- got the cfp and read it; found it hard to decide what to do, but eventually wrote an abstract focused on vectorisation. I'm hoping that I can develop just one simple argument about the cleaning, disciplining, and training of participative spaces as vectors and matrixes of transformation. 
- had the idea that I might start from the GPU -- see the abstract notes for various ideas about vector graphics and graphic collectives, or vector collectives.
- sending title and abstract to konstanz
- could also bring in some stuff from 'deep' and 'kittydar' pieces -- they might help ...

- wrote some notes in green notebook
- ideas about the relation to images:
    - remember that alphago only sees images. It doesn't see games. That means that the history of millions of plays has been seen in terms of a matrix of dots
    - the field of machine learning is littered with variations of the feature term -- could look at 'feature' more generally. How does it fit? Where does it come from in the ml? Did it get there from the pattern or image recognition literature, and if so, so what?
    - been playing quite a bit with Theano and Torch -- what do we learn by doing that? What is avoided by doing that?
