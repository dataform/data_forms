# Technocollective paper

- got the cfp and read it; found it hard to decide what to do, but eventually wrote an abstract focused on vectorisation. I'm hoping that I can develop just one simple argument about the cleaning, disciplining, and training of participative spaces as vectors and matrixes of transformation. 
- had the idea that I might start from the GPU -- see the abstract notes for various ideas about vector graphics and graphic collectives, or vector collectives.
- sending title and abstract to konstanz
- could also bring in some stuff from 'deep' and 'kittydar' pieces -- they might help ...
