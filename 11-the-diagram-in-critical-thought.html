<h1><span class="header-section-number">11</span> The diagram in critical thought</h1>
<p>As an experiment in the practice of critical thought amidst the accumulations of data, settings and devices, this book attempts to  the data practices of machine learning in respect to knowledge production. Despite their many operational deployments, the coming together of algorithm, calculation and technique in machine learning is not fully coherent or complete. In order to qualify or specify how machine learners exist in their generality, we would need to specify their operations at a level of abstraction that neither attributes a mathematical or algorithmic essence to them nor frames them as means of production of relative surplus value. Finding ways of accommodating their diversity, loose couplings and mutability would mean grasping their operational power and their potential to create new forms of difference.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Diagrams – a form of drawing that smooths away many frictions and variations –  practically abstract. (Gilles Deleuze, in his account of Michel Foucault’s philosophy presents diagrams as centres of power-knowledge: ‘What is a diagram? It is a display of the relations between forces which constitute power in the above conditions … the diagram or abstract machine is the map of relations between forces, a map of destiny, or intensity’ <span class="citation">[@Deleuze_1988, 36]</span>). Diagrams retain a connection to forms of doing, such as ‘learning from experience,’ that idea-centric accounts of abstraction sometimes struggle with. Perceptually and operationally, they span and indeed criss-cross between human and machine machine learners. As we will see, they form an axis of human-machine relations in machine learning, and a significant site of invention and emergence. They accommodate compositional substitutions, variations and superimpositions, as well as a play or movement amongst their often heterogeneous elements. Occasionally, perhaps rarely (Foucault as we will see characterises statements by their rarity amidst accumulation), by virtue of its composition, diagrams bring something new into the world.</p>
<p>Both the commonality and specificity (indeed the specific commonality) of machine learners would be hard to grasp without being able to trace their diagrammatic composition. Similarly, in order to understand the operational formation  associated with machine learning, the connections between data structures, infrastructures, processors, databases and lives need to be mapped. One path to follow in doing this - certainly not the one for everyone – is to inhabit and recognise oneself as a machine learner by occupying associated subject positions (the programmer or software developer, the statistics or computer science student, the modeller, the researcher, the data scientist, etc.) In moving between some of these subject positions, the densely operational indexes of mathematical formalisms begin to unravel.</p>
<p>Diagrams can be drawn in multiple ways, using various materials and inscriptive practices. Perhaps naively interpellated by the claim of machine learning to know differently, I use code and software implementations, graphical plots and mathematical expressions absorbed or copied from textbooks, blogs, online videos and the heavy accumulation of scientific publications from many disciplines (for instance, as seen in figure ), together with the theoretical resources of a media-focused  of knowledge and a science studies-informed ethnographic sensibility towards always situated and configured infrastructural and calculative practices.</p>
<p>From my own learning to machine learn,  I draw six major machine learning operations diagrammatically: vectorisation, optimisation, probabilisation, pattern recognition, regularization and propagation. These generic operations intersect in a diagram of machine learning spanning hardware and software architectures, organizations of data and datasets, practices of designing and testing models, intersections between scientific and engineering disciplines, and professional and popular pedagogies. With varying degrees of formalization and consistency, these operations might also occasion or provoke some creative, resistive or re-distributive moves for critical thought in relation to differences, materiality, experience, agency or power.  They are the topics of chapters -. A summary of the operations can also be found near the beginning of the concluding chapter.</p>
<p>My somewhat risky a-critical immersion in technical practice seeks to support an alternative account of machine learning, an account in which some feeling of agency movement can take root. Mundane technical practices, sometimes at a quite low level (for instance, vectorisation) and other times at a high level of formalization (for instance, in discussing mathematical functions) are elements to be drawn – sometimes literally, sometimes operationally – on a diagram. The  of the operational formation of machine learning does not unearth the footprint of a strategic monolith, but highlights the local relations of force that feed into the generalization and plurality of the field in both its monumental accumulations and peripheral variations.</p>

<p>Machine learning is not magic; it cannot get something from nothing. What it does is get more from less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work: we have to build everything from scratch. Learning is more like farming, which lets nature do most of the work. Farmers combine seeds with nutrients to grow crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to grow programs. <span class="citation">[@Domingos_2012, 81]</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The tools or material machines have to be chosen first of all by a diagram <span class="citation">[@Deleuze_1988,39]</span>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘learning’ in machine learning embodies a change in programming practice or indeed the programmability of machines. Our sense of the potentials of machine learning can be understood, according to Pedro Domingos, in terms of a contrast between programming as ‘a lot of [building] work’ and the ‘farming’ done by machine learners to ‘grow programs.’ In characterising machine learning, the tensions between the programming ‘we’ (programmers, computer scientists?) do and the programming that learners do (‘growing’) are worth pursuing.  While Domingos suggests that machine learners ‘get more from less,’ I will propose that an immense constellation of documents, software, publications, blog pages, books, spreadsheets, databases, data centre architectures, whiteboard and blackboard drawings, and an inordinate amount of talk and visual media orbit around machine learning.  There has been lively growth in machine learning, but this liveliness and the sometimes life-like growth of machine learners are a regional expression of a distributed formation. ‘Wherever there is a region of nature,’ the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead writes ‘which is itself the primary field of the expressions issuing from each of its parts, that region is alive’ <span class="citation">[@Whitehead_1956, 31]</span>. </p>
<p>In this chapter I attend to the problem of identifying and describing the distributed practices that give rise to a sense of machine learners framed as growth, or liveliness. I will argue these practices can only be traced partially through code written in generic or specialized programming languages such as <code>Python</code> and <code>R</code>, in libraries of machine learning code such as <code>R</code>’s <code>caret</code>  or <code>Python</code>’s <code>scikit-learn</code>  or <code>TensorFlow</code>  to do machine learning. Code obscures and reveals multiple transformations at work in the operational formation. Science studies scholars such as Anne-Marie Mol have urged the need to keep practice together with theories of what exists. Mol writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is not removed from the practices that sustain it, reality is multiple. This may be read as a description that beautifully fits the facts. But attending to the multiplicity of reality is also an act. It is something that may be done – or left undone <span class="citation">[@Mol_2003, 6]</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mol advocates thinking reality as multiplicity. Her insistence on the nexus of practice or doing and the plural existence of things suggests a way of handling the code that machine learners produce.  Code should be approached multiplicity. In the case of machine learners, this means following through pedagogical expositions of machine learning focused on both mathematical derivations and the accumulation of scientific or technical research publications, ranging from textbooks to research articles, that vary, explore, experiment and implement machine learners in code. The effect of liveliness or growth issues from many parts. In relation to machine learning, reading and writing code alongside scientific papers, Youtube lectures, machine learning books and competitions is not only a form of observant participation, but directly forms part of the diagrammatic multiplicity.</p>
<p>While machine learning utterly depends on code, I will suggest therefore that no matter how expressive or well-documented it may be, code alone cannot fully  how machine learners make programs or how they combine knowledge with data. Domingos writes that ‘learning algorithms … are algorithms that make other algorithms. With machine learning, computers write their own programs, so we don’t have to’ <span class="citation">[@Domingos_2015a, 6]</span>. Yet the writing performed by machine learners cannot be read textually or procedurally as other programs might be read for instance in work known as critical code studies. The difference between the reading of an Atari computer game console in Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost’s <em>Racing the Beam</em> <span class="citation">[@Montfort_2009]</span> and the machine learning of Atari’s games undertaken by DeepMind in London during recent years <span class="citation">[@Mnih_2013; @Mnih_2015]</span> is hard to read from program code.  The learning or making by learning is far from homogeneous, stable or automatic in practice. Materially, code is only one element in the diagram of machine learning. It displays, with greater or lesser degrees of visibility relations between a variety of forces (infrastructures, scientific knowledges, mathematical formalisations, etc.). It itself is aligned by and exposes other institutional, infrastructural, epistemic and economic positions. </p>
<p>Coding practices and the pedagogical expositions of machine learning have shifted substantially over the last decade or so due to the growth in open source programming languages and as a part of the broader and well-known expansion of digital media cultures. The fact that data scientists, software developers and other machine learners across scientific and commercial settings use programming languages such as <code>Python</code> and <code>R</code>   more than specialized commercial statistical and data software packages such as <code>Matlab</code>, <code>SAS</code> or <code>SPSS</code> <span class="citation">[@Muenchen_2014]</span> is perhaps symptomatic of shifts in computational culture. Coding cultures are crucial to the recent growth of machine learning. Although scientific computing languages such as <code>FORTRAN</code> – ‘Formula Translator’ – have long underpinned scientific research and engineering applications in various fields <span class="citation">[@Campbell-Kelly_2003, 34-35]</span>, the development in recent decades of data-analytic and statistical programming languages and coding frameworks has crystallized a repertoire of standard operations, patterns and functions for reshaping data and constructing models that classify and predict events and associations between things, people, processes, etc. This development continues apace, especially in research and engineering driven by social media and internet platforms such as Facebook and Google. While Domingos speaks of ‘growing’ programs, the accumulating sediment of certain well-established data practices are the soil in which programs take root. The different elements of coding practice are precisely the faceted levels of abstraction which we need to access and traverse in order to know and come to grips empirically with contemporary compositions of power and knowledge in machine learning. </p>

<li id="fn6"><p>Certain strands of social and cultural theory have taken a strong interest in algorithmic processes as operational forms of power. For instance, the sociologist Scott Lash distinguishes the operational rules found in algorithms from the regulative and constitutive rules studied by many social scientists:</p><blockquote><p>in a society of pervasive media and ubiquitous coding, at stake is a third type of rule, algorithmic, generative rules. ‘Generative’ rules are, as it were, virtuals that generate a whole variety of actuals. They are compressed and hidden and we do not encounter them in the way that we encounter constitutive and regulative rules. Yet this third type of generative rules is more and more pervasive in our social and cultural life of the post-hegemonic order. They do not merely open up opportunity for invention, however. They are also pathways through which capitalist power works, in, for example, biotechnology companies and software giants more generally <span class="citation">[@Lash_2007a, 71]</span>.  </p></blockquote><p>The term ‘generative’ is somewhat resonant in the field of machine learning as generative models, models that treat modelling as a problem of specifying the operations or dynamics that could have given rise to the observed data, are extremely important. <a href="11-the-diagram-in-critical-thought.html#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
