1
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,660
yet

2
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,269
can the pioneering machine learning in
neural nets

3
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,690
or zip pictures and think that's good

4
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,649
a okay

5
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,659
so I gave a talk here a couple years ago
and the first

6
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,710
10 minutes was there will be an overview
what I said there

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:52,710
and then I'll talk about the new stuff
um the new staff consists of a better

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,870
learning module

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,479
I'll show you learns better also
different things like

10
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,070
arm learning how images transform
learning how people walk

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,000
and learning object recognition so the
basic learning module

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,740
consists of some variables represent
things like pixels

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,619
need to be binary variables when I'm
some variables represent

14
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,790
these a latent variables they're also
gonna be binary and there's a bipartite

15
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,670
connectivity

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,630
so these guys and connect to each other
and that makes it very easy

17
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,409
if I give you the states that the
physical variables to further states

18
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:28,880
that the

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,100
in variables they're all independent
governor visible variables

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,570
it's not directed graph and the
inference procedure says

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,530
the probability of turning on him unit
HJ I'm given this visible back to be

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,770
is the logistic function at the total in
but it gets from his brilliance

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,110
so very simple to infer that Merkel's
I'm giving hidden variables we can also

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,820
in for the visible variables were simply

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,049
and if you want to if we put some weight
on the connections

26
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,610
we want to know what this model believes
we can just go backwards and forwards

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,310
inferring all hidden variables in Parel

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,799
that all these ones that for a long time
and then you'll see examples are the

29
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,150
kinds of things I'd like to believe

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,830
may move money is going to be to get
into like to believe the kinds of things

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,230
that actually happened so this thing is
governed by an energy function

32
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,720
but idk in the weights on the
connections the energy of a visible

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,620
person back to

34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,420
is the sum over all connections all

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,849
the wait if both visible and
immunoreactive

36
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,069
so to pick some of these attractive you
out in the weight

37
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,909
and it is a big positive way to slow in
a few is good so happy network

38
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,310
this has nice to repeat itself
differently respect to the weight you

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,980
get this product to the visible

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,739
in activity and so that route is gonna
show up a lot in the learning

41
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,489
cuz that derivative is how you change
the energy at the Combine configuration

42
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:45,959
visible

43
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,430
mutants the probability of a

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,209
combine configuration given the energy
function is he to the minus the energy

45
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:56,799
that among

46
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,469
aggression normalized by partition
function and if you're into the property

47
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:01,930
for particular visible Victor

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,870
after some overall the hidden factors
that might go with it and

49
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,719
that's the problem visible to if you
want to change the weights to make this

50
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,829
probability higher

51
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,099
you always need to lower the energies of
combinations invisible vector

52
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,790
and the hidden back to the would like
with it and raise the images all other

53
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,609
combinations

54
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:26,609
see decrease competition the correct
Maxim like good learning rule

55
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,639
that is if I want to change the way so
as to

56
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,019
I'm increase the low probability this
network would generate the back to the

57
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,639
when I let it just sort of fantasize
things like to believe in is a nice

58
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,549
simple form

59
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,870
it's just the difference in two
correlations so even though it depends

60
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,760
on all the other way

61
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,189
its it shows up as this difference the
correlations and

62
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,279
what you do is you take your data you
activate

63
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,839
units this to cast by units you can
reconstruct

64
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,499
because I expect that this is a Markov
chain you want for a long time to you've

65
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,439
got me started

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,389
and then you measure the correlation
that with the correlation here

67
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,129
what you really doing is saying by
changed to a simple push into that

68
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm lowering the energy this visible
backed

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,220
with whatever hidden victory chose by
doing the opposite

70
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,060
here I'm raising the energy things I
fantasize

71
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,370
and so what I'm trying to do is believe
in the data not believe in what model

72
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,940
believes it

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,660
eventually this correlation with the
same as that one in which case nothing

74
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,110
on

75
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,530
because I believe in the data it turns
out you can

76
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,680
get a much quicker learning algorithm we
just gone done it again

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
you take this difference correlations
them

78
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,590
justifying that is hard the main
justification is it works

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:55,590
um and it's quick the reason these
modules interesting

80
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,990
the main reason interesting is you can
stack them up studies

81
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,140
the company injuries are not gonna go
into it works very well

82
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,810
to training module then take the
activities are the features actors

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,450
treat them so they were data and train
another module on top of that

84
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,230
so the first module is trying to model
what's going on in the pixels by using

85
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,670
the speech in sectors

86
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,860
and the checks written to be highly
correlated the second model is trying to

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,700
model correlations among peach victims
and you can guarantee that if you do

88
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,920
that right

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,720
every time we gotta love legal battle
with the data actually can guarantee

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
that the first time you got level

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
for the level where you can guarantee is
that there's a band on how good you

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,620
might love the data is

93
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,040
every time you add another level that
band improves

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,440
if you got it right having got this
guarantee that something good is

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,330
happening is we have more levels

96
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,960
with them violate all conditions that
mathematics and just add more levels and

97
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,130
so that ok way

98
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,060
has been a good things can happen and
then we justified by the fact that good

99
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,080
things do happen

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,230
this elisa's to learn many lies a
feature detectors entirely unsupervised

101
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,270
just a model structure in the data once
we done

102
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,070
you can get that except in machine
learning conference because you have to

103
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,760
discrimination to be accepted notion

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,900
conference so once you've done that you
add

105
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,160
some decision units to the top and you
learn the connections

106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,460
discriminative Lee between the top their
features in the decision units

107
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,370
and then if you want you can go back and
find June all the connections using

108
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,190
backpropagation

109
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,620
that overcomes the limits a
back-propagation which is

110
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,220
there's not much information labeling it
can only learn on labeled data

111
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,540
these things come on on large amounts of
unlabeled data

112
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,780
after they've learned then you add these
units at the top

113
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,070
and back propagate from a small amount
labeled data

114
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,280
and that's not designing the features
actors anymore

115
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,730
as you probably know Google design
feature detectors is the art of things

116
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,590
and you'd like to design features actors
based on what's in the data

117
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,430
not based on having to produce labeled
data so the idea back propagation was

118
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,470
designed your piece that is so you could
be getting the right answer

119
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,260
the ID case design your features actors
to be good at Motley whatever's going on

120
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,690
in the data

121
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,230
once you've done that just ever so
slightly fine-tune them so you better

122
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,290
getting right answer

123
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:21,020
but don't run use the answer to design
feature detectors

124
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,440
and you're sure binges lap is done lots
a work showing that

125
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,470
this gives you better minimizing Justin
backpropagation

126
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,250
and what's more min completely different
part of the space

127
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,050
so just to summarize this section

128
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,500
I think this is the most important slide
in the talk because it says what's wrong

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,360
with Neil machine learning

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,180
up to a few years ago what people in
machine learning we're trying to do is

131
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
learn a mapping from an image to label

132
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,690
and I will be a fun thing to do if you
thought that images in labels arose in

133
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,040
the following way:

134
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,300
the stuff in it gives rise to images and
then the images give rise to the labels

135
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,400
given the image the labels don't depend
on stuff

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,060
but you don't really believe that you
believe that if the label something like

137
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,740
the parity if the pixels in the image

138
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,880
where you really believe is the stuff
that gives rise to images

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,120
and then the labels ago with images
because the stuff not because the image

140
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,220
so the cow in a field in use a cuddle
now if I just say County you

141
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,900
you don't know whether the cows brown or
black co upright or dead

142
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,820
or far away if I share your images the
care you know listings

143
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,320
so this is a very high bandwidth this a
very low bandwidth

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,529
and the right way to associate labels
with images is to first learn to invert

145
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,990
this high bandwidth path

146
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,649
we can't really do that cuz the gym
workspace the first or you look at than

147
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,690
you see things

148
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,519
and it's not like it might be kinda
might be an elephant it might be a

149
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,850
lecture theatre

150
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,550
basin you get it right knee all the time
and so we can but that pathway

151
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,490
having learned to do that we can learn
what things are cold

152
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,639
but you get the concept work am NOT from
the name

153
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,970
from seeing what's going on in the world
and that's what we're doing

154
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,050
men later say setting the label

155
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,240
now I need to do one slight modification
to the basic module

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,999
which is I had binary units as the
observables

157
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,660
now we want to have living units with
casino is

158
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,699
so we just change the energy function a
bit and the energy now says

159
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,949
I gotta kinda parabolic containment here
each of these linear visible units

160
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,509
has a bias which is like his mean we
would like to see here

161
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,800
moving away from that costs in an issue
problem is the negative local guys in

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,459
costs it and then the input the comes
from the hidden units

163
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,499
this is just me I H JW I J

164
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:48,949
but these have to be scaled by the
standard deviation at the

165
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:52,009
guessing that

166
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,110
the if I ask if a different route that
with respect to visible activity

167
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,170
them when I get is HJ Wijk divided by
the Sigma right

168
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,870
and that's like an engine gradient and
what the visible unit does when you

169
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,240
reconstruct

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,050
is it tries to compromise between
wanting to sit around here

171
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,309
and wanting to satisfy this energy
gradient say goes to the place where

172
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,399
these two great in single opposite

173
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,470
and you have that's the most likely
value and then you have guys in my

174
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,059
judgment

175
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:23,079
so without small modification we can I
deal with

176
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,910
real money data with binary latent
variables and we have an official

177
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,300
money out ridden its approximation
acting like it

178
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,529
so we can apply to some

179
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,899
so is a nice speech recognition task has
been well organized by the speech people

180
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,100
where there's no data base coat imminent

181
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,369
it's all very well to find casper phone
recognition

182
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:48,050
wear what you have to do is your
commercial window speech

183
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,720
you have to predict the distribution the
probability

184
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,069
for the central frame the various
different phones

185
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,420
actually each frame is modeled by three
statesmen so the

186
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,259
beginning middle and end so you have to
predict retrain

187
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,019
is its is at the beginning middle align
the beach the possible fines

188
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,730
the 193 those things if you give it

189
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,379
a good distribution so focused on the
right thing

190
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,119
that all post-processing will give you
back

191
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,660
where the phone in Bangor should be and
what your phone are a tease

192
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,959
not so very standard some people use try
from models

193
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,529
um where you can buy for models which
isn't quite as powerful

194
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,199
um so now we can test how good we are

195
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,019
a taking 11 Princess Peach is 10
milliseconds per frame but he trains

196
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,369
looking like 25 min second speech

197
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:42,009
and predicting the phone at the middle
frame

198
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,889
we use the standard speech
representation which is Mel capsule

199
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:45,959
coefficients

200
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,920
the 13th those in their differences and
differences differences

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,300
and we feed 'em into one of these deep
thats

202
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,129
so his your input 11 frame 239

203
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,509
coefficients and then I was away when
the student this

204
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,619
and he actually believed what I said so
he thought adding lots and lots been

205
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,610
less was a good idea

206
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,129
I'm stopped to but yet it also mean less

207
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,189
all unsupervised so all these green
connections

208
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:18,300
learned without any use for the labels

209
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,449
he used to bottle like bear so the
number red connections will be

210
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,610
relatively small

211
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,949
these are not these have to be learned
using discriminative information

212
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,160
um and now you back probably get the
correct answers through this home at

213
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,980
for by today on a GP you bored um

214
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,569
or a month comical and

215
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,529
it does very well studies the best phone
rato was

216
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,149
23 percent but the important thing is
whatever configuration used how many

217
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,689
could mess as long as you're plenty

218
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,759
whatever width whether uses pot like a
not he gets between 23 and 24 percent

219
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,279
says very robust to the exact details
I'm any less

220
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,759
I want their the best previous result
intimate

221
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,709
for things that didn't you speaker
adaptation with 20 4.4 percent

222
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,319
not with averaging to get a lot two
models so

223
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:15,300
this is good

224
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,429
with yep common ailments um

225
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,439
so we only training 123

226
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:25,949
one to 3 we training in about 20 million
mites

227
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,959
$20 million weights is about

228
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,860
I'm 2 percent to the cubic millimeter
cortex

229
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,939
them so this is a tiny brain that's
probably all you need to bring

230
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,379
recognition

231
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,389
is are differences in double differences

232
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,929
vehemence season good

233
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,970
that's a very good question could just
again at the end extremely good question

234
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,819
because

235
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,800
the recently put the differences in
double differences so they can model a

236
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,990
date with a diagonal covariance

237
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,399
Matri we are trying to convince model
pic a new car model fact that

238
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,050
overtime two things tend to be very much
the same

239
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,660
without modern conveniences unless you
actually put the differences in through

240
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,569
the day turn you what are the
differences directly

241
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:16,160
so allows you to use a model the Concord
because they're insists

242
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,389
later on we gonna show you model it can
cope with ovarian cysts

243
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,249
and then we gonna do declines with age
if you do

244
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:26,369
which is throw away the mockups
representation news about a workstation

245
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:28,339
speech

246
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:34,959
yeah he said that's me that something is

247
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,720
i cant so the new idea is to use a
better kinda module

248
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
this majority works pretty well right
you know it does well opinion

249
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,240
recognition it does well with other
things

250
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,529
econ mode multiplicative interaction is
very well

251
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,000
it can model anything I'm with enough
training data

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,930
but is not happy modding multiplies
multiplies all over the place

253
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,769
um I'll show you a bunch place where you
build

254
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,920
mice he's the sort of Maine example why
you need multiplies

255
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,019
suppose I want to from a high level
description of an object

256
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,389
the name that the shape and these poses

257
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,069
size position orientation special on a
generator parts an object

258
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:24,649
I want to be related correctly to each
other I could use very accurate talk

259
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,480
time model

260
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,769
the says knowing square nannies place
prime I generate

261
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,420
each piece in exactly the right position
I'm require high bandwidth

262
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,970
or I could be sloppy and I could say I'm
gonna generate decide

263
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,240
not answer is a representation the
distribution where the site might be

264
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,519
on generate corners and other sites and
their own a bit sloppy

265
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,420
if I picked one thing from each
distribution it would make a nice quite

266
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,329
but I could also top-down specify how
these things should be pieced together

267
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,600
in fact I can specify Markov Random
Field

268
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,160
says what goes with what and then I can
clean this up

269
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,680
knowing these distributions and pick a
square like that

270
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,000
because I might sometimes because where
there's a slightly different orientation

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,639
were slightly different size but it'll
be a nice clean square because I know

272
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,730
how I think go together

273
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,970
so that's a much more powerful kinda
general model

274
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,149
and that's what we want to learn to do
and so we can meet

275
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:22,420
hidden units appear to specify
interactions between visible units here

276
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,189
as opposed to just specifying input to
this Williams

277
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:30,199
there's an analogy for this which is

278
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,529
if I'm in office and there's a bunch of
soldiers and I want to stand in the

279
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,199
square

280
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,380
I could get my GPS mike is a soldier
number

281
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,149
one stand these GPS coordinates and so
do number two standard these GPS

282
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:42,899
coordinates

283
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,939
nothing is enough digits are getting
nice neat rectangle

284
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,980
work as a soldier number one stand
refuge here

285
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,699
and then soldier number two whole drama

286
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:57,059
out the stand this distance from Saudi
number one and that's a much better way

287
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,290
to get in the rectangle

288
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,939
will cost far less communication so what
you doing is you're downloading

289
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,059
roughly where people should stand and
then how they should relate to each

290
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:05,480
other

291
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,819
we have to specify the relations not
just where they should be

292
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,709
that's what we'd like in a powerful her
rocker generative model

293
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,540
so

294
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,240
we're going to aim to get units in one
layer

295
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,089
to say how units in the lab low should
laterally interact

296
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,090
when you're generating its gonna tonight
you don't need to worry about those with

297
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,010
her classroom track is when you
recognize me when you're generating you

298
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,309
do

299
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,700
um to do that we're going to need things
cool third audibles machines

300
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:45,940
with a three-way interactions so teri
Sinofsky point act

301
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,400
a long time ago that we have an energy
function like this

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,440
but this was the in this was a these
just buying

303
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,340
wheels and we could probably write an
injunction like this where three things

304
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,970
on track to have a 308

305
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,880
and if you think about the three things
now hey

306
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,000
stated k is acting like a switch when K
is on

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,030
effectively have this weight between I&J
when case of

308
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,740
is what disappears and it happens

309
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,559
every which way because this metric so
using an energy function like this

310
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,120
we can allow one thing to specify had
two other things should interact

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,700
so each in Munich is best for home
Markov random field over the pixels if

312
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,190
you want

313
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,929
that so begins to make you worry cuz my
girlfriend appeared as we're proud

314
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:30,700
president

315
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,899
and if you start counting indices here
if you have

316
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:37,070
end of the season and have those known
to those you get NQ

317
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:43,799
to these parameters which is rather lot
if you were willing to using key

318
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,240
parameters you can I make networks and
look like this

319
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,600
Spurs I have two images I want to model
how images transform overtime

320
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,320
and let's suppose I'm just moving random
dots around

321
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,659
have a pan around dots not translate
well

322
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,010
if I see that dog and I see that that
some evidence for a particular

323
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,140
translation

324
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,280
suffered a big positive way there

325
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,030
this triangle interruption that big
three way then when this

326
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,270
this the wrong they'll say it's very
good to have this Kyle

327
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,740
up in Iceland state if I also see this
paradox

328
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,520
I'll get more votes that this guy should
be on I'll turn this Kyle

329
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,620
if however this picture went to hear
about this guy and if this picture also

330
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,470
into the habit

331
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,610
this guy so these guys gonna represent
coherent translations of the image

332
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,880
and it can be able to use the three-way
to take two images

333
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,679
and extracting units represent the
coherent translation

334
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,320
it also be able to take the pre image in
the translation

335
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,130
and computer which pic so should be on
here

336
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,919
now we gonna do is take that basic model
I'm gonna fact right it

337
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,230
gonna say I got the three weights I got
too many of them

338
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,100
signing in to represent each three-way
as the product 23

339
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,010
to wait things I can infuse these
factors

340
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,070
each factor is gonna have these

341
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,940
these this many parameters which is just

342
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,679
um per factor it's just a linear number
parameters

343
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,120
if I'm about n factors I end up with any
and squared is these prime

344
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,790
these weights and if you think about how
pixels transforming an image

345
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,059
they don't do random permutations it's
not this because then that would cause

346
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,620
him

347
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,000
pixels do so the consistent things so I
don't really need and key parameters

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,020
cuz I'm just trying to model is fully
consistent transformations

349
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,790
which is limited number I should be able
to in many less printers

350
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,990
and this is a way to do so

351
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,990
that's going to be a new energy function
you can't buy stamps

352
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,100
one way of thinking about how in morning
wat is I want these

353
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,140
this tensor three-way weights if I taken
out a product due to factors like this

354
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,310
I'll get a matrix that has rank 1 figure
3 lacked a product

355
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,910
or get a 10 so that has run and if I now

356
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,300
add up a bunch of Kansas like that so
each factor in

357
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,100
which path specifies a ring on tensor by
coming up a bunch of them

358
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,530
I cannot let me tensile I if I use and
squared factors

359
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,600
phasing me n factors I can model nice
regular tense this but i ka model

360
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,600
obviously permutations that's what we
want if you are so how does imprints

361
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,760
work now

362
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,510
inference is still very simple in this
model so here's a factor

363
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,360
his the weights connecting it to say the
pre image

364
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,070
his the ways connecting it to the post
image is the weights connecting it to

365
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,010
the head units

366
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,060
and to do inference what I do is this

367
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,660
was only have that one factor I would

368
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,330
multiply the pixels by these weights um

369
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,400
at all add up so I get a summit this
vertex

370
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,590
I do the same here I get a summit this
vertex and I multiply these two sons

371
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,370
together to get a message trying to send
to the hidden units

372
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,360
and has that message goes to the hidden
unit I multiplied by the way to my

373
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,940
connection

374
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,940
so what the hidden unit will see is this
weight

375
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,010
times the product these two sons and not

376
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,400
is the derivative the energy with
respect to the state that this would

377
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,430
which is what he's no to decide whether
to be on or off he wants to go into what

378
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,650
are the state will love the image

379
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,020
and all the hidden units remain
independent even I got these multiplies

380
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,650
so this is much better than putting in
another state casting binary unit

381
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,290
if I produced gas turbine unit in fear
the hidden units will cease to be

382
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,980
independent in prince who get tough

383
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,830
but this way with the deterministic
factor that's taking a problem these two

384
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,430
sons

385
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,620
inference remains easy the learning also
remains easy

386
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,200
so this is the message that goes for
factor

387
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,280
to him unit H and that message is the
product that we got it is to know that

388
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,880
is

389
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,050
problems the computer on the pre-match
in the post image

390
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,450
and the way you learn the

391
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,850
wat on the connection from fact after
Muniz H

392
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,730
is by changing the way so as to lower
the energy

393
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,420
when you're looking at data and raise
the energy when you're constructing

394
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,170
model we're just reconstructing things
from the community got

395
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,720
date and those energy drink it just
looked like this they just the product

396
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,270
of the state Supreme unit

397
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,450
and the message goes to it when you're
looking at data

398
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,830
and stated that in unison message goes
to when you're looking at samples from

399
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,370
the model

400
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,710
reconstructions so still nice pairwise
learning

401
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,870
so everything is paralyzed still um

402
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,250
so you might they didn't bring

403
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:57,250
now if we look at what one of these
factors does when I show random dopant

404
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,550
to translate

405
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,310
then we can look at the weights
connected to the free image

406
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,750
and that's a patent weights wear white
is a big positive way

407
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,320
blacksburg make the point that would
have learned a great in connecting it to

408
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,070
the pre-match

409
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,730
Mistral integrating correct to post
image with a hundred fact is I show you

410
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,930
what role England

411
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,460
so those two hundred factors

412
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,380
connecting um these are the receptive
fields

413
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,100
factors in the pre-match remembers
looking at translating dots

414
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,040
and these are the factors in the post
image

415
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,070
NEC's basin and the free basis in its
land to translate things by about 90

416
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,670
degrees

417
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,270
and that's a very good way of handling
translation mathematician say things

418
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,840
like

419
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,240
the free basis is natural bases for
modeling translation I don't really know

420
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
what that means but

421
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,510
this land the free basis I'm on if your
attentions and learn a different basis

422
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,530
so this a basic lands rotations

423
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,850
she learns about you when yang

424
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,530
I'm apps which

425
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,910
a spaces for tations

426
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,890
arm one other thing you could do is

427
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,300
train it just on single don't plan to
the translating the case your way

428
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,010
and then tested it on

429
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,920
two overlaid dot patterns the
translating different directions

430
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,750
is never seen that before its only been
trained incoherent mation

431
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,160
we're gonna tested on Transpo school
transformation

432
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,740
in order to see what it thinks

433
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,300
room wit rainy unsupervised is no labels
anyway we never tell about the motions

434
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,970
on

435
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,040
we need somewhere seeing what is
thinking so we had a second hidden layer

436
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,110
the looks at the hidden units for
planning transformations

437
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,710
and it's fairly sparse so the unisom a
second inlet

438
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,790
will be choosing to particular actions
have motion

439
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,150
meant to see what is thinking we take
the

440
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,390
directions as units like weighted by how
acted as units no

441
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,540
and I'll tell you what direction it
thinks it see now when you show it

442
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,580
transformation when you look at those
units in the second hidden

443
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,070
if the two missions within about 30
degrees it sees a single motion at the

444
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,570
average direction

445
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,060
if they be on but they should be sissies
to deformations and what's more they

446
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,810
rappelled from each other

447
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:31,810
that's exactly what happens with people
so this is exactly how the brain works

448
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,360
I'm there's gonna be a lot I kinda
reasoning in this talk

449
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,070
I'm going on two time series models now
so we'd like to you

450
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,400
model not just static images for example
like a modern video

451
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,280
to be in with gonna try something a bit
simpler arm

452
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,570
when people do time series models you
would

453
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,900
nearly always like to have a distributed
nonlinear representation

454
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,180
but that's hard to learn so people tend
to do

455
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,950
dumb things like hidden Markov models
all in and Customs

456
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,440
which either give up on the distributed
or on the

457
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,890
nonlinear but a easy to do imprints

458
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,850
what we gonna come up with is something
that has the district and the nonlinear

459
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,890
and is easy to do imprints but the
learning algorithm

460
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,080
isn't quite right but it's good enough
it's just an approximation commencement

461
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,390
and the inference also is ignoring the
future and just basing things on the

462
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,570
past

463
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,370
so here's a basic module missus just two
way

464
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,330
interactions this is the restricted both
machines visible units

465
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,750
hidden units here are the pre

466
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,660
um previous visible frames these are
going to be linear units

467
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,900
and so these blue connections
conditioning

468
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,910
the current visible values on previous
and that runs

469
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:01,260
in a linear way such cold water
aggressive model

470
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,990
the hidden units here gonna be binary
him units they also condition on the

471
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,630
pieces

472
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,590
frames and learn easy easy in this model

473
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,770
what you do is you take your observed
data

474
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,050
and then given the current visible frame
given the previous visible frames

475
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,160
you get into today units they're all
independent given the data

476
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,950
so you can separately decide what states
should be in

477
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,610
once you pick states for them you know I
reconstruct

478
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,800
the current frame using the input you're
getting from previous frames

479
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,090
using the top dining for you going from
the units after reconstructive knee then

480
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,100
activate the music and

481
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,220
you take the difference in the power
status sex with data here reconstruction

482
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,460
to run these weights and you take the
difference on leaked images these guys

483
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,290
we date with reconstructions to get a
signal that you can use to learn these

484
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:51,970
weights

485
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,640
these weights so it's Manning's
straightforwardness just depends on

486
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,200
differences and you can look more like
this

487
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,880
of you learned it

488
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,490
you can generate from the model

489
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,870
by taking some previous frames

490
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,100
these imports the condition imports in
effect

491
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,360
fix the biases these to depend on the
previous frame so is there a dynamic my

492
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,310
sis

493
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,740
and then with the spices fix just go
back and forth

494
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,270
for a while and then pick up right now
and that's you an extremely generated

495
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,270
Nikica so we can generate from online
says none so we can see what it believes

496
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,540
sorry 0 with going back no week going to
go back more certain time

497
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:49,540
I I just got lazy with the power

498
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,320
One Direction week ago from case to to
high-level models

499
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,610
that is having learned this model where
these venues all independent given the

500
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,110
date

501
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,230
we could say what I done as I turned
visible frames

502
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,429
in Dunedin friends and it turns out you
can get a better model if you take these

503
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,370
hidden frames

504
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,419
a model what's going on here and now you
put in conditioning connections between

505
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:12,380
frames

506
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,940
and more him units the data conditioning
the don't

507
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,899
interact with humans and you know this
model then you can prove that if you do

508
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:20,640
this right

509
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,350
then you get a better more to love the
original sequences

510
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,480
or your improve abound on the model of
the original sequence

511
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,179
signals a less like that when you have
more lies it generates better Ryan go in

512
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,250
a different direction

513
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,929
um

514
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,139
I'm she had with 3-way connections and
we can apply it to

515
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,760
motion capture data so you put
reflective markers on the joint check

516
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,590
got something for eight cameras you
figure out where the joints are in space

517
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,220
you know the shape the body say go back
through that figure the joint angles

518
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,679
and then the freemen base is going to
consist of 50 numbers

519
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,679
about 50 numbers which are joint angles
and

520
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,590
the translations and rotations at the
base of the spine okay so imagine we got

521
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,990
one is manikins you seen Hot Shot
Windows

522
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,120
European stock in the base responding
and we can move around

523
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,899
and rotate im using this pain and you
can also weaken his legs and arms

524
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,909
okay and what we wanted to do is ask me
move around we want to do with his legs

525
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:20,649
and arms

526
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:24,039
so is put a piece to be stationary on
the ground in the hope is to be walking

527
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,620
the better we loose like just right is
to translate his pelvis

528
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:34,620
otherwise is put will appear to skate on
the ground and we're gonna model him

529
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,120
we can do i hark a model I could show
you all we can do three or more like

530
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,600
this

531
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,260
where week additional six earlier frames
is occurring visible from his your basic

532
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,070
both machine

533
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,220
except that it's no wonder these three
way things were these are factors

534
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,100
and we have a 10 men style variable so
we have taken with tenet the style in

535
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,850
the training it

536
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:01,850
that's a semi-supervised arm it learns
to convert that one event representation

537
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,830
into a bunch rely you features

538
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,169
many uses real value features has won
the imposter factor

539
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:12,159
more the fact is really doing is saying
these real money features

540
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,520
are modulating the weight matrices the
use for conditioning

541
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,389
and also this weight matrix use in your
13 on your mobile

542
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:25,149
so these a modulating an autoregressive
model

543
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:29,380
that's very different from switching
between autoregressive models is much

544
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,029
more powerful

545
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,940
yep so we gonna have dated someone
walking in various different styles

546
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,740
style style a book yeah said

547
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:48,260
the history would

548
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,470
yes said

549
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,010
yeah yeah the rights on the connections
will tell you which rims come from

550
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,190
right in the earlier model the two blue
lines

551
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:05,710
they differ matrices and their different
weights up

552
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,440
it just came to light right just yes

553
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,749
we another was as direct connections
from

554
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:18,039
all six previous frames to the company
for determining the country

555
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,000
me

556
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,360
well the were when you were computing
with the fifth Prime Minister

557
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,820
right but when we computing this spring
we have their connections okay

558
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,360
so we now gonna trying this model it's
relatively easy to train especially in

559
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,190
GP board

560
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,990
and then we can to generate from it so
we can see so but learned

561
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,700
and we can judge if it's doing well by
weather think sleep on the ground

562
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:52,700
me

563
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:14,419
I online

564
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,750
we'll get there I'm 3

565
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,129
he is a normal walk maybe

566
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,980
mister winning okay

567
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,780
says generated from the Motley deciding
which direction to turn in

568
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,940
means deciding um you know

569
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,970
heat needs to make yes i'd like you the
inside like and so on

570
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,159
um if we've

571
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,409
we have one model but if we flipped the
style label

572
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,639
to say um gangly teenager

573
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,230
he definitely looks

574
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,369
awkward right we will be in there some

575
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,070
I think this is a computer science
student

576
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,450
my main reason for thinking that is if
you ask into graceful

577
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,490
looks like this

578
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,280
and that's definitely see through peer I

579
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,150
good you

580
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,319
now now I think this was to not like to
be very good

581
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:25,859
I'm you can ask him to walk softly like
a cat we are asking the model a present

582
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,240
i'd

583
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,410
the model looks pretty much like the
real date to the real data obviously the

584
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,569
fee to plant it better

585
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:36,480
but notice he can slow down the speed up
again

586
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,490
water aggressive models can't do things
like that what are aggressive models

587
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,560
have a biggest I can value thus I think
bigger than one in which case explode

588
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,450
where it's more than one in which case
they died the way you came alive is by

589
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,500
keep you keep injecting random noise

590
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,990
so they stay alive and that's like
making a horse walk by taking a dead

591
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,950
horse and jiggling

592
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,050
its kinda is not good I'm

593
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,670
now

594
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,740
he doesn't have any model the physics so
in order to do these kinds stumbles I

595
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,730
had to be stumble similar to that in the
data

596
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,760
but when he stopped in which somebody
did when

597
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,329
is entirely determining um

598
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:21,780
we could make into a sexy won't be a
problem not interested in that

599
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,260
you want answered

600
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,510
chicken westerns with chicken

601
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,510
unless dinosaur and chicken

602
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:38,510
that's a blend

603
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:46,369
maybe switch his Google Earth puts get
this is probably a blend

604
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,509
this is doing sexy walk

605
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,339
and then you flip label to normal when
you flip it back to sexy it's never seen

606
00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:02,339
any transitions because oh one more
thing we can do with the transitions

607
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:14,420
there the couple those from

608
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,589
wanna be in style styles yep

609
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:21,990
yep now you can also give him any more
labels when you train

610
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,849
you give its speed stride length all
sorts of things then you can control it

611
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,300
very well

612
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,300
okay so we can on time series at least
for fifty dimensional data

613
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,730
and obviously won't want to do is apply
that to video but we have nothing

614
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:45,730
set for some very simple cases

615
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,710
the last thing on your show use the most
complicated use these three models

616
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,320
one way of thinking of it

617
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,370
so that's similar to the previous uses
is we take an image you make two copies

618
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,980
of it

619
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,380
but they have to be the same and then we
insist the weights the go from a factor

620
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,260
to this copy is the same as the weights
ago from the fact this disc

621
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:17,260
so I equals JW I feel because the region
inference is still easy

622
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,990
impact inference he will consist of you
take these pixels times these weights

623
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,330
to get a weighted sum and then you
square because this is going to be the

624
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,020
same way tits

625
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,880
temperance consistent take a linear
filter square its output

626
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,900
and send it by these works to hidden
units that's exactly the

627
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,620
model call the Arlington energy model
she is right and when the filter

628
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:47,010
since been proposed both by vision
people by Adelson Bergen a long time ago

629
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:52,440
in the eighties and by neuroscientists
senior scientist attract a simple cells

630
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,800
a quick thinking about and look at

631
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,110
what polynomial the iPod is that they're
important

632
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,850
and young than a berkeley says it's
between 1.7 2.3

633
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,030
and that means to right I'm

634
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:13,780
so this looks quite like model so will
propose drop quite different reasons and

635
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,260
he just dropped time to take a three-way
energy model in fact rising at

636
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,570
the advantage we have is that we have a
learning are going through these weights

637
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,030
now only have a general model

638
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:30,030
mom so now we can model covariances
between pixels

639
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,880
and the reason that's good is well is
one reason is good

640
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
I'm spose I ask you to define vertical
edge

641
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,700
most people say we love Escalade you
some this light on the side document

642
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,160
site

643
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,200
well not now maybe it's like i'm this
i'm not come outside being a

644
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,790
well could be lighter p.m. don't end
there in Dhaka P in like 10 American

645
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:57,140
or it could be a texture each scan code
might actually be disparity age

646
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,000
arm well managed to be motion this side
main mission that's a that's a little

647
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,640
edge to

648
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,270
I'm so vertical edges are big assortment
of things more all listings have in

649
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:06,930
common

650
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,260
is a vertical edge is something where
you shouldn't do horizontal

651
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,060
interpolation generally image

652
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,000
horizontal interpolation works very well
a pixel is the average if it's right

653
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,770
left neighbors

654
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,140
pretty accurately or sold occasionally
breaks down replacing brakes times with

655
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,070
the political edge

656
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,050
so a real abstract definition virtual
wage

657
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:31,440
is a breakdown of her simple
interpolation and that's what I models

658
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,850
are gonna do a heating unit

659
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,470
is going to be putting in a min
interpolation

660
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,480
and it's actually the town of Cicero
smudge ink

661
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,710
when that breaks down is gonna turn off
so one less thing it is this

662
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,120
if this hidden units here

663
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,930
is on it puts in a weight between pixel
I'm pics LJ

664
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,660
the sequel to arm this way

665
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,000
times this wait times its weight okay

666
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,280
since these okay combat I'm

667
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,560
so these controlling

668
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,640
effectively the mark from the field
between pixels so we can model converts

669
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,610
is nicely

670
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,880
because the hidden units are creating
correlations invisible units

671
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,130
reconstruction is now more difficult we
could reconstruct one image given the

672
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,780
other image that will be my shin

673
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,860
but if you want to reconstruct them both
make my den to call

674
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,310
gets to be harder so we have to use a
different method called hybrid want to

675
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,760
comment essentially you start with the
data was

676
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,260
and let it wander away from where it was
but keeping both images the same

677
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,750
I'm not gonna go in type 1 comment but
it works just fine for doing the right

678
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,050
thing

679
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,190
and the 101 colors used just to get the
reconstructions

680
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:54,980
the running out in just the same as
before and what we gonna do is we're

681
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,560
gonna have

682
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,240
some hidden units that by using the
three-way interactions to model prevents

683
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,270
it from pixels

684
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,000
another hidden in this is just one means
so we cool

685
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,140
for meaningful than siegel is macao p.m.
arm

686
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:13,750
he's an example of what happens after is
learned

687
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,540
on black and white images his image
punch

688
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,100
he's its reconstruction of the image
patch

689
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,160
if you don't had no is which is very
good from the

690
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,290
mean and covariance hidden units his
sister Cassie

691
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,680
reconstruction which is a pretty good
but now we can do something funny you

692
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,920
were gonna take the

693
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,000
activations are the covariance units the
things are modeling which pictures in

694
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,420
the same as which other pixels

695
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,300
and we'll keep those but we're gonna
take the expressions in the mean unit so

696
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,560
we threw those away

697
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,640
and pretend that the means for the
pixels look like this

698
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,060
let's take this one place we tell all
pixels have the same value said these

699
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,860
which my stock

700
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,740
and in nine tries to make that
information about means

701
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,530
30 me this information i covariances
which is that these guys should be the

702
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:00,980
same

703
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,540
very different from these guys and so it
comes up with the reconstruction looks

704
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,350
like that

705
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,980
where you see is taking this doctor from
blurted across this region

706
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,680
if we just keep it four dots like that

707
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,910
and the covariance matrices got from
there it'll blow those dots I'm

708
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,870
to make an image that looks quite like
that one so this is very light was cool

709
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,260
to

710
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,480
kinda watercolor model images where you
know but with a bang resign

711
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,030
in just a rough sketch in the colors are
the regions amid all it's fine to us

712
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,170
because we saw the slave the Kalibangan
is to the actual

713
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,880
where the ages of um if you reverse the
colors are these

714
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,350
produce the reverse image because the
covariance doesn't care at all about

715
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:46,510
signs that things if you look at the
filters

716
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,780
uelman's the mean units which offers a
recovery in regions

717
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,850
learn these blurry filters and by taking
some combination of a few dozen times

718
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:00,670
you can make more less whatever colors
you like anywhere very blurred their

719
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,940
smooth blurry and multicolored on

720
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,940
you can me roughly right colors the
covariance units nine something

721
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,850
completely different

722
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,150
so these what the filters line and
you'll see that

723
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,100
those factors they learn high-frequency
black might ages

724
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,470
and then a small number

725
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:26,080
them turning to low-frequency color it
is the right the red green or yellow

726
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,580
blue

727
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,880
I'm what's more when you make it home a
topographic map

728
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,140
using a technical describing the next
slide you get this color blog this low

729
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,020
frequency kinda blog in with the
low-frequency black Michael Kors

730
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,510
and that's just what you said among his
brain cream

731
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,910
if you don't among his brain you see
these high physical to his orientation

732
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,100
changes smoothly as you go through the
cortex

733
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,830
tangentially and you see these
low-frequency callebs

734
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:54,940
most your scientists thought I'm that at
least must be an act

735
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,190
well this is saying is no just the
structure

736
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,320
images is and the idea for a truck
traffic map

737
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,380
is enough to get this but doesn't mean
it's not innate

738
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,940
just means it doesn't need to be so the
way we get there

739
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,460
topographic map is by

740
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,080
this global connectivity from the pixels
to the factors

741
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,010
so the fact is really are learning local
filters the local focused on of color

742
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,960
then gradually learn to be exactly black
and white

743
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,030
then those local connectivity between
the fact is in the head units

744
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,360
so when these hidden units will connect
to a little square off

745
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,490
practice and then induce the topography

746
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,560
and the energy function is such that

747
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,710
when you turn off wannabes hidden units
to say smoothness no longer applies

748
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,480
I'm you pay a penalty and you'd rather
just pay the penalty once

749
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,530
answer to thanks is gonna come on at the
same time

750
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,000
is best to connect them to the same unit
saying pay the penalty once

751
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,900
so that'll cause similar factors to go
to several places in here

752
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,000
me a topographic map

753
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,450
for people who know about modeling
images

754
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,710
um so far as I know nobody has yet
produced a good model a pact is a color

755
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,710
images

756
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,210
that is a generative model would
generate stuff that looks like a real

757
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,930
date

758
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,450
so his a model with London 16 by 16
color images from the Berkeley database

759
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,140
and his things generated from and they
look pretty similar

760
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,770
nice partly a trip is the color balance
here is like the color balance and that

761
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,390
makes you think this summer

762
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,590
but is partly real I mean most to these
a smooth patches

763
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:43,060
referee uniform color as almost to these
the few more these scrutinize

764
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,510
but you also get these things where you
get fairly sharp edges

765
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,930
see get smooth this then shop age than
most with this like doing real date

766
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,760
you get things like owners here we're
not quite there yet but this is the best

767
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,210
model is applied to the color images

768
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,140
and this causes modeling both the
covariance and the means

769
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,200
says caper saying what's the same as
what as well as

770
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,320
what the intense desire

771
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,480
you can apply for doing recognition

772
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,630
so this is a difficult object
recognition task where those

773
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,750
eighty million unlabeled training images

774
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,390
novel with these passes but prices as
the crisis

775
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,160
they were collected by people MIT is
called the tiny images database

776
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,390
the 32 by 32 color images but it's
surprising what you can see nothing to

777
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,470
do with a single image

778
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,060
and since the biggest mobile we're going
to use has about a hundred million

779
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,140
connections

780
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,010
but about .1 to the cuban a racial
cortex in terms number parameters

781
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,060
and so we have to somehow give a
computer model

782
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,440
some way of keeping up with the brain
which has a lot more hardware so we do

783
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,150
it by giving a very small right now

784
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,260
we say suppose the temple was only 32 by
32

785
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,950
maybe we can actually do something
reasonable

786
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,840
so as you see there are a lot of
variation if you look at the that's as

787
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,410
close up across to reach

788
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,660
this is a much more typical picture but
and

789
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,130
it's hard to tell the difference in
these ten categories

790
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,970
particularly things like dear course we
do breaches a very similar categories

791
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,910
like truck car deer and horse

792
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,240
people pretty good at these people won't
make very many errors that's partly

793
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,430
because these were hand labelled by
people

794
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:30,020
I'm so that even even people make
summers

795
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,550
we only have 50,000 training examples 5
as in each class

796
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,920
and 10,000 test examples could we have
and label them

797
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,470
but we have a lot on trade unlabeled
data so we can do all those pre training

798
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,740
a lot on mobile data

799
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,920
and then take our covariance units and I
mean units

800
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,010
and just try doing multinomial logistic
regression on top with those

801
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,580
or maybe add another hidden landed on
top of that

802
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,840
so well my career as i text me David

803
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,530
I'm since he worked in young because lab
yeah actually took small patches Monday

804
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,660
model and then

805
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,960
stratum across the mission replicate
them so the semi compositional

806
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,840
and then took the hidden units have all
these little patches and just

807
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,050
concatenated them

808
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,840
to make a great big picture of I'm
11,000 units

809
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,990
which both the means and the and the
covariances

810
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:26,990
and then we cannot use that as I
features see how well we can do

811
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:32,790
and we're going to compare it with
various other methods

812
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,090
so the surface compared to just take the
pic cells

813
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,480
unduly just aggression on the pixels
decide on the 10 classes

814
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,760
you get 36 percent right if you take

815
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,330
just features we should develop by
troubled people MIT

816
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,400
which meant to capture what's going on
in the image quite well but if any

817
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,970
low-dimensional

818
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,450
arm yet 54 percent so much but in pixels

819
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,990
if you take a normal rpm which has
living units with case in noisy input

820
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,340
variables and binary hidden units

821
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,550
and then uses binary hidden units to
castigation

822
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,460
you get sixty percent if you use

823
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,350
what are these IBM's with both the units
like these ones for doing the means

824
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,410
and then these units with three-way
interactions among the covariances

825
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,720
you get sixty nine percent as long as
you use a lot of these factors

826
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,730
and if you can learn an extra hidden
layer right-sizing

827
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,700
senators that time that Sandra million
$600 million connections you done that

828
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,750
that's fine because he's on supervised
me just landed on what's the data

829
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,120
you get up seventy percent not the best
results so far on this database

830
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,650
one final thing

831
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,910
you can take this model was developed
for image patches

832
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,280
and the stupid in phoneme recognition
just took that code

833
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,950
and appointed to look spectrograms which
is sorta more close to what dick would

834
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,490
like to see some you're not using all
the small capsule stuff which is

835
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,130
designed to throw away stuff you think
you don't need

836
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,930
and get rid of the correlations instead
you can take david has also correlations

837
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:07,510
in

838
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:11,710
but we got a model can deal with that
stuff I'm and

839
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,940
the first thing George tried to be the
28th

840
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,530
on which was follows a thousand in units
on top with this

841
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,130
I'm got 22 percent correct is that
correct which was the record

842
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:26,290
for phone recognition on the 28 database
where you know

843
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,810
trying to do in model adapted to each
speaker

844
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,880
and then week later when he did that to
the bad news more frames to thank Tony

845
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,480
1.6 percent

846
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,850
so this all this stuff was designed to
do vision it wasn't designed to the

847
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,020
phonemes

848
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,090
and if we treats phoneme recognition is
just a vision problem on the lock

849
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,010
spectrogram

850
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,900
we can wipe out the speech guys I'm

851
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,100
at least on small the Kaveri another
student is now

852
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,440
Microsoft see if this were complete
recovery as well

853
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,830
yes yeah right

854
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,290
me

855
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,630
we can give them you better tools we can
get the pneumatic tools

856
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,990
say his phoneme recognition over the
years

857
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,090
bankrupt from the eighties got 26 one
person correct

858
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:17,820
over the next twenty years or so they
got the country 4.4 percent

859
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,770
using that as the one you respond socal
much official

860
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,740
am we've now got and 31.6 percent

861
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,650
blessed with a few mobile homes is about
15 percent I don't know much about how

862
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,080
they did

863
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,810
assessment um we're but we nearly a
third of the way from artificial tree

864
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:39,740
I'm so we the two more ideas in with her
okay

865
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,990
I'm done infringed

866
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:50,990
a nap

867
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,840
yeah

868
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,900
you mentioned he did

869
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,890
movie moving

870
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,829
is

871
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:09,010
by using

872
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:13,410
within the good good

873
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,660
you yes he did indeed announce that

874
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,470
what he didn't announce was his wrist
his

875
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,310
he's got a spectacular result against on
235 events arm

876
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,540
what he didn't announce was this two
tricks involved

877
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,840
want ricky is to use a big net with lots
of layers and the GP you called

878
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,000
Patrick by itself won't give you thirty
five errors

879
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,200
the second trick which was surprising
dates

880
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,580
but you're a Microsoft impact which is
to put a lot of work

881
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,430
into producing distortions have the data
so you have not some not some labeled

882
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,070
data

883
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:56,050
see take a label the measure to and you
just Austin clever ways that make is to

884
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,119
look like a to

885
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,280
be translated so people get down to
about

886
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,540
forty years get

887
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,080
said it's already planted so you get on
to unit on July four tiers

888
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,640
by doing these distortions what he did
was even better distortions more of them

889
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,440
and a much bigger net and a GP you got
from 4235

890
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,850
which is impressive is how to make any
progress at

891
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:22,940
but it won't work unless you have lotsa
labeled data

892
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,910
and what's the disguise thing is the
work went into if you look in the paper

893
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:31,940
it's almost report is just back prop
except when you get to the section how

894
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,830
the generational sector labeled data

895
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,050
where this very careful things like it's
a one or seven they

896
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,600
any rotated a certain number degrees but
it is something else irritated more

897
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,119
degrees

898
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,380
I know she's referee for this paper but
I don't mind in knowing

899
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,030
I'm i think is very important work but
he should emphasize that

900
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,990
um they had to have labeled a tizzy that

901
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,680
network into distortions so for me the
lesson that paper is

902
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,109
when we had small computers um

903
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:04,359
you should put your effort into things
like weight constraints

904
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:07,560
so you don't have too many parameters
you only got a small computer

905
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,600
as computers get bigger and faster

906
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,150
you can transfer your effort from the
senate turning the weights to get like

907
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,980
em was doing

908
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,720
in the early days poor you effort into
generating more distortions

909
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,150
see conjecture prior knowledge in the
former distortions

910
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:27,390
and that's much less competition
efficient with the computer is fine

911
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,090
and is more flexible so I think that's
the lesson up

912
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,090
the

913
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:41,090
dead

914
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,140
he them

915
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,740
think that you in bed them cortex here

916
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,900
as expected property those vision

917
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,280
trip the problems you know

918
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,130
by it I'm maybe

919
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,369
be quicker to say the problems we not
been applied but

920
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:07,079
company her

921
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,599
but I mean okay

922
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,329
let me say what the main limitation if
this is true vision we've got

923
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:20,849
least 10 billion euros for doing this
you released billion anyway

924
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:25,010
probably ten billion and even though we
got that many neurons

925
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:30,240
and but tend to the 13 connections could
envision we still have a red notice got

926
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,000
a very small so be the size my thumb
that arm's length

927
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,619
and so we still take almost everything
and don't look at it and the essence a

928
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,450
vision is not to look at almost
everything

929
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,770
intelligently and that's where you get
all these funny illusions

930
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:48,940
we don't see things some we have to do
that in these models these models are

931
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,069
completely crazy

932
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:53,170
your computer vision is completely crazy
almost all that because they take a

933
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,690
uniform resolution image

934
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,760
quite a big one like it has my house and
they try and deal with

935
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,329
all at once with filters all over the
image and if they gonna do selection

936
00:57:03,329 --> 00:57:07,029
they either do it by running of the face
detect everywhere

937
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:10,770
with no intelligence all they do so
interest point detection

938
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,660
and a very low level to decide what to
attend what we do is we think takes

939
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,359
somewhere

940
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,910
then on the base is what I retin-a gives
us with these big pixels on the edges

941
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,270
more pics in the middle

942
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,529
we so decide what we're seeing where to
move next

943
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:26,809
by the second author fixation with a pic
sitting very intelligently

944
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:31,150
and the essence of it is a vision is
sampling um

945
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,839
is not processing everything and that's
completely missing from what I said

946
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:38,569
now in order to do that you have to be
able to take what you saw our way

947
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:40,049
sorting remind them

948
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:43,619
not to multiply so this module within
the month price is very good at

949
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:46,250
combining what some ways to integrate
information at the time

950
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:50,109
and that's when the things we worked on
but that's probably the biggest thing

951
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:52,010
missing but that is an example of

952
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,500
having a module is quite good but now

953
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,270
is never good enough so you have to put
it together over time use many times

954
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,039
and that's what sequential reason all
this stuff are so

955
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,119
basically as soon as people become
sequential we're not moving at all

956
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,460
with more than what you can do in
hundred milliseconds and so that was

957
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:11,900
missing

958
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,210
but I believe that to model a sequential
stuff we need to understand

959
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,299
what is a sequence all is a sequence
that these very powerful operations

960
00:58:20,299 --> 00:58:23,690
and we better shape now to try model
sequential AI

961
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,000
than we were if we didn't know what a
primitive operations mister printer

962
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,720
operation was just deciding whether to
symbols are the same

963
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,720
we're gonna be active luck for
understanding how people this country

964
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:38,750
the

965
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,730
good

966
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,250
you with

967
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:51,890
said

968
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,410
I'm still processing that quite big hug
right

969
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,300
right I'm making the point that people
think 15 quite difficult I'm

970
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,950
not to be good I would love to do that I
have not got a clue how to do it

971
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,440
and you'll notice that in old-fashioned
II that you use to point out on your own

972
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,109
at people

973
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:13,310
the income to qualify so forget it
nowadays when the old a graphical models

974
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,410
they didn't mention that anymore cuz a
graphical models have difficulty with

975
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:16,800
the two

976
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,700
some people scuffles least you're
awesome people track yet some people to

977
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,510
the most to the graphical models

978
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,900
like five years ago them to qualify as I
and so

979
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:31,710
a pretty good division mining would be
what you can do without having to do

980
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,500
with release first get problems like

981
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,790
I would love to know how we deal with
that but I'd so yeah I'm gonna give up

982
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,530
on that right now

983
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:43,390
good

984
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,840
label no extra would be

985
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,980
yes in yes intimate that's what we have
intimate all examples

986
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,050
we have labels is still is a big win to
the pre-training

987
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:05,050
well your judgment Hooper hasn't tried

988
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,010
yes with all these distortions do in
pre-training neither soon called in on

989
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,650
marriage just recently sis

990
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,920
where he tries things like that he tries
distortion zionist

991
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,950
and he uses special distortions it is
I'm

992
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:21,240
and the fact is distortions help a lot

993
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,869
but if you pre training that helps some
more too and benches results just

994
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,660
revenge is results suggest that

995
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,300
um return you will get use a different
part of the space even if you have all

996
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,090
this label date

997
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:36,480
sickly one thing that needs to be done
is to try the pre-training

998
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,760
mundo israel's you don't have to have
the pre training but I bet you would

999
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,140
still hopes and about you it's

1000
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,550
more efficient to it's fast because
briefings are to be fast you don't learn

1001
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,390
very good model

1002
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,770
get lotsa it reaches the starting from
there

1003
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,369
I think you'll do better than he does
just starting from random

1004
01:00:56,369 --> 01:01:02,380
and fast that's just a prediction you
might even get down to 34 s

1005
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,900
the problem with amnesties

1006
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,600
there a solo you can get significance to
me is really nice that way the ninety

1007
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:16,600
well see higher rates CQC differences

1008
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,630
the up

1009
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:27,300
said

1010
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,630
the

1011
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,249
rising

1012
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:38,009
sorry didn't understand the question we
have a limited time with them

1013
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:41,029
after for me

1014
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:45,079
is there any Israel

1015
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,160
nothing not

1016
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,150
the cannot deal with some

1017
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,609
the car model housed rights but

1018
01:01:56,609 --> 01:02:00,089
if sir what happened fifteen time steps
ago

1019
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:03,200
really tell George should have now and

1020
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,369
only tells your staff night doesn't tell
you what's happening to meet you 14

1021
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:07,049
times tax

1022
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:11,150
just contains information across 15 time
steps without having the signatures more

1023
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:11,979
time scales

1024
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:16,200
you come pick up on that because he's
not gonna hidden a four pack router

1025
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,539
before back in our room potentially
could pick up on that allowed actually

1026
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,089
count

1027
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:23,269
I'm said

1028
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:28,140
probably walk behind the box and

1029
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,499
comes out the other side not over a long
time scale my

1030
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:37,719
unless you say that there's a memory
involved where you go back to previous

1031
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:42,819
guestbook a pic now it is true that when
you build a multi-level one which you

1032
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:45,309
can do with three elections as well as
the two connections

1033
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:48,739
at every level you getting a bigger
times bankers your time window

1034
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:52,660
says going further back into the past
which level to get a bit I got class

1035
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,519
just a living

1036
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,660
you say

1037
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,459
him how much unlabeled the

1038
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:05,619
to train the different levels change

1039
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:09,209
like this is just you number waits for
as you go

1040
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:12,609
levels thing sad ones sort of

1041
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:17,699
important thing to say about that which
is that if you modeling high-dimensional

1042
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:21,630
tater you trying to build an
unsupervised model of the date

1043
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,759
you need many less training examples
then you would have thought

1044
01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:29,630
if you use to this country learning when
using discriminative learning

1045
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:34,489
the stoop me very few bits her training
case to constrain the parameters

1046
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:38,650
demand constrained you can you promise
for training case is number bits it

1047
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,140
takes to specify the ONS

1048
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,369
not the number this is expressed by the
import so we then missed you get 3.3

1049
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:45,380
bits per case

1050
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,599
if your modeling the image the number
bits per case is a number to take space

1051
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:51,519
for the image

1052
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,039
which is about a hundred bits so you
need far fewer cases

1053
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,569
parameter number saying is your modeling
much richer thinks

1054
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:03,619
and so each case is given much more
information

1055
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:08,170
so actually we can typically model many
more prime system we have training cases

1056
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:13,930
discount to people on used to that many
less primes me a pic cells

1057
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:17,329
many more than training cases and in
fact

1058
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:21,029
he only used by two million cases for
doing the image stuff

1059
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:25,140
he wasn't enough it was over 30 he
should have used more um

1060
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:31,930
but he was getting 100 million
parameters but the

1061
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,940
basically the annual family is um

1062
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,279
many less primed is the number total
number pixels in your training

1063
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:42,609
data but you can typically use many more
parameters the number trying cases

1064
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:45,859
and you can't do that with northeastern
Thailand

1065
01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:50,229
now if you do that when you start to
school to train

1066
01:04:50,229 --> 01:04:54,329
it quickly improve things and then very
quickly if it's so you have to stop it

1067
01:04:54,329 --> 01:05:01,329
early

1068
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,710
okay

1069
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:10,330
went Scully who
