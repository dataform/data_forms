\begin {equation}

Pr(G=K|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}exp(\beta_{l0} + \beta_l^Tx)} 
\end {equation}

\begin {equation}
\label {eq:linear_model}
\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta_0}  + \sum^p_{j=1} X_j \hat{\beta_j}

In flight, I find myself staring, transported, at a line of maths. It is not  unlike Haraway's marvelous integral equation for a grounded life in Terrapolis @GRMFXMB2#Haraway_2016.  I write the expression on a napkin that came with the in-flight service en route to Copenhagen. I carefully write on napkins because the idea of MRI scanners, the partitioning of Libya or the plot of Wall-E first saw the light of day there @8CX337FK#Walker_2017.  The expression for logistic regression is at the heart of happening in machine learning running from Facebook to self-driving cars. It's a very polished expression, a way of writing what much machine learning does, how it learns from data by fitting a function. It says something like: let there be probabilities that things in the world belong to classes. How many classes? K classes, perhaps even just two classes, like the passengers sitting fore and aft on this flight. The probability that a thing,  a passenger, sits in a particular class depends on all the data relating to that thing,  \$x lowercase.  There's so much compacted in this expression, the archetypal classifier. Its a path trodden by millions of times like the security lanes at Terminal 1 Manchester Airport. Winding through it, subscripted, superscripted and supervised,  terms such as the 'bias', the values of the model parameters \beta hat, the exponential function and the summing operator \sigma line up, pull apart, open the bags and lay out flat every passing datum. The prediction of the probability that things belong in a class is the sum of values of data, weighted by the parameters \beta, themselves the object of extensive calculation during the 'learning' or 'training' phases of machine learning. 

The simplicity of the expression still dazzles me almost as much as it did on a flight from Manchester to Copenhagen in 2014.   It compresses so much in its hold, and it keeps opening up new destinations, like a low-cost airline that crams millions of passengers on flights to a thousand hitherto far-flung resorts.   Sat in the logistic regression, an expression I write out often enough to remember to this day, I can't seen to stop flying, looking down at the ground. The dazzle of technicalities is not a good propensity for STS researchers since they can easily be caught up in it. This dazzle, like the sun that floods brilliantly through the window as the flight clears the almost ever-present cloud layer above Manchester, is not just that of being caught up in the take-off of a technology. If I am caught up, or scripted to use a more ANT-style term,  the dazzle is the effect of the  landscape panorama flashing into view as the cloud opens up. Down there on the ground, the ant-like traffic on the motorways, the rivers and streams, partly flooded fields, the warehouses and distribution centres, shopping malls and sports fields, and the roofs of houses, spread out like an actor-network diagram drawn by Breugel the Elder. Logistic regression and the logistic landscape coalesce as torrents of social media and disruptive platformisation, a cyclone of scientific publications and a firestorm of funding calls, data science initiatives and AI hubs stitch medicine, shopping, elections, policing, driving, banking, taxes, extinctions, music and cooking into the X-factors of machine learning. Caught up in the slipstream, I travel to Paris, Venice, Stockholm, London, Utrecht, Berlin, Dublin, Barcelona,  and many smaller terminals. The contrails of machine learning arc across the skies as it generalizes.      

'Doors to manual' brings its own problems. The sometimes contemplative calm of the flight dissolves. The anxieties of border control, a wrestling match  with bags, and the confusion of a new city's local transport and its fare machines take over.   'What about regulation?' The question comes after my public lecture on machine learning. I'm dismayed, flippant, even jocular in response. I say regulation is beside the point.  I bite the question, like a dysregulated dog. Such a strange reluctance rises in  my well-meaning self to deal with baggage like regulation. All around me, a fact-value split is opening up.  On the facts, there is the sciencing up of data science, the statistical practices of biomedicine or ecology that have better differentiated breast cancer sub-types, tracked migrating whales, identified illegal fish catches, not to mention played Go at a superhuman. Lists of attainment are part of the machine learning dazzle. In every scientific and technological sub-field and in the social sciences and humanities too, a review of machine learning has or will soon appear describing the need to embrace the techniques for their transportative potential. Institutionally, value regimes are arriving, sometimes flying first class.  People flock to the Alan Turing Institute, bastioned in the British Library, people that include machine learners, ethicists, philosophers, policy-analysts and social scientists, as well as me. On the campuses, data science institutes and initiatives seat computer scientists, statisticians, epidemiologists and sociologists around the table, nudging and nodding to the latter  responsibilities for ethical and social dimensions.  

I struggle to retrieve my baggage on arrival, not because of any lack of organisation or efficiency. 

, perhaps because all around the me the fact-value split is taking hold of discussion about it.   
I'm scripted by it. Machine learning has delegated something to me, perhaps one of its contradictions: become a machine learner and think about it at the same time. It's a classic ANT-case in reverse. The artefactual is scripting the factual.  It's a sobering thought. I'm working as part of the propagation of the function finding. I'm help find a function.  
In the office, my laptop fan is making too much noise because its trying to build a model of a platform
I try to model the distribution of activities of a few tens of million people and a few million projects. On a laptop.
all around me, machine learning is ramping up
My proposition? that we might include something more through ml? and that the practices itself might become more observable, common because of that?
I like what I find in the propagation of machine learning. It's inclusion of so many things in the world: ecosystems, media platforms, patterns of infection, etc. Its as if there is a quasi-common ground, a space for composition of collectives, something different to the familiar institutions. Perhaps not.


Struggling with a massive literature
Coping with millions of repositories
Drowning in streams of social media, twitter, youtube and news announcements
Surrounded by funding calls and projects, especially a mushrooming of data science and machine learning projects; including many in universities as well as Google, etc.

# Getting it wrong in practice

I never make it to the Copenhagen Machine Learning Meetups, not once during several months in Copenhagen in 2014. The meetups, usually early evening,  clash with my non-research commitments, like taking kids to the park after school.  An evening meetup at the offices of King!, the makers of Kandy Krush Saga, a particularly juicy instance of algorithmic absorption, is on my calendar. But I don't go.  

It is possible that my frustrations at missing fieldwork, of building an ethnographic archive of experience on which I can draw, are trivial. And the desire to be in a field, to have a  field site, to somehow ground research in peoples and their practicing, to move away from my desk and screen, to cycle along the lovely streets, waterfronts and urban conviviality of the city, to meet the intelligent, good-humoured Danish machine learners, is strong.  There is a countervailing desire, strongly felt, in the way that a toothache might be, acting this whole time. It shadows my every analytical move, vexing my attempts to find something redeeming in machine learning.
