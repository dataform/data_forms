From 2007-2012, I benefited greatly from a research position in the UK Economic and Social Research Council-funded Centre for Economic and Social Aspects of Genomics at Lancaster University. Certain colleagues there, initially in the Sociomics Core Facility, participated in the inception of this  book. Ruth McNally first of all, but also Paul Oldham, Maureen McNeil, Richard Tutton, and Brian Wynne were participants in many discussions concerning the transformation of life sciences around which my interest in machine learning first crystallised. Various academic staff in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Lancaster University shepherded me through their post-graduate training courses: Brian Francis for his course of 'Data Mining,' David Lucy for his course on 'Bayesian Statistics', Thomas Jakl for his course 'Genomic Data Analysis' and TBA's course on 'Missing Data.' My colleagues in science studies at Lancaster, especially Maggie Mort, Lucy Suchman, and Claire Waterton have .  I have been very fortunate to have worked with inspiring and adventurous doctoral students at Lancaster during the writing of this book. Lara Houston, Mette Kragh Furbo, Felipe Raglianti, Emils Kilis, Xaroula Charalampia, and Nina Ellis have all helped and indeed challenged me in different ways. Sjoerd Bollebakker very kindly updated many of the scientific literature searches towards the end of the book's writing. 
My colleagues in the Data Science Institute, Lancaster University, have been enthusiastic and enabling.
