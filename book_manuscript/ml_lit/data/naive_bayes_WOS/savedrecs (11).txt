Given the good performance of SRs compared to other classifiers for both image classification and phonetic classification, in this paper, we extended the use of SRs for text classification, a method which has thus far not been explored for this domain. Specifically, we demonstrate how sparse representations can be used for text classification and how their performance varies with the vocabulary size of the documents. In addition, we also show that this method offers promising results over the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, a standard baseline classifier used for text categorization, thus introducing an alternative class of methods for text categorization.

Observers were asked to judge whether the visual and auditory stimuli occurred simultaneously. The subjective judgment for 90-ms-asynchronous stimuli showed trial-by-trial variation, and we successfully classified subjective simultaneity using neuromagnetic signals. We submitted raw MEG signals, a wavelet transform, and nonlinear dynamics to a naive Bayes classifier. In the case of raw signals and nonlinear dynamics, the classifier trained with the VA (where the visual stimulus was given first) or AV (where the visual stimulus was given second) data could predict the subjective simultaneity of the other VA (or AV) data at a rate better than chance. The classification rate using nonlinear dynamics was comparable to that using raw signals, despite the fact that the dimension was considerably low (101 vs. 88,000 dimensions). In the case of the wavelet transform, the classifier trained with the VA data was able to decode the AV data, and vice versa. These results suggest that (1) we can decode subjective simultaneity using MEG signals. (2) nonlinear dynamics may encode simultaneity specific to the order of the audiovisual inputs, (3) the time-frequency characteristics of neural activity may predict subjective simultaneity independently of the physical order of the audiovisual inputs, and (4) the neural activity (time-frequency characteristics) reflecting subjective simultaneity may share a common mechanism among different sensory modalities.

In this study pixel-based statistics such as mean and variance were insufficient for classifying the bladder, rectum and a control region. Statistical texture analysis were used to extract features from gray-tone spatial dependence matrices (GTSDM). The features were de-correlated and reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), and the principal components (PC) were classified by a naive Bayes classifier (NBC). The results suggests that the three most significant PC of the 56 features from GTSDM with distances d = 1,2,3,4 give the highest average correct classification percentage.

Simultaneously, power densities have increased resulting in greater chances of thermal anomalies situations where the temperature at a location exceeds the safety threshold for equipment placed there. In this paper, we explore some techniques for predicting such thermal anomalies so that preemptive steps can be taken to address them. Four such techniques - a simple threshold method, a moving averages-based method, an EWMA-based method, and, a machine learning technique called naive Bayesian classifier - are tried on three months of temperature sensor data obtained from a real data center. The initial results are encouraging and the naive Bayes method performs better than the others, although the false positive rate needs to be improved.

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many contexts (e.g., spam identification, text categorization, etc) and are considered a powerful tool for the successful automation of several classification-based tasks. In this paper we present a study on the applicability of five widely used text classification algorithms in the context of web services robustness testing. In practice, we assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Large Linear Classification, K-nearest neighbor (Ibk), and Hyperpipes in classifying web services responses. Results indicate that these algorithms can be effectively used to automate the identification of robustness issues while reducing human intervention. However, in all mechanisms there are cases of misclassified responses, which means that there is space for improvement.

The class imbalance is that the amount of one class may be much less than that of another in training set. Under-sampling is a very popular approach to deal with this problem. Under-sampling approach is very efficient, it only using a subset of the majority class. The drawback of under-sampling is that it throws away many potentially useful majority class examples. To overcome this drawback, we adopt an unsupervised learning technique for supervised learning. We proposes cluster-based majority under-sampling approaches for selecting a representative subset from the majority class. Compared to under-sampling, cluster-based under-sampling can effectively avoid the important information loss of majority class. We adopt two methods to select representative subset from k clusters with certain proportions, and then use the representative subset and the all minority class samples as training data to improve accuracy over minority and majority classes. In the paper, we compared the behaviors of our approaches with the traditional random under-sampling approach on ten UCI repository datasets using the following classifiers: k-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes classifier. Recall, Precision, F-measure, G-mean and BACC (balance accuracy) are used for evaluating performance of classifiers. Experimental results show that our cluster-based majority under-sampling approaches outperform the random under-sampling approach. Our approaches attain better overall performance on k-nearest neighbor classifier compared to Naive Bayes classifier.

The increasing volume of spam has become a serious threat not only to the Internet, but also to society. Content-based filtering is one mainstream method of combating this threat in its various forms, but the previous Content-based filtering methods are hard to find a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper we intend to seek a linear solve for this problem, and two online linear classifiers: the Perceptron and Winnow are explored for this task in three benchmark corpora, which include English corpus PU1, Lingspam and Chinese corpus 2005-Jun, Our experiments conclude that both of these classifiers can filter spam emails effectively as well as efficiently. It is also show that they perform much better than a standard Naive Bayes method.

The method exploits statistics of the histogram, wavelet statistics, amplitudes of local extrema from the ID and 2D adjacency histograms, center of mass of the histogram characteristic function and co-occurrence matrices for feature extraction process. In order to reduce the proposed features dimension and select the best subset, genetic algorithm is used and the results are compared through principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in discriminating between innocent and stego images, as compared to one of well-known image steganalysis schemes.

One main challenge for this study is to find the optimal subsets of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which are most tightly associated with diseases. Feature selection which might effectively reduce the computational complexity has become a necessity in many bioinformatics applications. Hence we present a prediction algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) with a hybrid feature selection method named F-score and compact GA (FCGA). FCGA combines the advantage of filter method and wrapper method, which not only eliminates the redundancy of feature and reduces computing time, but also solves the problem of SVM's parameters selection. We use this prediction algorithm to analyze the lung cancer dataset including 595 samples and each one has 141 SNPs. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of our algorithm, we compare it with Naive Bayes along with some commonly used feature selection methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has the highest level of accuracies compared with the other methods.

Bayes method has shown its good classification performance in fault diagnosis, while the real-timing of this method can be guaranteed effectively. By taking advantages of the PCA and Naive Bayes classification, an integrated approach is proposed for the fault diagnosis of chemical process. Firstly, the dimension of industrial data was reduced by PCA method, and the resulting data were discretized to some grades for Bayes classification. The simulation results of TE process show that PCA-Bayes classification is feasible to detect and locate faults quickly with good real time property and high robustness.

For robust skin segmentation and detection, we investigate color classification based on random forest. A random forest is a statistical framework with a very high generalization accuracy and quick training times. The random forest approach is used with the IHLS color space for raw pixel based skin detection. We evaluate random forest based skin detection and compare it to Bayesian network, Multilayer Perceptron, SVM, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes and RBF network. Results on a database of 8991 images with manually annotated pixel-level ground truth show that with the IHLS color space, the random forest approach outperforms other approaches. We also show the effect of increasing the number of trees grown for random forest. With fewer trees we get faster training times and with 10 trees we get the highest F-score.

We investigate the recognition of handwritten musical notation based on three related probabilistic inference techniques: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Markov Models (MMs) and Naive Bayes (NBs). Music notes are written on a tablet. A sequence of ink patterns representing this symbol is captured and subsequently employed for constructing the models of HMMs, MMs and NBs. The proposed approach exploits both global and local information derived from ink patterns which we have demonstrated the exploitation of this information via different features employed in different HMMs. The specificity and sensitivity measures of these classification models are compared using unseen test datasets. The findings show that HMM outperformed MM and NB models, due to the ability of HMM in exploiting both transitional probability (transition matrix A) and the overall likelihood of the observed events (emission matrix B). Also, HMMs with more hidden states outperformed those with less states, since a larger model has more capacity. In conclusion, our approach demonstrated that HMM can better exploit information extracted from ink patterns than models of MM or NB, and therefore is an optimal inference technique to encoding useful information for musical notation representation.

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.

Helpfully, there are different approaches able to automatically detect and remove most of these messages, and the best-known ones are based on Bayesian decision theory and Support Vector Machines. However, there are several forms of Naive Bayes filters, something the anti-spam literature does not always acknowledge. In this paper, we discuss seven different versions of Naive Bayes classifiers, and compare them with the well-known Linear Support Vector Machine on six non-encoded datasets. Moreover, we propose a new measurement in order to evaluate the quality of anti-spam classifiers. In this way, we investigate the benefits of using Matthews correlation coefficient as the measure of performance.

Neural Network-based Taxonomic Clustering for Metagenomics	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				Metagenomic studies inherently involve sampling genetic information from an environment potentially containing thousands of distinctly different microbial organisms. This genetic information is sequenced producing many short fragments (<500 base pair (bp)); each is tentatively a small representative of the DNA coding structure. Any of the fragments may belong to any of the organisms in the sample, but the relationship is unknown a priori. Furthermore, most of these organisms have not been identified and correspondingly are not represented in any of the publicly available search databases. Our goal is to be able to predict the taxonomic classification of an organism based on the fragments obtained from an environmental sample that may include many (some previously unidentified) organisms. To elucidate the diversity and composition of the sample, we first use a supervised naive Bayes classifier to score the fragments of known genomes, followed by an unsupervised clustering to group fragments from similar organisms together. We are then free to analyze each cluster separately. This is challenging since we are not interested in similar sequences, but sequences that come from similar genomes, which are known to vary widely intra-genomically. Our dataset comprises of an extremely challenging scenario involving clustering fragments at the phyla level, where none of the phyla have been previously seen or identified. We present two variations of our proposed approach, one based on ART and K-means. We show that ART can cluster 500bp fragments from 17 novel phyla at an overall isolation/grouping that is 10% better than K-means and nearly 7 times over chance.

Naive Bayes texture classification applied to whisker data from a moving robot	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			RAT; CORTEX; DECISION; DISCRIMINATION; NEURONS	Many rodents use their whiskers to distinguish objects by surface texture. To examine possible mechanisms for this discrimination, data from an artificial whisker attached to a moving robot was used to test texture classification algorithms. This data was examined previously using a template-based classifier of the whisker vibration power spectrum [1]. Motivated by a proposal about the neural computations underlying sensory decision making [2], we classified the raw whisker signal using the related 'naive Bayes' method. The integration time window is important, with roughly 100ms of data required for good decisions and 500ms for the best decisions. For stereotyped motion, the classifier achieved hit rates of about 80% using a single ( horizontal or vertical) stream of vibration data and 90% using both streams. Similar hit rates were achieved on natural data, apart from a single case in which the performance was only about 55%. Therefore this application of naive Bayes represents a biologically motivated algorithm that can perform well in a real-world robot task.

This paper deals with the acceleration sensor of a commercial mobile phone that makes it possible to identify and classify the user's means of transportation. The needed pre-processing of the sensor data is described as well as the used classification algorithms, i.e. Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Their performance for solving the classification problem in combination with the different pre-processings is analyzed. It is shown that both classifiers are able to solve the classification task with high accuracy given a proper preprocessing. Support Vector Machines outperform Naive Bayes classifiers and achieve a classification accuracy of over 97% on an unknown test data set.

We calculate modularity and C-rand indices as an indication of the quality of each clustering of the three data sets. We compare the performance of the CSF algorithm with the performance of three other algorithms: hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, K-means, dynamic tree cut (DTC) algorithm and Naive Bayes Clustering (NBC) using both C-rand and modularity values. We report that the CSF algorithm detects clusters resulting in high modularity; however the CSF does not result in clusters with high C-rand values compared to the other methods.

Over the past decade, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved good results for genes classification. This paper presents a methodology which uses two neural networks to classify unseen genes based on their expression levels. In order to remove some of the noise and deal with the imbalanced class distribution of the dataset, data pre-processing is firstly performed before data classification in which data cleaning, data transformation and data over-sampling using SMOTE algorithm are undertaken. Thereafter, two neural networks with different architectures are trained using Scaled Conjugate Gradient in two different ways: 1) the training-validation-testing approach and 2) 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that this methodology outperforms the previous best-performing SVM for this problem and 8 other classifiers: 3 SVMs, C4.5, Bayesian network Naive Bayes, K-NN and JRip.

Imbalance distribution of instances between churners and non-churners and the size of customer dataset are the concerns when building a churn prediction model. This paper presents a local PCA classifier approach to avoid these problems by comparing eigenvalues of the best principal component. The experiments were carried out on a large real-world Telecommunication dataset and assessed on a churn prediction task. The experimental results showed that local PCA classifier generally outperformed Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM and Decision Tree C4.5 in terms of true churn rate.	[Sato, T.; Huang, B.

Even if the problem of WSD is difficult, when we consider its bilingual version, this problem becomes to be much more complex. In this case, it is needed not only to find the correct translation, but this translation must consider the contextual senses of the original sentence (in a source language), in order to find the correct sense (in the target language) of the source word. In this paper we propose a model based on n-grams (3-grams and 5-grams) that significantly outperforms the last results that we presented at the cross-lingual word sense disambiguation task at the SemEval-2 forum. We use a naive Bayes classifier for determining the probability of a target sense (in a target language) given a sentence which contains the ambiguous word (in a source language). For this purpose, we use a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EUROPARL parallel corpus, in order to determine the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language). As we mentioned, the results were compared with those of an international competition, obtaining a good performance.

Image annotation is an important step of content-based image retrieval (CBIR), which is relevant for many real-world applications. In this paper, a new algorithm based on multiple grid segmentation, entropy-based information and a Bayesian classifier, is proposed for an efficient, yet very effective, image annotation process. The proposed approach follows a two step process. In the first step, the algorithm generates grids of different sizes and different overlaps, and each grid is classified with a Naive Bayes classifier. In a second step, we used information based on the predicted class probability, its entropy, and the entropy of the neighbors of each grid element at the same and different resolutions, as input to a second binary classifier that qualifies the initial classification to select the correct segments. This significantly reduces false positives and improves the overall performance. We performed several experiments with images from the MSRC-9 database collection, which has manual ground truth segmentation and annotation information. The results show that the proposed approach has a very good performance compared to the initial labeling, and it also improves other scheme based on multiple segmentations.

However, NB might suffer from poor performance when its conditional independence assumption is violated. While most recent research focuses on improving NB by alleviating the conditional independence assumption, we propose a new Meta learning technique to scale up NB by assuming an altered strategy to the traditional Cascade Learning (CL). The new Meta learning technique is more effective than the traditional CL and other Meta learning techniques such as Bagging and Boosting techniques while maintaining the efficiency of Naive Bayes learning.

It has the potential to build predictive neural network models of polynomial functions using only a reduced set of features which minimizes the prediction error. This paper explores the offline recognition of isolated handwritten numeral characters described with non-Gaussian topological features using GMDH-based polynomial networks. In order to study the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply it on a publicly available dataset of isolated handwritten numerals and compare the results with five other state-of-the-art classifiers: multi layer Perceptron, support-vector machine, radial-basis function, naive Bayes and rule-based classifiers. In addition to improving the classification accuracy and the per-class performance measures, using GMDH-based polynomial neural networks has led to significant feature dimensionality reduction.

The environment may change over time due to some contextual or definitional changes. The environment may change with location. It would be surprising if the performance of common classifiers did not degrade with these changes. The question, we address here, is whether or not some types of classifier are inherently more immune than others to these effects. In this study, we simulate the changing of environment by reducing the influence on the class of the most significant attributes. Based on our analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Networks are the most robust learners, ensemble algorithms are somewhat robust, whereas Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and particularly Decision Trees are the most affected.

The classification methods we used are very classic, which are good at the imbalance data, so that the classification accuracy are convincing, for example NBtree, Naive Bayes and J4.8.

The aim of the study was to uncover the identity, the dynamic behavior, and the interactions among the components of the circadian clock. Transcriptional profiling has exposed the regulon conferring benefits for circadian biology and bioinformatics. Circadian plant time course gene expression data was examined, this was the prerequisite for Naive Bayes classifiers which were trained and led to expression model with a success rate of up to 87%. The model showed new combinatorial rules, including presence of elements and their frequencies in driving particular phases. Implementation of Genemining V2.3 multipotent algorithm showed the specific combinations of elements responsible for expression patterns, highlighting the role of GATA motifs. State-of-the-art technologies allowed for a model in silico, the first such model was made using time course circadian data.

Therefore, fault-prone module detection is one of the major and traditional area of software engineering. Although there are many approaches to detect fault-prone modules, they have their own pros and cons. Consequently, it is recommended to use appropriate approach on the various situations. This paper tries to show an integrated approach using two different fault-prone module detection approaches. To do so, we prepare two approaches of fault-prone module detection: a text feature metrics based approach using naive Bayes classifier and a complexity metrics based approach using logistic regression. The former one is proposed by us and the latter one is widely used approach. For the data for application, we used data obtained from Eclipse, which is publicly available. From the result of pre-experiment, we find that each approach has the pros and cons. That is, the text feature based approach has high recall, and complexity metrics based approach has high precision. In order to use their merits effectively, we proposed an integrated approach to apply these two approaches for fault-prone module detection. The result of experiment shows that the proposed approach shows better accuracy than each approach.

This paper presents a bootstrap feature selection for ensemble classifiers to deal with this problem and compares with traditional feature selection for ensemble (select optimal features from whole dataset before bootstrap selected data). Four base classifiers: Multi layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are used to evaluate the performance of UCT machine learning repository and causal discovery datasets. Bootstrap feature selection algorithm provides slightly better accuracy than traditional feature selection for ensemble classifiers.

We propose a novel spam email filtering approach based on network-level attributes (e.g. the IP sender geographic coordinates) that are more persistent in time when compared to message content. This approach was tested using two classifiers, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM); and compared against bag-of-words models and eight blacklists. Several experiments were held with recent collected legitimate (ham) and non legitimate (spam) messages, in order to simulate distinct user profiles from two countries (USA and Portugal). Overall, the network-level based SVM model achieved the best discriminatory performance. Moreover, preliminary results suggests that such method is more robust to phishing attacks.

Excellent accuracy on data streams has been obtained with Naive Bayes Hoeffding Trees-Hoeffding Trees with naive Hayes models at the leaf nodes-albeit with increased runtime compared to standard Hoeffding Trees. In this paper, we show that runtime can be reduced by replacing naive Bayes with perceptron classifiers, while maintaining highly competitive accuracy. We also show that accuracy can be increased even further by combining majority vote, naive Hayes, and perceptrons. We evaluate four perceptron-based learning strategies and compare them against appropriate baselines: simple perceptrons, Perceptron Hoeffding Trees, hybrid Naive Bayes Perceptron Trees, and bagged versions thereof. We implement a perceptron that uses the sigmoid activation function instead of the threshold activation function and optimizes the squared error, with one perceptron per class value. We test our methods by performing an evaluation study on synthetic and real-world datasets comprising up to ten million examples.

Most existing ensemble methods achieve this goal through resampling the training instances or input features. Inspired by MTForest and AODE that enumerate each input attribute together with the class attribute to create different component classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper, we propose a novel general ensemble method based on manipulating the class labels. It generates different biased new class labels through the Cartesian product of the class attribute and each input attribute, and then builds a component classifier for each of them. Extensive experiments, using decision tree and naive Bayes as base classifier respectively, show that the accuracy of our method is comparable to state-of-the-art ensemble methods. Finally, the bias-variance decomposition results reveal that the success of our method mainly lies in that it can significantly reduce the bias of the base learner.

We considered three relation types: cause-explanation-evidence (CEV), contrast, and elaboration and we extracted word pairs eliciting these relations. We determined a list of Swedish cue phrases marking explicitly the relations and we learned the word pairs automatically from a corpus of 60 million words. We evaluated the method by building two-way classifiers and we obtained the results: Contrast vs. Other 67.9%, CEV vs. Other 57.7%, and Elaboration vs. Other 52.2%. The conclusion is that this technique, possibly with improvements or modifications, seems usable to capture discourse relations in Swedish.

Using smoothed co-training of a naive Bayes classifier she obtains a 9.8% error reduction on Senseval-2 data with a fixed parameter setting. In this paper we test a semi-supervised learning algorithm with no parameters, namely tri-training [2]. We also test the random subspace method [3] for building committees out of stable learners. Both techniques lead to significant error reductions with different learning algorithms, but improvements do not accumulate. Our best error reduction is 7.4%, and our best absolute average over Senseval-2 data, though not directly comparable, is 12% higher than the results reported in Mihalcea [1].

Et is claimed that WSD is essential for those applications that require of language comprehension modules such as search engines, machine translation systems, automatic answer machines, second life agents, etc. Moreover, with the huge amounts of information in Internet and the fact that this information is continuosly growing in different languages, we are encourage to deal with cross-lingual scenarios where WSD systems are also needed. On the other hand, Lexical Substitution (LS) refers to the process of finding a substitute word for a source word in a given sentence. The LS task needs to be approached by firstly disambiguating the source word, therefore, these two tasks (WSD and LS) are somehow related. In this paper, we present a naive approach to tackle the problem of cross-lingual WSD and cross-lingual lexical substitution. We use a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EUROPARL parallel corpus, in order to calculate the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language). Two versions of the probabilistic model are tested: unweighted and weighted. The results were compared with those of an international competition, obtaining a good performance.

The task of learning from multi-label data can be addressed by methods that transform the multi-label classification problem into several single-label classification problems. The binary relevance approach is one of these methods, where the multi-label learning task is decomposed into several independent binary classification problems, one for each label in the set of labels, and the final labels for each example are determined by aggregating the predictions from all binary classifiers. However, this approach fails to consider any dependency among the labels. In this paper, we consider a simple approach which can be used to explore labels dependency aiming to accurately predict label combinations. An experimental study using decision trees, a kernel method as well as Naive Bayes as base-learning techniques shows the potential of the proposed approach to improve the multi-label classification performance.

The proposed approach was tested on a set of data from a Colombian organization for the sending and payment of remittances, in order to identify patterns associated with fraud detection. Similarly the results of the techniques used in the model were compared with other mining techniques such as Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.

In the beginning, a sequence of temporal silhouettes of the moving human body parts are extracted from a video clip (i.e., an action snippet). Next, each action snippet is temporally split into several time-slices represented by fuzzy intervals. As shape features, a variety of descriptors both boundary-based (Fourier descriptors, Curvature features) and region-based (Moments. Moment-based features) are then extracted from the silhouettes at each time-slice. Finally, an NB (Naive Bayes) classifier is learned in the feature space for activity classification. The performance of the method was evaluated on the KTH dataset and the obtained results are quite encouraging and show that an accuracy on par with or exceeding that of existing methods is achievable. Further the simplicity and computational efficiency of the features employed allow the method to achieve real-time performance, and thus it can provide latency guarantees to real-time applications.

In the paper, it is proposed the agent-based recommender system, which, for each new learner, suggests the student group of similar profiles and consequently indicates suitable learning resources. It is assumed that learners may be characterized by cognitive styles, usability preferences or historical behavior, represented by nominal values. It is considered to build recommendations by using Naive Bayes algorithm. The performance of the technique is validated on the basis of data of learners described by cognitive traits such as dominant learning style dimensions. Tests are done for real data of different groups of similar students as well as of individual learners.

In this paper we compare the effectiveness of two GP classification strategies. The first uses the standard (zero) class-threshold, while the second uses the "best" class-threshold determined dynamically on a solution-by-solution basis during evolution. These two strategies are evaluated using five different GP fitness across across a range of binary class imbalance problems, and the GP approaches are compared to other popular learning algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. Our results suggest that there is no overall difference between the two strategies, and that both strategies can evolve good solutions in binary classification when used in combination with an effective fitness function.

An early detection of MI greatly improves patient's chances of surviving and returning to health. In this work we focused on inferior MI detection; our database consisted of 6350 ECG records. Interpretation of records was made by cardiologist and 512 records were diagnosed as an inferior MI. Prediction of inferior MI was acquired by the Selvester QRS score, the Novacode, and the Siemens 440/740. Moreover, we compared performance of learning algorithms Ripper, C4.5, SVM, and Naive Bayes to the decison systems. The best decision system, the Selvester score, achieved 0.58 of sensitivity and 0.93 of specificity. The better results were obtained by Ripper - sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.92. The modification of Selvester yielded to similar performance of 0.85 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity.

Due to over-exploitation it is facing extinction and trade has been banned under CITES Appendix I since 1992. Current methods, primarily comparative wood anatomy, are inadequate for conclusive species identification. This study aims to find a set of anatomical characters that distinguish the wood of D. nigra from other commercially important species of Dalbergia from Latin America. Qualitative and quantitative wood anatomy, principal components analysis and naive Bayes classification were conducted on 43 specimens of Dalbergia, eight D. nigra and 35 from six other Latin American species. Dalbergia cearensis and D. miscolobium can be distinguished from D. nigra on the basis of vessel frequency for the former, and ray frequency for the latter. Principal components analysis was unable to provide any further basis for separating the species. Naive Bayes classification using the four characters: minimum vessel diameter; frequency of solitary vessels; mean ray width; and frequency of axially fused rays, classified all eight D. nigra correctly with no false negatives, but there was a false positive rate of 36 center dot 36 %. Wood anatomy alone cannot distinguish D. nigra from all other commercially important Dalbergia species likely to be encountered by customs officials, but can be used to reduce the number of specimens that would need further study.

Considering that in learning Bayesian network classifier, estimating probabilities from a given set of training examples is crucial, and it has been proved that m-estimate can scale up the accuracy of many Bayesian classifiers. Thus, a natural question is whether FISC with m-estimate can perform even better. Response to this problem, in this paper, we aim to scale up the accuracy of FISC by m-estimate and propose new probability estimation formulas. The experimental results show that the Laplace estimate used in the original FISC performs not very well and our m-estimate can greatly scale up the accuracy, it even outperforms other outstanding Bayesian classifiers used to compare.

Traditional methods can only find the linear dependencies or the dependencies among few features. In our research, we try to use feature selection approaches for finding dependencies. We use and compare Relief, CFS, NB-GA and NB-BOA as feature selection approaches to find the dependent features among our artificial data. Unexpectedly, Relief has the best performance in our experiments, even better than NB-BOA, which is a population-based evolutionary algorithm that used the population distribution information to find the dependent features. It may be because sonic weak "link strengths" between features or due to the fact that Naive Bayes classifier which is used in these wrapper approaches cannot represent the dependencies between features. However, the exact reason for these results still is an open problem for our future work.

In our work, we provide reliable confidence measures for the assessment of stroke risk, using the Conformal Prediction framework. This framework provides a way for assigning valid confidence measures to predictions of classical machine learning algorithms. We conduct experiments on a dataset which contains morphological features derived from ultrasound images of atherosclerotic carotid plaques, and we evaluate the results of four different Conformal Predictors (CPs). The four CPs are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes classification (NBC), and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN). The results given by all CPs demonstrate the reliability and usefulness of the obtained confidence measures on the problem of stroke risk assessment.

For this reason, manual observation is not feasible anymore and machine learning methods are progressing to analyze these new data. Specifically, since the number of genes is very high, feature selection methods have proven valuable to deal with this unbalanced - high dimensionality and low cardinality - datasets. Our method is composed by a discretizer, a filter and the FVQIT (Frontier Vector Quantization using Information Theory) classifier. It is employed to classify eight DNA gene-expression microarray datasets of different kinds of cancer. A comparative study with other classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), C4.5, naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor is performed. Our approach shows excellent results outperforming all other classifiers.

This paper presents a comparison analysis between correlation-based and causal feature selection for ensemble classifiers. MLP and SVM are used as base classifier and compared with Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. According to the results, correlation-based feature selection algorithm can eliminate more redundant and irrelevant features, provides slightly better accuracy and less complexity than causal feature selection. Ensemble using Bagging algorithm can improve accuracy in both correlation-based and causal feature selection.

Results: We exploit features derived from the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks and gene coexpression networks to reconstruct KEGG orthologs for Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens protein-protein interaction networks extracted from the DIP repository and Mus musculus and Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa gene coexpression networks extracted from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus using the decision tree, Naive-Bayes and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms. Conclusions: The performance of our classifiers in reconstructing KEGG orthologs is compared against a basic reciprocal BLAST hit approach. We provide implementations of the resulting algorithms as part of BiNA, an open source biomolecular network alignment toolkit.	[Towfic, Fadi; VanderPlas, Susan; Tuggle, Christopher K.; Greenlee, M.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining of EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the representation of time-frequency patterns of the signal's information content by WC qualiatative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions in time-frequency spectrum during the specified task of BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns are classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). This innovative characteristic of the process justifies the feasibility of the proposed approach to other data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches in this field and on non stationary time series analysis.

This paper presents an application of the boosting-based ensemble learning with penalty setting profiles on automatic unknown word recognition in Thai. Treating a sequential task as a non-sequential problem requires us to rank a set of generated candidates for a potential unknown word position. Since the correct candidate might not located at the highest rank among those candidates in the set, the proposed method provides penalties, in the form of a penalty setting profile, to improper ranking in order to reconstruct the succeeding classification model. In addition a number of alternative penalty setting profiles are introduced and their performances are compared on the task of extracting unknown words from a large Thai medical text. Using the naive Bayes as the base classifier for ensemble learning, the proposed method achieves the accuracy of 89.24%, which is an improvement of 9.91%, 7.54%, 5.25% over conventional naive Bayes, non-ensemble version, and flat penalty setting profile.

The goal is to collect interaction data during a realistic simulation of procedures in order to provide to users feedback about their skills. In this paper, we present a new approach to online training assessment based on Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes (FGNB) for modeling and classification of simulation in M pre-defined classes, which is a generalization of Gaussian Bayes Networks.

Unfortunately, in several tasks training sets are extremely small and their generation is very expensive. In order to tackle this problem in tins paper we propose a new text classification method that takes advantage of the information embedded in the own test set. This method is supported on the idea that similar documents must belong to the same category. Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering not only their own content; but also information about the assigned category to other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental results in four data sets of different sizes are encouraging. They indicate that the proposed method is appropriate: to be used with small training sets, where it could significantly outperform the results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

However, although the beneficial nature of including these relationships seems obvious, in practice finding good representations for feature relationships in video is difficult. We propose a simple and computationally efficient method for expressing pairwise relationships between quantized features that combines the power of discriminative representations with key aspects of Naive Bayes. We demonstrate how our technique can augment both appearance- and motion-based features, and that it significantly improves performance on both types of features.

However, the performance of this distance relies heavily on the large number of local features in the training set and test image, which need heavy computation cost for nearest-neighbor (NN) search in the testing phase. If using small number of local features for accelerating the NN search, the performance will be poor. In this paper, we propose a large margin framework to improve the discrimination of I2C distance especially for small number of local features by learning Per-Class Mahalanobis metrics. Our I2C distance is adaptive to different class by combining with the learned metric for each class. These multiple Per-Class metrics are learned simultaneously by forming a convex optimization problem with the constraints that the I2C distance from each training image to its belonging class should be less than the distance to other classes by a large margin. A gradient descent method is applied to efficiently solve this optimization problem. For efficiency and performance improved, we also adopt the idea of spatial pyramid restriction and learning I2C distance function to improve this I2C distance. We show in experiments that the proposed method can significantly outperform the original NBNN in several prevalent image datasets, and our best results can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most datasets.

The algorithm combines a bottom-up, low-level, procedure of a bag-of-words naive Bayes phase for winnowing out unlikely object classes with a high-level procedure for detection and classification. The high-level process is a hybrid of a voting method where votes are filtered using beliefs computed by a class-specific graphical model. In that sense, shape is both explicit (determining the voting pattern) and implicit (each object part votes independently) - hence the term "semi-explicit shape model".

It is based on the hypothesis that each local descriptor is drawn from a class-dependent probability measure. The density of the latter is estimated by the non-parametric kernel estimator, which is further simplified under the assumption that the normalization factor is class-independent. While leading to significant simplification, the assumption underlying the original NBNN is too restrictive and considerably degrades its generalization ability. The goal of this paper is to address this issue. As we relax the incriminated assumption we are faced with a parameter selection problem that we solve by hinge-loss minimization. We also show that our modified formulation naturally generalizes to optimal combinations of feature types. Experiments conducted on several datasets show that the gain over the original NBNN may attain up to 20 percentage points. We also take advantage of the linearity of optimal NBNN to perform classification by detection through efficient sub-window search [2], with yet another performance gain. As a result, our classifier outperforms - in terms of misclassification error - methods based on support vector machine and bags of quantized features on some datasets.

We describe two existing approaches, Shannon entropy and asymmetric entropy, and one new approach, warped entropy. The approaches are used to find cut points for the end point of cardiovascular death for three risk metrics: heart rate variability (HRV LF-HF), morphological variability (MV) and deceleration capacity (DC). When trained on multiple instances of training set containing 2813 patients, warped entropy yielded the most robust cutoffs. The performance of the cutoffs obtained using warped entropy from the training sets was compared with those in the literature using a Naive Bayes classifier on corresponding test sets. Each test set contained 1406 patients. The resulting classifier resulted in a significantly (p<0.05) improved recall rate at the expense of a lower precision.	[Singh, A.; Liu, J.; Guttag, J.

The second stage employs k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data into k clusters (in our case, k=2 i.e. cluster / no, cluster1 / yes) for validation the class labels associated with the data. After clustering, the class labels associated with the data is compared with the labels generated by clustering algorithm if both the labels are same it is assumed that the data is correctly classified. The instances for which the labels are not same are considered to be misclassified and are removed before further processing. In the third stage support vector machine classification is applied. The classification model is validated by using k-fold cross validation method. The performance of SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is also compared with Naive Bayes classifier. In our case SVM classifier outperforms the Naive Bayes classifier. To validate the proposed framework, experiments have been carried out on benchmark datasets such as Indian Pima diabetes dataset and Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD). These datasets were obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Our proposed study obtained classification accuracy on both datasets, which is better with respect to the other classification algorithms applied on the same datasets as cited in the literature. The performance of the proposed framework was also evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity measures.	[Patil, B. M.; Joshi, R.

A common criterion to decide on the number of selected genes is minimizing the classifier error. However, considering the risk of overfitting due to the small sample size, and the fact that the number of selected genes is usually larger than the suspected number of discriminating genes, this work proposes relaxing the minimum error rate criterion. The paper shows that from a small number of feature selection and classification methods, it is possible to find configurations that select few genes without significantly worsening the error rate of the best classifier. Average ranking for 10 to 40 genes shows that SVM-RFE with Naive Bayes and FCBF with SVM behave consistently well.

A number of common learning algorithms have been adapted for this task, including k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and decision trees. Following this line, we propose an adaptation of the naive Bayes classification algorithm for the label ranking problem. Our main idea lies in the use of similarity between the rankings to replace the concept of probability. We empirically test the proposed method on some metalearning problems that consist of relating characteristics of learning problems to the relative performance of learning algorithms. Our method generally performs better than the baseline indicating that it is able to identify some of the underlying patterns in the data.

Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers for classifying Databank Accession Number sentences from online biomedical articles	DOCUMENT RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL XVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Document Recognition and Retrieval XVII	JAN 19-21, 2010	San Jose, CA	SPIE, IS & T (Soc Imaging Sci & Technol), Inst Telecom		Naive Bayes; Support Vector Machine (SVM); databank; labeling; text classification; bibliographic information		This paper describes two classifiers, Nave Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify sentences containing Databank Accession Numbers, a key piece of bibliographic information, from online biomedical articles. The correct identification of these sentences is necessary for the subsequent extraction of these numbers. The classifiers use words that occur most frequently in sentences as features for the classification. Twelve sets of word features are collected to train and test the classifiers. Each set has a different number of word features ranging from 100 to 1,200. The performance of each classifier is evaluated using four measures: Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. The Naive Bayes classifier shows performance above 93.91% at 200 word features for all four measures. The SVM shows 98.80% Precision at 200 word features, 94.90% Recall at 500 and 700, 96.46% F-Measure at 200, and 99.14% Accuracy at 200 and 400. To improve classification performance, we propose two merging operators, Max and Harmonic Mean, to combine results of the two classifiers. The final results show a measureable improvement in Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy rates.

This paper adopts three supervised learning approaches and a web-based semantic orientation approach, PMI-IR, to Chinese reviews. The results show that SVM outperforms naive bayes and N-gram model on various sizes of training examples, but does not obviously exceeds the semantic orientation approach when the number of training examples is smaller than 300.

We have compared six classifiers for predicting implantation potentials of IVF embryos. We have constructed an embryo based dataset which represents an imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples as in most of the medical datasets. Since it is shown that accuracy is not an appropriate measure for imbalanced class distributions, ROC analysis have been used for performance evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that Naive Bayes and Radial Basis Function methods produced significantly better performance with (0.739 +/- 0.036) and (0.712 +/- 0.036) area under the curve measures respectively.

J	Kovacevic, A; Devedzic, V; Pocajt, V				Kovacevic, Ana; Devedzic, Vladan; Pocajt, Viktor			Using data mining to improve digital library services	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Digital libraries; Databases; Serbia; Data handling; Service delivery	RECOMMENDATION	Purpose This paper aims to propose a solution for recommending digital library services based on data mining techniques (clustering and predictive classification). Design/methodology/approach - Data mining techniques are used to recommend digital library services based on the user's profile and search history. First, similar users were clustered together, based on their profiles and search behavior. Then predictive classification for recommending appropriate services to them was used. It has been shown that users in the same cluster have a high probability of accepting similar services or their patterns. Findings - The results indicate that k-means clustering and Naive Bayes classification may be used to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. The overall accuracy is satisfying, while average accuracy depends on the specific service. The results were better for frequently occurring services. Research limitations/implications - Datasets were used from the KOBSON digital library. Only clustering and predictive classification was applied. If the correlation between the service and the institution were higher, it would have better accuracy. Originality/value - The paper applied different and efficient data mining techniques for clustering digital library users based on their profiles and their search behavior, i.e. users' interaction with library services, and obtain user patterns with respect to the library services they use. A digital library may apply this approach to offer appropriate services to new users more easily. The recommendations will be based on library items that similar users have already found useful.

J	Kenaza, T; Tabia, K; Benferhat, S				Kenaza, Tayeb; Tabia, Karim; Benferhat, Salem			On the Use of Naive Bayesian Classifiers for Detecting Elementary and Coordinated Attacks	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Bayesian networks; classification; naive Bayes classifiers; intrusion detection; coordinated attacks	INTRUSION DETECTION	Bayesian networks are very powerful tools for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty. This paper shows the applicability of naive Bayesian classifiers to two major problems in intrusion detection: the detection of elementary attacks and the detection of coordinated ones. We propose two models starting with stating the problems and defining the variables necessary for model building using naive Bayesian networks. In addition to the fact that the construction of such models is simple and efficient, the performance of naive Bayesian networks on a representative data is competing with the most efficient state of the art classification tools. We show how the decision rules used in naive Bayesian classifiers can be improved to detect new attacks and new anomalous activities. We experimentally show the effectiveness of these improvements on a recent Web-based traffic. Finally, we propose a naive Bayesian network-based approach especially designed to detect coordinated attacks and provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of this approach.

Diagnosis, treatment and care of pressure ulcers are costly for health services. Accurate wound evaluation is a critical task for optimizing the efficacy of treatment and care. Prediction of wound evolution helps the effective management of health resources and planning of pharmacological treatment and health-care decisions. In this paper, different machine learning approaches have been designed and used to predict the evolution of pressure ulcers. These predictive systems are based on local features extracted from wound images which were weekly taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions. The images were automatically segmented by the mean-shift procedure. A group of clinical experts manually classified the segmented regions into five different tissue types, and a set of local descriptors based on area measurements of these tissues was extracted. The one-week evolution of two different indicators for pressure ulcer evaluation is predicted: the ratio between granulation and devitalized tissue, and the percentage of wound-bed border consisting of granulation tissue. Of the tens of machine learning approaches and architectures tested in this study, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers, neural networks and decision trees achieved the highest accuracy rates in the prediction of the two indicators above, with also acceptable sensitivity and positive predictive value rates. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features needed for prediction. Neural networks and decision trees gave the best performance results, and the C4.5 algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate (similar to 81%) in the prediction of the granulation/devitalized ratio from a small number of input features.

Several existing approachs use smart outlets or detectors to acquire the information of individual appliance and recognize the operating state. However, such approachs have to install numerous devices if they want to monitor the states of all appliances. This will increase the cost and complexity of installation and maintenance. Therefore, we develop an appliance recognition system which minimizing the scope of deployment. We install smart meters at single-point, distribution board, to measure the power consumption at circuit-level. In addition, to improve the recognition accuracy of our system and detect the state changes in real time, We use dynamic baysian network to take user behavior into account and Bayes filter to perform online inference. Finally, we design several experiments to compare our approach with some commonly used classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results shows that our model outperforms these classifiers and the accuracies of all appliances are greater than 92%. Furthermore, we also compare the results of Bayes filter with Viterbi algorithm, which is an offline inference method. The difference in accuracy of every appliance between Bayes filter and Viterbi algorithm is less than 1%.

The visual obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior rely on the segmentation of the traversable floor region in the omnidirectional robocentric view. The image processing employs a supervised approach in which the segmentation optimal with respect to the appearance of the local environment is determined by cross validation over 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device (PMD) camera. The range data in the front view provides the seeds and validation data to supervise the appearance based segmentation in the omniview. Segmentation relies on histogram backprojection which maintains separate appearance models for floor, obstacles and background. A naive Bayes classifier predicts the occupancy of the robots local environment by fusing the evidence provided by different segmentations and models. The classification error is analyzed on ground truth data generated by a PMD camera and manually segmented scenes. The scheme is highly robust with respect to ambiguous and misleading visual appearances of obstacles and floor, thus enabling the robot to navigate safely in unstructured environments of diverse appearance, texture and illumination. The proposed vision algorithm and the navigation behavior demonstrate a robust performance in extensive robotic experiments across several hours of autonomous operation.

In this paper, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement). Statistical Tests also demonstrate higher confidence in detection accuracy for our method.

Our application transforms remotely sensed topographic data gathered by orbiting satellites into semantically meaningful maps of landforms; such maps are valuable research tools for planetary science. As topographic data become increasingly available, the ability to derive geomorphic maps efficiently is becoming essential. In our proposed framework, the mapping is achieved by means of scene segmentation followed by supervised classification of segments. The two mapping steps use different sets of features derived from digital elevation models of planetary surfaces; selection of appropriate features is discussed. Using a particular set of terrain attributes relevant to annotating cratered terrain on Mars, we investigate the design choices for both segmentation and classification components. The segmentation assessment includes K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and watershed-based segmentation. The classification assessment includes three supervised learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Bagging with decision trees, and support-vector machines (SVMs); segments are classified into the following landforms: crater floors, crater walls (concave and convex), ridges (concave and convex), and intercrater plains. The method is applied to six test sites on Mars. The analysis of the results shows that a combination of K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and either SVM with a quadratic kernel or Bagging with C4.5 yields best maps. The presented framework can be adopted to generate geomorphic maps of sites on Earth.

Bayesian Classifiers Programmed in SQL	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; K-means; query optimization		The Bayesian classifier is a fundamental classification technique. In this work, we focus on programming Bayesian classifiers in SQL. We introduce two classifiers: Naive Bayes and a classifier based on class decomposition using K-means clustering. We consider two complementary tasks: model computation and scoring a data set. We study several layouts for tables and several indexing alternatives. We analyze how to transform equations into efficient SQL queries and introduce several query optimizations. We conduct experiments with real and synthetic data sets to evaluate classification accuracy, query optimizations, and scalability. Our Bayesian classifier is more accurate than Naive Bayes and decision trees. Distance computation is significantly accelerated with horizontal layout for tables, denormalization, and pivoting. We also compare Naive Bayes implementations in SQL and C++: SQL is about four times slower. Our Bayesian classifier in SQL achieves high classification accuracy, can efficiently analyze large data sets, and has linear scalability.

It adopts kernel principal component analysis to extract sample features and implements target recognition by using GP classification with automatic relevance determination (ARD) function. Compared with k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine, GP with ARD has the advantage of automatic model selection and hyper-parameter optimization. The experiments on UCI datasets and MSTAR database show that our algorithm is self-tuning and has better recognition accuracy as well.

In a typical scenario, multiple parties may wish to collaborate to extract interesting global information such as class labels without revealing their respective data to each other. This may be particularly useful in applications such as car selling units, medical research etc. In the proposed work, we aim to develop a global classification model based on the Naive Bayes classification scheme. The Naive Bayes classification has been used because of its simplicity and high efficiency. For privacy-preservation of the data, the concept of trusted third party with two offsets has been used. The data is first anonymized at local party end and then the aggregation and global classification is done at the trusted third party. The proposed algorithms address various types of fragmentation schemes such as horizontal, vertical and arbitrary distribution.	[Keshavamurthy, B.

Due to the enormous volume existing and newly appearing network data, Data Mining classification methods are used for Intrusion Detection System. In this paper the classifying methods used are ID3, J48, Naive Bayes and OneR. The data set used for this experiment is kddcup1999. The dimensionality reduction is being performed from 41 attributes to 7 and 14 attributes based on Best First Search method and the 4 classifying methods are being applied. The result shows that ID3 and J48 method carry the highest accuracy and sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes. Naive Bayes holds the highest degree of specification for all three dimensionalities. OneR has the worst Sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes but the time taken by OneR for classification is very less. It is found that the optimal algorithm may vary based on the dimensionality.

Supervised Learning Approach for Predicting the Quality of Cotton Using WEKA	INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Trends in Business Administration and Information Processing	MAR 26-27, 2010	Trivandrum, INDIA	ACEEE		Machine learning Techniques; Multilayer Perceptron; Naive Bayes; J48; k-Nearest Neighbor		Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre used in Textile manufacturing. Cotton fiber is processed into yarn and fabric. Yarn strength depends extremely on the quality of cotton. The physical characteristics such as fiber length, length distribution, trash value, color grade, strength, shape, tenacity, density, moisture absorption, dimensional stability, resistance, thermal reaction, count, etc., contributes to the quality of cotton. Hence determining the quality of cotton accurately is an essential task to make better raw material choices in textile industry which in turn will support better buying and selling decisions. In this work, cotton quality prediction is modeled as classification task and implemented using supervised learning algorithms namely Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, J48 Decision tree, k-nearest neighbor in WEKA environment on the cotton quality assessment dataset. The classification models have been trained using the data collected from a spinning mill. The prediction accuracy of the classifiers is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and the results are compared. It is observed that the model based on decision tree classifier produces high predictive accuracy compared to other models.	[Selvanayaki, M.; Vijaya, M. S.; Jamuna, K.

NCC has been shown to return more robust classification than NBC. However, there are particular situations (which we precisely characterize in the paper) under which the extreme densities included by the IDM force NCC to become very indeterminate, although NBC is able to issue accurately classifications. In this paper, we propose two approaches which overcome this issue, by restricting the set of priors of the IDM. We analyze both approaches theoretically and experimentally.

EM-based Naive Bayes algorithm is often employed to argument the labeled data with the unlabeled ones. However, such an approach assumes the distributions of these two sets of data are identical, which may not hold in practice and often results in inferior performance. We propose a semi-supervised algorithm, called Ratio-Adjusted EM-based Naive Bayes (RAEMNB), for sentiment classification, which combines knowledge from a source domain and limited training instances from a target domain. In RAEMNB, the initial Bayes model is trained from labeled instances from both domains. During each EM iteration, we add an extra R-step to adjust the ratio of predicted positive instances to negative ones, which is approximated with labeled instances of target domain. Experimental results show that our RAEMNB approach outperforms the traditional supervised, semi-supervised classifiers.

Users spend a valuable amount of time deleting spam emails. More importantly, ever increasing spam emails occupy server storage space and consume network bandwidth. Keyword-based spam email filtering strategies will eventually be less successful to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes their tricks to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are patterns and these patterns can be modeled to combat spam. This paper investigates the possibilities of modeling spammer behavioral patterns by well-known classification algorithms such as Naive Bayesian classifier (Naive Bayes), Decision Tree Induction (DTI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Preliminary experimental results demonstrate a promising detection rate of around 92%, which is considerably an enhancement of performance compared to similar spammer behavior modeling research.

In constructing a blog entry classifier, we need as training data a rather large set of blog entries that are manually labeled with a class label. In contrast, we can easily obtain a set of blog sites with class labels. In this paper, we present a method for constructing a blog entry classifier using only a set of blog sites with class labels. Our method is based on the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with the EM algorithm.

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of new packers and variants of existing ones combined with packers employing increasingly sophisticated anti-unpacker tricks and obfuscation methods. This makes it difficult, costly and time-consuming for antivirus (AV) researchers to carry out the traditional static packer identification and classification methods which are mainly based on the packer's byte signature. In this paper(1), we present a simple, yet fast and effective packer classification framework that applies pattern recognition techniques on automatically extracted randomness profiles of packers. This system can be run without AV researcher's manual input. We test various statistical classification algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbor, Best-first Decision Tree, Sequential Minimal Optimization and Naive Bayes. We test these algorithms on a large data set that consists of clean packed files and 17,336 real malware samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our packer classification system achieves extremely high effectiveness (> 99%). The experiments also confirm that the randomness profile used in the system is a very strong feature for packer classification. It can be applied with high accuracy on real malware samples.

In this study, our objective is to build precise and accurate classification models to predict the factors, which attribute to the disparity in healthcare coverage in the United States. The study utilizes twenty-three variables and 67,636 records from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In our comparative analysis, three statistical feature extraction methods, Chi-Square, Gain Ratio, and Info Gain, were used to extract a set of relevant features, which were then subjected to the classification models, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to analyze healthcare coverage. The most important factors that were discovered in the model are presented in this paper.

The goal is to build a classifier for a task-of-interest for which we have too few training samples. We additionally have "supplementary data" collected from other tasks, but it is uncertain which of these other samples are relevant, that is, which samples are classified in the same way as in the task-of-interest. The research problem is how to use the "supplementary data" from the other tasks to improve the classifier in the task-of-interest. We show how to solve the problem, and demonstrate the solution with logistic regression classifiers. The key idea is to model all tasks as mixtures of relevant and irrelevant samples, and model the irrelevant part with a sufficiently flexible model such that it does not distort the model of relevant data. We give two learning algorithms for the method - a simple maximum likelihood optimization algorithm and a more advanced variational Bayes inference algorithm; in both cases we show that the method works better than a comparable multi-task learning model and naive methods.

This paper also proposes an idea of their estimation method which directly uses empirical marginal distributions to retain simplicity of calculation. Our method is interpreted as an optimization of a rough approximation of the Bregman divergence so that it is expected to have a kind of robust property. Effectiveness of our proposed models is shown by numerical experiments on some benchmark data sets.

To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by identifying other users with similar taste and use their opinions for recommendation; whereas content-based recommender systems recommend items based on the content information of the items. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialization, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed a unique switching hybrid recommendation approach by combining a Naive Bayes classification approach with the collaborative filtering. Experimental results on two different data sets, show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and provide better performance in terms of accuracy and coverage than other algorithms while at the same time eliminates some recorded problems with the recommender systems.

The objective of this research is to assess the relative performance of some well-known classification methods for managing portfolio by predicting financial performance of a company on the basis of text documents. This approach is quite useful for managing portfolios on the basis of predicted risk category by framing the risk categorization task to assess company's financial outlook in the form of a classification problem. Availability of financial text information in electronic form and positive correlation between news reports on company's financial status make its classification a useful tool for investors to predict financial outlook of a company before investing their money in particular stock. Major contribution of classifier is that it enables to manage investor's portfolio. Among the proposed classification techniques combined naive bayes and K-NN (NBKNN) with bigrams and unigrams with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approach for features extraction has high potential of classifying and predicting risk from available financial news. We developed a text classification algorithm that classifies financial news article by using a combination of a reduced but highly informative word feature sets and a variant of weighted majority algorithm. Short learning time is additional advantage of this technique resulted due to its computational efficiency along with relatively high accuracy. We measure the accuracy on precision basis and also do a comparative analysis of combined NBKNN with other classification techniques. The major contribution lies in developing new classification method and its application in portfolio management.

Such environments are equipped with sensors that unobtrusively capture information about the occupants. Reasoning mechanisms transform the technical, frequently noisy data of sensors into meaningful interpretations of occupant activities. Time is a natural human way to reason about activities. Peoples' activities in the home often have an identifiable routine; activities take place at distinct times throughout the day and last for predicable lengths of time. However, the inclusion of temporal information is still limited in the domain of activity recognition. Evidence theory is gaining increasing interest in the field of activity recognition, and is suited to the incorporation of time related domain knowledge into the reasoning process. In this paper, an evidential reasoning framework that incorporates temporal knowledge is presented. We evaluate the effectiveness of the framework using a third party published smart home dataset. An improvement in activity recognition of 70% is achieved when time patterns and activity durations are included in activity recognition. We also compare our approach with Naive Bayes classifier and J48 Decision Tree, with temporal evidence theory achieving higher accuracies than both classifiers.

Kurt			Machine learning for radioxenon event classification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article						Machine learning; Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; Radioxenon monitoring		A method of weapon detection for the Comprehensive nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty (CTBT) consists of monitoring the amount of radioxenon in the atmosphere by measuring and sampling the activity concentration of (131m)Xe, (133)Xe, (133m)Xe, and (135)Xe by radionuclide monitoring. Several explosion samples were simulated based on real data since the measured data of this type is quite rare. These data sets consisted of different circumstances of a nuclear explosion, and are used as training data sets to establish an effective classification model employing state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning. A study was conducted involving classic induction algorithms in machine learning including Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, that revealed that they can successfully be used in this practical application. In particular, our studies show that many induction algorithms in machine learning outperform a simple linear discriminator when a signal is found in a high radioxenon background environment.

J	Bylander, T				Bylander, Tom			Transforming examples for multiclass boosting	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						ensemble methods; boosting; multiclass learning; pseudoloss; Hamming loss		AdaBoost.M2 and AdaBoost. MH are boosting algorithms for learning from multiclass datasets. They have received less attention than other boosting algorithms because they require base classifiers that can handle the pseudoloss or Hamming loss, respectively. The difficulty with these loss functions is that each example is associated with k weights, where k is the number of classes. We address this issue by transforming an m-example dataset with k weights per example into a dataset with km examples and one weight per example. Minimising error on the transformed dataset is equivalent to minimising loss on the original dataset. Resampling the transformed dataset can be used for time efficiency and base classifiers that cannot handle weighted examples. We empirically apply the transformation on several multiclass datasets using naive Bayes and decision trees as base classifiers. Our experiment shows that it is competitive with AdaBoost.

Early detection of exudates could improve patients' chances to avoid blindness. In this paper, we present a series of experiments on feature selection and exudates classification using naive Bayes and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. We first fit the naive Bayes model to a training set consisting of 15 features extracted from each of 115,867 positive examples of exudate pixels and an equal number of negative examples. We then perform feature selection on the naive Bayes model, repeatedly removing features from the classifier, one by one, until classification performance stops improving. To find the best SVM, we begin with the best feature set from the naive Bayes classifier, and repeatedly add the previously-removed features to the classifier. For each combination of features, we perform a grid search to determine the best combination of hyperparameters nu ( tolerance for training errors) and gamma ( radial basis function width). We compare the best naive Bayes and SVM classifiers to a baseline nearest neighbour (NN) classifier using the best feature sets from both classifiers. We find that the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers perform better than the NN classifier. The overall best sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy are 92.28%, 98.52%, 53.05%, and 98.41%, respectively.

But now this rate is decreased in the recent years due to the earlier diagnosis and proper treatment. Chances of the long survival of the patient can be increased by the accurate brain tumor diagnosis. For this regard we are proposing more accurate and efficient system for brain tumor diagnosis and brain tumor region extraction. Proposed system first diagnosis the tumor from the brain MR images using naive bayes classification. After diagnosis brain tumor region is extracted using K-means clustering and boundary detection techniques. We are achieving diagnosis accuracy more than 99%. Qualitative results show that accurate tumor region is extracted by the proposed system. The proposed technique is tested against the datasets of different patients received from Holy Family hospital and Abrar MRI&CT Scan center Rawalpindi.	[Qurat-ul Ain; Mehmood, Irfan; Jaffar, M.

Most of the previous works only focus on the cost while ignore the importance of time In this paper, we address how to choose the unknown attributes to be tested in the limited time in order to minimize the total cost. We propose a multi-batch strategy applying on test-cost sensitive Naive Bayes classifier and evaluate its performance on several data sets.

Rather than relying on elementary measurements or a fixed set of moments, the SDE measures global distribution information and, as such, has more discriminative power in classifying distributions. Based on functional images, which are subject to noise and segmentation inaccuracies, heart wall motion analysis is acknowledged as a difficult problem and, therefore, incorporation of prior knowledge is desirable to enhance the accuracy. Given noisy data and nonlinear dynamic model to describe the myocardial motion, unscented Kalman filter, a recursive nonlinear Bayesian filter, is devised in this study so as to estimate LV cavity points. Subsequently, a naive Bayes classifier algorithm is constructed from the SDEs of different features in order to automatically detect abnormal functional regions of the myocardium. Using 90x20 segmented LV cavities of short-axis magnetic resonance images obtained from 30 subjects, the experimental analysis carried over 480 myocardial segments demonstrates that the proposed method perform significantly better than other recent methods, and can lead to a promising diagnostic support tool to assist clinicians.

Chi-square-based Scoring Function for Categorization of MEDLINE Citations	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Applied statistics; text mining; natural language processing; document categorization	DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION; BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; ALGORITHMS	Objectives: Text categorization has been used in biomedical informatics for identifying documents containing relevant topics of interest. We developed a simple method that uses a chi-square-based scoring function to determine the likelihood of MEDLINE (R) citations containing genetic relevant topic. Methods: Our procedure requires construction of a genetic and a nongenetic domain document corpus. We used MeSH (R) descriptors assigned to MEDLINE citations for this categorization task. We compared frequencies of MeSH descriptors between two corpora applying chi-square test. A MeSH descriptor was considered to be a positive indicator if its relative observed frequency in the genetic domain corpus was greater than its relative observed frequency in the nongenetic domain corpus. The output of the proposed method is a list of scores for all the citations, with the highest score given to those citations containing MeSH descriptors typical for the genetic domain. Results: Validation was done on a set of 734 manually annotated MEDLINE citations. It achieved predictive accuracy of 0.87 with 0.69 recall and 0.64 precision. We evaluated the method by comparing it to three machine-learning algorithms (support vector machines, decision trees, naive Bayes). Although the differences were not statistically significantly different, results showed that our chi-square scoring performs as good as compared machine-learning algorithms. Conclusions: We suggest that the chi-square scoring is an effective solution to help categorize MEDLINE citations. The algorithm is implemented in the BITOLA literature-based discovery support system as a preprocessor for gene symbol disambiguation process.

We propose an coarse indoor localization approach that exploits the ubiquity of smart phones with embedded sensors. GPS is used to find the building in which the user is present. The Accelerometers are used to recognize the user's dynamic activities (going up or down stairs or an elevator) to determine his/her location within the building. We demonstrate the ability to estimate the floor-level of a user. We compare two techniques for activity classification, one is naive Bayes classifier and the other is based on dynamic time warping. The design and implementation of a localization application on the HTC G1 platform running Google Android is also presented.

In one step initial crude images are analyzed for multiple cytological features, statistical analysis is performed and molecules that produce the desired phenotypic pro. le are identified. A naive Bayes classifier, integrating chemical and phenotypic spaces, is built and utilized during the process to assess those images initially classified as "fuzzy''-an automated iterative feedback tuning. Simultaneously, all this information is directly annotated in a relational database containing the chemical data. This novel fully automated method was validated by conducting a re-analysis of results from a high-content screening campaign involving 33 992 molecules used to identify inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Ninety-two percent of confirmed hits identified by the conventional multistep analysis method were identified using this integrated one-step system as well as 40 new hits, 14.9% of the total, originally false negatives. Ninety-six percent of true negatives were properly recognized too. A web-based access to the database, with customizable data retrieval and visualization tools, facilitates the posterior analysis of annotated cytological features which allows identi. cation of additional phenotypic profiles; thus, further analysis of original crude images is not required.

When applying unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering it is useful to determine which words are event-specific and which topic they relate to. Continuous language models are used to model the generation of news stories over time and from these models two measures are derived: bendiness which indicates whether a word is event specific and shape distance which indicates whether two terms are likely to relate to the same topic. These are used to construct a new clustering technique which identifies and characterises the underlying events within the news stream.

The classifiers we consider here are trained with linguistically motivated features. We present comparative experimental evaluation results of four supervised machine learning methods: Support Vector Machines, Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Conditional Inference Trees. We provide a quantitative evaluation of learning and generalization during the classification supervised training, using cross validation and ROC analysis procedures. The reranking is derived using the posterior knowledge given by the classification algorithms.

It proposes using Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes networks (TANs) for goal detection. The problem is formulated as N binary decisions, and each is performed by a TAN. Comparative study has been carried out to compare the performance with Naive Bayes, fully-connected TANs, and multi-layer neural networks. Experimental results show that TANs consistently give better results when tested on the ATIS and DARPA Communicator corpora.

However, few research works are on how to select appropriate metrics for fault-proneness prediction currently. We conduct a large-scale comparative experiment of nine different software metrics reduction methods over eleven public-domain data sets from the NASA metrics data repository. The Naive Bayes data miner, with a log-filtering preprocessor on the numeric data, is utilized to construct the prediction model. Comparisons are based on the analysis of variance. Our conclusion is that, reduction methods of software metrics are important to build adaptable and robust software fault-proneness prediction models. Given our results on Naive Bayes and log-filtering, discrete wavelet transformation outperforms other reduction methods, and correlation-based feature selection with genetic search algorithm and information gain can also obtain better predicted performance.

The first step of web mining is to classify web pages into interesting classes, so the classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining. In this paper, we study the capabilities of bayesian classifiers for web pages categorization, after that we report our work on the comparison of binary-classification and multi-classification. Results on benchmark dataset show that bayesian classifiers perform satisfying, especially for Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) which is more competitive than other methods. Furthermore, the performances of binary-classification are better than those of multi-classification under the evaluation metrics of accuracy and F-measure.

While prior methods can accurately identify the location of hosts in some regions of the Internet, they produce erroneous results when the delay or topology measurement on which they are based is limited. The hypothesis of our work is that the accuracy of IP geolocation can be improved through the creation of a flexible analytic framework that accommodates different types of geolocation information. In this paper, we describe a new framework for IP geolocation that reduces to a machine-learning classification problem. Our methodology considers a set of lightweight measurements from a set of known monitors to a target, and then classifies the location of that target based on the most probable geographic region given probability densities learned from a training set. For this study, we employ a Naive Bayes framework that has low computational complexity and enables additional environmental information to be easily added to enhance the classification process. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach, we test IP geolocation on over 16,000 routers given ping measurements from 78 monitors with known geographic placement. Our results show that the simple application of our method improves geolocation accuracy for over 96% of the nodes identified in our data set, with on average accuracy 70 miles closer to the true geographic location versus prior constraint-based geolocation. These results highlight the promise of our method and indicate how future expansion of the classifier can lead to further improvements in geolocation accuracy.

Experiments showed that the best prediction of nucleotide densities at selected site positions is obtained using only a few key protein sequence positions. These positions are stably selected by the forward feature selection based on the mutual information of factor-site position pairs.

The features further employed are: the relative mean square energy, the number of maxima in the energy envelope, the pitch frequency average and the relative number of zero crossings for every utterance. This approach implies low computational requirements for features extraction and provides good recognition rates. For the experiments some classifiers (kNN, Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, RBF and SVM) provided by the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment are employed.

It outperforms Naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity of Naive Bayes. But the existing TAN model, BL-TAN, for text categorization has the following two problems: 1) it does not take the features that do not appear in texts into account; 2) it ignores the information of word frequency. Based on the two problems, we propose two improved TAN models, BNL-TAN and MUL-TAN, where BNL-TAN considers the unappeared features and MUL-TAN uses the information of word frequency. Then, we compare the original BL-TAN with these two improved versions on Chinese and English unbalanced text datasets, respectively. Experimental results show BNL-TAN is better than BL-TAN and MUL-TAN is much better than BL-TAN and BNL-TAN. So, we conclude that word frequency of texts is very important to text categorization.

We propose a feature selection scheme based on slicing technique which was originally proposed for programming languages. The proposed approach called Case Slicing Technique (CST). Slicing means that we are interested in automatically obtaining that portion features' of the case responsible for specific parts of the solution of the case at hand. We show that our goal should be to eliminate the number of features by removing irrelevant once. Choosing a subset of the features may increase accuracy and reduce complexity of the acquired knowledge. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of CST as a method of feature subset selection is better than the performance of the other approaches which are RELIEF with Base Learning Algorithm (C4.5), RELIEF with K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), RELIEF with Induction of Decision Tree Algorithm (1D3) and RELIEF with Naive Bayes (NB), which are mostly used in the feature selection task.

In 2002, a new standard named "National Student Physical Health Standard" (PHS) began to be carried out year by year. Therefore, a great deal of test data is recorded. Although sports data analysis became more and more technical with the development of artificial intelligence and data analysis technologies, studies on these records were still limited to basic statistics analysis in the past. In this paper a new technology named "Data Mining" which can find unknown patterns of certain data sets and relationships among the data is introduced to analyze PHS test data. We attempt to apply various data mining algorithms in PHS data analysis with the help of Microsoft SQL Server 2005. First, decision tree and naive bayes algorithms are applied to analysis the dependency between single test and score level. Second, association rules algorithm is used to explore detailed associations between single test and score level. Finally, classifying performance of naive bayes, decision tree and clustering algorithms are compared. Some valuable conclusions are achieved.

However, the hazards that follow these new types of communication are growing as well. Predators use Internet conversations to attract minor users, usually resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, a new risk management based approach is proposed, which aims to monitor internet-based conversations and identify possible attacks. In particular, a wide research on the area of children exploitation is first conducted, in order to identify the methods and the techniques that are used. Then, the implementation of a system capable of capturing and analyzing chat dialogs is proposed. The proposed system is under development and has not be implemented yet. It is based on three different sensors. The first one performs text analysis on captured traffic, as an attempt to look for known patterns that may indicate a possible attack. The Naive Bayes classifier method then follows, based upon the initial training set. In addition, this training set is enhanced and adopted to specific users' needs via the proposed "supervised learning technique". The second sensor captures files or web links that are sent through the chat conversation, indicating possible personal information leak or exposing unwanted material to minors. The third sensor counts how many times the same users talk with a particular child. As a result, a total risk factor is calculated as a weighted sum of the three risk factors, through applying the proper weight coefficients. In case the risk factor is above the predefined threshold, a warning signal is sent in order to warn on time that there is a possible grooming attack. The main challenge in the proposed system implementation is related to natural language processing, due to the fact that teenagers use their own acronyms and idioms when chatting, creating their own language. A deep research on these dialogs might result into different linguistic sets. Another important challenge is related with the privacy in internet-related communications.

The elegant simplicity and apparent accuracy of naive Bayes (NB) even when the independence assumption is violated, fosters the ongoing interest in the model. Rough Sets Theory has been used for different tasks in knowledge discovery and successfully applied in many real-life problems. In this study we make use of rough sets ability, in discovering attributes dependencies, to overcome the NB un-practical assumption. We propose a new algorithm called Rough-Naive Bayes (RNB) that is expected to outperform other current NB variants. RNB is based on adjusting attributes' weights based on their dependencies and contribution to the final decision. Experimental results show that RNB can achieve better performance than NB classifier.

The theory of rough sets provides a ternary classification method by approximating a set into positive, negative and boundary regions based on an equivalence relation on the universe. In this paper, we propose a naive Bayesian decision-theoretic rough set model, or simply a naive Bayesian rough set (NBRS) model, to integrate these two classification techniques. The conditional probability is estimated based on the Bayes' theorem and the naive probabilistic independence assumption. A discriminant function is defined as a monotonically increasing function of the conditional probability, which leads to analytical and computational simplifications.

We have mainly focused on co-occurrence of non dictionary words across bloggers of different gender and age groups. For this analysis, we have focused on the feature use of slang words to study the stylistic variations of bloggers across various age groups and gender. We have modeled the co-occurrences of slang words used by bloggers as graph based model where nodes are slang words and edges represent the number of cooccurrences and studied the variations in predicting age groups and gender. We have used demographically tagged blog corpus from ICWSM Spinner damsel for these experiments and used Naive Bayes classifier with 10 fold cross validations. Preliminary results shows that the concurrence of of slang words could be a better choice for predicting age and gender.

Information is extracted as time functions of various dynamic properties of the signatures. We apply our methodology to global features extracted from a 108-users database. Thirty-one features were identified and extracted from each signature. Rough set approach has resulted in a reduced set of nine features that were found to capture the essential characteristics required for signature identification. Low error rates obtained in experiments illustrate the feasibility of using Rough Set as a promising technique for online signature identification systems.

In particular, we estimate the location of Flickr photos, based on their tags, at four different scales, ranging from a city-level granularity to fine-grained intra-city areas. Using Dempster-Shafer's evidence theory, we combine the output of the different classifiers into a single mass assignment. We demonstrate experimentally that the induced belief and plausibility measures are useful to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to classify the photo at a given granularity. Thus an adaptive method is obtained, by which photos are georeferenced at the most appropriate resolution.

It usually employs a supervised learning strategy, where we first build a classification model using pre-classified documents and then use this model to classify unseen documents. The majority of supervised algorithms consider that all documents provide equally important information. However, in practice, a document may be considered more or less important to build the classification model according to several factors, such as its timeliness, the venue where it was published in, its authors, among others. In this paper, we are particularly concerned with the impact that temporal effects may have on ADC and how to minimize such impact. In order to deal with these effects, we introduce a temporal weighting function (TWF) and propose a methodology to determine it for document collections. We applied the proposed methodology to ACM-DL and Medline and found that the TWF of both follows a lognormal. We then extend three ADC algorithms (namely kNN, Rocchio and Naive Bayes) to incorporate the TWF. Experiments showed that the temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains, outperforming (or at least matching) state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, the visual interpretation of these spectra is difficult and few clinicians are trained to use the technique. In this study, sixty-eight spectra obtained from twenty-two multi-voxel spectroscopies were classified using three well-known classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)., Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. The best results were obtained using NaiveBayes that presented an average balanced accuracy rate around 75%, although K-Nearest Neighbors presented very good results in some situations. The obtained results lead us to conclude that it is possible to classify magnetic resonance spectra with data mining techniques for further integration in a Clinical Decision Support System which may help in the diagnosis of new cases.

The proposed estimator shrinks both means and variances, and is thus called the double shrinkage estimator. Extensive numerical studies indicate that the double shrinkage estimator has lower Bayes risk than the estimator which shrinks the means alone, and the naive estimator which has no shrinkage at all. We further use a spike-in data set to assess different estimating procedures. It turns out that our proposed estimator performs the best and is thus strongly recommended for applications.

Different statistical methods are proposed to discern vulnerable buildings for retrofit prioritization. This paper utilized reported seismic induced damage data and illustrated eight different statistical damage classification techniques. naive Bayes, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NN), classification tree (CT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Six building performance modifiers were considered in this study for damage classification: number of stories above the ground level (N), soft story index (SSI), overhang ratio (OHR), minimum normalized lateral stiffness index (MNLSTFI), minimum normalized lateral strength index (MNLSI) and normalized redundancy score (NRS). The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the selected statistical approaches to classify the damage of concrete buildings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studying the Factors Influencing Automatic User Task Detection on the Computer Desktop	SUSTAINING TEL: FROM INNOVATION TO LEARNING AND PRACTICE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	5th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN				CONTEXT; MODEL	Supporting learning activities during work has gained momentum for organizations since work-integrated learning (WIL) has been shown to increase productivity of knowledge workers. WIL aims at fostering learning at the workplace, during work, for enhancing task performance. A key challenge for enabling task-specific, contextualized, personalized learning and work support is to automatically detect the user's task. In this paper we utilize our ontology-based user task detection approach for studying the factors influencing task detection performance. We describe three laboratory experiments we have performed in two domains including over 40 users and more than 500 recorded task executions. The insights gained from our evaluation are: (i) the J48 decision tree and Naive Bayes classifiers perform best, (ii) six features can be isolated, which provide good classification accuracy, (iii) knowledge-intensive tasks can be classified as well as routine tasks and (iv) a classifier trained by experts on standardized tasks can be used to classify users' personal tasks.

Nursing activity recognition using an inexpensive game controller: An application to infection control	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Infection control; hand hygiene; accelerometer; nursing activities Sony PlayStation; Sixaxis		It is estimated that 10% of the patients admitted to North American hospitals die of hospital acquired infections. Approximately half of these are thought to be a consequence of poor hand hygiene practices by the hospital staff. Electronic hand washing reminders that prompt caregivers to wash their hands before and after the patient/patient's environment contact may help to increase the hand hygiene compliance rate. However, the current systems fail to identify the nursing procedures happening around the patient to issue proper hand hygiene prompt. In this research we used the hardware of a low-cost wireless Sony game controller, which included a 3-axis accelerometer, to identify six nursing activities happening around a patient. We attached five sensors to eight nurses' left and right wrists, left and right upper arms, and the backs. Each nurse performed 10 trials of each nursing activity in sequence, followed by a combined nursing activities trial. We extracted mean, standard deviation, energy, and correlation among axes per sensor and compared the results of 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN), Decision Tree (J48), and Naive Bayes classifiers. 1-NN classifier had the best performance and on average regardless of the sensor locations, we achieved 84% +/- 2% accuracy.

An approach for rich format text classification is design and implemented here. We propose a comprehensive feature weighting which considers structure affections to classification by using feature structure distribution weight which is calculated with extended structure model, and text formats as well. We also take into account of the descriptive information of title, keywords, subject, structure, style and text, and morphology information in rich format text. The text classification is fulfilled by a document component tree similarity. We first decompose document, gather features by components, complete document component tree, and compare similarity between same kinds of components. The final result is the combination of all classifiers of component tree. We thoroughly study OpenOffice.org word document from text classification view, construct component tree for OpenOffice.org word document and conduct classification with corpus. Experiment results show that the component tree similarity based Naive Bayes classifier turns out a pretty good precision and recall rate.

From the past usage, the tool can analyze the promotion that is suitable for the user which may save the total expense. The application consists of both client and server side. On the server side, the information for each promotion package for a phone operator is stored as well as the usage database for each client. The client side is a user interface for both phone operators and users to enter their information. The analysis engine are based on KNN, ANN, decision tree and Naive Bayes models. For comparison, it is shown that KNN and decision outperforms the others.

The gait of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to identify the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg.

Positive changes have been experienced on dimensions of user, management and teacher in distance education systems at each passing day. In addition to these positive changes, new approaches to be used at the evaluation of distance education are emerging. Each of these approaches is an algorithm. In this study, the algorithms to be used at the evaluation of distance education platforms are analyzed and compared. Distance education algorithms as K-means, Apriori, C45, Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNN and Naive Bayes are created the universe and sample of this research. As a result, it is determined that which algorithms can be effective at analyzing of the student behavior, dimension of management and giving more impressive decision of the teachers.

This paper presents study undertaken to identify possible improvements in processing of neonatal sleep electroencephalographic recordings. The influence of segmentation, feature extraction and feature selection on the classification accuracy was examined. The total of 97 features was extracted for each EEG channel for each segment. For selection of individual features from different channels, sequential methods were used. Naive Bayes classifier was used for final classification and performance was evaluated through cross validation. Experiments show that the combination of adaptive segmentation and selected features led to better performance. Obtained results may provide a reference for developing or enhancing neonatal sleep EEG classification algorithms. Analysis was performed on real clinical data.

Machine learning methods for metabolic pathway prediction	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DATABASES; GENOMES; NETWORKS; ENZYMES; METACYC; MODEL	Background: A key challenge in systems biology is the reconstruction of an organism's metabolic network from its genome sequence. One strategy for addressing this problem is to predict which metabolic pathways, from a reference database of known pathways, are present in the organism, based on the annotated genome of the organism. Results: To quantitatively validate methods for pathway prediction, we developed a large "gold standard" dataset of 5,610 pathway instances known to be present or absent in curated metabolic pathway databases for six organisms. We defined a collection of 123 pathway features, whose information content we evaluated with respect to the gold standard. Feature data were used as input to an extensive collection of machine learning (ML) methods, including naive Bayes, decision trees, and logistic regression, together with feature selection and ensemble methods. We compared the ML methods to the previous PathoLogic algorithm for pathway prediction using the gold standard dataset. We found that ML-based prediction methods can match the performance of the PathoLogic algorithm. PathoLogic achieved an accuracy of 91% and an F-measure of 0.786. The ML-based prediction methods achieved accuracy as high as 91.2% and F-measure as high as 0.787. The ML-based methods output a probability for each predicted pathway, whereas PathoLogic does not, which provides more information to the user and facilitates filtering of predicted pathways. Conclusions: ML methods for pathway prediction perform as well as existing methods, and have qualitative advantages in terms of extensibility, tunability, and explainability. More advanced prediction methods and/or more sophisticated input features may improve the performance of ML methods. However, pathway prediction performance appears to be limited largely by the ability to correctly match enzymes to the reactions they catalyze based on genome annotations.

A novel time series analysis approach for prediction of dialysis in critically ill patients using echo-state networks	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							MORTALITY PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; SCORES	Background: Echo-state networks (ESN) are part of a group of reservoir computing methods and are basically a form of recurrent artificial neural networks (ANN). These methods can perform classification tasks on time series data. The recurrent ANN of an echo-state network has an 'echo-state' characteristic. This 'echo-state' functions as a fading memory: samples that have been introduced into the network in a further past, are faded away. The echostate approach for the training of recurrent neural networks was first described by Jaeger H. et al. In clinical medicine, until this moment, no original research articles have been published to examine the use of echo-state networks. Methods: This study examines the possibility of using an echo-state network for prediction of dialysis in the ICU. Therefore, diuresis values and creatinine levels of the first three days after ICU admission were collected from 830 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between May 31th 2003 and November 17th 2007. The outcome parameter was the performance by the echo-state network in predicting the need for dialysis between day 5 and day 10 of ICU admission. Patients with an ICU length of stay < 10 days or patients that received dialysis in the first five days of ICU admission were excluded. Performance by the echo-state network was then compared by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with results obtained by two other time series analysis methods by means of a support vector machine (SVM) and a naive Bayes algorithm (NB). Results: The AUC's in the three developed echo-state networks were 0.822, 0.818, and 0.817. These results were comparable to the results obtained by the SVM and the NB algorithm. Conclusions: This proof of concept study is the first to evaluate the performance of echo-state networks in an ICU environment. This echo-state network predicted the need for dialysis in ICU patients. The AUC's of the echo-state networks were good and comparable to the performance of other classification algorithms. Moreover, the echostate network was more easily configured than other time series modeling technologies.

However, the interactions between population dynamics and different environmental factors are complex and often non-linear, making it difficult to produce robust predictions. 'Machine-learning' techniques (in particular, supervised classification methods) have been proposed as useful tools, to overcome such difficulties. In this study, a methodology is proposed to build a robust classifier for fish recruitment prediction with sparse and noisy data. The methodology consists of 4 steps: (1) a semi-automated recruitment discretization method; (2) supervised discretization of predictors; (3) multivariate and non-redundant predictors selection: (4) learning a probabilistic classifier. in terms of fisheries management, the classifier estimated performance has important consequences and, to be useful, the manager needs to know the risk that is being taken when using this number. Probabilistic classifiers such as 'naive Bayes', have the advantage that, in addition to the predictions, estimate also the probability of each possible outcome. Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius) recruitments are used as application examples. 'Two-intervals' recruitment discretization accomplishes 70% accuracies and Brier scores of around 0.10, for both anchovy and hake recruitment. In comparison, 'three-intervals' recruitment discretization accomplishes 50% accuracies; and Brier scores of around 0.25 for anchovy and 0.30 for hake recruitment. These statistics are the result of validating not only the classifier, but also the previous steps, as a whole methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liang, H; Yan, YH; Zhang, H				Liang, Han; Yan, Yuhong; Zhang, Harry			LEARNING DECISION TREES WITH LOG CONDITIONAL LIKELIHOOD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; log conditional likelihood; probability estimation tree; discriminative learning; AUC		In machine learning and data mining, traditional learning models aim for high classification accuracy. However, accurate class probability prediction is more desirable than classification accuracy in many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis. Although it is known that decision trees can be adapted to be class probability estimators in a variety of approaches, and the resulting models are uniformly called Probability Estimation Trees (PETs), the performances of these PETs in class probability estimation, have not yet been investigated. We begin our research by empirically studying PETs in terms of class probability estimation, measured by Log Conditional Likelihood (LCL). We also compare a PET called C4.4 with other representative models, including Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, Bayesian Network, KNN and SVM, in LCL. From our experiments, we draw several valuable conclusions. First, among various tree-based models, C4.4 is the best in yielding precise class probability prediction measured by LCL. We provide an explanation for this and reveal the nature of LCL. Second, compared with non tree-based models, C4.4 also performs best. Finally, LCL does not dominate another well-established relevant metric-AUC, which suggests that different decision-tree learning models should be used for different objectives. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI sample sets. We run all the models within a machine learning platform-Weka. We also explore an approach to improve the class probability estimation of Naive Bayes Tree. We propose a greedy and recursive learning algorithm, where at each step, LCL is used as the scoring function to expand the decision tree. The algorithm uses Naive Bayes created at leaves to estimate class probabilities of test samples. The whole tree encodes the posterior class probability in its structure. One benefit of improving class probability estimation is that both classification accuracy and AUC can be possibly scaled up. We call the new model LCL Tree (LCLT). Our experiments on 33 UCI sample sets show that LCLT outperforms all state-of-the-art learning models, such as Naive Bayes Tree, significantly in accurate class probability prediction measured by LCL, as well as in classification accuracy and AUC.

We use mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTEs) to represent the joint distribution in the induced networks. We consider two particular Bayesian network structures, the so-called naive Bayes and TAN, which have been successfully used as regression models when learning from complete data. We propose an iterative procedure for inducing the models, based on a variation of the data augmentation method in which the missing values of the explanatory variables are filled by simulating from their posterior distributions, while the missing values of the response variable are generated using the conditional expectation of the response given the explanatory variables. We also consider the refinement of the regression models by using variable selection and bias reduction. We illustrate through a set of experiments with various databases the performance of the proposed algorithms.

The evaluated classifiers are naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, J48 decision trees, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines (SVM). The dataset used contains 843 regions of interest (ROI) of healthy and five pathologic lung tissue patterns identified by two radiologists at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Correlation of the feature space composed of 39 texture attributes is studied. A grid search for optimal parameters is carried out for each classifier family. Two complementary metrics are used to characterize the performances of classification. These are based on McNemar's statistical tests and global accuracy. SVM reached best values for each metric and allowed a mean correct prediction rate of 88.3% with high class-specific precision on testing sets of 423 ROIs.

Development of a five-year mortality model in systemic sclerosis patients by different analytical approaches	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Systemic sclerosis; survival; Cox regression; data mining; Naive Bayes	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; COX PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS; BREAST-CANCER; FEATURE-SELECTION; UNITED-STATES; SURVIVAL; SCLERODERMA; DISEASE; DEATH; PROGNOSIS	Objective. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multiorgan disease with high mortality rates. Several clinical features have been associated with poor survival in different populations of SSc patients, but no clear and reproducible prognostic model to assess individual survival prediction in scleroderma patients has ever been developed. Methods. We used Cox regression and three data mining-based classifiers (Naive Bayes Classifier [NBC], Random Forests [RND-F] and logistic regression [Log-Reg]) to develop a robust and reproducible 5-year prognostic model. All the models were built and internally validated by means of 5-fold cross-validation on a population of 558 Italian SSc patients. Their predictive ability and capability of generalisation was then tested on an independent population of 356 patients recruited from 5 external centres and finally compared to the predictions made by two SSc domain experts on the same population. Results. The NBC outperformed the Cox-based classifier and the other data mining algorithms after internal cross-validation (area under receiving operator characteristic curve, AUROC: NBC=0.759; RND-F=0.736; Log-Reg=0.754 and Cox= 0.724). The NBC had also a remarkable and better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (e.g. Balanced accuracy, BA) than the Cox-based classifier, when tested on an independent population of SSc patients (BA: NBC=0.769, Cox=0.622). The NBC was also superior to domain experts in predicting 5-year survival in this population (AUROC=0.829 vs. AUROC=0.788 and BA=0.769 vs. BA=0.67). Conclusion. We provide a model to make consistent 5-year prognostic predictions in SSc patients. Its internal validity, as well as capability of generalisation and reduced uncertainty compared to human experts support its use at bedside.

Such abuse results in loss of workers' productivity, network congestion, security risks, and legal liabilities. To address this problem, organizations have started to adopt Internet usage policies, management training, and filtering software. Several commercial Internet filters are experiencing an increasing number of organizational adoptions. These products mainly rely on black lists, white lists, and keyword/profile matching to filter out undesired web pages. In this paper, we describe three top-ranked commercial Internet filters - CYBERSitter, Net Nanny. and CyberPatrol - and evaluate their performance in the context of an Internet abuse problem. We then propose a text mining approach to address the problem and evaluate its performance using six different classification algorithms: naive Bayes, multinominal naive Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and neural network. The evaluation results point to the perils of using commercial Internet filters on one hand, and to the prospects of using text mining on the other. The proposed text mining approach Outperforms the commercial filters. We discuss the possible reasons for the relatively poor performance of the filters and the steps that could be taken to improve their performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rodriguez, JD; Perez, A; Lozano, JA				Diego Rodriguez, Juan; Perez, Aritz; Antonio Lozano, Jose			Sensitivity Analysis of k-Fold Cross Validation in Prediction Error Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						k-fold cross validation; prediction error; error estimation; bias and variance; decomposition of the variance; sources of sensitivity; supervised classification	VARIANCE; BIAS	In the machine learning field, the performance of a classifier is usually measured in terms of prediction error. In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of k-fold cross validation.

Many researchers have shown that the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the conditional random field (CRF)-based activity classifiers work well to classify activities in comparison with the widely used nave Bayes-based activity classifier. However, it would not be an exact verdict if a nave Bayes-based activity classifier is properly smoothed. Parameter estimation plays the central role in the performance of a nave Bayes activity classifier. Data sparsity puts substantial challenges in parameter estimation because the sizes of the real-life activity datasets are relatively small. The distribution of the sensors may not be even among the activity classes. Additionally, some of the sensors would appear during testing but would not appear while training. This is called zero-frequency problems which assign zero probability of a sensor for a given activity. To prevent such estimation problems, we propose two smoothing techniques for adjusting the maximum likelihood to produce more precise probability of a sensor given an activity. We performed three experiments using three real-life activity datasets. It is observed that our proposed mechanism yields significant improvement in the accuracy of activity classification in comparison with its existing counterparts. We achieved the class accuracy ranging between 63 and 83.	[Sarkar, A. M.

In order to avoid bias in data interpretation, it would be of advantage for the data analysis to include all available data. A practical challenge in exploratory metabolomics analysis is therefore how to interpret the changes related to unidentified peaks. In this paper, we address the challenge by predicting the class membership of unknown peaks by applying and comparing multiple supervised classifiers to selected lipidomics datasets. The employed classifiers include k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), partial least squares and discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Naive Bayes methods which are known to be effective and efficient in predicting the labels for unseen data. Here, the class label predictions are sought for unidentified lipid profiles coming from high throughput global screening in Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC(TM)/MS) experimental setup. Our investigation reveals that k-NN and SVM classifiers outperform both PLS-DA and Naive Bayes classifiers. Naive Bayes classifier perform poorly among all models and this observation seems logical as lipids are highly co-regulated and do not respect Naive Bayes assumptions of features being conditionally independent given the class.

Results: The proposed graph-based approach generates a robust GSN for the training process of genetic network construction. The RVM-based ensemble model that combines AdaBoost and reduced-feature yields improved performance on large-scale learning problems with massive missing values in comparison to Naive Bayes.

Studies on Bayes classifier for condition monitoring of single point carbide tipped tool based on statistical and histogram features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision tree; Naive Bayes; Bayes Net; Statistical features; Histogram features; Tool condition monitoring	TURNING OPERATIONS; WEAR; VIBRATION; NETWORK; SYSTEM	Various methods of tool condition monitoring techniques are used to control the tool wear during machining in CNC machine tools. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is used to probe into the structural information hidden in the signals acquired. This paper discusses machine tool condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool by using Naive Bayes and Bayes Net classifiers and compares the results of histogram features with the statistical features to establish better classification among the two. The vibration signals are acquired for various tool conditions like tool-good condition, tip-breakage, etc. The effort is to bring out the better feature-classifier combine. The results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Elangovan, M.; Ramachandran, K.

Evaluation by Data Mining Techniques of Fluconazole Breakpoints Established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Comparison with Those of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)	ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article							INTERPRETIVE BREAKPOINTS; THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE; CANDIDA-INFECTIONS; DOSE/MIC RATIO; ITRACONAZOLE; ASSOCIATION; RESISTANCE; MORTALITY; M27-A2; MICS	The EUCAST and the CLSI have established different breakpoints for fluconazole and Candida spp. However, the reference methodologies employed to obtain the MICs provide similar results. The aim of this work was to apply supervised classification algorithms to analyze the clinical data used by the CLSI to establish fluconazole breakpoints for Candida infections and to compare these data with the results obtained with the data set used to set up EUCAST fluconazole breakpoints, where the MIC for detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, with a sensitivity of 87%, a false-positive rate of 8%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89. Five supervised classifiers (J48 and CART decision trees, the OneR decision rule, the naive Bayes classifier, and simple logistic regression) were used to analyze the original cohort of patients (Rex's data set), which was used to establish CLSI breakpoints, and a later cohort of candidemia (Clancy's data set), with which CLSI breakpoints were validated. The target variable was the outcome of the infections, and the predictor variable was the MIC or dose/MIC ratio. For Rex's data set, the MIC detecting failures was >8 mg/liter, and for Clancy's data set, the MIC detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, in close agreement with the EUCAST breakpoint (MIC > 4 mg/liter). The sensitivities, false-positive rates, and areas under the ROC curve obtained by means of CART, the algorithm with the best statistical results, were 52%, 18%, and 0.7, respectively, for Rex's data set and 65%, 6%, and 0.72, respectively, for Clancy's data set. In addition, the correlation between outcome and dose/MIC ratio was analyzed for Clancy's data set, where a dose/MIC ratio of > 75 was associated with successes, with a sensitivity of 93%, a false-positive rate of 29%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83. This dose/MIC ratio of > 75 was identical to that found for the cohorts used by EUCAST to establish their breakpoints ( a dose/MIC ratio of > 75, with a sensitivity of 91%, a false-positive rate of 10%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.90).

Moreover, secondary inflammation may be identified in PanCa, further complicating diagnosis. To improve the survival of patients with PanCa, a reliable test to differentiate CP from PanCa is needed. In this article, the authors describe a methylation profile of cell-free plasma DNA that distinguished CP from PanCa with >90% accuracy. METHODS: Methylation in cell-free, plasma DNA was compared among 30 samples from patients with CP, 30 samples from patients with PanCa, and 30 samples from healthy controls (N) using a microarray-mediated methylation analysis of 56 fragments in each sample (MethDet56). Statistical analysis was done by using the Fisher exact test, a naive Bayes algorithm, and 25 rounds of 5-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The MethDet56 methylation analysis technique identified 17 gene promoters as informative (8 for distinguishing N from CP and 14 for distinguishing CP from PanCa). It achieved 81.7% sensitivity and 78% specificity (P<.01) in the detection of CP (N vs CP) and 91.2% sensitivity and 90.8% specificity (P<.01) in the differential detection of PanCa (PanCa vs CP). CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggested that, among patients with pancreatic disease, the methylation profiles of inflammatory disease and cancer are different and open a new venue for the development of biomarkers for differential diagnosis. Further investigation of diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer based on methylation in cell-free, circulating DNA appears to be warranted. Cancer 2010;116:1674-80.

The number of every text feature in the source code of a module is counted and used as data for training detection models. In this paper, we prepared a naive Bayes classifier and a logistic regression model as detection models. To show the effectiveness of our approaches, we conducted experiments with five open source projects and compared them with a well-known metrics set, thereby achieving higher detection results. The results imply that large-scale text features are useful in constructing practical detection models, and measuring sophisticated metrics is not always necessary for detecting fault-prone modules.

First, eight directional search was applied in order to extract regions of interests (ROIs). Then, 3D feature extraction was performed which includes 3D connected component labeling, straightness calculation, thickness calculation, determining the middle slice, vertical and horizontal widths calculation, regularity calculation, and calculation of vertical and horizontal black pixel ratios. To make a decision for each ROI, feed forward neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), na < ve Bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR) methods were used. These methods were trained and tested via k-fold cross validation, and results were compared. To test the performance of the proposed system, 11 cases, which were taken from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, were used. ROC curves were given for all methods and 100% detection sensitivity was reached except na < ve Bayes.

J	Conway, M				Conway, Mike			Mining a corpus of biographical texts using keywords	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article								Using statistically derived keywords to characterize texts has become an important research method for digital humanists and corpus linguists in areas such as literary analysis and the exploration of genre difference. Keywords-and the associated concepts of 'keyness' and 'key-keyness'-have inspired conferences and workshops, many and varied research papers, and are central to several modern corpus processing tools. In this article, we present evidence that (at least for the task of biographical sentence classification) frequent words characterize texts better than keywords or key-keywords. Using the naive Bayes learning algorithm in conjunction with frequency-, keyword-, and key-keyword-based text representation to classify a corpus of biographical sentences, we discovered that the use of frequent words alone provided a classification accuracy better than either the keyword or key-keyword representations at a statistically significant level. This result suggests that (for the biographical sentence classification task at least) frequent words characterize texts better than keywords derived using more computationally intensive methods.

J	Poh, N; Kittler, J; Bourlai, T				Poh, Norman; Kittler, Josef; Bourlai, Thirimachos			Quality-Based Score Normalization With Device Qualitative Information for Multimodal Biometric Fusion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Multimodal biometrics; person authentication; quality-based fusion; score normalization	SENSOR INTEROPERABILITY	As biometric technology is rolled out on a larger scale, it will be a common scenario (known as cross-device matching) to have a template acquired by one biometric device used by another during testing. This requires a biometric system to work with different acquisition devices, an issue known as device interoperability. We further distinguish two subproblems, depending on whether the device identity is known or unknown. In the latter case, we show that the device information can be probabilistically inferred given quality measures (e.g., image resolution) derived from the raw biometric data. By keeping the template unchanged, cross-device matching can result in significant degradation in performance. We propose to minimize this degradation by using device-specific quality-dependent score normalization. In the context of fusion, after having normalized each device output independently, these outputs can be combined using the naive Bayes principal. We have compared and categorized several state-of-the-art quality-based score normalization procedures, depending on how the relationship between quality measures and score is modeled, as follows: 1) direct modeling; 2) modeling via the cluster index of quality measures; and 3) extending 2) to further include the device information (device-specific cluster index). Experimental results carried out on the Biosecure DS2 data set show that the last approach can reduce both false acceptance and false rejection rates simultaneously. Furthermore, the compounded effect of normalizing each system individually in multimodal fusion is a significant improvement in performance over the baseline fusion (without using any quality information) when the device information is given.

Nowadays, numerous attacks made by the malware pose a major security threat to computer users. Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples that need to be analyzed, named "gray list,"on a daily basis is constantly increasing. In order to help our virus analysts, quickly and efficiently pick out the malicious executables from the "gray list," an automatic and robust tool to analyze and classify the file samples is needed. In our previous work, we have developed an intelligent malware detection system (IMDS) by adopting associative classification method based on the analysis of application programming interface (API) execution calls. Despite its good performance in malware detection, IMDS still faces the following two challenges: 1) handling the large set of the generated rules to build the classifier; and 2) finding effective rules for classifying new file samples. In this paper, we first systematically evaluate the effects of the postprocessing techniques (e. g., rule pruning, rule ranking, and rule selection) of associative classification in malware detection, and then, propose an effective way, i.e., CIDCPF, to detect the malware from the "gray list." To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort on using postprocessing techniques of associative classification in malware detection. CIDCPF adapts the postprocessing techniques as follows: first applying Chi-square testing and Insignificant rule pruning followed by using Database coverage based on the Chi-square measure rule ranking mechanism and Pessimistic error estimation, and finally performing prediction by selecting the best First rule. We have incorporated the CIDCPF method into our existing IMDS system, and we call the new system as CIMDS system. Case studies are performed on the large collection of file samples obtained from the Antivirus Laboratory at Kingsoft Corporation and promising experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency and ability of detecting malware from the "gray list" of our CIMDS system outperform popular antivirus software tools, such as McAfee VirusScan and Norton AntiVirus, as well as previous data-mining-based detection systems, which employed Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and decision tree techniques. In particular, our CIMDS system can greatly reduce the number of generated rules, which makes it easy for our virus analysts to identify the useful ones.

G. Oude			Gene expression analysis in predicting the effectiveness of insect venom immunotherapy	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Insect venom allergy; venom immunotherapy gene expression; microarray assessment; prediction of treatment efficacy	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; ALLERGY	Background: Venom immunotherapy (VIT) enables longtime prevention of insect venom allergy in the majority of patients. However, in some, the risk of a resystemic reaction increases after completion of treatment. No reliable factors predicting individual lack of efficacy of VIT are currently available. Objective: To determine the use of gene expression profiles to predict the long-term effect of VIT. Methods: Whole genome gene expression analysis was performed on RNA samples from 46 patients treated with VIT divided into 3 groups: (1) patients who achieved and maintained long-term protection after VIT, (2) patients in whom insect venom allergy relapsed, and (3) patients still in the maintenance phase of VIT. Results: Among the 48.071 transcripts analyzed, 1401 showed a >2 fold difference in gene expression (P <.05); 658 genes (47%) were upregulated and 743 (53%) downregulated. Forty-three transcripts still show significant differences in expression after correction for multiple testing; 12 of 43 genes (28%) were upregulated and 31 of 43 genes (72%) downregulated. A naive Bayes prediction model demonstrated a gene expression pattern characteristic of effective VIT that was present in all patients with successful VIT but absent in all subjects with failure of VIT. The same gene expression profile was present in 88% of patients in the maintenance phase of VIT. Conclusion: Gene expression profiling might be a useful tool to assess the long-term effectiveness of VIT. The analysis of differently expressed genes confirms the involvement of immunologic pathways described previously but also indicates novel factors that might be relevant for allergen tolerance.

Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECEPs were developed specifically for structure activity modeling. ECEPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can he tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECEPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.

J	Huang, CN; Fu, TJ; Chen, HC				Huang, Chunneng; Fu, Tianjun; Chen, Hsinchun			Text-Based Video Content Classification for Online Video-Sharing Sites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION; RETRIEVAL; WEB; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; MESSAGES; FEATURES; MIXTURE	With the emergence of Web 2.0, sharing personal content, communicating ideas, and interacting with other online users in Web 2.0 communities have become daily routines for online users. User-generated data from Web 2.0 sites provide rich personal information (e.g., personal preferences and interests) and can be utilized to obtain insight about cyber communities and their social networks. Many studies have focused on leveraging user-generated information to analyze blogs and forums, but few studies have applied this approach to video-sharing Web sites. In this study, we propose a text-based framework for video content classification of online-video sharing Web sites. Different types of user-generated data (e.g., titles, descriptions, and comments) were used as proxies for online videos, and three types of text features (lexical, syntactic, and content-specific features) were extracted. Three feature-based classification techniques (C4.5, Nave Bayes, and Support Vector Machine) were used to classify videos. To evaluate the proposed framework, user-generated data from candidate videos, which were identified by searching user-given keywords on YouTube, were first collected. Then, a subset of the collected data was randomly selected and manually tagged by users as our experiment data. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was able to classify online videos based on users' interests with accuracy rates up to 87.2%, and all three types of text features contributed to discriminating videos. Support Vector Machine outperformed C4.5 and Naive Bayes techniques in our experiments. In addition, our case study further demonstrated that accurate video-classification results are very useful for identifying implicit cyber communities on video-sharing Web sites.

However, these estimates are usually modified by application of a heuristic parameter smoothing technique to avoid (over-fitted) null estimates. In this work, we advocate the reduction of the parameter domain instead of parameter smoothing. This leads to a constrained domain maximum likelihood estimation problem for which we provide an iterative algorithm that solves it optimally.

MOTIPS: Automated Motif Analysis for Predicting Targets of Modular Protein Domains	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; WIDE PREDICTION; SPECIFICITY; NETWORKS; MATRICES; SERVER; YEAST	Background: Many protein interactions, especially those involved in signaling, involve short linear motifs consisting of 5-10 amino acid residues that interact with modular protein domains such as the SH3 binding domains and the kinase catalytic domains. One straightforward way of identifying these interactions is by scanning for matches to the motif against all the sequences in a target proteome. However, predicting domain targets by motif sequence alone without considering other genomic and structural information has been shown to be lacking in accuracy. Results: We developed an efficient search algorithm to scan the target proteome for potential domain targets and to increase the accuracy of each hit by integrating a variety of pre-computed features, such as conservation, surface propensity, and disorder. The integration is performed using naive Bayes and a training set of validated experiments. Conclusions: By integrating a variety of biologically relevant features to predict domain targets, we demonstrated a notably improved prediction of modular protein domain targets. Combined with emerging high-resolution data of domain specificities, we believe that our approach can assist in the reconstruction of many signaling pathways.	[Lam, Hugo Y.

FluTyper-an algorithm for automated typing and subtyping of the influenza virus from high resolution mass spectral data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							HEMAGGLUTINATION-INHIBITION; SPECTROMETRY; IDENTIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE; ANTIGENICITY; EVOLUTION	Background: High resolution mass spectrometry has been employed to rapidly and accurately type and subtype influenza viruses. The detection of signature peptides with unique theoretical masses enables the unequivocal assignment of the type and subtype of a given strain. This analysis has, to date, required the manual inspection of mass spectra of whole virus and antigen digests. Results: A computer algorithm, FluTyper, has been designed and implemented to achieve the automated analysis of MALDI mass spectra recorded for proteolytic digests of the whole influenza virus and antigens. FluTyper incorporates the use of established signature peptides and newly developed naive Bayes classifiers for four common influenza antigens, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 1, to type and subtype the influenza virus based on their detection within proteolytic peptide mass maps. Theoretical and experimental testing of the classifiers demonstrates their applicability at protein coverage rates normally achievable in mass mapping experiments. The application of FluTyper to whole virus and antigen digests of a range of different strains of the influenza virus is demonstrated. Conclusions: FluTyper algorithm facilitates the rapid and automated typing and subtyping of the influenza virus from mass spectral data. The newly developed naive Bayes classifiers increase the confidence of influenza virus subtyping, especially where signature peptides are not detected. FluTyper is expected to popularize the use of mass spectrometry to characterize influenza viruses.	[Wong, Jason W.

Joint Parsimonious Modeling and Model Order Selection for Multivariate Gaussian Mixtures	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Bayesian information criterion (BIC); generalized Expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm; Multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM); unsupervised learning	EM ALGORITHM; ANALYZERS	Multivariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely for density estimation, model-based data clustering, and statistical classification. A difficult problem is estimating the model order, i.e., the number of mixture components, and model structure. Use of full covariance matrices, with number of parameters quadratic in the feature dimension, entails high model complexity, and thus may underestimate order, while naive Bayes mixtures may introduce model bias and lead to order overestimates. We develop a parsimonious modeling and model order and structure selection method for GMMs which allows for and optimizes over parameter tying configurations across mixture components applied to each individual parameter, including the covariates. We derive a generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm for [(Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based] penalized likelihood minimization. This, coupled with sequential model order reduction, forms our joint learning and model selection. Our method searches over a rich space of models and, consistent with minimizing BIC, achieves fine-grained matching of model complexity to the available data. We have found our method to be effective and largely robust in learning accurate model orders and parameter-tying structures for simulated ground-truth mixtures. We compared against naive Bayes and standard full-covariance GMMs for several criteria: 1) model order and structure accuracy (for synthetic data sets); 2) test set log-likelihood; 3) unsupervised classification accuracy; and 4) accuracy when class-conditional mixtures are used in a plug-in Bayes classifier. Our method, which chooses model orders intermediate between standard and naive Bayes GMMs, gives improved accuracy with respect to each of these performance measures.

In most cases, the operating temperature is modulated according to a standard waveform (e.g., ramp, sine wave). A few studies have approached the optimization of temperature profiles systematically, but these optimizations are performed offline and cannot adapt to changes in the environment. Here, we present an "active perception" strategy based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) that allows the temperature program to be optimized in real time, as the sensor reacts to its environment. We characterize the method on a ternary classification problem using a simulated sensor model subjected to additive Gaussian noise, and compare it against two "passive" approaches, a naive Bayes classifier and a nearest neighbor classifier. Finally, we validate the method in real time using a Taguchi sensor exposed to three volatile compounds. Our results show that the POMDP outperforms both passive approaches and provides a strategy to balance classification performance and sensing costs.

Evolutionary Learning of Dynamic Naive Bayesian Classifiers	JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING			English	Article						Naive Bayes classifier; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Genetic algorithms; Gesture recognition	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS	Many problems such as voice recognition, speech recognition and many other tasks have been tackled with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). These problems can also be dealt with an extension of the Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) known as Dynamic NBC (DNBC). From a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) perspective, in a DNBC at each time there is a NBC. NBCs work well in data sets with independent attributes. However, they perform poorly when the attributes are dependent or when there are one or more irrelevant attributes which are dependent of some relevant ones. Therefore, to increase this classifier accuracy, we need a method to design network structures that can capture the dependencies and get rid of irrelevant attributes. Furthermore, when we deal with dynamical processes there are temporal relations that should be considered in the network design. In order to learn automatically these models from data and increase the classifier accuracy we propose an evolutionary optimization algorithm to solve this design problem. We introduce a new encoding scheme and new genetic operators which are natural extensions of previously proposed encoding and operators for grouping problems. The design methodology is applied to solve the recognition problem for nine hand gestures. Experimental results show that the evolved network has higher average classification accuracy than the basic DNBC and a HMM.

Assessing Drug Treatment Preferences of Patients with Crohn's Disease A Conjoint Analysis	PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; INFORMED DECISION-MAKING; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATIENTS SATISFACTION; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; ADHERENCE; CARE; OUTCOMES; RECOMMENDATIONS; HETEROGENEITY	Background: Patient preference has been recognized as being of increasing importance when choosing a drug therapy for chronic conditions for which there are no cures and for which long-term treatment is needed. Objective: To quantify treatment preferences and priorities of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: This was a prospective Internet-based survey of adult participants with moderate to severe CD who were recruited through two national survey panels in the US. The survey included questions about diagnostic and treatment histories, attitudes and perceptions related to CD, and CD therapy. In a discrete-choice-based conjoint exercise, respondents selected a preferred biologic treatment option from each of 16 pairs of drug profiles that systematically varied efficacy, convenience, and product history attributes. A hierarchical Bayes probit model was utilized to estimate respondent-level 'utility scores' for each of the attribute levels. In a separate exercise, respondents also directly ranked each specific attribute. Two-tailed tests were conducted to determine statistical significance at p < 0.05. Results: A total of 252 participants were surveyed, 202 (80%) of whom were biologic naive. Mean age was 44.1 years and mean disease duration was 11.6 years. The majority (71.8%) were female. In the conjoint exercise, the three attributes of greatest importance in accounting for patients' biologic therapy preference were (greater) proportion of patients achieving lasting remission, (decreased) frequency of medication administration, and (higher) proportion of patients responding in 2 weeks. In the direct ranking exercise, the proportion of CD patients achieving lasting remission was selected as the most important attribute by the most respondents (27%), followed by the proportion of CD patients responding in 2 weeks (23%). Conclusion: Achievement of lasting remission and a rapid clinical response were the biologic treatment characteristics highly valued by respondents in this survey. It is critical that physicians provide patients with balanced information regarding the benefits and risks, convenience, and medication history of each treatment option available to them in order for patients to make informed therapy choices that reflect their personal priorities.

J	Aubanel, V; Nguyen, N				Aubanel, Vincent; Nguyen, Noel			Automatic recognition of regional phonological variation in conversational interaction	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Conversational interaction; Regional phonological and phonetic variation; Automatic speech processing; French; Sociophonetics	SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; SPEECH RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE; DIALECT; FRENCH; CONVERGENCE; ACCENT; CORPUS; SCALE	One key aspect of face-to-face communication concerns the differences that may exist between speakers' native regional accents. This paper focuses on the characterization of regional phonological variation in a conversational setting. A new, interactive task was designed in which 12 pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative game leading them to produce a number of purpose-built names. In each game, the participants were native speakers of Southern French and Northern French, respectively. How the names were produced by each of the two participants was automatically determined from the recordings using ASR techniques and a pre-established set of possible regional variants along five phonological dimensions. A naive Bayes classifier was then applied to these phonetic forms, with a view to differentiating the speakers' native regional accents. The results showed that native regional accent was correctly recognized for 79% of the speakers. These results also revealed or confirmed the existence of accent-dependent differences in how segments are phonetically realized, such as the affrication of /d/ in /di/ sequences. Our data allow us to better characterize the phonological and phonetic patterns associated with regional varieties of French on a large scale and in a natural, interactional situation.

As a result, a reliable identification of RNA binding site of a protein is important for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. Accumulated data of experimental protein-RNA interactions reveal that a RNA binding residue with different neighbor amino acids often exhibits different preferences for its RNA partners, which in turn can be assessed by the interacting interdependence of the amino acid fragment and RNA nucleotide. Results: In this work, we propose a novel classification method to identify the RNA binding sites in proteins by combining a new interacting feature (interaction propensity) with other sequence- and structure-based features. Specifically, the interaction propensity represents a binding specificity of a protein residue to the interacting RNA nucleotide by considering its two-side neighborhood in a protein residue triplet. The sequence as well as the structure-based features of the residues are combined together to discriminate the interaction propensity of amino acids with RNA. We predict RNA interacting residues in proteins by implementing a well-built random forest classifier. The experiments show that our method is able to detect the annotated protein-RNA interaction sites in a high accuracy. Our method achieves an accuracy of 84.5%, F-measure of 0.85 and AUC of 0.92 prediction of the RNA binding residues for a dataset containing 205 non-homologous RNA binding proteins, and also outperforms several existing RNA binding residue predictors, such as RNABindR, BindN, RNAProB and PPRint, and some alternative machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, naive Bayes and neural network in the comparison study. Furthermore, we provide some biological insights into the roles of sequences and structures in protein-RNA interactions by both evaluating the importance of features for their contributions in predictive accuracy and analyzing the binding patterns of interacting residues.

One of the most difficult problems to be solved by metacomputing systems is ensuring accurate and fast prediction of available performance on each resource. The main objective of the present study is to develop a new prediction model that can be used to predict the future CPU load in a distributed computing environment. This prediction model is based on a mixture of Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) via the naive Bayes assumption. Experimental results for different load time series confirm that the new prediction model performs better than other CPU load prediction methods. In addition, a comparison with previous prediction methods to evaluate their accuracy is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Classification of Protein-Protein Interaction Full-Text Documents Using Text and Citation Network Features	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Text mining; literature mining; binary classification; protein-protein interaction; citation network	RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM; GENES	We participated ( as Team 9) in the Article Classification Task of the Biocreative II.5 Challenge: binary classification of full-text documents relevant for protein-protein interaction. We used two distinct classifiers for the online and offline challenges: 1) the lightweight Variable Trigonometric Threshold (VTT) linear classifier we successfully introduced in BioCreative 2 for binary classification of abstracts and 2) a novel Naive Bayes classifier using features from the citation network of the relevant literature. We supplemented the supplied training data with full-text documents from the MIPS database. The lightweight VTT classifier was very competitive in this new full-text scenario: it was a top-performing submission in this task, taking into account the rank product of the Area Under the interpolated precision and recall Curve, Accuracy, Balanced F-Score, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient performance measures. The novel citation network classifier for the biomedical text mining domain, while not a top performing classifier in the challenge, performed above the central tendency of all submissions, and therefore indicates a promising new avenue to investigate further in bibliome informatics.

Prediction of weekly nitrate-N fluctuations in a small agricultural watershed in Illinois	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; drinking water; forecasting; genetic algorithms; naive Bayes model; nitrate-N	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RESOURCES APPLICATIONS; INPUT DETERMINATION; ALGAL BLOOMS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; SYSTEM	Agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been identified as one of the leading causes of surface water quality impairment in the United States. Such an impact is important, particularly in predominantly agricultural areas, where application of agricultural fertilizers often results in excessive nitrate levels in streams and rivers. When nitrate concentration in a public water supply reaches or exceeds drinking water standards, costly measures such as well closure or water treatment have to be considered. Thus, having accurate nitrate-N predictions is critical in making correct and timely management decisions. This study applied a set of data mining tools to predict weekly nitrate-N concentrations at a gauging station on the Sangamon River near Decatur, Illinois. The data mining tools used in this study included artificial neural networks, evolutionary polynomial regression and the naive Bayes model. The results were compared using seven forecast measures. In general, all models performed reasonably well, but not all achieved best scores in each of the measures, suggesting that a multi-tool approach is needed. In addition to improving forecast accuracy compared with previous studies, the tools described in this study demonstrated potential for application in error analysis, input selection and ranking of explanatory variables, thereby designing cost-effective monitoring networks.

Design The proposed classifier was evaluated on a test collection built from 15 systematic drug class reviews used in previous work. The FCNB classifier was constructed to classify each article as containing high-quality, drug class-specific evidence or not. Weight engineering (WE) techniques were added to reduce underestimation for Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)-based and Publication Type (PubType)-based features. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate the classifier's parameters and performance. Measurements Work saved over sampling (WSS) at no less than a 95% recall was used as the main measure of performance. Results The minimum workload reduction for a systematic review for one topic, achieved with a FCNB/WE classifier, was 8.5%; the maximum was 62.2% and the average over the 15 topics was 33.5%. This is 15.0% higher than the average workload reduction obtained using a voting perceptron-based automated citation classification system. Conclusion The FCNB/WE classifier is simple, easy to implement, and produces significantly better results in reducing the workload than previously achieved. The results support it being a useful algorithm for machine-learning- based automation of systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for disease treatment.

J	Dayanik, A				Dayanik, Aynur			Feature interval learning algorithms for classification	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification learning; Inductive learning; Feature partitioning; Adaptive feature weights	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; DECISION TREE; NAIVE BAYES; INSTANCE	This paper presents Feature Interval Learning algorithms (FIL) which represent multi-concept descriptions in the form of disjoint feature intervals. The FIL algorithms are batch supervised inductive learning algorithms and use feature projections of the training instances to represent induced classification knowledge. The concept description is learned separately for each feature and is in the form of a set of disjoint intervals. The class of an unseen instance is determined by the weighted-majority voting of the feature predictions. The basic FIL algorithm is enhanced with adaptive interval and feature weight schemes in order to handle noisy and irrelevant features. The algorithms are empirically evaluated on twelve data sets from the UCI repository and are compared with k-NN, k-NNFP, and NBC classification algorithms. The experiments demonstrate that the FIL algorithms are robust to irrelevant features and missing feature values, achieve accuracy comparable to the best of the existing algorithms with significantly less average running times.

J	Murakami, Y; Mizuguchi, K				Murakami, Yoichi; Mizuguchi, Kenji			Applying the Naive Bayes classifier with kernel density estimation to the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BINDING-SITES; SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; SEQUENCE PROFILE; DATA-BANK; DATABASE; INFORMATION; INTERFACES; NETWORKS	Motivation: The limited availability of protein structures often restricts the functional annotation of proteins and the identification of their protein-protein interaction sites. Computational methods to identify interaction sites from protein sequences alone are, therefore, required for unraveling the functions of many proteins. This article describes a new method (PSIVER) to predict interaction sites, i.e. residues binding to other proteins, in protein sequences. Only sequence features (position-specific scoring matrix and predicted accessibility) are used for training a Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and conditional probabilities of each sequence feature are estimated using a kernel density estimation method (KDE). Results: The leave-one out cross-validation of PSIVER achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.151, an F-measure of 35.3%, a precision of 30.6% and a recall of 41.6% on a non-redundant set of 186 protein sequences extracted from 105 heterodimers in the Protein Data Bank (consisting of 36 219 residues, of which 15.2% were known interface residues). Even though the dataset used for training was highly imbalanced, a randomization test demonstrated that the proposed method managed to avoid overfitting. PSIVER was also tested on 72 sequences not used in training (consisting of 18 140 residues, of which 10.6% were known interface residues), and achieved an MCC of 0.135, an F-measure of 31.5%, a precision of 25.0% and a recall of 46.5%, outperforming other publicly available servers tested on the same dataset.

Electrodes built with conductive textiles are arranged on both sides of a compressible spacer, forming a variable capacitor. The use of textiles makes unobtrusive, comfortable, lightweight, and washable sensors possible. This simplifies the goal to integrate such sensors into clothing in the future, to be simple, and fast to mount just as getting dressed. Hysteresis induced by the spacer of the sensor has been modeled with the Preisach model to reduce the measurement error from 24% to 5% on average and the maximal error from above 50% to below 10%. Standard textiles that are not specially optimized for low hysteresis can be used for designing the sensor due to the modeling. The model may also be used for other pressure or even strain sensors to reduce their hysteresis. The modeling enhances the accuracy of the textile sensor to those of commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mats. Furthermore, we used the sensor system for the classification of sitting postures in a chair. The data of nine subjects have been classified with Naive Bayes classifier, achieving an average recognition rate of 82%. We show that the textile sensor performs similarly to a commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mat for this application.

Unfortunately, the classification process can be time-consuming and users are still required to spend considerable amount of time scanning through the classified web documents to identify the ones with contents that satisfy their information needs. In solving this problem, we first introduce CorSum, an extractive single-document summarization approach, which is simple and effective in performing the summarization task, since it only relies on word similarity to generate high-quality summaries. We further enhance CorSum by considering the significance factor of sentences in documents, in addition to using word-correlation factors, for document summarization. We denote the enhanced approach CorSum-SF and use the summaries generated by CorSum-SF to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for categorizing web document summaries into predefined classes. Experimental results on the DUC-2002 and 20 Newsgroups datasets show that CorSum-SF outperforms other extractive summarization methods, and classification time (accuracy, respectively) is significantly reduced (compatible, respectively) using CorSum-SF generated summaries compared with using the entire documents. More importantly, browsing summaries, instead of entire documents, which are assigned to predefined categories, facilitates the information search process on the Web.

A combinational incremental ensemble of classifiers as a technique for predicting students' performance in distance education	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Educational data mining; Online learning algorithms; Classifiers; Voting methods	BAYESIAN NETWORKS	The ability to predict a student's performance could be useful in a great number of different ways associated with university-level distance learning. Students' marks in a few written assignments can constitute the training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm. Along with the explosive increase of data and information, incremental learning ability has become more and more important for machine learning approaches. The online algorithms try to forget irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms) Nowadays, combining classifiers is proposed as a new direction for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. Therefore a better proposal is an online ensemble of classifiers that combines an incremental version of Naive Bayes, the 1-NN and the WINNOW algorithms using the voting methodology. Among other significant conclusions it was found that the proposed algorithm is the most appropriate to be used for the construction of a software support tool.

While several computational methods are currently available for identifying miRNA genes, accurate prediction of the mature miRNA remains a challenge. Existing approaches fall short in predicting the location of mature miRNAs but also in finding the functional strand(s) of miRNA precursors. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we present a computational tool that incorporates a Naive Bayes classifier to identify mature miRNA candidates based on sequence and secondary structure information of their miRNA precursors. We take into account both positive (true mature miRNAs) and negative (same-size non-mature miRNA sequences) examples to optimize sensitivity as well as specificity. Our method can accurately predict the start position of experimentally verified mature miRNAs for both human and mouse, achieving a significantly larger (often double) performance accuracy compared with two existing methods. Moreover, the method exhibits a very high generalization performance on miRNAs from two other organisms. More importantly, our method provides direct evidence about the features of miRNA precursors which may determine the location of the mature miRNA. We find that the triplet of positions 7, 8 and 9 from the mature miRNA end towards the closest hairpin have the largest discriminatory power, are relatively conserved in terms of sequence composition (mostly contain a Uracil) and are located within or in very close proximity to the hairpin loop, suggesting the existence of a possible recognition site for Dicer and associated proteins. Conclusions: This work describes a novel algorithm for identifying the start position of mature miRNA(s) produced by miRNA precursors. Our tool has significantly better (often double) performance than two existing approaches and provides new insights about the potential use of specific sequence/structural information as recognition signals for Dicer processing.

The recurrence rate ranges from 35-50% among early stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. To date, there is no fully-validated and clinically applied prognostic gene signature for personalized treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings: From genome-wide mRNA expression profiles generated on 256 lung adenocarcinoma patients, a 12-gene signature was identified using combinatorial gene selection methods, and a risk score algorithm was developed with Naive Bayes. The 12-gene model generates significant patient stratification in the training cohort HLM & UM (n = 256; log-rank P = 6.96e-7) and two independent validation sets, MSK (n = 104; log-rank P = 9.88e-4) and DFCI (n = 82; log-rank P = 2.57e-4), using Kaplan-Meier analyses. This gene signature also stratifies stage I and IB lung adenocarcinoma patients into two distinct survival groups (log-rank P<0.04). The 12-gene risk score is more significant (hazard ratio = 4.19, 95% CI: [2.08, 8.46]) than other commonly used clinical factors except tumor stage (III vs. I) in multivariate Cox analyses. The 12-gene model is more accurate than previously published lung cancer gene signatures on the same datasets. Furthermore, this signature accurately predicts chemoresistance/chemosensitivity to Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Etoposide, Erlotinib, and Gefitinib in NCl-60 cancer cell lines (P<0.017). The identified 12 genes exhibit curated interactions with major lung cancer signaling hallmarks in functional pathway analysis. The expression patterns of the signature genes have been confirmed in RT-PCR analyses of independent tumor samples. Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrate the clinical utility of the identified gene signature in prognostic categorization. With this 12-gene risk score algorithm, early stage patients at high risk for tumor recurrence could be identified for adjuvant chemotherapy; whereas stage I and II patients at low risk could be spared the toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.

The FEATURE system developed at Stanford is an effective tool for characterizing and classifying local environments in proteins. FEATURE utilizes vectors of a fixed dimension to represent the physicochemical properties around a residue. Functional sites and non-sites are identified by classifying such vectors using the Naive Bayes classifier. In this paper, we improve the FEATURE framework in several ways so that it can be more flexible, robust and accurate. The new tool can handle vectors of a user-specified dimension and can suppress noise effectively, with little loss of important signals, by employing dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, our approach utilizes the support vector machine for a more accurate classification. According to the results of our thorough experiments, the proposed new approach outperformed the original tool by 20.13% and 13.42% with respect to true and false positive rates, respectively.

Analyzing taxonomic classification using extensible Markov models	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA	Motivation: As next generation sequencing is rapidly adding new genomes, their correct placement in the taxonomy needs verification. However, the current methods for confirming classification of a taxon or suggesting revision for a potential misplacement relies on computationally intense multi-sequence alignment followed by an iterative adjustment of the distance matrix. Due to intra-heterogeneity issues with the 16S rRNA marker, no classifier is available for sub-genus level, which could readily suggest a classification for a novel 16S rRNA sequence. Metagenomics further complicates the issue by generating fragmented 16S rRNA sequences. This article proposes a novel alignment-free method for representing the microbial profiles using extensible Markov models (EMMs) with an extended Karlin-Altschul statistical framework similar to the classic alignment paradigm. We propose a log odds (LODs) score classifier based on Gumbel difference distribution that confirms correct classifications with statistical significance qualifications and suggests revisions where necessary. Results: We tested our method by generating a sub-genus level classifier with which we re-evaluated classifications of 676 microbial organisms using the NCBI FTP database for the 16S rRNA. The results confirm current classification for all genera while ascertaining significance at 95%. Furthermore, this novel classifier isolates heterogeneity issues to a mere 12 strains while confirming classifications with significance qualification for the remaining 98%. The models require less memory than that needed by multi-sequence alignments and have better time complexity than the current methods. The classifier operates at sub-genus level, and thus outperforms the naive Bayes classifier of the RNA Database Project where much of the taxonomic analysis is available online. Finally, using information redundancy in model building, we show that the method applies to metagenomic fragment classification of 19 Escherichia coli strains.

J	Calders, T; Verwer, S				Calders, Toon; Verwer, Sicco			Three naive Bayes approaches for discrimination-free classification	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)	SEP 20-24, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN			Discrimination-aware classification; Naive Bayes; Expectation maximization		In this paper, we investigate how to modify the naive Bayes classifier in order to perform classification that is restricted to be independent with respect to a given sensitive attribute. Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.

J	Wang, G; Hao, JX; Ma, JA; Huang, LH				Wang, Gang; Hao, Jinxing; Ma, Jian; Huang, Lihua			A new approach to intrusion detection using Artificial Neural Networks and fuzzy clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Artificial Neural Networks; Fuzzy clustering	IDS	Many researches have argued that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) when compared with traditional methods. However for ANN-based IDS, detection precision, especially for low-frequent attacks, and detection stability are still needed to be enhanced. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called FC-ANN, based on ANN and fuzzy clustering, to solve the problem and help IDS achieve higher detection rate, less false positive rate and stronger stability. The general procedure of FC-ANN is as follows: firstly fuzzy clustering technique is used to generate different training subsets. Subsequently, based on different training subsets, different ANN models are trained to formulate different base models. Finally, a meta-learner, fuzzy aggregation module, is employed to aggregate these results. Experimental results on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset show that our proposed new approach, FC-ANN, outperforms BPNN and other well-known methods such as decision tree, the naive Bayes in terms of detection precision and detection stability.

J	Seo, HJ; Milanfar, P				Seo, Hae Jong; Milanfar, Peyman			Training-Free, Generic Object Detection Using Locally Adaptive Regression Kernels	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Object detection; image representation; correlation and regression analysis	BAYES DECISION RULE; CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; SIMILARITY MEASURE; IMAGE; RECOGNITION; RESEMBLANCE; FEATURES; SCENE; SHAPE	We present a generic detection/localization algorithm capable of searching for a visual object of interest without training. The proposed method operates using a single example of an object of interest to find similar matches, does not require prior knowledge (learning) about objects being sought, and does not require any preprocessing step or segmentation of a target image. Our method is based on the computation of local regression kernels as descriptors from a query, which measure the likeness of a pixel to its surroundings. Salient features are extracted from said descriptors and compared against analogous features from the target image. This comparison is done using a matrix generalization of the cosine similarity measure. We illustrate optimality properties of the algorithm using a naive-Bayes framework. The algorithm yields a scalar resemblance map, indicating the likelihood of similarity between the query and all patches in the target image. By employing nonparametric significance tests and nonmaxima suppression, we detect the presence and location of objects similar to the given query. The approach is extended to account for large variations in scale and rotation. High performance is demonstrated on several challenging data sets, indicating successful detection of objects in diverse contexts and under different imaging conditions.

Improving a SVM Meta-classifier for Text Documents by using Naive Bayes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						Meta-classification; Support Vector Machine; Naive Bayes; Text document and Performance Evaluation		Text categorization is the problem of classifying text documents into a set of predefined classes. In this paper, we investigated two approaches: a) to develop a classifier for text document based on Naive Bayes Theory and b) to integrate this classifier into a meta-classifier in order to increase the classification accuracy. The basic idea is to learn a meta-classifier to optimally select the best component classifier for each data point. The experimental results show that combining classifiers can significantly improve the classification accuracy and that our improved meta-classification strategy gives better results than each individual classifier. For Reuters2000 text documents we obtained classification accuracies up to 93.87%.

Automated processing and identification of benthic invertebrate samples	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						bioassessment; water quality; automated insect identification; bioindicators; Plecoptera	RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; SCALE	We present a visually based method for the taxonomic identification of benthic invertebrates that automates image capture, image processing, and specimen classification. The BugID system automatically positions and images specimens with minimal user input. Images are then processed with interest operators (machine-learning algorithms for locating informative visual regions) to identify informative pattern features, and this information is used to train a classifier algorithm. Naive Bayes modeling of stacked decision trees is used to determine whether a specimen is an unknown distractor (taxon not in the training data set) or one of the species in the training set. When tested on images from 9 larval stonefly taxa, BugID correctly identified 94.5% of images, even though small or damaged specimens were included in testing. When distractor taxa (10 common invertebrates not present in the training set) were included to make classification more challenging, overall accuracy decreased but generally was close to 90%. At the equal error rate (EER), 89.5% of stonefly images were correctly classified and the accuracy of nonrejected stoneflies increased to 96.4%, a result suggesting that many difficult-to-identify or poorly imaged stonefly specimens had been rejected prior to classification. BugID is the first system of its kind that allows users to select thresholds for rejection depending on the required use. Rejected images of distractor taxa or difficult specimens can be identified later by a taxonomic expert, and new taxa ultimately can be incorporated into the training set of known taxa. BugID has several advantages over other automated insect classification systems, including automated handling of specimens, the ability to isolate nontarget and novel species, and the ability to identify specimens across different stages of larval development.

To overcome the influence of the descending resolution caused by column pollution and the subsequent deterioration of column efficacy at different testing times, we constructed combined peaks by summing the peaks over a specific elution time interval Delta t. On constructing tree classifiers, both the original peaks and the combined peaks were considered. A data set of 75 samples from three grades of the same tobacco brand was used to evaluate our method. Two parameters of the random forest were optimized using out-of-bag error, and the relationship between Delta t and classification rate was investigated. Experiments show that partial least squares discriminant analysis was not suitable because of the overfitting, and the random forest with the combined features performed more accurately than Naive Bayes, support vector machines, bootstrap aggregating and the random forest using only its original features.

Gene function prediction using semantic similarity clustering and enrichment analysis in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN FUNCTION; PATTERN IDENTIFICATION; TRANSLATION INITIATION; LIFE-CYCLE; DATABASE; ONTOLOGY; ANNOTATION; PROFILES; TAXONOMY; REVEALS	Motivation: Functional genomics data provides a rich source of information that can be used in the annotation of the thousands of genes of unknown function found in most sequenced genomes. However, previous gene function prediction programs are mostly produced for relatively well-annotated organisms that often have a large amount of functional genomics data. Here, we present a novel method for predicting gene function that uses clustering of genes by semantic similarity, a naive Bayes classifier and 'enrichment analysis' to predict gene function for a genome that is less well annotated but does has a severe effect on human health, that of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Results: Predictions for the molecular function, biological process and cellular component of P.falciparum genes were created from eight different datasets with a combined prediction also being produced. The high-confidence predictions produced by the combined prediction were compared to those produced by a simple K-nearest neighbour classifier approach and were shown to improve accuracy and coverage. Finally, two case studies are described, which investigate two biological processes in more detail, that of translation initiation and invasion of the host cell.	[Tedder, Philip M.

Such situations are prevalent in business processes where events consist of communications between people, such as email messages. We examine how the accuracy of an independent task identifier, such as a classification or clustering engine, can be improved by examining the currently mined process model. First, a classification scheme based on identifying the keywords in each message is presented to provide an initial labeling. We then demonstrate how these labels can be refined by considering the likelihood that the event represents a particular task as obtained via an analysis of the current representation of the process model. This process is then repeated a number of times until the model is sufficiently refined. Results show that both keyword classification and the current process model analysis can be significantly effective on their own, and when combined have the potential to correct virtually all errors when noise is low (less than 20%), and can reduce the error rate by about 85% when noise is in the 30-40% range.

An adaptive Kalman-based Bayes estimation technique to classify locomotor activities in young and elderly adults through accelerometers	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Activity monitoring; Accelerometer; Bayes estimation; Classification; Kalman filter	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TRIAXIAL ACCELEROMETER; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; ORIENTATION; PATTERNS; WALKING; SYSTEM; INDIVIDUALS; OVERWEIGHT; GYROSCOPES	An accelerometer-based system able to classify among different locomotor activities during real life conditions is here presented, and its performance evaluated. Epochs of walking at different speeds, and with different slopes, and stair descending and ascending, are detected, segmented, and classified by using an adaptation of a naive 2D-Bayes classifier, which is updated on-line through the history of the estimated activities, in a Kalman-based scheme. The feature pair used for classification is mapped from an ensemble of 16 features extracted from the accelerometer data for each activity epoch. Two different versions of the classifier are presented to combine the multi-dimensional nature of the accelerometer data, and their results are compared in terms of correct recognition rate of the segmented activities, on two population samples of different age. The classification algorithm achieves correct classification rates higher than 90% and higher than 92%, for young and elderly adults, respectively. (c) 2010 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This has led to the application of many well-established supervised learning (SL) algorithms in an attempt to provide more accurate and automatic diagnosis class (cancer/non cancer) prediction. Virtually all research on SL addresses the task of learning to classify complete domain instances. However, in some research situations we often have to classify instances given incomplete vectors, which can affect the predictive accuracy of learned classifiers. The task of learning an accurate incomplete data classifier from instances raises a number of new issues some of which have not been properly addressed by bioinformatics research. Thus, an effective missing value estimation method is required for improving predictive accuracy. Results: The essence of the approach is the proposal that prediction using supervised learning can be improved in probabilistic terms given incomplete microarray data. This imputation approach is based on the a priori probability of each value determined from the instances at that node of a decision tree (PDT) that have specified values. The proposed approach exploits the total probability and Bayes' theorems and it has three versions. We evaluate our approach with other supervised learning techniques including C5.0, classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), linear discrimination (LD) naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) and support vector machines (SVMs), from the point of view of their effect or tolerance of incomplete test data. Eight cancer related gene expression datasets are utilized for this task. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Standard programs, such as MASCOT, provide peptide assignments for many of the spectra, including identification of PTM sites, but these results are plagued by false-positive identifications. In phosphoproteomic experiments, only a single peptide assignment is typically available to support identification of each phosphorylation site, and hence minimizing false positives is critical. Thus, tedious manual validation is often required to increase confidence in the spectral assignments. We have developed phoMSVal, an open-source platform for managing MS/MS data and automatically validating identified phosphopeptides. We tested five classification algorithms with 17 extracted features to separate correct peptide assignments from incorrect ones using over 2600 manually curated spectra. The naive Bayes algorithm was among the best classifiers with an AUC value of 97% and PPV of 97% for phosphotyrosine data. This classifier required only three features to achieve a 76% decrease in false positives as compared with MASCOT while retaining 97% of true positives. This algorithm was able to classify an independent phosphoserine/threonine data set with AUC value of 93% and PPV of 91%, demonstrating the applicability of this method for all types of phospho-MS/MS data.

One criticism raised against heuristics is the argument that complexity is hidden in the calculation of the cue order used to make predictions. We discuss ways to order cues that do not entail individual learning. Then we propose and test the thesis that when orders are learned individually, people's necessarily limited knowledge will curtail computational complexity while also achieving robustness. Using computer simulations, we compare the performance of the take-the-best heuristic with dichotomized or undichotomized cues to benchmarks such as the naive Bayes algorithm across 19 environments. Even with minute sizes of training sets, take-the-best using undichotomized cues excels. For 10 environments, we probe people's intuitions about the direction of the correlation between cues and criterion. On the basis of these intuitions, in most of the environments take-the-best achieves the level of performance that would be expected from learning cue orders from 50% of the objects in the environments. Thus, ordinary information about cues either gleaned from small training sets or intuited can support robust performance without requiring Herculean computations.

J	Li, JG; Brew, C				Li, Jianguo; Brew, Chris			Class-based approach to disambiguating Levin verbs	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article							ROLES	Lapata and Brew (Computational Linguistics, vol. 30, 2004, pp. 295-313) (hereafter LB04) obtain from untagged texts a statistical prior model that is able to generate class preferences for ambiguous Lewin (English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary Investigation, 1993, University of Chicago Press) verbs (hereafter Levin). They also show that their informative priors, incorporated into a Naive Bayes classifier deduced from hand-tagged data (HTD), can aid in verb class disambiguation. We re-analyse LB04's prior model and show that a single factor (the joint probability of class and frame) determines the predominant class for a particular verb in a particular frame. This means that the prior model cannot be sensitive to fine-grained lexical distinctions between different individual verbs falling in the same class. We replicate LB04's supervised disambiguation experiments on large-scale data, using deep parsers rather than the shallow parser of LB04. In addition, we introduce a method for training our classifier without using HTD. This relies on knowledge of Levin class memberships to move information from unambiguous to ambiguous instances of each class. We regard this system as unsupervised because it does not rely on human annotation of individual verb instances. Although our unsupervised verb class disambiguator does not match the performance of the ones that make use of HTD, it consistently outperforms the random baseline model. Our experiments also demonstrate that the informative priors derived from untagged texts help improve the performance of the classifier trained on untagged data.

J	Misaki, M; Kim, Y; Bandettini, PA; Kriegeskorte, N				Misaki, Masaya; Kim, Youn; Bandettini, Peter A.; Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus			Comparison of multivariate classifiers and response normalizations for pattern-information fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-voxel pattern analysis; decoding; classification analysis; fMRI; normalization; pattern-information analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; STATES; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; ACTIVATION	A popular method for investigating whether stimulus information is present in fMRI response patterns is to attempt to "decode" the stimuli from the response patterns with a multivariate classifier. The sensitivity for detecting the information depends on the particular classifier used. However, little is known about the relative performance of different classifiers on fMRI data. Here we compared six multivariate classifiers and investigated how the response-amplitude estimate used (beta- or t-value) and different pattern normalizations affect classification performance. The compared classifiers were a pattern-correlation classifier, a k-nearest-neighbors classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, Gaussian naive Bayes, and linear and nonlinear (radial-basis-function kernel) support vector machines. We compared these classifiers' accuracy at decoding the category of visual objects from response patterns in human early visual and inferior temporal cortex acquired in an event-related design with BOLD fMRI at 3 T using SENSE and isotropic voxels of about 2-mm width. Overall, Fisher's linear discriminant (with an optimal-shrinkage covariance estimator) and the linear support vector machine performed best. The pattern-correlation classifier often performed similarly as those two classifiers. The nonlinear classifiers never performed better and sometimes significantly worse than the linear classifiers, suggesting overfitting. Defining response patterns by t-values (or in error-standard-deviation units) rather than by beta estimates (in % signal change) to define the patterns appeared advantageous. Cross-validation by a leave-one-stimulus-pair-out method gave higher accuracies than a leave-one-run-out method, suggesting that generalization to independent runs (which more safely ensures independence of the test set) is more challenging than generalization to novel stimuli within the same category. Independent selection of fewer more visually responsive voxels tended to yield better decoding performance for all classifiers. Normalizing mean and standard deviation of the response patterns either across stimuli or across voxels had no significant effect on decoding performance. Overall our results suggest that linear decoders based on t-value patterns may perform best in the present scenario of visual object representations measured for about 60 min per subject with 3T fMRI.

Learning Graphical Models for Hypothesis Testing and Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Internatiional Conference on Accoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAR, 2008	Las Vegas, NC			Boosting; classification; graphical models; structure learning; tree distributions	BAYESIAN NETWORK CLASSIFIERS; VARIABLE SELECTION; DISTANCE MEASURES; SIGNAL; DISTRIBUTIONS	Sparse graphical models have proven to be a flexible class of multivariate probability models for approximating high-dimensional distributions. In this paper, we propose techniques to exploit this modeling ability for binary classification by discriminatively learning such models from labeled training data, i.e., using both positive and negative samples to optimize for the structures of the two models. We motivate why it is difficult to adapt existing generative methods, and propose an alternative method consisting of two parts. First, we develop a novel method to learn tree-structured graphical models which optimizes an approximation of the log-likelihood ratio. We also formulate a joint objective to learn a nested sequence of optimal forests-structured models. Second, we construct a classifier by using ideas from boosting to learn a set of discriminative trees. The final classifier can interpreted as a likelihood ratio test between two models with a larger set of pair-wise features. We use cross-validation to determine the optimal number of edges in the final model. The algorithm presented in this paper also provides a method to identify a subset of the edges that are most salient for discrimination. Experiments show that the proposed procedure outperforms generative methods such as Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and Chow-Liu as well as their boosted counterparts.	[Tan, Vincent Y.

It is not easy to collect data, utilize any type of algorithm and build a permanent model at once. We have conducted a study in a large telecommunications company in Turkey to employ a software measurement program and to predict pre-release defects. Based on our prior publication, we have shared our experience in terms of the project steps (i.e. challenges and opportunities). We have further introduced new techniques that improve our earlier results. Objective: In our previous work, we have built similar predictors using data representative for US software development. Our task here was to check if those predictors were specific solely to US organizations or to a broader class of software. Method: We have presented our approach and results in the form of an experience report. Specifically, we have made use of different techniques for improving the information content of the software data and the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier in the prediction model that is locally tuned for the company. We have increased the information content of the software data by using module dependency data and improved the performance by adjusting the hyper-parameter (decision threshold) of the Naive Bayes classifier. We have reported and discussed our results in terms of defect detection rates and false alarms. We also carried out a cost-benefit analysis to show that our approach can be efficiently put into practice. Results: Our general result is that general defect predictors, which exist across a wide range of software (in both US and Turkish organizations), are present. Our specific results indicate that concerning the organization subject to this study, the use of version history information along with code metrics decreased false alarms by 22%, the use of dependencies between modules further reduced false alarms by 8%, and the decision threshold optimization for the Naive Bayes classifier using code metrics and version history information further improved false alarms by 30% in comparison to a prediction using only code metrics and a default decision threshold. Conclusion: Implementing statistical techniques and machine learning on a real life scenario is a difficult yet possible task. Using simple statistical and algorithmic techniques produces an average detection rate of 88%. Although using dependency data improves our results, it is difficult to collect and analyze such data in general. Therefore, we would recommend optimizing the hyper-parameter of the proposed technique, Naive Bayes, to calibrate the defect prediction model rather than employing more complex classifiers. We also recommend that researchers who explore statistical and algorithmic methods for defect prediction should spend less time on their algorithms and more time on studying the pragmatic considerations of large organizations.

Comparing Classification Methods for Longitudinal fMRI Studies	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OBJECT RECOGNITION; NEUROIMAGING DATA; BRAIN IMAGES; PREDICTION; CLASSIFIERS; PIPELINES; SELECTION; PATTERNS; CORTEX	We compare 10 methods of classifying fMRI volumes by applying them to data from a longitudinal study of stroke recovery: adaptive Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminant; gaussian naive Bayes; support vector machines with linear, quadratic, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels; logistic regression; two novel methods based on pairs of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM); and K-nearest neighbors. All methods were tested on three binary classification tasks, and their out-of-sample classification accuracies are compared. The relative performance of the methods varies considerably across subjects and classification tasks. The best overall performers were adaptive quadratic discriminant, support vector machines with RBF kernels, and generatively trained pairs of RBMs.	[Schmah, Tanya; Zemel, Richard S.; Hinton, Geoffrey E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada; [Strother, Stephen C.] Univ Toronto, Baycrest Ctr, Rotman Res Inst, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada; [Yourganov, Grigori; Strother, Stephen C.] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada; [Small, Steven L.] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA	Schmah, T (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada.	schmah@cs.toronto.edu; gyourganov@rotman-baycrest.on.ca; zemel@cs.toronto.edu; hinton@cs.toronto.edu; small@uchicago.edu; sstrother@rotman-baycrest.on.ca			Brain Network Recovery Group through the James S.

Aligned octapeptide substrates of 498 proteases taken from the MEROPS peptidase database were used for the in silica analysis. A multiple-category naive Bayes model, trained on the two-dimensional chemical features of the substrates, was able to classify the substrates of 365 (73%) proteases and elucidate statistically significant chemical features for each of their specific substrate positions. The positional awareness of the method allows us to identify the most similar substrate positions between proteases. Our analysis reveals that proteases from different families, based on the traditional classification (aspartic, cysteine, serine, and metallo), could have substrates that differ at the cleavage site (P1-P1') but are similar away from it. Caspase-3 (cysteine protease) and granzyme B (serine protease) are previously known examples of cross-family neighbors identified by this method. To assess whether peptide substrate similarity between unrelated proteases could reliably translate into the discovery of low molecular weight synthetic inhibitors, a lead discovery strategy was tested on two other cross-family neighbors-namely cathepsin L2 and matrix metallo proteinase 9, and calpain 1 and pepsin A. For both these pairs, a naive Bayes classifier model trained on inhibitors of one protease could successfully enrich those of its neighbor from a different family and vice versa, indicating that this approach could be prospectively applied to lead discovery for a novel protease target with no known synthetic inhibitors.

J	Fagni, T; Sebastiani, F				Fagni, Tiziano; Sebastiani, Fabrizio			Selecting Negative Examples for Hierarchical Text Classification: An Experimental Comparison	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CATEGORIZATION; SYSTEM	Hierarchical text classification (HTC) approaches have recently attracted a lot of interest on the part of researchers in human language technology and machine learning, since they have been shown to bring about equal, if not better, classification accuracy with respect to their "flat" counterparts while allowing exponential time savings at both learning and classification time. A typical component of HTC methods is a "local" policy for selecting negative examples: Given a category c, its negative training examples are by default identified with the training examples that are negative for c and positive for the categories which are siblings of c in the hierarchy. However, this policy has always been taken for granted and never been subjected to careful scrutiny since first proposed 15 years ago. This article proposes a thorough experimental comparison between this policy and three other policies for the selection of negative examples in HTC contexts, one of which (BESTLOCAL(k)) is being proposed for the first time in this article. We compare these policies on the hierarchical versions of three supervised learning algorithms (boosting, support vector machines, and naive Bayes) by performing experiments on two standard TC datasets, REUTERS-21578 and RCV1-v2.

Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) is a recently developed method for engineering C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) designed to bind specific DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity in vivo. Because generation of ZFPs using OPEN requires considerable effort, a computational method for identifying the sites in any given gene that are most likely to be successfully targeted by this method is desirable. Results: Analysis of the base composition of experimentally validated ZFP target sites identified important constraints on the DNA sequence space that can be effectively targeted using OPEN. Using alternate encodings to represent ZFP target sites, we implemented Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers capable of distinguishing "active" targets, i.e., ZFP binding sites that can be targeted with a high rate of success, from those that are "inactive" or poor targets for ZFPs generated using current OPEN technologies. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation on a dataset of 135 experimentally validated ZFP target sites, the best Naive Bayes classifier, designated ZiFOpT, achieved overall accuracy of 87% and specificity(+) of 90%, with an ROC AUC of 0.89. When challenged with a completely independent test set of 140 newly validated ZFP target sites, ZiFOpT performance was comparable in terms of overall accuracy (88%) and specificity(+) (92%), but with reduced ROC AUC (0.77). Users can rank potentially active ZFP target sites using a confidence score derived from the posterior probability returned by ZiFOpT. Conclusion: ZiFOpT, a machine learning classifier trained to identify DNA sequences amenable for targeting by OPEN-generated zinc finger arrays, can guide users to target sites that are most likely to function successfully in vivo, substantially reducing the experimental effort required. ZiFOpT is freely available and incorporated in the Zinc Finger Targeter web server (http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFiT).

Predicting the start week of respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks using real time weather variables	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							INFANT BRONCHIOLITIS; AIR-POLLUTANTS; GROUP-A; RSV; HEALTH; POPULATION; POLLUTION; EPIDEMICS; UTAH	Background: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a major cause of bronchiolitis, has a large impact on the census of pediatric hospitals during outbreak seasons. Reliable prediction of the week these outbreaks will start, based on readily available data, could help pediatric hospitals better prepare for large outbreaks. Methods: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models were constructed using weather data from 1985-2008 considering only variables that are available in real time and that could be used to forecast the week in which an RSV outbreak will occur in Salt Lake County, Utah. Outbreak start dates were determined by a panel of experts using 32,509 records with ICD-9 coded RSV and bronchiolitis diagnoses from Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and clinics for the RSV seasons from 1985 to 2008. Results: NB models predicted RSV outbreaks up to 3 weeks in advance with an estimated sensitivity of up to 67% and estimated specificities as high as 94% to 100%. Temperature and wind speed were the best overall predictors, but other weather variables also showed relevance depending on how far in advance the predictions were made. The weather conditions predictive of an RSV outbreak in our study were similar to those that lead to temperature inversions in the Salt Lake Valley. Conclusions: We demonstrate that Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models based on weather data available in real time have the potential to be used as effective predictive models. These models may be able to predict the week that an RSV outbreak will occur with clinical relevance. Their clinical usefulness will be field tested during the next five years.

A high-throughput metabolic fingerprinting approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed for the detection of wound biomarkers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. High-dimensional data were generated and analysed with chemometric methods. Besides, machine learning classification algorithms constitute promising tools to decipher complex metabolic phenotypes but their application remains however scarcely reported in that research field. The present work proposes a comparative evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes in the context of metabolomic data with respect to their ability to provide a deeper insight into the metabolite network involved in the wound response. Standalone classifiers, i.e. J48 (decision tree), kNN (instance-based learner), SMO (support vector machine), multilayer perceptron and RBF network (neural networks) and Naive Bayes (probabilistic method), or combinations of classification and feature selection algorithms, such as Information Gain, RELIEF-F. Correlation Feature-based Selection and SVM-based methods, are concurrently assessed and cross-validation resampling procedures are used to avoid overfitting. This study demonstrates that machine learning methods represent valuable tools for the analysis of UPLC-TOF/MS metabolomic data. In addition, remarkable performance was achieved, while the models' stability showed the robustness and the interpretability potential. The results allowed drawing attention to both temporal and spatial metabolic patterns in the context of stress signalling and highlighting relevant biomarkers not evidenced with standard data treatment.

Methods: To explore the relationship between increased body mass and gene expression in blood, we conducted whole-genome expression profiling of whole blood from seventeen obese and seventeen well matched lean subjects. Gene expression data was analyzed at the individual gene and pathway level and a preliminary assessment of the predictive value of blood gene expression profiles in obesity was carried out. Results: Principal components analysis of whole-blood gene expression data from obese and lean subjects led to efficient separation of the two cohorts. Pathway analysis by gene-set enrichment demonstrated increased transcript levels for genes belonging to the "ribosome", "apoptosis" and "oxidative phosphorylation" pathways in the obese cohort, consistent with an altered metabolic state including increased protein synthesis, enhanced cell death from proinflammatory or lipotoxic stimuli, and increased energy demands. A subset of pathway-specific genes acted as efficient predictors of obese or lean class membership when used in Naive Bayes or logistic regression based classifiers. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the whole blood transcriptome in obesity and demonstrates that the investigation of gene expression profiles from whole blood can inform and illustrate the biological processes related to regulation of body mass. Additionally, the ability of pathway-related gene expression to predict class membership suggests the feasibility of a similar approach for identifying clinically useful blood-based predictors of weight loss success following dietary or surgical interventions.

A Naive Bayes Classifier for Intensities Using Peak Ground Velocity and Acceleration	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY; SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS; MOTION PREDICTION EQUATIONS; EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS; PARAMETERS; SELECTION; CALIFORNIA; MAGNITUDE; MODELS	A naive Bayes classifier is determined to predict intensities from peak ground velocity and acceleration. It is trained on the same dataset that was used in the study of Faenza and Michelini (2010). The naive Bayes classifier directly estimates a discrete probability distribution for the ordinal intensities.

Hybrid Bayesian network classifiers: Application to species distribution models	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Hybrid Bayesian networks; Classification; Mixtures of truncated exponentials; Conservation planning	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; TRUNCATED EXPONENTIALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPATIAL PREDICTION; PRESENCE-ABSENCE; HABITAT; MIXTURES; BIODIVERSITY; UNCERTAINTY; CONSERVATION	Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel information theoretic-interact algorithm (IT-IN) for feature selection using three machine learning algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Correlation; Relevance; Redundancy; Consistency	MUTUAL INFORMATION; RELEVANCE	The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and inconsistent features in the data-mining model results in poor predictions and high computational overhead. This paper proposes a novel information theoretic-based interact (IT-IN) algorithm, which concerns the relevance, redundancy, and consistency of the features. The proposed IT-IN algorithm is compared with existing Interact, FCBF, Relief and CFS feature selection algorithms. To evaluate the classification accuracy of IT-IN and remaining four feature selection algorithms, Naive Bayes, SVM, and ELM classifier are used for ten UCI repository datasets. The proposed IT-IN performs better than existing above algorithms in terms of number of features. The specially designed hash function is used to speed up the IT-IN algorithms and provides minimum computation time than the Interact algorithms. The result clearly reveals that the proposed feature selection algorithm improves the classification accuracy for ELM, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers. The performance of proposed IT-IN with ELM classifier is superior to other classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Deisy, C.; Koori, J.

J	Fan, LW; Poh, KL; Zhou, P				Fan, Liwei; Poh, Kim-Leng; Zhou, Peng			Partition-conditional ICA for Bayesian classification of microarray data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Independent component analysis; Microarray data; Naive Bayes; Feature extraction; Mutual information	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ECG BEAT CLASSIFICATION; NAIVE BAYES; FEATURE-SELECTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EXPRESSION DATA	Accurate classification of microarray data is very important for medical decision making. Past studies have shown that class-conditional independent component analysis (CC-ICA) is capable of improving the performance of naive Bayes classifier in microarray data analysis. However, when a microarray dataset has a small number of samples for some classes, the application of CC-ICA may become infeasible. This paper extends CC-ICA and proposes a partition-conditional independent component analysis (PC-ICA) method for naive Bayes classification of microarray data. Compared to ICA and CC-ICA, PC-ICA represents an in-between concept for feature extraction.

J	Lee, LH; Isa, D				Lee, Lam Hong; Isa, Dino			Automatically computed document dependent weighting factor facility for Naive Bayes classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Text document classification; ACDD weighting factor facility	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	The Naive Bayes classification approach has been widely implemented in real-world applications due to its simplicity and low cost training and classifying algorithm. As a trade-off to its simplicity, the Naive Bayes technique has thus been reported to be one of the poorest-performing classification methods around. We have explored and investigated the Naive Bayes classification approach and found that one of the reasons that causes the low classification accuracy is the mis-classification of documents into several "popular" categories due to the improper organization of the training dataset where the distribution of training documents among categories is highly skewed. In this work, we propose a solution to the problem addressed above, which is the addition of the Automatically Computed Document Dependent (ACDD) weighting factor facility to the Naive Bayes classifier. The ACDD weighting factors are computed for the purpose of enhancing the classification performance by adjusting the probability values based on the density of classified documents in each available category to minimize the mis-classification rate.

J	Ozyurt, O; Kose, C				Oezyurt, Oezcan; Koese, Cemal			Chat mining: Automatically determination of chat conversations' topic in Turkish text based chat mediums	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Chat mining; Topic detection; Chat conversations; Feature selection; Text classification	IDENTIFICATION	Mostly, the conversations taking place in chat mediums bear important information concerning the speakers. This information can vary in many fields such as tendencies, habits, attitudes, guilt situations, and intentions of the speakers. Therefore, analysis and processing of these conversations are of much importance. Many social and semantic inferences can be made from these conversations. In determining characteristics of conversations and analysis of conversations, subject designation can be grounded on. In this study, chat mining is chosen as an application of text mining, and a study concerning determination of subject in the Turkish text based chat conversations is conducted. In sorting the conversations, supervised learning methods are used in this study. As for classifiers, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine are used. Ninety-one percent success is achieved in determination of subject. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ordonez, C				Ordonez, Carlos			Statistical Model Computation with UDFs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						DBMS; SQL; statistical model; UDF	RELATIONAL DBMS; DATABASES; SQL	Statistical models are generally computed outside a DBMS due to their mathematical complexity. We introduce techniques to efficiently compute fundamental statistical models inside a DBMS exploiting User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Specifically, we study the computation of linear regression, PCA, clustering, and Naive Bayes. Two summary matrices on the data set are mathematically shown to be essential for all models: the linear sum of points and the quadratic sum of cross products of points. We consider two layouts for the input data set: horizontal and vertical. We first introduce efficient SQL queries to compute summary matrices and score the data set. Based on the SQL framework, we introduce UDFs that work in a single table scan: aggregate UDFs to compute summary matrices for all models and a set of primitive scalar UDFs to score data sets. Experiments compare UDFs and SQL queries (running inside the DBMS) with C++ (analyzing exported files). In general, UDFs are faster than SQL queries and not much slower than C++. Considering export times, C++ is slower than UDFs and SQL queries. Statistical models based on precomputed summary matrices are computed in a few seconds. UDFs scale linearly and only require one table scan, highlighting their efficiency.

J	Rosen, GL; Essinger, SD				Rosen, Gail L.; Essinger, Steven D.			Comparison of Statistical Methods to Classify Environmental Genomic Fragments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian classification; DNA; language models; metagenomics	NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS; SEQUENCES; SIGNATURE; DNA; METAGENOMICS; BIASES; TOOL	"Binning" (or taxonomic classification) of DNA sequence reads is an initial step to analyzing an environmental biological sample. Currently, a homology-based tool, BLAST, is one of the most commonly used tools to label DNA reads, but it is argued that BLAST will quickly lose its classification ability as the genome databases grow. In this paper, we compare the accuracies of a nave Bayes classifier (NBC) and statistical language model to BLAST for binning reads and demonstrate that NBC obtains good performance for the low cost of computational complexity. On the other hand, the back-off n-gram language model can improve accuracy when only partial training data is available (such as in-progress sequencing projects). NBC demonstrates comparable performance to BLAST and can also be optimized on partial training datasets by adjusting the word feature size. A fivefold cross validation is conducted to compare each method's accuracy for determining novel genomes at different taxonomic levels, with NBC outperforming BLAST for species-level classification but BLAST outperforming NBC for genus-level and phyla-level classification. In conclusion, the NBC is a competitive taxonomic classifier, and language models can improve performance when only partial training data is available.

Discretization as the enabling technique for the Naive Bayes and semi-Naive Bayes-based classification	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Review							MIXED-MODE DATA; CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFIERS; RULES	Current classification problems that concern data sets of large and increasing size require scalable classification algorithms. In this study, we concentrate on several scalable, linear complexity classifiers that include one of the top 10 voted data mining methods, Naive Bayes (NB), and several recently proposed semi-NB classifiers. These algorithms perform front-end discretization of the continuous features since by design they work only with nominal or discrete features. We address the lack of studies that investigate the benefits and drawbacks of discretization in the context of the subsequent classification. Our comprehensive empirical study considers 12 discretizers (two unsupervised and 10 supervised), seven classifiers (two classical NB and five semi-NB), and 16 data sets. We investigate the scalability of the discretizers and show that the fastest supervised discretizers fast class-attribute interdependency maximization (FCAIM), class-attribute interdependency maximization (CAIM), and information entropy maximization (IEM) provide discretization schemes with the highest overall quality. We show that discretization improves the classification accuracy when compared against the two classical methods, NB and Flexible Naive Bayes (FNB), executed on the raw data. The choice of the discretization algorithm impacts the significance of the improvements. The MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM methods provide statistically significant improvements, while the IEM, Class-attribute contingency coefficient (CACC), and Khiops discretizers provide moderate improvements. The most accurate classification models are generated by the Averaged one-dependence estimators (AODEsr) classifier followed by AODE and HNB (Hidden Naive Bayes). AODEsr run on data discretized with MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM provides statistically significantly better accuracies than both the classical NB methods. The worst results are obtained with the NB, FNB, and LBR (Lazy Bayes rule) classifiers. We show that although the time to build the discretization scheme could be longer than the time to train the classifier, the completion of the entire process (to discretize data, compute the classifier, and predict test instances) is often faster than the NB-based classification of the continuous instances. This is because the time to classify test instances is an important factor that is positively influenced by discretization. The biggest positive influence, both on the accuracy and the classification time, is associated with the MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM algorithms.

J	Ong, MS; Magrabi, F; Coiera, E				Ong, Mei-Sing; Magrabi, Farah; Coiera, Enrico			Automated categorisation of clinical incident reports using statistical text classification	QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article							QUALITY	Objectives To explore the feasibility of using statistical text classification techniques to automatically categorise clinical incident reports. Methods Statistical text classifiers based on Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms were trained and tested on incident reports submitted by public hospitals to identify two classes of clinical incidents: inadequate clinical handover and incorrect patient identification. Each classifier was trained on 600 reports (300 positives, 300 negatives), and tested on 372 reports (248 positives, 124 negatives). The results were evaluated using standard measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Classifier learning rates were also evaluated, using classifier accuracy against training set size. Results All classifiers performed well in categorising clinical handover and patient identification incidents. Naive Bayes attained the best performance on handover incidents, correctly identifying 86.29% of reporter-classified incidents (precision=0.84, recall=0.90, F-measure=0.87, AUC=0.93) and 91.53% of expert-classified incidents (precision=0.87, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.92, AUC=0.97). For patient identification incidents, the best results were obtained when Support Vector Machine with radial-basis function kernel was used to classify reporter-classified reports (accuracy=97.98%, precision=0.98, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.98, AUC=1.00); and when Naive Bayes was used on expert-classified reports (accuracy=95.97%, precision=0.95, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.96, AUC=0.99). A relatively small training set was found to be adequate, with most classifiers achieving an accuracy above 80% when the training set size was as small as 100 samples. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using text classification techniques to automatically categorise clinical incident reports.

However, gaps persist in knowledge of effective intervention approaches for home visiting relative to specific client risks such as parenting and psychosocial problems. The purpose of this study was to inductively create clusters from electronic health records of 484 public health nursing clients, using client characteristics and intervention data. Four clinically relevant client clusters were generated using Mixed Membership Naive Bayes methods. Fourteen distinct intervention clusters were generated using KMETIS, a graph partitioning method. The content of the intervention clusters illustrates the complexity of public health nursing practice. This study leverages current nursing documentation technology capacity to advance nursing knowledge. Future research is needed to explore relationships between client and intervention clusters and their associations with client outcomes, with the end goals of improving home visiting practice and client outcomes.

Such efforts, however, have been significantly hindered by high variability in the length and composition of the epitope sequences, making naive modeling methods difficult to apply. Results: We analyzed two benchmark datasets and found that linear B-cell epitopes possess distinctive residue conservation and position-specific residue propensities which could be exploited for epitope discrimination in silico. We developed a support vector machines (SVM) prediction model employing Bayes Feature Extraction to predict linear B-cell epitopes of diverse lengths (12- to 20-mers). The best SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 74.50% and A(ROC) of 0.84 on an independent test set and was shown to outperform existing linear B-cell epitope prediction algorithms. In addition, we applied our model to a dataset of antigenic proteins with experimentally-verified epitopes and found it to be generally effective for discriminating the epitopes from non-epitopes. Conclusion: We developed a SVM prediction model utilizing Bayes Feature Extraction and showed that it was effective in discriminating epitopes from non-epitopes in benchmark datasets and annotated antigenic proteins. A web server for predicting linear B-cell epitopes was developed and is available, together with supplementary materials, at http://www.immunopred.org/bayesb/index.html.	[Wee, Lawrence J.

We downloaded 15 million Web pages on a comprehensive range topics. Next, spoken language-like texts were selected from the downloaded Web data using the naive Bayes classifier, and typical linguistic phenomena such as fillers and pauses were added using simulation models. A language model trained by the generated data gave as high performance as the large-scale spontaneous speech corpus (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese, CSJ). By combining the generated data and CSJ, we improved word accuracy.

On average over classffier and database, data agglomeration and majority voting deliver relative improvements of unweighted accuracy by 9.0 % and 4.8 %, respectively, over single-database cross-corpus classification of arousal, while majority voting performs best for valence recognition.

A first modification is the introduction of a tuning parameter similar to the radius in radial basis function neural networks, it allows improving classification performance. The second modification is the approximation of exponential function with a piecewise-linear function that allows efficient implementation in embedded systems. Using a large set of benchmark problems, comparisons with "standard" NB and with other classifiers (such as SVM and a modified RBF) provided that modified NB learns very fast and may have a very efficient implementation providing a good accuracy.

Consequently, tool support for the person reporting the bug in the form of a recommender or verification system is desirable. In previous work we made a first step towards such a tool: we demonstrated that text mining can predict the severity of a given bug report with a reasonable accuracy given a training set of sufficient size. In this paper we report on a follow-up study where we compare four well-known text mining algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Multinomial, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines) with respect to accuracy and training set size. We discovered that for the cases under investigation (two open source systems: Eclipse and GNOME) Naive Bayes Multinomial performs superior compared to the other proposed algorithms.

In this paper the effect of using this kind of Vector on automatic classification of Persian documents is examined. In this method, preprocessed documents, extra words as well as word stems are at first found. Next, through one of the known ways, some features are extracted for each category. Then, the Representative Vector, which is made based on the elicited features, leads to some more detailed words which are better Representatives for each category. Findings of the experiments show that Precision and Recall can be increased significantly by extra words omission and addition of few words in the Representative Vectors as well as the use of a famous classification model like Naive Bayes.

It is significant to use optimal classification algorithm and fewer features to implement a fast and accurate brain computer interface system. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of five classical classifiers in different aspects including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Kappa and computational time in low-dimensional feature vectors extracted from EEG signals. The experiments show that naive Bayes is the most appropriate classifier for low dimensional feature vectors compared to k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and decision tree classifiers.

NBNN is a feature-based image classifier, and can achieve impressive classification accuracy. However, the performance of NBNN relies heavily on the large number of training samples. If using small number of training samples, the performance will degrade. The goal of this paper is to address this issue. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a robust Image-to-Class distance by local learning. We define the patch-to-class distance as the distance between the input patch to its nearest neighbor in one class, which is reconstructed in the local manifold space; and then our image-to-class distance is the sum of patch-to-class distance. Furthermore, we take advantage of large-margin metric learning framework to obtain a proper Mahalanobis metric for each class. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets: Caltech, Corel, Scene13, and Graz. The results show that our defined Image-To-Class Distance is more robust than NBNN and Optimal-NBNN, and by combining with the learned metric for each class, our method can achieve significant improvement over previous reported results on these datasets.

Accordingly, several efforts have been made in the past years to find reliable and scalable approaches to solve this problem. Unfortunately, cheating behaviors are rather difficult to detect and existing approaches generally require human supervision. In this work we introduce a novel framework to automatically detect cheating behaviors in Unreal Tournament III by exploiting supervised learning techniques. Our framework consists of three main components: (i) an extended game-server responsible for collecting the game data; (ii) a processing backend in charge of preprocessing data and detecting the cheating behaviors; (iii) an analysis frontend. We validated our framework with an experimental analysis which involved three human players, three game maps and five different supervised learning techniques, i. e., decision trees, Naive Bayes, random forest, neural networks, support vector machines. The results show that all the supervised learning techniques are able to classify correctly almost 90% of the test examples.

It is intended to detect passengers' faces because it is the most appealing characteristic of occupants in a vehicle. This work proposes the implementation of visual categorization by means of two classification methods (Naive Bayes and Multi-class SVM) that build multi-category image models using the invariant descriptors (SIFT and SURF) extracted from the images under analysis. Bag of visual words approach requires training in order to cluster invariant descriptors and learn the data distribution depending on the classification algorithm. Once the model is created, the category of every test image can be determined by querying a visual dictionary like searching a word in a text dictionary. The performance of the classifiers will be evaluated doing several comparative tests and using standard multi-category image databases. Experimental results and the conclusions are presented.

The former are often characterized by locally discriminative texture cues (e.g., instances with prominent brand names and logos), and the latter by salient global shape properties (plates, bowls, pots). We describe experiments with both types of cues, combining a template-and-deformable-parts detector to capture overall shape properties with a local feature Naive-Bayes nearest neighbor model to capture local texture properties. We base our implementation on the recently introduced Kinect sensor, which provides reliable depth estimates of indoor scenes. Depth cues provide segmentation and size constraints to our method. Depth affinity is used to modify the appearance term in a segmentation-based proposal step, and size priors are imposed on object classes to prune false positives. We address the complexity of scanning window HOG search using multi-class pruning schemes, first applying a generic object detection scheme to prune unlikely windows, and then focusing only on the most likely class per remaining window. Our method is able to handle relatively cluttered scenes involving multiple objects with varying levels of surface texture, and can efficiently employ multi-class scanning window search.

Active learning using a Variational Dirichlet Process model for pre-clustering and classification of underwater stereo imagery	2011 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	SEP 25-30, 2011	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, Robot Soc Japan (RSJ), BOSCH, HONDA, KUKA, SRI Int, ABB, Willow Garage, ALDEBARAN, Google, INTUITIVE Surg, SCHUNK, IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES), Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE), New Technol Fdn (NTF), IEEE Robot & Automat Soc (RAS), Inst Control, Robto & Syst (ICROS)			SURFACE-TOPOGRAPHY; SCALE	This paper demonstrates an implementation of pool-based active learning through uncertainty sampling using a Variational Dirichlet Process (VDP) model. The VDP is used for both pre-clustering and classification, and is extended to incorporate fixed labels from an oracle (human annotator). Three different uncertainty sampling techniques are explored least confident sampling, margin sampling and entropy based sampling. Clustering with the VDP is done in a completely unsupervised manner, without the need to specify the number of clusters. This appears particularly useful in improving the results when there are only few labelled samples, or if the cost of labelling is high. Results are shown for a toy dataset and the performance is compared to similar implementations using an Expectation Maximisation model (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier (NB). The VDP active learning framework is tested on a stereo image dataset obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle that covers several linear kilometres and consists of thousands of stereo image pairs. Our results show that combining an active learning strategy with the VDP significantly reduces the number of labelled images required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.

In this paper, the utilization of document classification to create patterns from real dialogs is proposed. Furthermore, a decision making method that results in generating proper warning signals based on the classification results is introduced. The decision making method is then applied using the best ranked algorithm with a comparative evaluation which conducted on seven document classification algorithms.

The main achievement of the approach is to accurately recognize the human activity with the minimum body sensor usage through the use of dynamic sensor collaboration. The Naive Bayes Classifier is adopted as the classification engine due to not only its easy implementation but also the advantages for multi-sensor fusion. The sensor selection is based on the real-time assignment information value of each sensor node. The platform is composed of a base station and a number of sensor nodes. The base station is used to assign the real-time information value for each sensor node, and fuse the chosen sensor data.

The formulas used for probabilistic record linkage have been recognized by some as being equivalent to the naive Bayes classifier. While this method can produce useful results, it is not difficult to improve accuracy by using one of a host of other machine learning or neural network algorithms. Even a simple single-layer perceptron tends to outperform the naive Bayes classifier-and thus traditional probabilistic record linkage methods-by a substantial margin. Furthermore, many record linkage system use simple field comparisons rather than more complex features, partially due to the limits of the probabilistic formulas they use. This paper presents an overview of probabilistic record linkage, shows how to cast it in machine learning terms, and then shows that it is equivalent to a naive Bayes classifier. It then discusses how to use more complex features than simple field comparisons, and shows how probabilistic record linkage formulas can be modified to handle this. Finally, it demonstrates a huge improvement in accuracy through the use of neural networks and higher-level matching features, compared to traditional probabilistic record linkage on a large (80,000 pair) set of labeled pairs of genealogical records used by FamilySearch.org.

Exudates are the primary sign of this disease so the proper detection of these lesions is an essential task in an automatic screening,system. In this paper, we propose a method for exudate detection which performs with high accuracy. First, we identify possible regions containing exudates using grayscale morphology. Then, we extract more than 50 descriptors for each candidate pixel to classify them. We analyzed the information content of the descriptors and selected the most relevant ones. The selected features are used to train a boosted naive Bayes classifier. We tested this approach on the publicly available DiaretDB color fundus image database, where the proposed detector outperformed the state-of-the-art ones regarding the F-Score.

As genome-wide DNA sequencing is getting more affordable, more dense genotyping is performed and accuracy is increased. Therefore, health public services may consider the results of this approach in their preventing plans and physicians be encouraged to perform these risk tests. A web-based tool has been built for risk assessing of complex diseases and its knowledge base is currently filled with multiple sclerosis risk variants and their effect on the disease. The genetic profiling is calculated by using a Naive Bayes network, which it has been shown to provide highly accurate results as long as dense genotyping, haplotype reconstruction and several markers at a time are considered.

J	Ye, ZR; Veneziano, D; Lord, D				Ye, Zhirui; Veneziano, David; Lord, Dominique			Safety impact of Gateway Monuments	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic safety; Gateway Monuments; Empirical Bayes; Before-after study	SEVERITY	Gateway Monuments are free standing roadside structures or signage that communicate the name of a city, country or township to motorists. The placement of such monuments within state-controlled right-of-way is a relatively recent occurrence in California. As a result, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) initiated research to quantify the impacts that this type of signage may or may not have on crashes in their vicinity. To date, no specific research has examined the impact such features have on crashes. To determine whether these features impacted safety, the before-after study method using the Empirical Bayes technique was used, with reference groups and Safety Performance Functions adapted from existing studies, eliminating the need to calibrate new models. Results indicated that, on an individual basis, no deterioration in safety was observed at any monument site. When all sites were examined collectively (using two different scenarios), the calculated index of effectiveness values were 0.978 and 0.680, respectively, corresponding to 2.2% and 32.0% reductions in crashes. In addition to the EB method, naive study methods (with and without AADT taken into account) were applied to the study data. Results (crash reductions) from these methods also showed that the presence of Gateway Monuments did not have negative impact on traffic safety. However, the use of EB technique should be very careful employed when adopting reference groups from different jurisdictions, as these may affect the validity of EB results. In light of these results, Caltrans may continue to participate in the Gateway Monument Program at its discretion with the knowledge that roadway safety is not impacted by monuments.

One standard approach involves first imputing the missing values, then giving the completed data to the learning algorithm. However, this is especially problematic when the features are nominal. This work presents "classifier-based nominal imputation" (CNI), an easy-to-implement and effective nominal imputation technique that views nominal imputation as classification: it learns a classifier for each feature (that maps the other features of an instance to the predicted value of that feature), then uses that classifier to predict themissing values of that feature. Our empirical results show that learners that preprocess their incomplete training data using CNI using support vector machine or decision tree learners have significantly higher predictive accuracy than learners that (1) do not use preprocessing, (2) use baseline imputation techniques, or (3) use this CNI preprocessor with other classification algorithms. This improvement is especially apparent when the base learner is instance-based. CNI is also found helpful for other base learners, such as naive Bayes and decision tree, on incomplete nominal data.

The set of 11 diagnostic variables was used, which included, among others, number of lactation, artificial insemination (AI) season, age of inseminated cow, proportion of HF-genes in cow genotype, sex of calf from preceding calving, length of pregnancy, milk, protein and fat yield. Two conception classes were distinguished: the GOOD class, if a cow conceived after one or two AIs and the "POOR" class, if more than two AIs per conception were required. The models were characterized by capability of predicting the membership of conceptions to either class. Correctness of predictions was 83%. CART proved to be more precise in detecting conceptions of the POOR class (sensitivity) compared with predictions by NBC (P <= 0.01). Specificity was similar for both classifiers (90% and 93%). Among the variables determining conception class, calving-to-conception interval, calving interval and the difference between the mean body condition and condition at AI were the most significant variables for CART. Utilization of these classifiers, particularly of CART, may help a breeder to appropriately prepare cows for AI, thus contributing to the improved financial results of a herd.

By incorporating cognitive tools into plots and character roles, narrative-centered learning environments can promote self-regulated learning in a manner that is transparent to students. In order to adapt narrative plots to explicitly support effective cognitive tool-use, narrative-centered learning environments need to be able to make early predictions about how effectively students will utilize learning resources. This paper presents results from an investigation into machine-learned models for making early predictions about students' use of a specific cognitive tool in the Crystal Island learning environment. Multiple classification models are compared and discussed. Findings suggest that support vector machine and naive Bayes models offer considerable promise for generating useful predictive models of cognitive tool use in narrative-centered learning environments.

Methods and materials: The test collection is the data used in large-scale systematic review on the topic of the dissemination strategy of health care services for elderly people. From a group of 47,274 abstracts marked by human reviewers to be included in or excluded from further screening, we randomly selected 20,000 as a training set, with the remaining 27,274 becoming a separate test set. As a machine learning algorithm we used complement naive Bayes. We tested both a global classification method, where a single classifier is trained on instances of abstracts and their classification (i.e., included or excluded), and a novel per-question classification method that trains multiple classifiers for each abstract, exploiting the specific protocol (questions) of the systematic review. For the per-question method we tested four ways of combining the results of the classifiers trained for the individual questions. As evaluation measures, we calculated precision and recall for several settings of the two methods. It is most important not to exclude any relevant documents (i.e., to attain high recall for the class of interest) but also desirable to exclude most of the non-relevant documents (i.e., to attain high precision on the class of interest) in order to reduce human workload. Results: For the global method, the highest recall was 67.8% and the highest precision was 37.9%. For the per-question method, the highest recall was 99.2%, and the highest precision was 63%. The human-machine workflow proposed in this paper achieved a recall value of 99.6%, and a precision value of 17.8%. Conclusion: The per-question method that combines classifiers following the specific protocol of the review leads to better results than the global method in terms of recall. Because neither method is efficient enough to classify abstracts reliably by itself, the technology should be applied in a semi-automatic way, with a human expert still involved. When the workflow includes one human expert and the trained automatic classifier, recall improves to an acceptable level, showing that automatic classification techniques can reduce the human workload in the process of building a systematic review.

NBC: the Naive Bayes Classification tool webserver for taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							COMMUNITY	Motivation: Datasets from high-throughput sequencing technologies have yielded a vast amount of data about organisms in environmental samples. Yet, it is still a challenge to assess the exact organism content in these samples because the task of taxonomic classification is too computationally complex to annotate all reads in a dataset. An easy-to-use webserver is needed to process these reads. While many methods exist, only a few are publicly available on webservers, and out of those, most do not annotate all reads. Results: We introduce a webserver that implements the naive Bayes classifier (NBC) to classify all metagenomic reads to their best taxonomic match. Results indicate that NBC can assign next-generation sequencing reads to their taxonomic classification and can find significant populations of genera that other classifiers may miss.

Serum biomarker profiles as diagnostic tools in lung cancer	CANCER BIOMARKERS			English	Article						Lung cancer; NSCLC; diagnosis; serum biomarkers; CT-scanning	MIGRATION INHIBITORY FACTOR; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; POTENTIAL BIOMARKER; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; POOR-PROGNOSIS; TUMOR-MARKERS; GROWTH-FACTOR; EXPRESSION; PROLACTIN; CARCINOMA	Background: Computed tomography (CT) scanning has emerged as an effective means of early detection for lung cancer. Despite marked improvement over earlier methodologies, the low level of specificity demonstrated by CT scanning has limited its clinical implementation as a screening tool. A minimally-invasive biomarker-based test that could further characterize CT-positive patients based on risk of malignancy would greatly enhance its clinical efficacy. Methods: We performed an analysis of 81 serum proteins in 92 patients diagnosed with lung cancer and 172 CT-screened control individuals. We utilize a series of bioinformatics algorithms including Metropolis-Monte Carlo, artificial neural networks, Naive Bayes, and additive logistic regression to identify multimarker panels capable of discriminating cases from controls with high levels of sensitivity and specificity in distinct training and independent validation sets. Results: A three-biomarker panel comprised of MIF, prolactin, and thrombospondin identified using the Metropolis-Monte Carlo algorithm provided the best classification with a % Sensitivity/Specificity/Accuracy of 74/90/86 in the training set and 70/93/82 in the validation set. This panel was effective in the classification of control individuals demonstrating suspicious pulmonary nodules and stage I lung cancer patients. Conclusions: The selected serum biomarker panel demonstrated a high diagnostic utility in the current study and performance characteristics which compare favorably with previous reports.

This project aims to help patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy achieve and maintain good blood glucose control. Over the course of seven years and three clinical research studies, a series of defining cases altered the research and development path. Each of these cases suggested a new, unanticipated research direction or clinical application. New AI technologies, including naive Bayes classification and support vector regression, were incorporated. New medical research into glycemic variability and blood glucose prediction was undertaken. The CBR research paradigm has provided a strong framework for medical research as well as for artificial intelligence (AI) research. This new work has the potential to positively impact the health and wellbeing of patients with diabetes. This paper shares the 4DSS project experience.

Since the documents can be annotated with multiple keywords (labels), we approach this task by applying and evaluating multi-label classification methods of supervised machine learning. We describe forming a test corpus of 1015 economic documents that we automatically classify using a tool which integrates ontology construction with text mining methods. In our experimental work, we evaluate three groups of multi-label classification approaches: transformation to single-class problems, specialized multi-label models, and hierarchical/ranking models. The classification accuracies of all tested classification models indicate that there is a potential for using all of the evaluated methods to solve this task. The results show the benefits of using complex groups of approaches which benefit from exploiting dependence between the labels. A good alternative to these approaches is also single-class naive Bayes classifiers coupled with the binary relevance transformation approach.

For this purpose, online auctioning companies assign special personnel, a large team of monitoring experts, to monitor the items posted on the web to ensure a safe and healthy online trading atmosphere. This process costs a lot for such companies and also takes a lot of time. In this research we propose a solution to this problem as an automated intelligent monitoring system which uses machine learning and data mining algorithms; in particular document classification, to monitor new items. Our results show that this approach is reliable and it reduces the monitoring cost and time.

The early detection of AD has become one of the principal focuses of research, and its diagnosis is fundamental when the disease is incipient or even prodromic, because it is at these stages when treatments are more effective. There are numerous research studies to characterise the disease in these stages, and we have used the specific research carried out by Drs. Herminia Peraita and Lina Grasso. The application of Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams, may provide a very valuable contribution both to the very research and the application of results. This article justifies using Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams to solve this type of problems and because of their great contribution to this application field. The modelling techniques used for constructing the Bayesian Network are mentioned in this article, and a mechanism for automatic learning of the model parameters is established.			josemaria.guerrero@cpiia.org	Ferrandez, Jose Manuel/C-9378-2009; Martinez-Tomas, Rafael/G-4403-2014	Ferrandez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-4613-6101; Martinez-Tomas, Rafael/0000-0003-4706-7168			Arias-Calleja M., 2009, CARMEN HERRAMIENTA S; Bottcher S.

Flexible Learning of k-Dependence Bayesian Network Classifiers	GECCO-2011: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH ANNUAL GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	13th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 12-16, 2011	Dublin, IRELAND	Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat (ACM SIGEVO)		Bayesian network classifier; estimation of distribution algorithm; flexible learning	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; ESTIMATORS	In this paper we present an extension to the classical k-dependence Bayesian network classifier algorithm. The original method intends to work for the whole continuum of Bayesian classifiers, from naive Bayes to unrestricted networks. In our experience, it performs well for low values of k. However, the algorithm tends to degrade in more complex spaces, as it greedily tries to add k dependencies to all feature nodes of the resulting net. We try to overcome this limitation by seeking for optimal values of k on a feature per feature basis. At the same time, we look for the best feature ordering. That is, we try to estimate the joint probability distribution of optimal feature orderings and individual number of dependencies. We feel that this preserves the essence of the original algorithm, while providing notable performance improvements.

This important property of data is strongly affected by such factors as the number of erroneous or missing attributes present in the dataset. In this paper we show how those factors can be handled by introducing the levels of abstraction in data definition. Our approach is especially valuable in cases where giving the precise value of an attribute is impossible for a number of reasons as for example lack of time or knowledge. Furthermore, we show that increasing the level of precision for an attribute significantly increase predictive accuracy, especially when it is done for the attribute with high information gain.

Measuring the interestingness of articles in a limited user environment	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						News filtering; Personalization; News recommendation	TRACKING	Search engines, such as Google, assign scores to news articles based on their relevance to a query. However, not all relevant articles for the query may be interesting to a user. For example, if the article is old or yields little new information, the article would be uninteresting. Relevance scores do not take into account what makes an article interesting, which would vary from user to user. Although methods such as collaborative filtering have been shown to be effective in recommendation systems, in a limited user environment, there are not enough users that would make collaborative filtering effective. A general framework, called iScore, is presented for defining and measuring the "interestingness" of articles, incorporating user-feedback. iScore addresses the various aspects of what makes an article interesting, such as topic relevance, uniqueness, freshness, source reputation, and writing style. It employs various methods, such as multiple topic tracking, online parameter selection, language models, clustering, sentiment analysis, and phrase extraction to measure these features. Due to varying reasons that users hold about why an article is interesting, an online feature selection method in naive Bayes is also used to improve recommendation results. iScore can outperform traditional IR techniques by as much as 50.7%. iScore and its components are evaluated in the news recommendation task using three datasets from Yahoo! News, actual users, and Digg. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pon, R. K.; Cardenas, A. F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Buttler, D.

Bayesian network classifiers: Beyond classification accuracy	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian networks; classifiers; supervised learning		This work proposes and discusses an approach for inducing Bayesian classifiers aimed at balancing the tradeoff between the precise probability estimates produced by time consuming unrestricted Bayesian networks and the computational efficiency of Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. The proposed approach is based on the fundamental principles of the Heuristic Search Bayesian network learning. The Markov Blanket concept, as well as a proposed "approximate Markov Blanket" are used to reduce the number of nodes that form the Bayesian network to be induced from data. Consequently, the usually high computational cost of the heuristic search learning algorithms can be lessened, while Bayesian network structures better than NB can be achieved. The resulting algorithms, called DMBC (Dynamic Markov Blanket Classifier) and A-DMBC (Approximate DMBC), are empirically assessed in twelve domains that illustrate scenarios of particular interest. The obtained results are compared with NB and Tree Augmented Network (TAN) classifiers, and confinn that both proposed algorithms can provide good classification accuracies and better probability estimates than NB and TAN, while being more computationally efficient than the widely used K2 Algorithm.

We can use this knowledge to select the most suitable learning methods and to achieve further improvements in the performance of classification systems. For the known Naive Bayes classifier, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to reconstruct the set of attributes in order to remove or debilitate dependence relations, which can reduce the accuracy of this classifier. These methods are included in the ones known as semi-naive Bayes classifiers. In the present research, we present a semi-Naive Bayes classifier that searches for dependent attributes using a filter approach. In order to prevent the number of cases of the compound attributes from being excessively high, a grouping procedure is always applied after the merging of two variables. This method attempts to group two or more cases of the new variable into a single one, in order to reduce the cardinality of the compound variables. As a result, the model presented is a competitive classifier with respect to the state of the art of semi-Naive Bayes classifiers, particularly in terms of quality of class probability estimates, but with a much lower memory space complexity.

In this paper, visual data are organized into an orientation histogram to roughly express input images by extracting and cumulating straight lines according to direction angle. In addition, behavioral data are organized into a behavioral histogram by cumulating motions performed to avoid obstacles encountered while the robot is executing specified behavioral patterns. These visual and behavioral data are utilized as input data, and the probability that a place belongs to a specific class is calculated by designating the places already learnt by the robot as categories. The naive Bayes classification method is employed, in which the probability is calculated that the input data belong to each specific category, and the category with the highest probability is then selected. The location of the robot is classified by merging the probabilities for visual and behavioral data. The experimental results are as follows. First, a comparison of behavioral patterns used by the robot to collect data about a place indicates that a rotational behavior pattern provides the best performance. Second, classification performance is more accurate with two types of input data than with a single type of data.

Experimental results have shown that ensemble of classifiers are often more accurate and robust to the effects of noisy data, and achieve lower average error rate than any of the constituent classifiers. However, inconsistencies exist in different studies and the performances of learning algorithms may vary using different performance measures and under different circumstances. Therefore, more research is needed to evaluate the performance of ensemble algorithms in software defect prediction. The goal of this paper is to assess the quality of ensemble methods in software defect prediction with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is a multicriteria decision-making approach that prioritizes decision alternatives based on pairwise comparisons. Through the application of the AHP, this study compares experimentally the performance of several popular ensemble methods using 13 different performance metrics over 10 public-domain software defect datasets from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) repository. The results indicate that ensemble methods can improve the classification results of software defect prediction in general and AdaBoost gives the best results. In addition, tree and rule based classifiers perform better in software defect prediction than other types of classifiers included in the experiment. In terms of single classifier, K-nearest-neighbor, C4.5, and Naive Bayes tree ranked higher than other classifiers.

An exploratory study of a text classification framework for Internet-based surveillance of emerging epidemics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Information storage and retrieval; Medical informatics applications; Disease notification; Disease outbreaks; Biosurveillance; Internet	AGREEMENT; HEALTHMAP; MACHINE; SUPPORT	Purpose: Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is crucial to protecting the public health of a society. Online news articles provide timely information on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. Methods: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate the classifiers. Results: Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the naive Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period. Conclusions: The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance project. We plan to examine this framework further using larger data sets and using articles in non-English languages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

As an alternative to the naive credal classifier, we present a likelihood-based approach, which extends in a novel way the naive Bayes towards imprecise probabilities, by considering any possible quantification (each one defining a naive Bayes classifier) apart from those assigning to the available data a probability below a given threshold level. Besides the available supervised data, in the likelihood evaluation we also consider the instance to be classified, for which the value of the class variable is assumed missing-at-random. We obtain a closed formula to compute the dominance according to the maximality criterion for any threshold level. As there are currently no well-established metrics for comparing credal classifiers which have considerably different determinacy, we compare the two classifiers when they have comparable determinacy, finding that in those cases they generate almost equivalent classifications.

There are two major problems of the theme acquisition; tourism activity extraction and tourism activity generalization. Therefore, this research proposes of using Naive Bayes Classifier to determine word co-occurrences between verbs and nouns with the tourism activity concept from web documents. Furthermore, this research also applies the fuzzy concept along with the imputation technique, to determine the tourism activity theme by generalizing the extracted tourism activity. The result of the tourism activity extraction shows successfully the precision and recall of 85% and 77%, respectively, with Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of the tourism activity theme is 0.5.

Classification of Postural Profiles among Mouth-breathing Children by Learning Vector Quantization	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Neural networks (computer); clinical decision support systems; posture and mouth breathing	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHEST-WALL; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS	Background: Mouth breathing is a chronic syndrome that may bring about postural changes. Finding characteristic patterns of changes occurring in the complex musculoskeletal system of mouth-breathing children has been a challenge. Learning vector quantization (LVQ) is an artificial neural network model that can be applied for this purpose. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to apply LVQ to determine the characteristic postural profiles shown by mouth-breathing children, in order to further understand abnormal posture among mouth breathers. Methods: Postural training data on 52 children (30 mouth breathers and 22 nose breathers) and postural validation data on 32 children (22 mouth breathers and 10 nose breathers) were used. The performance of LVQ and other classification models was compared in relation to self-organizing maps, back-propagation applied to multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian networks, naive Bayes, 148 decision trees, k*, and k-nearest-neighbor classifiers. Classifier accuracy was assessed by means of leave-one-out cross-validation, area under ROC curve (AUC), and inter-rater agreement (Kappa statistics). Results: By using the LVQ model, five postural profiles for mouth-breathing children could be determined. LVQ showed satisfactory results for mouth-breathing and nose-breathing classification: sensitivity and specificity rates of 0.90 and 0.95, respectively, when using the training dataset, and 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, when using the validation dataset. Conclusions: The five postural profiles for mouth-breathing children suggested by LVQ were incorporated into application software for classifying the severity of mouth breathers' abnormal posture.

J	Paoin, W				Paoin, W.			Lessons Learned from Data Mining of WHO Mortality Database	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Mortality statistics; data mining; classification; clustering; association analysis	CONVERGENCE; DIVERGENCE; SET	Objectives: The objectives of this research were to test the ability of classification algorithms to predict the cause of death in the mortality data with unknown causes, to find association between common causes of death, to identify groups of countries based on their common causes of death, and to extract knowledge gained from data mining of the World Health Organization mortality database. Methods: The WEKA software version 3.5.3 was used for classification, clustering and association analysis of the World Health Organization mortality database which contained 1,109,537 records. Three major steps were performed: Step 1 - preprocessing of data to convert all records into suitable formats for each type of analysis algorithm; Step 2 - analyzing data using the C4.5 decision tree and Naive Bayes classification algorithm, K-means clustering algorithm and Apriori association analysis algorithm; Step 3 - interpretation of results and hypothesis testing after clustering analysis. Results: Using a C4.5 decision tree classifier to predict cause of death, we obtained 440 leaf nodes that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 40.06%. Naive Bayes classification algorithm calculated probability of death from each disease that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 28.13%. K means clustering divided the data into four clusters with 189, 59, 65, 144 country-years in each cluster. A Chi-square was used to test discriminate disease differences found in each cluster which had different diseases as predominant causes of death. Apriori association analysis produced association rules of linkage among cancer of the lung, hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases. These were found in the top five leading causes of death with 99-100% confidence level. Conclusion: Classification tools produced the poorest results in predicting cause of death. Given the inadequacy of variables in the WHO database, creation of a classification model to predict specific cause of death was impossible. Clustering and association tools yielded interesting results that could be used to identify new areas of interest in mortality data analysis. This can be used in data mining analysis to help solve some quality problems in mortality data.

In this study, we use a broad selection of machine learning and statistical methods for the classification and numerical prediction of this key end point. Our data set is based on a selection of 458 small,druglike compounds with FDA approval. Using easily available tools, we calculated one- to three-dimensional physicochemical descriptors and used various methods of feature selection (best-first backward selection, correlation analysis, and decision tree analysis). We then used decision free induction (DTI), fragment-based lazy-learning (LAZAR), support vector machine classification, multilayer perceptrons, random forests, k-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes analysis to model absorption ratios and binary classification (well-absorbed and poorly absorbed compounds). Best performance for classification was seen with DTI using the chi-squared analysis interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm, yielding corrected classification rate of 88% (Matthews correlation coefficient of 75%). In numeric predictions, the multilayer perceptron performed best, achieving a root mean squared error of 25.823 and a coefficient of determination of 0.6. In line with current understanding is the importance of descriptors such as lipophilic partition coefficients (log P) and hydrogen bonding. However, we are able to highlight the utility of gravitational indices and moments of inertia, reflecting the role of structural symmetry in oral absorption. Our models are based on a diverse data set of marketed drugs representing a broad chemical space. These models therefore contribute substantially to the molecular understanding of human intestinal drug absorption and qualify for a generalized use in drug discovery and lead optimization.

Know Your Data: Understanding Implicit Usage versus Explicit Action in Video Content Classification	MULTIMEDIA ON MOBILE DEVICES 2011 AND MULTIMEDIA CONTENT ACCESS: ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Multimedia on Mobile Devices and Multimedia Content Access - Algorithms and Systems V	JAN 25-26, 2011	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, Soc Imaging Sci & Technol (IS & T)		Video; Social; Categorization; YouTube; Naive Bayes; Classification		In this paper, we present a method for video category classification using only social metadata from websites like YouTube. In place of content analysis, we utilize communicative and social contexts surrounding videos as a means to determine a categorical genre, e. g. Comedy, Music. We hypothesize that video clips belonging to different genre categories would have distinct signatures and patterns that are reflected in their collected metadata. In particular, we define and describe social metadata as usage or action to aid in classification. We trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict categories from a sample of 1,740 YouTube videos representing the top five genre categories. Using just a small number of the available metadata features, we compare the classifications produced by our Naive Bayes classifier with those provided by the uploader of that particular video. Compared to random predictions with the YouTube data (21% accurate), our classifier attained a mediocre 33% accuracy in predicting video genres. However, we found that the accuracy of our classifier significantly improves by nominal factoring of the explicit data features. By factoring the ratings of the videos in the dataset, the classifier was able to accurately predict the genres of 75% of the videos. We argue that the patterns of social activity found in the metadata are not just meaningful in their own right, but are indicative of the meaning of the shared video content. The results presented by this project represents a first step in investigating the potential meaning and significance of social metadata and its relation to the media experience.

The proposed method is an extension of the Naive Bayes text categorization model which allows obtaining good performance results in documentary databases with unbalanced training data. Experimental results allow us to conclude that the categorization method overcomes Naive Bayes and compares favorably with more sophisticated categorization methods such as support vector machines and logistic regression without increasing the use of computational resources in the training phase.			marcelo.mendoza@usm.cl; iortiz@iale.cl; vrojas@iale.cl	Mendoza, Marcelo/D-2312-2014	Mendoza, Marcelo/0000-0002-7969-6041			Ault T., 2002, J INFORM RETRIEVAL, V5, P159; Bennett P, 2000, CMUCS00155 CARN MELL; Datar M., 2004, ANN S COMP GEOM BROO; Hastie T, 2001, ELEMENTS STAT LEARNI; Indyk P., 2004, HDB DISCRETE COMPUTA, P877; Joachims Thorsten, 2006, ACM SIGKDD INT C KNO; Kolcz A., 2007, ACM SIGKDD INT C KNO; Lewis D., 1994, ANN S DOC AN INF RET; Lewis DD, 2004, J MACH LEARN RES, V5, P361; MARON ME, 1960, J ACM, V7, P216, DOI 10.1145/321033.321035; McCallum A., 1998, INT C MACH LEARN WOR; Mendoza M., 2010, IEEE INT C ADV LEARN; Perkins S., 2003, Journal of Machine Learning Research, V3, DOI 10.1162/153244303322753698; Qiang G, 2010, INT C COMP RES DEV K; Rennie J., 2003, INT C MACH LEARN WAS; Robertson S., 1992, TEXT RETR C GAITH MA; Rocchio J J, 1971, SMART RETRIEVAL SYST, P313; SALTON G, 1988, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V24, P513, DOI 10.1016/0306-4573(88)90021-0; Schneider K, 2005, INT C COMP LING INT; Sebastiani F, 2002, ACM COMPUT SURV, V34, P1, DOI 10.1145/505282.505283; Vapnik V., 1998, STAT LEARNING THEORY; Venegas R, 2007, REV SIGNOS, V40, P239, DOI 10.4067/S0718-09342007000100012; Voorhees E, 2005, TREC EXPT EVALUATION; Wilbur WJ, 2009, INFORM RETRIEVAL, V12, P509, DOI 10.1007/s10791-008-9069-5; Zhang T, 2001, INFORM RETRIEVAL, V4, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1011441423217	25	0	0	0	1	EDICIONES UNIV VALPARAISO	VALPARAISO	CASILLA 1415, VALPARAISO, 00000, CHILE	0035-0451			REV SIGNOS	Rev.

Data streams are the order of the day input mechanisms. Here is a study of GP Classifier on Data Streams. GP classification performance is compared to that of other state-of-the-art data mining and stream classification approaches. Boosting is a machine learning meta-algorithm for performing supervised learning. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier which is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing). In contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification. Boosting combines a set of weak learners to create a strong learner. It is observed that the Boosting GP approach is beating Boosting Naive Bayes classification. Hence it is found that GP is a competent algorithm for Data Stream classification.	[Kumar, Dirisala J.

We compare the predictive performance of two approaches for training a learner model with domain data. One is based on the principle of building the model solely from observable data items, such as exercises or test items. Skills modelling is not part of the training phase, but instead dealt with at later stage. The other approach incorporates a single latent skill in the model. We compare the capacity of both approaches to accurately predict item outcome (binary success or failure) from a subset of item outcomes. Three types of item-to-item models based on standard Bayesian modeling algorithms are tested: (1) Naive Bayes, (2) Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and (3) a K2 Bayesian Classifier. Their performance is compared to the widely used IRT-2PL approach which incorporates a single latent skill. The results show that the item-to-item approaches perform as well, or better than the IRT-2PL approach over 4 widely different data sets, but the differences vary considerably among the data sets. We discuss the implications of these results and the issues relating to the practical use of item-to-item models.

J	Yang, QL; Shao, JM; Scholz, M; Plant, C				Yang, Qinli; Shao, Junming; Scholz, Miklas; Plant, Claudia			Feature selection methods for characterizing and classifying adaptive Sustainable Flood Retention Basins	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainable flood risk management; Flood control; Classification; Information gain; Mutual information; Relief	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION	The European Union's Flood Directive 2007/60/EC requires member states to produce flood risk maps for all river basins and coastal areas at risk of flooding by 2013. As a result, flood risk assessments have become an urgent challenge requiring a range of rapid and effective tools and approaches. The Sustainable Flood Retention Basin (SFRB) concept has evolved to provide a rapid assessment technique for impoundments, which have a pre-defined or potential role in flood defense and diffuse pollution control. A previous version of the SFRB survey method developed by the co-author Scholz in 2006 recommends gathering of over 40 variables to characterize an SERB. Collecting all these variables is relatively time-consuming and more importantly, these variables are often correlated with each other. Therefore, the objective is to explore the correlation among these variables and find the most important variables to represent an SFRB. Three feature selection techniques (Information Gain, Mutual Information and Relief) were applied on the SFRB data set to identify the importance of the variables in terms of classification accuracy. Four benchmark classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, C4.5 Decision Tree and Naive Bayes) were subsequently used to verify the effectiveness of the classification with the selected variables and automatically identify the optimal number of variables. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach provides a simple, rapid and effective framework for variable selection and SFRB classification. Only nine important variables are sufficient to accurately classify SFRB. Finally, six typical cases were studied to verify the performance of the identified nine variables on different SFRB types. The findings provide a rapid scientific tool for SFRB assessment in practice. Moreover, the generic value of this tool allows also for its wide application in other areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In a typical scenario, multiple parties may wish to collaborate to extract interesting global information such as class labels without revealing their respective data to each other. This may be particularly useful in applications such as customer retention, medical research etc. In the proposed work, we aim to develop a global classification model based on the Naive Bayes classification scheme. The Naive Bayes classification has been used because of its simplicity, high efficiency. For privacy-preservation of the data, the concept of trusted third party with two offsets has been used. The data is first anonymized at local party end and then the aggregation and global classification is done at the trusted third party. The proposed algorithms address various types of fragmentation schemes such as horizontal, vertical and arbitrary distribution required format. The car-evaluation dataset is used to test the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.	[Keshavamurthy, B.

In addition popular algorithms such as memory-based collaborative filtering are rather ad-hoc, making principled improvements difficult. In this paper we focus on a simple recommender based on naive Bayesian techniques, and explore two different methods of modelling probabilities. We find that a Gaussian model for rating behaviour works well, and with the addition of a Gaussian-Gamma prior it maintains good performance even when data is sparse.

Text Classification on a Grid Environment	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - VECPAR 2010	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on High Performance Computing for Computational Science	JUN 22-25, 2010	Berkeley, CA			grid computing; text classification; expectation-maximization and naive bayes		The enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text as simple sequences of character strings. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims at automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class Oven the observed feature values of the documents, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. The semi-supervised learning classifier in the grid is available as a grid service, expanding the functionality of Aiuri Portal, which is a framework for a cooperative academic environment for education and research. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming by using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in learning and the classification process.

Alternatively, we restrict the number of parents of a node in a Bayesian network classifier by computing the strength of relations between this node and others. The measure method is carried out with conditional mutual information testing, for it has a property of additive decomposition of itself. Moreover, we propose a Local Score-Search algorithm (LSS) for Bayesian network classifier learning. Comparing with the fixed number algorithms, experimental results obtained have shown that LSS is more effective on average of classification error rate.

In a typical scenario, multiple parties may be wishing to collaborate to extract interesting global information such as class labels without breaching privacy. This may be particularly useful in applications such as customer retention, medical research etc. In the present work, we aim to develop a global classification model based on the Naive Bayes classification scheme. The Naive Bayes classification has been used because of its applicability in case of customer retention application such as car evaluation dataset. For privacy preservation of the data, the concept of trusted third party has been used. We have proposed algorithms and tested car evaluation dataset for vertical partitioned progressive sequential data streams.	[Keshavamurthy, B.

The traditional Naive Bayes text categorization directly uses term frequency to describe the relationship between words and categories. In deed, there are many words with high frequency do not have a close relevance with the category. To solve this problem, we introduce cloud model theory into Naive Bayes text classification and build a new feature selection system. By using numerical characteristics of cloud, we obtain more representative features. Experimental results on 20 Newsgroups show that our method can improve accuracy of text categorization remarkably.

J	Borchani, H; Larranaga, P; Bielza, C				Borchani, Hanen; Larranaga, Pedro; Bielza, Concha			Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data streams; concept drift; change detection; semi-supervised learning	CONCEPT DRIFT; CLASSIFICATION; EM	Recently, several approaches have been proposed to deal with the increasingly challenging task of mining concept-drifting data streams. However, most are based on supervised classification algorithms assuming that true labels are immediately and entirely available in the data streams. Unfortunately, such an assumption is often violated in real-world applications given that it is expensive or because it takes a long time to obtain all true labels. To deal with this problem, we propose in this paper a new semi-supervised approach for handling concept-drifting data streams containing both labeled and unlabeled instances. First, contrary to existing approaches, we monitor three possible kinds of drift: feature, conditional or dual drift. Drift detection is based on a hypothesis test comparing Kullback-Leibler divergence between old and recent data, whose distribution under the null hypothesis of coming from the same distribution is approximated via a bootstrap method. Then, if any drift occurs, a new classifier is learned from the recent data using the EM algorithm; otherwise, the current classifier is left unchanged. Our approach is so general that it can be applied to different classification models. Experimental studies, using the naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression, on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach performs well.

Lazy attribute selection: Choosing attributes at classification time	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Attribute selection; classification; lazy learning		Attribute selection is a data preprocessing step which aims at identifying relevant attributes for the target machine learning task - namely classification in this paper. In this paper, we propose a new attribute selection strategy - based on a lazy learning approach - which postpones the identification of relevant attributes until an instance is submitted for classification. Our strategy relies on the hypothesis that taking into account the attribute values of an instance to be classified may contribute to identifying the best attributes for the correct classification of that particular instance. Experimental results using the k-NN and Naive Bayes classifiers, over 40 different data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and five large data sets from the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge, show the effectiveness of delaying attribute selection to classification time. The proposed lazy technique in most cases improves the accuracy of classification, when compared with the analogous attribute selection approach performed as a data preprocessing step. We also propose a metric to estimate when a specific data set can benefit from the lazy attribute selection approach.

But online content can be misused when the information being distributed, such as radical opinions, is unsolicited or inappropriate. This study introduces a technique that combines machine learning and semantic-oriented approaches to identify radical opinions in hate group Web forums. Four types of text features (syntactic, stylistic, content-specific, and lexicon features) are extracted as text classification predictors, and three classification techniques (SVM, Naive Bayes, and Adaboost) are implemented. Postings from two hate group Web forums are collected and the preliminary results are encouraging. In addition, cross-validation indicates the proposed technique is stable and extendible to timeframes beyond that of the training data. The proposed technique can also be an effective tool for other sentiment classification problems.

Based on a feature set derived from the gray level images, including first order statistics, Haralick's features, gradient features, semi-quantitative and quantitative (pharmacokinetic modeling) dynamic parameters, we trained and compared four kinds of classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB). The aim is twofold: we try to discriminate between the relevant features as well as creating an efficient classifier using these features. The database consists of 23 radical prostatectomy patients. Using histologic sections as the gold standard, both cancers and non-malignant tissues (suspicious and clearly benign) were annotated in consensus on all MR images by two radiologists, a histopathologist and a researcher. Diagnostic performances were evaluated based on a ROC curves analysis. From the outputs of all evaluated feature selection methods on the test bench, we discriminated a restrictive set of about 20 highly informative features. Quantitative evaluation of the diagnostic performance yielded to a maximal Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Moreover, the optimal CADi scheme outperformed, in terms of specificity, our human experts in differentiating malignant from suspicious tissues, thus demonstrating its potential for assisting cancer identification in the PZ.

Significant work has been done to solve each of these problems separately. We consider the problems of lighting and expression variation together, proposing a method that accounts for both variabilities within a single model. We present a novel deformation and lighting insensitive metric to compare images, and we present a novel framework to optimize over this metric to calculate dense correspondences between images. Typical correspondence cost patterns are learned between face image pairs and a Naive Bayes classifier is applied to improve recognition accuracy. Very promising results are presented on the AR Face Database, and we note that our method can be extended to a broad set of applications.

This study examined the application of supervised learning algorithms for famine prediction. Data were collected between 2004 and 2005 from households in northern, central, eastern, and southern parts of Uganda. Data sets from the northern region were the most suitable as a learning sample for other regions. Classification performance of Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Decision tree in prediction of famine were evaluated. Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors performed better than the other methods, and Support Vector Machine produced the best Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), which can be used by policy makers to identify famine-prone households. It is recommended that satellite and household data should be used in combination to predict food security because this increases the specificity of households at risk.

The individual naive Bayes classifiers rely on different features and cues to determine a pixel's class label. Ground truth data for training and testing the classifiers is obtained from the superposition of 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device camera. The classification is supported by edge detection which indicate the presence of obstacles and sonar range data. The complementary expert decisions are aggregated by stacked generalization, behavior knowledge space or voting combination. The combined floor classifier achieves a classification accuracy of up to 0 : 9 6 true positive rate with only 0 : 0 3 false positive rate. A robust robot navigation is accomplished by arbitration among a reactive obstacle avoidance and a corridor following behavior using the robots local free space as perception.

QPC index has been used in constructive neural networks to discover non-local clusters in high-dimensional multi-class data, reduce dimensionality, aggregate features, visualize and classify data. However, for n training instances such optimization requires O(n(2)) calculations. Fast approximate version of QPC introduced here obtains results of similar quality with O(n) effort, as illustrated in a number of classification and data visualization problems.

For easy comprehensibility, rules are preferrable to another functions in the analysis of biomedical data. The aim of this work is to use a new fuzzy immune rule-based classification system for a medical diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease. In this study, fuzzy immune approach (FIA), which can be improved by ours, is a new method and firstly, it is applied to ECG dataset. The performance of the proposed approach, in terms of classification accuracy, ROC curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was compared with traditional classifier schemes: C4.5, Naive Bayes, KStar, Meta END, and ANN. The classification accuracies and AUC statistics of PEA for the data sets used are the highest among the classifiers reported on the UCI website and other classifiers used for related problems and tested by cross validation.

Building on our previous successful approach that enhanced the harmonic parts by means of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for increased accuracy, we integrate on the one hand a new source separation algorithm specifically tailored to extracting the leading voice from monaural recordings. On the other hand, we introduce Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs) as context-sensitive classifiers for this scenario, which have lately led to great success in Music Information Retrieval tasks. Through a combination of leading voice separation and BLSTM networks, as opposed to a baseline approach using Hidden Naive Bayes on the original recordings, the accuracy of simultaneous detection of vocal presence and vocalist gender on beat level is improved by up to 10% absolute. Furthermore, using this technique we achieve 91.6% accuracy in determining the gender of the predominant vocalist on song level, which is 4% absolute above our previous best result.

An example is the determination of the presence or absence of stroke from tomographic projections. Conventionally, the sensing process is inverted and a classifier is built in the reconstructed domain, which requires complete knowledge of the sensing mechanism. Alternatively, a direct data domain classifier might be constructed, but the constraints imposed by the sensing process are then lost. In this work we study the behavior of a third path we term "sensing-aware classification." Our aim is to contribute to the development of a rigorous theory for such challenging problems. To this end, we consider an abstracted binary classification problem with very high dimensional observations, a restricting sensing configuration, and unknown statistical models of noise and object which must be learned from constrained training data. We analyze the impact of different levels of prior knowledge concerning the sensing mechanism for various classification strategies. In particular we prove that the strategies based on the naive estimation of all model elements results in a classification performance asymptotically no better than guessing whereas sensing-aware, projection-based classification rules attain Bayes-optimal risk. Simulation results are also provided.	[Orten, Burkay; Ishwar, Prakash; Karl, W.

The NBNN kernel	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)	NOV 06-13, 2011	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, Toyota, Google, Microsoft Res, Siemens, Technicolor, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent, Gentex Corp, Kooaba Image Recognit, Mitsubishi Elect, Mobileye, Object Video (OV), Toshiba, Xerox, Zeiss, 2d3, SATURNUS				Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) has recently been proposed as a powerful, non-parametric approach for object classification, that manages to achieve remarkably good results thanks to the avoidance of a vector quantization step and the use of image-to-class comparisons, yielding good generalization. In this paper, we introduce a kernelized version of NBNN. This way, we can learn the classifier in a discriminative setting. Moreover, it then becomes straightforward to combine it with other kernels. In particular, we show that our NBNN kernel is complementary to standard bag-of-features based kernels, focussing on local generalization as opposed to global image composition. By combining them, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Caltech101 and 15 Scenes datasets. As a side contribution, we also investigate how to speed up the NBNN computations.

A large-margin formulation solved by linear programming is adopted to learn sparse features on the max-similarity based image representation. The margins between the training images and the query images can be directly utilized for classification by the Naive-Bayes or the K Nearest Neighbor category classifier. Balancing between efficiency and classification accuracy is the most attractive characteristic of our approach. Efficiency lies in its on-line sparsity learning algorithm and direct usage of margins, while accuracy depends on the discriminative power of selected sparse features with their weights. We test our approach using much fewer features on Caltech-101 and Scene-15 datasets and our classification results are comparable to the state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we introduce a remote health care system, which is composed of a wireless vital sensor, multiple receivers and a triage engine installed in a desktop personal computer (PC). The middleware installed in the receiver, which was developed in C++, supports reliable data handling of vital data to the ethernet port. On the other hand, the human interface of the triage engine, which was developed in JAVA, shows graphics on his/her ECG data, 3D acceleration data, body surface temperature data and behavior status in the display of the desktop PC and sends an urgent e-mail containing the display data to a pre-registered medical doctor when it detects the occurrence of an abnormal event. In the triage engine, the lethal arrhythmia detection algorithm based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis can achieve 100 % sensitivity and 99.99 % specificity, and the behavior recognition algorithm based on the combination of the nearest neighbor method and the Naive Bayes method can achieve more than 71 % classification accuracy.

By computing the power spectrum density (PSD) on segments of 10 seconds, we obtained a feature vector of 40 points, notably the PSD values in the standard frequency range (1-40 Hz), for each EEG channel. By using a naive Bayes classifier and K-fold cross-validations, we observed high correct recognition rates (CRR) at the parieto-occipital electrodes (similar to 78% during eyes open, similar to 89% during eyes closed). Notably, the eyes closed resting state elicited the highest CRRs at the occipital electrodes (92% O2, 91% O1), suggesting these biometric characteristics as the most suitable, among those investigated here, for identifying individuals.

Four human subjects undergoing presurgical brain mapping and seizure foci localization participated in this study. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded while the subjects performed simple language tasks involving semantic information processing, such as a picture naming task where subjects named pictures of objects belonging to different semantic categories. Robust high-gamma band (60-120Hz) activation was observed at the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) with a temporal sequence corresponding to speech production and perception. Furthermore, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers, two commonly used machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, were able to predict the semantic category of an object using cortical activity captured by ECoG electrodes covering the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These findings have implications for both basic neuroscience research and development of semantic-based brain-computer interface systems (BCI) that can help individuals with severe motor or communication disorders to express their intention and thoughts.

Artificial neural network and naive Bayesian classifiers were trained with data from single and multiple subjects and their ability to discriminate among three difficulty conditions was tested. When trained on data from multiple subjects, both types of classifiers poorly discriminated between the three levels. However, a novel model, the naive Bayesian classifier with a hidden node, performed nearly as well as the models trained and tested on individuals. In addition, a hierarchical Bayes model with a higher level constraint on the hidden node can further improve its performance.

In this system, four sensors are attached to the waist, chest, thigh, and side of the body. In the study we present two solutions for factors that affect the activity recognition accuracy: the calibration drift and the sensor orientation changing. The datasets used to evaluate this system were collected from 8 subjects who were asked to perform 8 scripted normal activities of daily living (ADL), three times each. The Naive Bayes classifier using multi-sensor fusion is adopted and achieves 70.88%-97.66% recognition accuracies for 1-4 sensors.

One of the most important components of the system is a Decision Support System (DSS) that has been developed in a Smart Device (SD). This component decides on patient's current health status by combining several data, which are acquired either by wearable sensors or manually inputted by the patient or retrieved from the specific database. In case no abnormal situation has been tracked, the DSS takes no action and remains deactivated until next abnormal situation pack of data are being acquired or next scheduled data being transmitted. The DSS that has been implemented is an integrated classification system with two parallel classifiers, combining an expert system (rule-based system) and a supervised classifier, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, artificial Neural Networks (aNN like the Multi-Layer Perceptron), Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. The above categorized system is useful for providing critical information about the health status of the patient.

In literature, numbers of novel feature extraction and representation methods have been proposed. However, many of them only focus on specific domain problems. In this article, we introduce a novel distance-based feature extraction method for various pattern classification problems. Specifically, two distances are extracted, which are based on (1) the distance between the data and its intra-cluster center and (2) the distance between the data and its extra-cluster centers. Experiments based on ten datasets containing different numbers of classes, samples, and dimensions are examined. The experimental results using naive Bayes, k-NN, and SVM classifiers show that concatenating the original features provided by the datasets to the distance-based features can improve classification accuracy except image-related datasets. In particular, the distance-based features are suitable for the datasets which have smaller numbers of classes, numbers of samples, and the lower dimensionality of features. Moreover, two datasets, which have similar characteristics, are further used to validate this finding. The result is consistent with the first experiment result that adding the distance-based features can improve the classification performance.

Genome-wide discovery of functional enhancers in different cell types is important for our understanding of genome function as well as human disease etiology. Results In this study, we developed an in silico approach to model the previously reported phenomenon of transcriptional pausing, accompanied by divergent transcription, at active promoters. We then used this model for large-scale prediction of non-promoter associated bidirectional expression of short transcripts. Our predictions were significantly enriched for DNase hypersensitive sites, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), and other chromatin marks associated with active rather than poised or repressed enhancers. We also detected modest bidirectional expression at binding sites of the CCCTC-factor (CTCF) genome-wide, particularly those that overlap H3K27ac. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the signature of bidirectional expression of short transcripts, learned from promoter-proximal transcriptional pausing, can be used to predict active long-range regulatory elements genome-wide, likely due in part to specific association of RNA polymerase with enhancer regions.

For instance, in text classification and information retrieval problems, we have large collections of documents. Each text is usually represented by a bag-of-words or similar representation, with a large number of features (terms). Many of these features may be irrelevant (or even detrimental) for the learning tasks. This excessive number of features carries the problem of memory usage in order to represent and deal with these collections, clearly showing the need for adequate techniques for feature representation, reduction, and selection, to both improve the classification accuracy and the memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a combined unsupervised feature discretization and feature selection technique.

As a precious outcome, a successful segmentation may lead to the improvement of automatic screening systems. Namely, the detection of the vessels helps the localization of other anatomical parts and lesions besides the vascular disorders. In this paper, we recommend a novel approach for the segmentation of the vascular system in retina images, based on Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF). We extend the optimization problem of HMRF models considering the tangent vector field of the image to enhance the connectivity of the vascular system consisting of elongated structures. To enhance the probability estimation during the solution of the Hidden Markov problem, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimator (AODE) is used instead of the commonly used naive Bayes estimators, since AODE uses a weaker assumption than total independence of features. The advantages of our method is discussed through a quantitative analysis on a publicly available database.

Statistical features are obtained from of a set of neighboring voxels without using any computation that requires hard labeling of grey matter and white matter tissues. The significance of the proposed features is quantitatively evaluated with a Naive Bayes probabilistic approach, which is used for classification, and experiments are conducted on a total of 21 subjects with FCD lesions. The experimental results indicate that using the proposed features can achieve better detection rate and lower false positive rate for the FCD lesions compared to the widely used Antel's features [1].

Our method is based on three steps : 1) We automatically label the five lumbar intervertebral discs in a sagittal MRI slice using a probabilistic model and then extract an ROI for each disc using an Active Shape Model. 2) We generate relevant intensity and texture features from each disc ROI. 3) We construct five different classifiers ( SVM, PCA+LDA, PCA+Naive Bayes, PCA+QDA, PCA+SVM) and combine them in a majority voting scheme. We perform 5-fold cross-validation experiments and achieve an accuracy of 94.85%, specificity of 95.9% and sensitivity of 92.45% for 35 clinical cases i.e. a total of 175 lumbar intervertebral discs.

In this work, we use the periodic nature of body actions to propose an action-based scheduling technique in which time-slot allocations are adapted to the periodic connectedness of on-body links. In other words, the periodicity of on-body links is employed to predict the future behaviours of links to help develop energy-efficient communications between on-body nodes, thereby elongating the network lifetime. Analysis and measurement with 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee compliant micaZ motes in a fitness environment serve as our tool to do action recognition and subsequently scheduling. The proposed technique helps us reach within less than 7% of power consumption lower bound while it does not have complexity of most channel prediction algorithms that can result in excessive process power consumption.

With a number of learning methods available, a need for their comparison arises. This paper presents initial comparison results for selected algorithms (SARSA, Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper), which are obtained based on the new multi-dimensional Farmer-Pest problem domain, which is suitable for benchmarking learning algorithms. The results show that supervised learning algorithms can be used to generate agent strategy. It appears that for simple environment reinforcement learning algorithm together with Naive Bayes learning gives best results. Although, in a difficult environment, C4.5 and Ripper are the best.

The application runs entirely on the mobile device without relying on an external server to achieve real-time performance. The estimation of the localization using camera information is accomplished by keygraph matching between previously selected sign images whose location are known in the environment. The estimation of the Wi-Fi localization is implemented using a naive Bayes classifier on the signals of existing local wireless networks. The final estimation is achieved by using the latter as a rougher estimation of the device location while no sign is detected and, when the device gets closer to a sign, by using the camera to refine the initial Wi-Fi estimation to obtain a much more precise localization. We show results obtained with our approach on a local indoor environment.

We analysed and manually annotated 4,404 e-mails from citizens to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. and compared two methods for detecting answerable e-mails: manually-created text patterns (rule-based) and machine learning-based methods. We found that the text pattern-based method gave much higher precision at 89 percent than the machine learning-based method that gave only 63 percent precision. The recall was slightly higher (66 percent) for the machine learning-based methods than for the text patterns (47 percent). We also found that 23 percent of the total e-mail flow was processed by the automatic e-mail answering system.

Therefore, clinicians seek to improve diagnostic procedures in order to reach reliable early diagnoses. In the clinical setting, coronary artery disease diagnostics is often performed in a sequential manner, where the four diagnostic steps typically consist of evaluation of (1) signs and symptoms of the disease and electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest, (2) sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, (3) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and (4) finally coronary angiography, that is considered as the "gold standard" reference method. Our study focuses on improving diagnostic and probabilistic interpretation of scintigraphic images obtained from the penultimate step. We use automatic image parameterization on multiple resolutions, based on spatial association rules. Extracted image parameters are combined into more informative composite parameters by means of principle component analysis. and finally used to build automatic classifiers with neural networks and naive Bayes learning methods. Experiments show that our approach significantly increases diagnostic accuracy, specificity and sensitivity with respect to clinical results.

The aim is to effectively and automatically classify documents to separate classes based on their topics. The classification with self-organising map was tested with three data sets and the results were then compared to those of six well known baseline methods: k-means clustering. Ward's clustering, k nearest neighbour searching, discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier and classification tree. The self-organising map proved to be yielding the highest accuracies of tested unsupervised methods in classification of the Reuters news collection and the Spanish CLEF 2003 news collection, and comparable accuracies against some of the supervised methods in all three data sets.

The study experimentally evaluates classifier testing validity if the data set used in testing has already been used in feature selection in pre-processing because of the possible classification model corruption and adaptation to test data. The experiments employ ten feature selection methods four subset selection methods (correlation-based, consistency evaluator and two types of wrappers) and six feature ranking methods (Chi-square statistic, Gain Ratio, Information Gain, OneR, ReliefF and SVM), and evaluates four classifiers (C4.5, Random forest, SVM and Naive Bayes) using data sets that were used in feature selection and absolutely independent test sets.

In this paper, an auxiliary feature method is proposed. It determines features by an existing feature selection method, and selects an auxiliary feature which can reclassify the text space aimed at the chosen features. Then the corresponding conditional probability is adjusted in order to improve classification accuracy. Illustrative examples show that the proposed meth-od indeed improves the performance of naive Bayes classifier. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we attempt to discard this assumption in order to develop a more efficient and secure scheme to perform classification with minimal disclosure of private data. Our proposed scheme is based on the work by Vaidya and Clifton[1], which uses commutative encryption to perform secure set intersection so that the parties with access to the individual partitions have no knowledge of the intersection. The evaluations presented in this paper are based on experimental results, which show that our proposed protocol scales well with large sparse datasets.

For a wireless ad hoc network, which is exposed to an open and cooperative environment, its vulnerability needs a more effective protection for the validation of information sharing, when compared to traditional networks. At present, trust gains extensive attention as it is regarded as a well-known distributed management method to perceive abnormal behavior of other nodes. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of node cooperation, especially for the sharing of trust information. Thereby, an outlier detection scheme is presented based on Naive Bayes algorithm, which is used to predict the reliability of trust information provided by other adjacent nodes. We examine the scheme based on our design criteria and attack models. Through the security analysis, Naive Bayes makes the trust-based outlier detection more suitable and reliable for distributed networks.

This paper presents a study on choosing the best model for a classifier used to group electromiographic signals into classes corresponding to the isometric flexion effort of different fingers. The signals were collected from the Flexor Digitorum Superficialis and Profundus of seven healthy subjects. Different features (root mean square RMS, average rectified value - ARV, mean and median frequency) and different classifier structures (discriminant analysis, nearest neighbor analysis, naive Bayes algorithm, neural network, fuzzy logic based algorithm) were implemented with classification success rates ranging from 50 to 99 %. The success rate of the classifiers corresponds to the ability of a numerical system to decode the physiological manifestations associated with the finger movements.

The algorithm is based on previously published signal quality metrics, with some novel additions, designed for intensive care monitoring. The algorithms have been adapted for use on short (10s) 12-lead ECGs. The metrics quantify spectral energy distribution, higher order moments and inter-channel and inter-algorithm agreement. Six metrics are produced for each channel (72 features in all) and presented to machine learning algorithms for training on the provided labeled data (Set-a) for the challenge. (Binary labels were available, indicating whether the data were acceptable or unacceptable for clinical interpretation.) We re-annotated all the data in Set-a as well as those in Set-b (the test data) using two independent annotators, and a third for adjudication of differences. Events were balanced and the 1000 subjects in Set-a were used to train the classifiers. We compared four classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron artificial neural network classifiers. The SVM and MLP provided the best (and almost equivalent) classification accuracies of 99% on the training data (Set-a) and 95% on the test data (Set-b). The binary classification results (acceptable or unacceptable) were then submitted as an entry into the PhysioNetComputing in Cardiology Competition 2011. Before the competition deadline, we scored 92.6% on the unseen test data (0.6% less than the winning entry). After improving labelling inconsistencies and errors we achieved 94.0%, the highest overall score of all competition entrants.	[Clifford, G.

In this classification problem, the instances of the dataset are divided into disjoint groups, where there is no certainty about the labels associated with individual samples. However, in each group the number of instances that belong to each class is known. We propose several versions of an EM-algorithm that learns naive Bayes models to deal with the exposed problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The obtained results show a competitive behaviour of our proposals.

The von Mises distribution is the best known angular distribution. We extend the naive Bayes classifier to the case where directional predictive variables are modeled using von Mises distributions. We find the decision surfaces induced by the classifiers and illustrate their behavior with artificial examples. Two applications to real data are included to show the potential uses of these models.

Data mining is an information extraction technique for identifying relevant information, structuring this information and subsequently providing the means to add textual information through mining the natural language. In the healthcare field, techniques summarise patient records, extract terms, ascertain new knowledge and provide diagnostics for various conditions. In this study we are interested in health information particularly with regard to the relationship between symptoms and cause in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data filtered through a discovery pattern can be used for many tasks, including mining and evaluation to the accuracy of information extraction. In this paper an approach and framework of classification analysis has been proposed for evaluating health information from personal and medical data extracted from records and documents. The information extraction, as a feature of the selection from textual data, is significant in that it uses sliding window and TF-IDF techniques for a multiword check as well as for statistical matrix term weighting and rate of recurrence. Diagnosis of a probable cardiovascular disease is done by looking at the symptoms and mined data by way of the ML algorithm. The outcome of the specific medical conditions is considered and determined the probability of cardiovascular disease in order to classify the documents and cardiovascular disease by the use of rule induction. This model generates a classifier from the patient medical data training set. Two machine learning techniques, C4.5 and Naive Bayes, have been applied where the domain concept is 'diseases'. Evaluation of the accuracy for the disease term and document classification process for our theoretical patient's symptom and diagnosis were measured precisely using recall and F-measure for comparison as well as to demonstrate the process of learning. The results show that in predicting the categories of cardiovascular disease, the C4.5 classifier has 99.8% rate of prediction accuracy (percentage correct) and performed better performance than the Naive Bayes.

But previous researches show that the skewed distribution of training collection may cause poor results in text classification. This paper presents a new method to deal with this situation. We introduce a conditional probability which takes into account both the information of the whole corpus and each category. Our proposed method performs well in the standard benchmark collections, competing with the state-of-the-art text classifiers especially for the skewed data.

The accurate colour classification is the basis of the colour management system for dyeing products. The classification method based on Naive Bayes and its improved algorithms mostly was affected by the distribution of sample space. It was unstable when samples' attributes were not independent with each other, so the prediction accuracy dropped. A novel colour classification method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) was proposed in this paper, which solved the classification problem by twice optimal-searching using the principle of nonlinear transformation and structural risk minimization. It obtained the input parameters, made the predicting error minimum by cross validation of sample data. Initially, the knowledge of CIE1976L*a*b* and HSV colour model was used in extracting features of colour and the classification model was discussed. Further, the theoretical knowledge of SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms were introduced. Finally, experiments Were done using sample data under four situations of random sampling, homogeneous sampling, stratified sampling and sampling with data having different attributes. Experimental results show that: 1) each attribute of colour feature doesn't have to meet the assumption of conditions independence; 2) the SVM-based classification method was not dependent on the distribution of the sample space, so it had better classification stability; 3) SVM had higher accuracy in classification especially while certain attribute of colour feature such as lightness had little effect on classification.

This paper proposes a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on the social tagging, which try to settle the semantic gap and the cold start problems of traditional collaborative filtering. Firstly, the communities with the similar habits are detected in the social network of the digital library. Then the candidate tags are derived from the user-book-tag correlation model. Finally, the books with highest posterior of the tags are recommended by the naive Bayes classifier. Experiments results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the collaborative filtering algorithms. And it has been a core recommendation algorithm in China Academic Digital Associative Library (CADAL).

Anomaly detection is one of intrusion detection system. Current anomaly detection is often associated with high false alarm with moderate accuracy and detection rates when it's unable to detect all types of attacks correctly. To overcome this problem, we propose an hybrid learning approach through combination of K-Means clustering and Naive Bayes classification. The proposed approach will be cluster all data into the corresponding group before applying a classifier for classification purpose. An experiment is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using KDD Cup '99 dataset. Result show that the proposed approach performed better in term of accuracy, detection rate with reasonable false alarm rate.	[Muda, Z.; Yassin, W.; Sulaiman, M. N.; Udzir, N.

We provide an overview of existing approaches to sentiment analysis including supervised (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and SVM) and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply three supervised learning methods-Naive Bayes, KNN, and a method based on the Jaccard index - to the dataset of Internet user reviews about cars and report the results. When learning a user opinion on a specific feature of a car such as speed or comfort, it turns out that training on full unprocessed reviews decreases the classification accuracy. We experiment with different approaches to preprocessing reviews in order to obtain representations that are relevant for the feature one wants to learn and show the effect of each representation on the accuracy of classification.

Opinion lexicons comprise opinion words expressing prior positive or negative sentiments. In most previous work documents are represented as bags of words and sentiment analysis has been cast a classification problem, where opinion lexicons are only used to enhance the classification models. In this paper we aim to establish the direct connection between document sentiment and opinion words in the documents. We propose two holistic approaches that consider the probability distribution of both opinion words and their polarity for analyzing document sentiment. Our extensive experiments on blogs of 12 topics show that our holistic models significantly improve baseline models using words and their polarity information separately, and is also superior to an existing approach combining both types of information.

In the living area, a fine-grained context may not only contain information about the occupancy of certain furniture, but also the posture of a user on the occupied furniture. This information is useful in the application area of home automation, where, for example, a lying user may effect a different system reaction than a sitting user. In this paper, we present an approach for determining contextual information from furniture, using capacitive proximity sensors. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of Naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees and radial basis function networks, regarding the classification of user postures. Therefore, we use our generic classification framework to visualize, train and evaluate postures with up to two persons on a couch. Based on a data set collected from multiple users, we show that this approach is robust and suitable for real-time classification.

In this work we present new features extracted from the full length protein sequence to incorporate more biological information. Features are based on the occurrence frequency of di-peptides - traditional, higher order. Naive Bayes classification along with correlation-based feature selection method is proposed to predict the subcellular location of apoptosis protein sequences. Our system makes predictions with an accuracy of 83% using Naive Bayes classification alone and 86% using Naive Bayes classification with correlation-based feature selection. This result shows that the new feature vector is promising, and helps in increasing the prediction accuracy.

The inference of a GRN from gene expression data (the GRN reverse engineering), is a challenging task that requires the exploitation of diverse mathematical and computational techniques. The DREAM conference proposes several challenges about the inference of biological networks and/or the prediction of how they are influenced by perturbations. This paper describes a method for GRN reverse engineering that the authors submitted to the 2010 DREAM challenge. The methodology is based on a combination of well known statistical methods into a Naive Bayes classifier. Despite its simplicity the approach fared fairly well when compared to other proposals on real networks.

Data mining methods such as Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree are tested. The implementation of the three algorithms showed that Naive Bayes algorithm is effectively used when the data attributes are categorized, and it can be used successfully in machine learning. The Nearest Neighbor is most suitable when the data attributes are continuous or categorized. The last algorithm tested is the Decision Tree, it is a simple predictive algorithm implemented by using simple rule methods in data classification. Each of the three algorithms can be implemented successfully and efficiently after studying the nature of database according to their; size, attributes, continuity and repetition. The success of data mining implementation depends on the completeness of database, that represented by data warehouse, that must be organized by using the important characteristics of data warehouse.

This paper presents a spam classification algorithm that utilizes both majority voting and multiple instance approaches to determine the resulting classification type. By utilizing multiple sub-classifiers, the classifier can be updated by replacing an individual sub-classifier. Furthermore, each sub-classifier represents a small fraction of a typical classifier, so it can be trained in less time with less data as well. The TREC 2007 spam corpus was used to conduct the experiments.

The image to class distance(I2CD), with simple formulation, can tackle the intra-class variation and show the state of the art results in several datasets. This paper focuses on the performance of I2CD on Unbalanced training dataset which has not been catched much attention by I2CD researchers. Under the naive bayes assumption, when the dataset is Unbalanced, I2CD is not comparable.

Among the approaches to stop spam, Naive Bayes filter is very popular. In this paper, we propose the standard Naive Bayes combining with a In-grain language model, namely TGNB model to filter spam emails. The TGNB model solves the problem of strong independence assumption of standard Naive Bayes model. Our experiment results on three public datasets indicate that the TGNB model can achieve higher spam recall and lower false positive, and even achieve better performance than support vector machine method which is state-of-the-art on all the three datasets.

Classifiers can do a good job in achieving accurate mechanism classification of glycoside hydrolases which have different physicochemical properties. This classification method is not limited by reaction conditions. In this paper, a new method is proposed to classify the catalytic mechanism of a certain glycoside hydrolase according to their sequence and structure features by using several classifiers. Through making a comparison of the classification results achieved by the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and Multi layer Perceptron (MLP)classifier, the kNN classifier is approved to be an ideal choice in classifying and predicting the catalytic mechanisms of glycoside hydrolases with various physicochemical properties.

We separate the occluded humans by considering the occlusion region as a pixel classification problem. First, we detect an isolated human using the human detector. Then we divide it into three body parts (head, torso, and legs) using the body part detector, and model the color distributions of each body part using a naive Bayes classifier. Next, we detect an occlusion region by associating the occluded humans in consecutive frames. Finally, we identify the pixels associated with a human or body parts in occlusion region by the Bayesian pixel classifier with re-weighted posterior probability, which can classify them more accurately. Experimental results show that our proposed method can classify pixels in an occlusion region and separate multiple occluded humans.

Naive Bayes (NB) and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) have been extended to PU learning algorithms (PNB and PTAN). However, they require user-specified parameter, which is difficult for the user to provide in practice. We estimate this parameter following [2] by taking the "selected completely at random" assumption and reformulate these two algorithms with this assumption. Furthermore, based on supervised algorithms Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and Full Bayesian network Classifier (FBC), we extend these algorithms to PU learning algorithms (PAODE, PHNB and PFBC respectively). Experimental results on 20 UCI datasets show that the performance of the Bayesian algorithms for PU learning are comparable to corresponding supervised ones in most cases. Additionally, PNB and PFBC are more robust against unlabeled data, and PFBC generally performs the best.

Naive Bayes classifiers fuse multiple visual cues and features generated from heterogeneous segmentation schemes that maintain separate appearance models and seeds for floor and obstacles regions. Pixel-wise classifications are aggregated across regions of homogeneous appearance to obtain a segmentation that is robust with respect to noise and outliers. The final classification utilizes fuzzy preference structures that interpret the individual classification as fuzzy preference relations which distinguish the uncertainty inherent to the classification in terms of conflict and ignorance. Ground truth data for training and testing the classifiers is obtained from the superposition of 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device camera. The results demonstrate that the classification error is substantially reduced by rejecting those queries associated with a strong degree of conflict and ignorance.

We use the relative abundance of different words along a genome to distinguish reads from different species. The distribution of word counts within a genome is accurately represented by a Poisson distribution. The Multinomial mixture model is derived as a standardized Poisson mixture model. The Bayesian network efficiently encodes the conditional dependencies between word counts in a DNA due to overlaps and hence is most consistent with the data. We present a two-way mixture model that captures the high dimensionality and sparsity associated with the data. Our method can cluster reads as short as 50 bps with accuracy over 80%. The Bayesian mixture models clearly outperform their Naive Bayes counterparts on datasets of varying abundances, divergences and read lengths. Our method attains comparable accuracy to that of state-of-art Scimm and converges at least 5 times faster than Scimm for all the cases tested. The reduced time taken, by our method, to obtain accurate results is highly significant and justifies the use of our proposed method to evaluate large metagenome datasets.

The assessment is based on 22 different features calculated from the signal. The different features are combined using machine learning algorithms in order to decide whether the subject has an increased fall risk. Results from Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Locally Weighted Learning, Support Vector Machines and C4.5 are reported and compared. It is argued that the neural networks provide low accuracy results because of the high dimensionality of the feature space compared to the available data. It is shown that FD-NEAT (a method from neuro evolution which simultaneously learns the network topology, the network weights and the relevant features) outperforms the other methods in the given classification task. The system is evaluated on a database consisting of 40 elderly with known fall risk and 40 healthy elderly controls.

Malicious code writers launch illicit programs to the compromised systems to gain access to the resources, and confidential/intellectual information of the users. The primary reason for systems becoming vulnerable for attack is because of the ignorance of the Naive users using the system over Internet without worrying about the extent of threats. Hence, malware detection is of prime importance for protecting systems and its resources. Most malware scanners employ signature based detection methods. These scanners fail to detect unseen and obfuscated malware samples. In this paper we propose a non-signature based approach for detecting malicious code. n-grams are extracted from Portable Executable (PE) of benign and malware samples which is considered as feature. n-grams ranging from 1 to 8 is extracted from raw byte patterns. Since the number of unique n-grams extracted from the sample are very large hence. Classwise document frequency is used for reducing feature space. Experiments have been conducted on 2138 Portable Executables (PE) samples and classification is performed using classifiers like Naive Bayes, Instance Based Learner (IBK), J48 and AdaBoost1 supported by WEKA(a data mining tool). Experimental results are promising and shows that our proposed approach can be used to effectively classify executables (Malware and Benign) minimizing false alarms.

With the increase in number of web users and the websites, the need for website classification gains attraction. The website classification based on URLs alone plays an important role, since the contents of web pages need not be fetched for classification. In this paper, a soft computing approach is proposed for classification of websites based on features extracted from URLs alone. The Open Directory Project dataset was considered and the proposed system classified the websites into various categories using Naive Bayes approach. The performance of the system was evaluated and Precision, Recall and F-measure values of 0.7, 0.88 and 0.76 were achieved by this approach.

Few studies have been done comparing their resilience to missing data. This paper provides an experimental comparison of the naive Bayes and support vector machine regarding the resilience to missing data on 24 UCI data sets. The experimental results show that when the missing rate is very small (e.g. 1%), the resilience of the naive Bayes classifiers to missing data are approximately similar to that of support vector machine classifiers. With the increase of the missing rate, however, the resilience of the naive Bayes classifiers to missing data are slowly decreased and that of support vector machine classifiers to missing data are rapidly decreased. This demonstrates that the naive Bayes classifiers have better resilience to missing data than support vector machine classifiers.

Distributed Classification for Pocket Data Mining	FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	JUN 28-30, 2011	Warsaw, POLAND		Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci			Distributed and collaborative data stream mining in a mobile computing environment is referred to as Pocket Data Mining PDM. Large amounts of available data streams to which smart phones can subscribe to or sense, coupled with the increasing computational power of handheld devices motivates the development of PDM as a decision making system. This emerging area of study has shown to be feasible in an earlier study using technological enablers of mobile software agents and stream mining techniques [1]. A typical PDM process would start by having mobile agents roam the network to discover relevant data streams and resources. Then other (mobile) agents encapsulating stream mining techniques visit the relevant nodes in the network in order to build evolving data mining models. Finally, a third type of mobile agents roam the network consulting the mining agents for a final collaborative decision, when required by one or more users. In this paper, we propose the use of distributed Hoeffding trees and Naive Bayes classifiers in the PDM framework over vertically partitioned data streams. Mobile policing, health monitoring and stock market analysis are among the possible applications of PDM. An extensive experimental study is reported showing the effectiveness of the collaborative data mining with the two classifiers.

In this paper, each essay was represented by Vector Space Model (VSM). After removing the stopwords, we extracted the features of contents and linguistics from the essays, and each vector was expressed by corresponding weight. Three classical approaches including Document Frequency (DF), Information Gain (IG) and Chi-square Statistic (CHI) were used to select features by some predetermined thresholds. According to the experimental results, we classified the test essay to appropriate category using different classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally the ensemble classifier was combined by those component classifiers.

The scope of this research is to investigate which is the most efficient machine learning technique in predicting the final grade of Ionian University Informatics postgraduate students. Consequently, five academic courses are chosen, each constituting an individual dataset, and six well-known classification algorithms are experimented with. Furthermore, the datasets are enriched with demographic, in-term performance and in-class behaviour features. The small size of the datasets and the imbalance in the distribution of class values are the main research challenges of the present work. Several techniques, like resampling and feature selection, are employed to address these issues, for the first time in a performance prediction application. Naive Bayes and 1-NN achieved the best prediction results, which are very satisfactory compared to those of similar approaches.

Medical bills can be classified by the statutory environment which determines appropriate adjudication of payment disputes. We refer to this classification result as the adjudication type of a bill. This classification can be used to determine appropriate payment for medical services. Using a set of 182,811 medical bills, we develop a procedure to quickly and accurately determine the correct adjudication type. A simple naive Bayes classifier based on training set class occurrences gives 92.8% accuracy, which can be remarkably improved by instead presenting these probabilities to an artificial neural network, yielding 96.8 +/- 0.5 % accuracy.

We use information gain based feature selection method to reduce feature vector dimension of online SVM filter in this paper. Experimental results illustrate that the method improves the filter performance a little and greatly reduces the computational cost of online SVM filter.

A Generalized Classification Approach for Indian Sign Language Datasets Using Instance Based Classifiers	TRENDS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (CCSEIT 2011)	SEP 23-25, 2011	Tirunelveli, INDIA	Acad & Ind Res Collaborat Ctr		Sign Language; boundary based; K-NN classifier; Navie Bayes; classification accuracy		Sign language is the primary means of communication in the deaf community. The importance of sign language is emphasized by growing research activities and various funding agencies which deal with the technical aspects of deaf people's communication needs. Signing is primarily done with the hands. In technical terms the hands are used to describe the so-called manual parameters, which are pose, posture, position and motion. General view based sign language recognition systems extract these parameters by a single camera view because it seems to be user friendly and hardware complexity; however it needs a high accuracy classifier for classification and recognition purpose. The decision making of the system in this work employs statistical classifiers namely Navie bayes and K-NN to recognize the sign language isolated signs. Indian sign language datasets is used for the training and performance evaluation of the system.It compares the ability to deploy the K-NN and the Naive Bayesian classifiers in solving the sign classification problem. The impact of such study may reflect the exploration for using such algorithms in other similar applications such as text classification and the development of automated systems.

A common method is to select and label unlabeled instances that the current classifier has high classification confidence to enlarge the labeled training set and then to update the classifier, which is widely used in two paradigms of semi-supervised learning: self-training and co-training. However, the original labeled instances are more reliable than the self-labeled instances that are labeled by the classifier. If unlabeled instances are assigned wrong labels and then used to update the classifier, classification accuracy will be jeopardized. In this paper, we present a new instance selection method based on the original labeled data (ISBOLD). ISBOLD considers not only the prediction confidence of the current classifier on unlabeled data but also its performance on the original labeled data only. In each iteration, ISBOLD uses the change of accuracy of the newly learned classifier on the original labeled data as a criterion to decide whether the selected most confident unlabeled instances will be accepted to the next iteration or not. We conducted experiments in self-training and co-training scenarios when using Naive Bayes as the base classifier. Experimental results on 26 UCI datasets show that, ISBOLD can significantly improve accuracy and AUC of self-training and co-training.

J	Freitas, AA; Vasieva, O; de Magalhaes, JP				Freitas, Alex A.; Vasieva, Olga; de Magalhaes, Joao Pedro			A data mining approach for classifying DNA repair genes into ageing-related or non-ageing-related	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; END JOINING NHEJ; CELLULAR SENESCENCE; DOWNS-SYNDROME; AUTOIMMUNITY; MECHANISMS; LONGEVITY; NETWORKS; PROTEINS; GENETICS	Background: The ageing of the worldwide population means there is a growing need for research on the biology of ageing. DNA damage is likely a key contributor to the ageing process and elucidating the role of different DNA repair systems in ageing is of great interest. In this paper we propose a data mining approach, based on classification methods (decision trees and Naive Bayes), for analysing data about human DNA repair genes. The goal is to build classification models that allow us to discriminate between ageing-related and non-ageing-related DNA repair genes, in order to better understand their different properties. Results: The main patterns discovered by the classification methods are as follows: (a) the number of protein-protein interactions was a predictor of DNA repair proteins being ageing-related; (b) the use of predictor attributes based on protein-protein interactions considerably increased predictive accuracy of attributes based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations; (c) GO terms related to "response to stimulus" seem reasonably good predictors of ageing-relatedness for DNA repair genes; (d) interaction with the XRCC5 (Ku80) protein is a strong predictor of ageing-relatedness for DNA repair genes; and (e) DNA repair genes with a high expression in T lymphocytes are more likely to be ageing-related. Conclusions: The above patterns are broadly integrated in an analysis discussing relations between Ku, the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, ageing and lymphocyte development. These patterns and their analysis support non-homologous end joining double strand break repair as central to the ageing-relatedness of DNA repair genes. Our work also showcases the use of protein interaction partners to improve accuracy in data mining methods and our approach could be applied to other ageing-related pathways.

We extended the large-scale linear support vector machine library LIBLINEAR with state-of-the-art virtual high-throughput screening metrics to train classifiers on whole large and unbalanced data sets. The formulation of this linear support machine has an excellent performance if applied to high-dimensional sparse feature vectors. An additional advantage is the average linear complexity in the number of non zero features of a prediction. Nevertheless, the approach assumes that a problem is linearly separable. Therefore, we conducted an extensive benchmarking to evaluate the performance on large-scale problems up to a size of 175000 samples. To examine the virtual screening performance, we determined the chemotype clusters using Feature Trees and integrated this information to compute weighted AUC-based performance measures and a leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We also considered the BEDROC score, a metric that was suggested to tackle the early enrichment problem. The performance on each problem was evaluated by a nested cross-validation and a nested leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We compared LIBLINEAR against a Naive Bayes classifier, a random decision forest classifier, and a maximum similarity ranking approach. These reference approaches were outperformed in a direct comparison by LIBLINEAR A comparison to literature results showed that the LIBLINEAR performance is competitive but without achieving results as good as the top-ranked nonlinear machines on these benchmarks. However, considering the overall convincing performance and computation time of the large-scale support vector machine, the approach provides an excellent alternative to established large-scale classification approaches.

J	Maji, P				Maji, Pradipta			Fuzzy-Rough Supervised Attribute Clustering Algorithm and Classification of Microarray Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Attribute clustering; classification; gene selection; microarray analysis; rough sets	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; PATTERNS; SETS	One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find groups of coregulated genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. In this regard, a new clustering algorithm, termed as fuzzy-rough supervised attribute clustering (FRSAC), is proposed to find such groups of genes. The proposed algorithm is based on the theory of fuzzy-rough sets, which directly incorporates the information of sample categories into the gene clustering process. A new quantitative measure is introduced based on fuzzy-rough sets that incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity among genes. The proposed algorithm is based on measuring the similarity between genes using the new quantitative measure, whereby redundancy among the genes is removed. The clusters are refined incrementally based on sample categories. The effectiveness of the proposed FRSAC algorithm, along with a comparison with existing supervised and unsupervised gene selection and clustering algorithms, is demonstrated on six cancer and two arthritis data sets based on the class separability index and predictive accuracy of the naive Bayes' classifier, the K-nearest neighbor rule, and the support vector machine.

Identification of fraudulent financial statements using linguistic credibility analysis	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financial fraud; Deception; Text mining; Classification; Fraud risk; SAS 99		The strategic use of deceptive language in managerial financial fraud is investigated with linguistic cues extracted from 202 publicly available financial disclosures. Those crafting fraudulent disclosures use more activation language, words, imagery, pleasantness, group references, and less lexical diversity than non-fraudulent ones. Writers of fraudulent disclosures may write more to appear credible while communicating less in actual content. A parsimonious model with Naive Bayes and C4.5 achieved the highest classification accuracy.

J	Jiang, LX				Jiang, Liangxiao			Random one-dependence estimators	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; One-dependence estimators; Random selection; Classification; Class probability estimation; Ranking	NAIVE BAYES; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; AREA	Many approaches attempt to improve naive Bayes and have been broadly divided into five main categories: (1) structure extension; (2) attribute weighting; (3) attribute selection; (4) instance weighting; (5) instance selection, also called local learning. In this paper, we work on the approach of structure extension and single out a random Bayes model by augmenting the structure of naive Bayes. We called it random one-dependence estimators, simply RODE. In RODE, each attribute has at most one parent from other attributes and this parent is randomly selected from log(2)m (where m is the number of attributes) attributes with the maximal conditional mutual information. Our work conducts the randomness into Bayesian network classifiers. The experimental results on a large number of UCI data sets validate its effectiveness in terms of classification, class probability estimation, and ranking. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, LM; Cao, CH; Li, XF				Wang, Li Min; Cao, Chun Hong; Li, Xiong Fei			Semi-Supervised Learning Based on Information Theory and Functional Dependency Rules of Probability	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Machine Learning; Semi-Supervised Learning; Unlabeled Data; Missing Values; Naive Bayes		The problems of unlabeled data and missing values are two hot research topics in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm called FFDC, which chooses Naive Bayes as the underlying supervised learner in the semi-supervised learning framework. Based on the conditional independence assumption of Naive Bayes, the information gain of Information theory is redefined to quantitatively measure the information implicated in unlabeled data. And functional dependency rules of probability are deduced based on Armstrong's axioms, which can be used to find and delete redundant attributes. Thus the computational complexity while modeling will be reduced exponentially. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that FFDC has clear advantages with respect to generalization and probabilistic performance.

J	Chandra, B; Gupta, M				Chandra, B.; Gupta, Manish			Robust approach for estimating probabilities in Naive-Bayes Classifier for gene expression data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Naive-Bayes; Gene expression data	MICROARRAY DATA; CANCER; ALGORITHMS	Naive-Bayes Classifier (NBC) is widely used for classification in machine learning. It is considered as the first choice for many classification problems because of its simplicity and classification accuracy as compared to other supervised learning methods. However, for high dimensional data like gene expression data, it does not perform well due to two major limitations i.e. underflow and overfitting. In order to address the problem of underflow, the existing approach adopted is to add the logarithms of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities and the estimate approach is used for providing solution to overfitting problem. However, in practice for gene expression data, these approaches do not perform well. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to overcome the limitations using a robust function for estimating probabilities in Naive-Bayes Classifier. The proposed method not only resolves the limitation of NBC but also improves the classification accuracy for gene expression data. The method has been tested over several benchmark gene expression datasets of high dimension. Comparative results of proposed Robust Naive-Bayes Classifier (R-NBC) and existing NBC for gene expression data have also been illustrated to highlight the effectiveness of the R-NBC. Simulation study has also been performed to depict the robustness of the R-NBC over the existing approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it has some intrinsic properties that make it more difficult to deal with, mainly the large cardinality of the class variable (i.e. the number of folders), the different number of e-mails per class state and the fact that this is a dynamic problem, in the sense that e-mails arrive in our mail-folders following a time-line. Perhaps because of these problems, standard text-oriented classifiers such as Naive Bayes Multinomial do no obtain a good accuracy when applied to e-mail corpora. In this paper, we identify the imbalance among classes/folders as the main problem, and propose a new method based on learning and sampling probability distributions. Our experiments over a standard corpus (ENRON) with seven datasets (e-mail users) show that the results obtained by Naive Bayes Multinomial significantly improve when applying the balancing algorithm first. For the sake of completeness in our experimental study we also compare this with another standard balancing method (SMOTE) and classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Catal, C; Sevim, U; Diri, B				Catal, Cagatay; Sevim, Ugur; Diri, Banu			Practical development of an Eclipse-based software fault prediction tool using Naive Bayes algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Naive Bayes; Eclipse technology; Software fault prediction	MODELS; METRICS; CODE	Despite the amount of effort software engineers have been putting into developing fault prediction models. software fault prediction still poses great challenges. This research using machine learning and statistical techniques has been ongoing for 15 years, and yet we still have not had a breakthrough. Unfortunately, none of these prediction models have achieved widespread applicability in the software industry due to a lack of software tools to automate this prediction process. Historical project data, including software faults and a robust software fault prediction tool, can enable quality managers to focus on fault-prone modules. Thus, they can improve the testing process. We developed an Eclipse-based software fault prediction tool for Java programs to simplify the fault prediction process. We also integrated a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes into the plug-in because of its proven high-performance for this problem. This article presents a practical view to software fault prediction problem, and it shows how we managed to combine software metrics with software fault data to apply Naive Bayes technique inside an open source platform.

Francis			CAERUS: Predicting CAncER oUtcomeS Using Relationship between Protein Structural Information, Protein Networks, Gene Expression Data, and Mutation Data	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NF-KAPPA-B; BREAST-CANCER; SIGNALING NETWORKS; SOMATIC MUTATION; SH2 DOMAINS; GENOME; KINASE; SIGNATURE; SURVIVAL; METASTASIS	Carcinogenesis is a complex process with multiple genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of one or more tumors. Understanding the underlying mechanism of this process and identifying related markers to assess the outcome of this process would lead to more directed treatment and thus significantly reduce the mortality rate of cancers. Recently, molecular diagnostics and prognostics based on the identification of patterns within gene expression profiles in the context of protein interaction networks were reported. However, the predictive performances of these approaches were limited. In this study we propose a novel integrated approach, named CAERUS, for the identification of gene signatures to predict cancer outcomes based on the domain interaction network in human proteome. We first developed a model to score each protein by quantifying the domain connections to its interacting partners and the somatic mutations present in the domain. We then defined proteins as gene signatures if their scores were above a preset threshold. Next, for each gene signature, we quantified the correlation of the expression levels between this gene signature and its neighboring proteins. The results of the quantification in each patient were then used to predict cancer outcome by a modified naive Bayes classifier. In this study we achieved a favorable accuracy of 88.3%, sensitivity of 87.2%, and specificity of 88.9% on a set of well-documented gene expression profiles of 253 consecutive breast cancer patients with different outcomes. We also compiled a list of cancer-associated gene signatures and domains, which provided testable hypotheses for further experimental investigation. Our approach proved successful on different independent breast cancer data sets as well as an ovarian cancer data set. This study constitutes the first predictive method to classify cancer outcomes based on the relationship between the domain organization and protein network.

J	Groth, SS; Muntermann, J				Groth, Sven S.; Muntermann, Jan			An intraday market risk management approach based on textual analysis	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Market risk management; Text mining; Corporate disclosures		The management of financial risk is one of the most challenging tasks of financial institutions. In the last two decades, diverse quantitative models and approaches have been developed and refined to address the impact of volatile markets on business. Whereas existing approaches have intensively utilized structured data such as historical price series, little attention has been paid to unstructured (textual) data, which could be a large source of information in this context. Previous empirical research has shown that certain news stories, such as corporate disclosures, can cause abnormal price behavior subsequent to their publication. On the basis of a data set comprising such news stories as well as intraday stock prices, this paper explores the risk implications of information being newly available to market participants. After showing that such events can significantly drive stock price volatilities, this research aims at identifying among the textual data provided those disclosures that have resulted in most supranormal risk exposures. To this end, four different learners - Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine - have been applied in order to detect patterns in the textual data that could explain increased risk exposure. Two evaluations are presented in order to assess the learning capabilities of the approach in the context of risk management. First, "classic" data mining evaluation metrics are applied and, second, a newly developed simulation-based evaluation method is presented. Evaluation results provide strong evidence that unstructured (textual) data represents a valuable source of information also for financial risk management - a domain in which, in the past, little attention has been paid to unstructured data. With regard to classification performance, it is also shown that there exist significant differences between the applied learning techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Feature selection for gene expression data aims at finding a set of genes that best discriminates biological samples of different types. In this paper, we propose a two-stage selection algorithm for genomic data by combining MRMR (Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance) and GA (Genetic Algorithm). In the first stage, MRMR is used to filter noisy and redundant genes in high-dimensional microarray data. In the second stage, the GA uses the classifier accuracy as a fitness function to select the highly discriminating genes. The proposed method is tested for tumor classification on five open datasets: NCI, Lymphoma, Lung, Leukemia and Colon using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na < ve Bayes (NB) classifiers. The comparison of the MRMR-GA with MRMR filter and GA wrapper shows that our method is able to find the smallest gene subset that gives the most classification accuracy in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).

Alan; Chen, Hsinchun			Identity matching using personal and social identity features	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Identity management; Identity matching; Probabilistic relational model; Social context	HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES; NAIVE BAYES; MODEL	Identity verification is essential in our mission to identify potential terrorists and criminals. It is not a trivial task because terrorists reportedly assume multiple identities using either fraudulent or legitimate means. A national identification card and biometrics technologies have been proposed as solutions to the identity problem. However, several studies show their inability to tackle the complex problem. We aim to develop data mining alternatives that can match identities referring to the same individual. Existing identity matching techniques based on data mining primarily rely on personal identity features. In this research, we propose a new identity matching technique that considers both personal identity features and social identity features. We define two groups of social identity features including social activities and social relations. The proposed technique is built upon a probabilistic relational model that utilizes a relational database structure to extract social identity features. Experiments show that the social activity features significantly improve the matching performance while the social relation features effectively reduce false positive and false negative decisions.

In order to deploy activity recognition systems in the real world, we need simple sensing systems with lightweight computational modules to accurately analyze sensed data. In this paper, we propose a simple method to recognize human activities using simple object information involved in activities. We apply activity theory for representing complex human activities and propose a penalized naive Bayes classifier for performing activity recognition. Our results show that our method reduces computation up to an order of magnitude in both learning and inference without penalizing accuracy, when compared to hidden Markov models and conditional random fields.

As such, there is an increasing demand to develop and adapt cheminformatics algorithms and tools in order to predict molecular and pharmacological properties on the basis of these large data sets. In this manuscript, we report a novel machine-learning-based ligand classification algorithm, named Ligand Classifier of Adaptively Boosting Ensemble Decision Stumps (LiCABEDS), for data-mining and modeling of large chemical data sets to predict pharmacological properties in an efficient and accurate manner. The performance of LiCABEDS was evaluated through predicting GPCR ligand functionality (agonist or antagonist) using four different molecular fingerprints, including Maccs, FP2, Unity, and Molprint 2D fingerprints. Our studies showed that LiCABEDS outperformed two other popular techniques, classification tree and Naive Bayes classifier, on all four types of molecular fingerprints. Parameters in LiCABEDS, including the number of boosting iterations, initialization condition, and a "reject option" boundary, were thoroughly explored and discussed to demonstrate the capability of handling imbalanced data sets, as well as its robustness and flexibility. In addition, the detailed mathematical concepts and theory are also given to address the principle behind statistical prediction models. The LiCABEDS algorithm has been implemented into a user-friendly software package that is accessible online at http://www.cbligand.org/LiCABEDS/.

Long term cardiovascular risk models' combination	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Management of cardiovascular diseases; Modeling; Bayesian networks	ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES; ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; HEART-DISEASE; PREVENTION; SCORE; CLASSIFIERS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	The correct diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is a key factor to reduce social and economic costs. In this context, cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools are of fundamental importance. This work addresses two major drawbacks of the currert cardiovascular risk score systems: reduced number of risk factors considered by each individual tool and the inability of these tools to deal with incomplete information. To achieve these goals a two phase strategy was followed. In the first phase, a common representation procedure, based on a Naive-Bayes classifier methodology, was applied to a set of current risk assessment tools. Classifiers' individual parameters and conditional probabilities were initially evaluated through a frequency estimation method. In a second phase, a combination scheme was proposed exploiting the particular features of Bayes probabilistic reasoning, followed by conditional probabilities optimization based on a genetic algorithm approach. This strategy was applied to describe and combine ASSIGN and Framingham models. Validation results were obtained based on individual models, assuming their statistical correctness. The achieved results are very promising, showing the potential of the strategy to accomplish the desired goals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chowdhury, I; Zulkernine, M				Chowdhury, Istehad; Zulkernine, Mohammad			Using complexity, coupling, and cohesion metrics as early indicators of vulnerabilities	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						Vulnerability prediction; Software metrics; Complexity; Coupling; Cohesion	OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN; SYSTEMS; SUITE	Software security failures are common and the problem is growing. A vulnerability is a weakness in the software that, when exploited, causes a security failure. It is difficult to detect vulnerabilities until they manifest themselves as security failures in the operational stage of software, because security concerns are often not addressed or known sufficiently early during the software development life cycle. Numerous studies have shown that complexity, coupling, and cohesion (CCC) related structural metrics are important indicators of the quality of software architecture, and software architecture is one of the most important and early design decisions that influences the final quality of the software system. Although these metrics have been successfully employed to indicate software faults in general, there are no systematic guidelines on how to use these metrics to predict vulnerabilities in software. If CCC metrics can be used to indicate vulnerabilities, these metrics could aid in the conception of more secured architecture, leading to more secured design and code and eventually better software. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically predict vulnerabilities based on CCC metrics. To empirically validate the framework and prediction accuracy, we conduct a large empirical study on fifty-two releases of Mozilla Firefox developed over a period of four years. To build vulnerability predictors, we consider four alternative data mining and statistical techniques - C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Naive-Bayes - and compare their prediction performances. We are able to correctly predict majority of the vulnerability-prone files in Mozilla Firefox, with tolerable false positive rates. Moreover, the predictors built from the past releases can reliably predict the likelihood of having vulnerabilities in the future releases. The experimental results indicate that structural information from the non-security realm such as complexity, coupling, and cohesion are useful in vulnerability prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Machine Learning Methods Predict Locomotor Response to MK-801 in Mouse Models of Down Syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEUROGENETICS			English	Article						behavior prediction; Down syndrome; Naive Bayes; Ts1Cje; Ts65Dn	DENDRITIC SPINE DEVELOPMENT; EXCHANGE FACTOR TIAM1; HUMAN-CHROMOSOME-21; PHOSPHORYLATION; NETWORKS; TS65DN; PROTEINS; KINASE; RAC1	Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), is a common genetic cause of cognitive impairment. This disorder results from the overexpression of HSA21 genes and the resulting perturbations in many molecular pathways and cellular processes. Knowledge-based identification of targets for pharmacotherapies will require defining the most critical protein abnormalities among these many perturbations. Here the authors show that using the Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models of DS, which are trisomic for 88 and 69 reference protein coding genes, respectively, a simple linear Naive Bayes classifier successfully predicts behavioral outcome (level of locomotor activity) in response to treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. Input to the Naive Bayes method were simple protein profiles generated from cortex and output was locomotor activity binned into three levels: low, medium, and high. When Feature Selection was used with the Naive Bayes method, levels of three HSA21 and two non-HSA21 protein features were identified as making the most significant contributions to activity level. Using these five features, accuracies of up to 88% in prediction of locomotor activity were achieved. These predictions depend not only on genotype-specific differences but also on within-genotype individual variation in levels of molecular and behavioral parameters. With judicious choice of pathways and components, a similar approach may be useful in analysis of more complex behaviors, including those associated with learning and memory, and may facilitate identification of novel targets for pharmacotherapeutics.

Several approaches exist, but they have limited performance. Here, we present a new scheme to infer protein quaternary structure from lattice and protein information, with all-around coverage for strong, weak and very weak affinity homomeric and heteromeric complexes. The scheme combines naive Bayes classifier and point group symmetry under Boolean framework to detect quaternary structures in crystal lattice. It consistently produces >= 90% coverage across diverse benchmarking data sets, including a notably superior 95% coverage for recognition heteromeric complexes, compared with 53% on the same data set by current state-of-the-art method. The detailed study of a limited number of prediction-failed cases offers interesting insights into the intriguing nature of protein contacts in lattice. The findings have implications for accurate inference of quaternary states of proteins, especially weak affinity complexes.

The ensemble framework is applied to sentiment classification tasks, with the aim of efficiently integrating different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesize a more accurate classification procedure. First, two types of feature sets are designed for sentiment classification, namely the part-of-speech based feature sets and the word-relation based feature sets. Second, three well-known text classification algorithms, namely naive Bayes, maximum entropy and support vector machines, are employed as base-classifiers for each of the feature sets. Third, three types of ensemble methods, namely the fixed combination, weighted combination and meta-classifier combination, are evaluated for three ensemble strategies. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on five widely-used datasets in sentiment classification. Finally, some in-depth discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of ensemble technique for sentiment classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Choi, K; Kim, S				Choi, Kwangmin; Kim, Sun			Building interacting partner predictors using co-varying residue pairs between histidine kinase and response regulator pairs of 48 bacterial two-component systems	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						two-component systems; mutual information; molecular co-evolution; machine learning	INFORMATION-THEORETIC ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION SYSTEMS; RHODOBACTER-SPHAEROIDES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CHEMOTAXIS; CHEA; SPECIFICITY; COVARIANCE	The two-component system (TCS) is a signal transduction system that involves a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). Although up to hundreds of TCSs may operate in parallel in a bacterial cell, the high-fidelity of a TCS signaling is well maintained, minimizing irrelevant crosstalk between TCSs. When a HK gene and a RR gene in a given TCS system exist in neighboring positions, it is almost certain that their protein products (i.e., HK and RR) are interacting partners. However, large bacterial genomes often have multiple HK genes and/or cognate RR genes that are not neighboring positions. In many partially assembled genomes, some HK genes and RR genes belong to different contigs. In these cases, it is not clear which HK(s) and RR(s) interact. By combining information-theoretic and graph-theoretic approaches, we developed a computational method identifying co-evolving residue pairs between HKs and cognate RRs and predicting the interacting HK: RR pairs for each TCS. In addition, we built a TCSppWWW webserver (http://compath.org/platcom/tcs) that takes query sequences of pairing candidates and predicts their HK: RR pairing using precomputed models. The current release of TCSppWWW provides predictors for 48 TCSs using over 20,000 protein sequences from about 900 bacterial genomes. Three different types of predictors using Random Forest, RBF Network, and Naive Bayes are provided. Once a set of HK and RR candidate sequences are submitted, TCSppWWW aligns query sequences to the precomputed multiple sequence alignment of HK: RR pairs, extracts co-evolving column positions, then returns prediction results with prediction margin and additional information.

Machine learning approach for automated visual inspection of machine components	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision tree; Naive Bayes; Histogram features; Machine learning; Visual inspection	TOOL WEAR; VISION SYSTEM	Visual inspection on the surface of components is a main application of machine vision. Visual inspection finds its application in identifying defects such as scratches, cracks bubbles and measurement of cutting tool wear and welding quality. Machine learning approach to machine vision helps in automating the design process of machine vision systems. This approach involves image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Study shows a library of features, and classifiers are available to classify the data. However, only the best combination of them can yield the highest classification accuracy. In this study, images with different known conditions were acquired, preprocessed, and histogram features were extracted. The classification accuracies of C4.5 classifier algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm were compared, and results are reported. The study shows that C4.5 algorithm performs better.

J	Ozel, SA				Ozel, Selma Ayse			A Web page classification system based on a genetic algorithm using tagged-terms as features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Web mining; Classification; Classifier learning; Genetic algorithms	TEXT CLASSIFICATION; DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL; FEATURE-SELECTION	The incredible increase in the amount of information on the World Wide Web has caused the birth of topic specific crawling of the Web. During a focused crawling process, an automatic Web page classification mechanism is needed to determine whether the page being considered is on the topic or not. In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) based automatic Web page classification system which uses both HTML tags and terms belong to each tag as classification features and learns optimal classifier from the positive and negative Web pages in the training dataset is developed. Our system classifies Web pages by simply computing similarity between the learned classifier and the new Web pages. In the existing GA-based classifiers, only HTML tags or terms are used as features, however in this study both of them are taken together and optimal weights for the features are learned by our GA. It was found that, using both HTML tags and terms in each tag as separate features improves accuracy of classification, and the number of documents in the training dataset affects the accuracy such that if the number of negative documents is larger than the number of positive documents in the training dataset, the classification accuracy of our system increases up to 95% and becomes higher than the well known Naive Bayes and k nearest neighbor classifiers.

Several algorithms have been presented to select the proper set of data and elicit suitable structured environments to handle the queries submitted to OLAP systems, which are called view selection algorithms to materialize. As users' requirements may change during run time, materialization must be viewed dynamically. In this work, the authors propose and operate a dynamic view management system to select and materialize views with new and improved architecture, which predicts incoming queries through association rule mining and three probabilistic reasoning approaches: Conditional probability, Bayes' rule, and Naive Bayes' rule. The proposed system is compared with DynaMat system and Hybrid system through two standard measures. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic view selection system improves these measures. This system outperforms DynaMat and Hybrid for each type of query and each sequence of incoming queries.

Improving dynamic facial expression recognition with feature subset selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Dynamic facial expression recognition; Feature subset selection; Estimation of Distribution Algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Wrapper technique	IMAGE SEQUENCES; MACHINE; VIDEO; FACE	This paper addresses the dynamic recognition of basic facial expressions in videos using feature subset selection. Feature selection has been already used by some static classifiers where the facial expression is recognized from one single image. Past work on dynamic facial expression recognition has emphasized the issues of feature extraction and classification, however, less attention has been given to the critical issue of feature selection in the dynamic scenario. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we show that dynamic facial expression recognition can be casted into a classical classification problem. Second, we combine a facial dynamics extractor algorithm with a feature selection scheme for generic classifiers. We show that the paradigm of feature subset selection with a wrapper technique can improve the dynamic recognition of facial expressions. We provide evaluations of performance on real video sequences using five standard machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, and Classification Trees.

This situation makes it necessary to create specialized tools capable of supporting users in their searches. Objective: To apply and compare strategies that were developed to investigate the use of the Portuguese version of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for constructing an automated classifier for Brazilian Portuguese-language web-based content within or outside of the field of healthcare, focusing on the lay public. Methods: 3658 Brazilian web pages were used to train the classifier and 606 Brazilian web pages were used to validate it. The strategies proposed were constructed using content-based vector methods for text classification, such that Naive Bayes was used for the task of classifying vector patterns with characteristics obtained through the proposed strategies. Results: A strategy named InDeCS was developed specifically to adapt MeSH for the problem that was put forward. This approach achieved better accuracy for this pattern classification task (0.94 sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve). Conclusions: Because of the significant results achieved by InDeCS, this tool has been successfully applied to the Brazilian healthcare search portal known as Busca Saude. Furthermore, it could be shown that MeSH presents important results when used for the task of classifying web-based content focusing on the lay public. It was also possible to show from this study that MeSH was able to map out mutable non-deterministic characteristics of the web. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: For 14 patients with known occurrence of honeycombing, a stack of 70 axial, lung kernel reconstructed images was acquired from HRCT chest exams. A set of 964 regions of interest of both healthy and pathological (356) lung tissue was identified by an experienced radiologist. Texture features were extracted using statistical features (Stat), six properties calculated from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), Minkowski dimensions (MDs), and three Minkowski functionals (MFs) (e.g., MF.Euler). A naive Bayes (NB) and k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifier, a multilayer radial basis functions network (RBFN), and a support vector machine with a radial basis function (SVMrbf) kernel were optimized in a tenfold cross-validation for each texture vector, and the classification accuracy was calculated on independent test sets as a quantitative measure of automated tissue characterization. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare two accuracy distributions and the significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni correction. Results: The best classification results were obtained by the MF features, which performed significantly better than all the standard Stat, GLCM, and MD features (p<0.001) for both classifiers. The highest accuracies were found for MF. Euler (93.6%, 94.9%, 94.2%, and 95.0% for NB, k-NN, RBFN, and SVMrbf, respectively). The best groups of standard texture features were a Stat and GLCM ("homogeneity") feature set (up to 91.8%).

Adaptive Naive Bayes method for masquerade detection	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						intrusion detection; masquerade detection; adaptive Naive Bayes; deferred detection; machine learning	INTRUSION DETECTION; COMPUTER INTRUSION; UNIX COMMANDS; MODEL	Recently, researchers have proposed efficient detection mechanisms for masquerade attacks. Most of these techniques use machine learning methods to learn the behavioral patterns of users and to check if an observed behavior conforms to the learnt behavior of a user. Masquerade attack is detected when the observed behavior, reportedly of a specific user, does not match with the learnt pattern of this user's past data. A major shortcoming in this process is that the user may legitimately deviate temporarily from its past behavior. If the deviation is large and near-permanent, it is desirable that such deviations are captured in a detection mechanism. We propose, in this paper, a method that takes into consideration this aspect of user behavior while detecting masquerade attacks. Our scheme is based on the premise that the commands used by a legitimate user or an attacker may differ from the trained signature. But the deviation of the legitimate user is momentary whereas that of an attacker persists longer. By introducing this novel concept in the detection mechanism, the performance improves. We show this empirically using several benchmark datasets. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Improving feature selection algorithms using normalised feature histograms	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								The proposed feature selection method builds a histogram of the most stable features from random subsets of a training set and ranks the features based on a classifier based cross-validation. This approach reduces the instability of features obtained by conventional feature selection methods that occur with variation in training data and selection criteria. Classification results on four microarray and three image datasets using three major feature selection criteria and a naive Bayes classifier show considerable improvement over benchmark results.

J	Wong, TT; Chang, LH				Wong, Tzu-Tsung; Chang, Liang-Hao			Individual attribute prior setting methods for naive Bayesian classifiers	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Dirichlet distribution; Generalized Dirichlet distribution; Naive Bayesian classifier; Prior distribution; Selective naive Bayes	DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION	The generalized Dirichlet distribution has been shown to be a more appropriate prior for naive Bayesian classifiers, because it can release both the negative-correlation and the equal-confidence requirements of the Dirichlet distribution. The previous research did not take the impact of individual attributes on classification accuracy into account, and therefore assumed that all attributes follow the same generalized Dirichlet prior. In this study, the selective naive Bayes mechanism is employed to choose and rank attributes, and two methods are then proposed to search for the best prior of each single attribute according to the attribute ranks. The experimental results on 18 data sets show that the best approach is to use selective naive Bayes for filtering and ranking attributes when all of them have Dirichlet priors with Laplace's estimate. After the ranks of the chosen attributes are determined, individual setting is performed to search for the best noninformative generalized Dirichlet prior for each attribute. The selective naive Bayes is also compared with two representative filters for the feature selection, and the experimental results show that it has the best performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shi, L; Ma, XM; Xi, L; Duan, QG; Zhao, JY				Shi, Lei; Ma, Xinming; Xi, Lei; Duan, Qiguo; Zhao, Jingying			Rough set and ensemble learning based semi-supervised algorithm for text classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text classification; Rough set; Ensemble learning; Semi-supervised classification		Text classification has received more and more attention due to the enormous growth of digital content available on-line. This paper investigates the design of two-class text classifiers using positive and unlabeled data only. The specialty of this problem is that there is no labeled negative example for learning, which makes traditional text classification techniques inapplicable. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised classification algorithm based on tolerance rough set and ensemble learning is proposed. Tolerance rough set theory is used to approximate concepts existed in documents and extract an initial set of negative example. Then, SVM, Rocchio and Naive Bayes algorithms are used as base classifiers to construct an ensemble classifier, which runs iteratively and exploits margins between positive and negative data to progressively improve the approximation of negative data. Thus, the class boundary eventually converges to the true boundary of the positive class in the feature space. An experimental evaluation of different methods is carried out on two common text corpora, i.e., the Reuters-21578 collection and the WebKB collection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, not all patients with mastocytosis suffer from anaphylaxis. The aim of the study was to analyze differences in gene expression between patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and a history of insect venom anaphylaxis (IVA) compared to those patients without a history of anaphylaxis, and to determine the predictive use of gene expression profiling. Methods: Whole-genome gene expression analysis was performed in peripheral blood cells. Results: Twenty-two adults with ISM were included: 12 with a history of IVA and 10 without a history of anaphylaxis of any kind. Significant differences in single gene expression corrected for multiple testing were found for 104 transcripts (P < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were involved in pathways responsible for the development of cancer and focal and cell adhesion suggesting that the expression of genes related to the differentiation state of cells is higher in patients with a history of anaphylaxis. Based on the gene expression profiles, a naive Bayes prediction model was built identifying patients with IVA. Conclusions: In ISM, gene expression profiles are different between patients with a history of IVA and those without. These findings might reflect a more pronounced mast cells dysfunction in patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Gene expression profiling might be a useful tool to predict the risk of anaphylaxis on insect venom in patients with ISM. Prospective studies are needed to substantiate any conclusions.

The information is extracted as time functions of various dynamic properties of the signatures. A database of 2160 signatures from 108 subjects was built. Thirty-one features were identified and extracted from each signature. Different feature reduction approaches and classifiers were used to assess their suitability for this application. Rough set approach has resulted in a reduced set of nine features that were found to capture the essential characteristics required for signature identification. Rough set classifier has achieved 100% correct classification rate, which demonstrates its suitability and effectiveness for online signature identification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Thousands of faint X-ray sources are found, many concentrated into rich young stellar clusters. However, significant contamination from unrelated Galactic and extragalactic sources is present in the X-ray catalog. We describe the use of a naive Bayes classifier to assign membership probabilities to individual sources, based on source location, X-ray properties, and visual/infrared properties. For the particular membership decision rule adopted, 75% of CCCP sources are classified as members, 11% are classified as contaminants, and 14% remain unclassified. The resulting sample of stars likely to be Carina members is used in several other studies, which appear in this special issue devoted to the CCCP.

It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP isoform. In this study, inhibitor predicting models were developed for five major CYP isoforms, namely 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, using a combined classifier algorithm on a large data set containing more than 24,700 unique compounds, extracted from PubChem. The combined classifiers algorithm is an ensemble of different independent machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes, fused by a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). All developed models were validated by 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse validation set composed of about 9000 diverse unique compounds. The range of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation sets was 0.764 to 0.815 for CYP1A2, 0.837 to 0.861 for CYP2C9, 0.793 to 0.842 for CYP2C19, 0.839 to 0.886 for CYP2D6, and 0.754 to 0.790 for CYP3A4, respectively, using the new developed combined classifiers. The overall performance of the combined classifiers fused by BP-ANN was superior to that of three classic fusion techniques (Mean, Maximum, and Multiply). The chemical spaces of data sets were explored by multidimensional scaling plots, and the use of applicability domain improved the prediction accuracies of models. In addition, some representative substructure fragments differentiating CYP inhibitors and noninhibitors were characterized by the substructure fragment analysis. These classification models are applicable for virtual screening of the five major CYP isoforms inhibitors or can be used as simple filters of potential chemicals in drug discovery.

Performance comparison of machine learning algorithms and number of independent components used in fMRI decoding of belief vs. disbelief	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Machine learning; Classifier; fMRI; Interpretability; Optimization; Independent component analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REAL-TIME FMRI; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ACCURATE; ROBUST	Machine learning (ML) has become a popular tool for mining functional neuroimaging data, and there are now hopes of performing such analyses efficiently in real-time. Towards this goal, we compared accuracy of six different ML algorithms applied to neuroimaging data of persons engaged in a bivariate task, asserting their belief or disbelief of a variety of propositional statements. We performed unsupervised dimension reduction and automated feature extraction using independent component (IC) analysis and extracted IC time courses. Optimization of classification hyperparameters across each classifier occurred prior to assessment. Maximum accuracy was achieved at 92% for Random Forest, followed by 91% for AdaBoost, 89% for Naive Bayes, 87% for a J48 decision tree, 86% for K* and 84% for support vector machine. For real-time decoding applications, finding a parsimonious subset of diagnostic ICs might be useful. We used a forward search technique to sequentially add ranked ICs to the feature subspace. For the current data set, we determined that approximately six ICs represented a meaningful basis set for classification. We then projected these six IC spatial maps forward onto a later scanning session within subject. We then applied the optimized ML algorithms to these new data instances, and found that classification accuracy results were reproducible. Additionally, we compared our classification method to our previously published general linear model results on this same data set. The highest ranked IC spatial maps show similarity to brain regions associated with contrasts for belief > disbelief, and disbelief < belief. 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Douglas, P.

Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are proposed for binary classification, and then extended to multi-class cases by using approaches such as one-against-the-rest. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning method by using the multi-class boosting, which can directly classify the multi-class data and achieve high classification accuracy by exploiting the unlabeled data. There are two distinct features in our proposed semi-supervised learning approach: (1) handling multi-class cases directly without reducing them to multiple two-class problems, and (2) the classification accuracy of each base classifier requiring only at least 1/K or better than 1/K (K is the number of classes). Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective based on the testing of 21 UCI benchmark data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, ZQ; Ye, QA; Zhang, ZL; Li, YJ				Zhang, Ziqiong; Ye, Qiang; Zhang, Zili; Li, Yijun			Sentiment classification of Internet restaurant reviews written in Cantonese	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Sentiment classification; Online review; Cantonese; Restaurant; Machine learning	WORD-OF-MOUTH; TALK	Cantonese is an important dialect in some regions of Southern China. Local online users often represent their opinions and experiences on the web with written Cantonese. Although the information in those reviews is valuable to potential consumers and sellers, the huge amount of web reviews make it difficult to give an unbiased evaluation to a product and the Cantonese reviews are unintelligible for Mandarin Chinese speakers. In this paper, standard machine learning techniques naive Bayes and SVM are incorporated into the domain of online Cantonese-written restaurant reviews to automatically classify user reviews as positive or negative. The effects of feature presentations and feature sizes on classification performance are discussed. We find that accuracy is influenced by interaction between the classification models and the feature options. The naive Bayes classifier achieves as well as or better accuracy than SVM. Character-based bigrams are proved better features than unigrams and trigrams in capturing Cantonese sentiment orientation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Handling numeric attributes when comparing Bayesian network classifiers: does the discretization method matter?	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	23rd International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligence Systems (IEA/AIE 2010)	2010	Cordoba, SPAIN	Univ Cordoba		Discretization; Bayesian classifiers; AODE; Naive Bayes		Within the framework of Bayesian networks (BNs), most classifiers assume that the variables involved are of a discrete nature, but this assumption rarely holds in real problems. Despite the loss of information discretization entails, it is a direct easy-to-use mechanism that can offer some benefits: sometimes discretization improves the run time for certain algorithms; it provides a reduction in the value set and then a reduction in the noise which might be present in the data; in other cases, there are some Bayesian methods that can only deal with discrete variables. Hence, even though there are many ways to deal with continuous variables other than discretization, it is still commonly used. This paper presents a study of the impact of using different discretization strategies on a set of representative BN classifiers, with a significant sample consisting of 26 datasets. For this comparison, we have chosen Naive Bayes (NB) together with several other semi-Naive Bayes classifiers: Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), k-Dependence Bayesian (KDB), Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) and Hybrid AODE (HAODE). Also, we have included an augmented Bayesian network created by using a hill climbing algorithm (BNHC). With this comparison we analyse to what extent the type of discretization method affects classifier performance in terms of accuracy and bias-variance discretization. Our main conclusion is that even if a discretization method produces different results for a particular dataset, it does not really have an effect when classifiers are being compared. That is, given a set of datasets, accuracy values might vary but the classifier ranking is generally maintained. This is a very useful outcome, assuming that the type of discretization applied is not decisive future experiments can be d times faster, d being the number of discretization methods considered.

These graphical models provide, at first glance, a snapshot of the relevant relationships among the variables under consideration. We analyse the behaviour of the proposed methodology in a practical case, showing that it is a useful tool to help decision making when elaborating policies based on performance indicators. The methodology has been implemented in a software that interacts with the Elvira package for graphical models, and that is available to the administration board at the University of Almeria (Spain) through a web interface. The software also implements a new method for constructing composite indicators by using a Bayesian network regression model.

Statistical modeling for the detection, localization and extraction of text from heterogeneous textual images using combined feature scheme	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Text extraction; Non sub sampled Contourlet Transform; Gray level run length matrix; Caption text; Scene text; Document image	CONTOURLET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; VIDEO	Discriminating between the text and non text regions of an image is a complex and challenging task. In contrast to Caption text, Scene text can have any orientation and may be distorted by the perspective projection. Moreover, it is often affected by variations in scene and camera parameters such as illumination, focus, etc. These variations make the design of unified text extraction from various kinds of images extremely difficult. This paper proposes a statistical unified approach for the extraction of text from hybrid textual images (both Scene text and Caption text in an image) and Document images with variations in text by using carefully selected features with the help of multi level feature priority (MLFP) algorithm. The selected features are combinedly found to be the good choice of feature vectors and have the efficacy to discriminate between text and non text regions for Scene text, Caption text and Document images and the proposed system is robust to illumination, transformation/perspective projection, font size and radially changing/angular text. MLFP feature selection algorithm is evaluated with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based K-nearest neighbour learner and effectiveness of MLFP is shown by comparing with three feature selection methods with benchmark dataset. The proposed text extraction system is compared with the Edge based method, Connected component method and Texture based method and shown encouraging result and finds its major application in preprocessing for optical character recognition technique and multimedia processing, mobile robot navigation, vehicle license detection and recognition, page segmentation and text-based image indexing, etc.	[Gopalan, Chitrakala] Anna Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Easwari Engn Coll, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manjula, D.] Anna Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India	Gopalan, C (reprint author), Anna Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Easwari Engn Coll, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.	ckgops@gmail.com; manju@annauniv.edu					AHA DW, 1991, MACH LEARN, V6, P37, DOI 10.1023/A:1022689900470; Chen N, 2007, INT J DOC ANAL RECOG, V10, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10032-006-0020-2; da Cunha AL, 2006, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V15, P3089, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2006.877507; Do MN, 2005, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V14, P2091, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2005.859376; Feng Pan Y., 2009, ICDAR 2009, P6; Galloway MM, 1975, COMPUTER GRAPHICS IM, V4, P172, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80008-6; Gllavata J., 2003, P 3 INT S IM SIGN PR, V2, P611; GNITECKI J, 2001, P 26 C IEEE ENG MED, P3844; Gopalan C., 2008, INT J COMPUT SCI ENG, V2, P202; GUPTA SC, 1970, FUNDAMENTALS MATH ST, pCH2; Guyon I., 2003, Journal of Machine Learning Research, V3, DOI 10.1162/153244303322753616; HARALICK RM, 1973, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, VSMC3, P610, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1973.4309314; JEONG KY, 1999, IMAGE PROCESSING, V3, P319; Jiang RJ, 2007, J ZHEJIANG UNIV-SC A, V8, P568, DOI 10.1631/jzus.2007.A0568; John G.

Differentiation between Viral and Bacterial Acute Infections Using Chemiluminescent Signatures of Circulating Phagocytes	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHEMI-LUMINESCENCE; POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; RESPIRATORY BURST; HUMAN-NEUTROPHILS; PNEUMONIA; BLOOD; CELLS; ACTIVATION; CHILDREN	Oftentimes the etiological diagnostic differentiation between viral and bacterial infections is problematic, while clinical management decisions need to be made promptly upon I admission. Thus, alternative rapid and sensitive diagnostic approaches need to be developed. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) or phagocytes act as major players in the defense response of the host during an episode of infection, and thereby undergo functional changes that differ according to the infections. PMNs functional activity can be characterized by quantification and localization of respiratory burst production and assessed by chemiluminescent (CL) byproduct reaction. We have assessed the functional states of PMNs of patients with acute infections in a luminol-amplified whole blood system using the component CL approach. In this study, blood was drawn from 69 patients with fever (>38 degrees C), and diagnosed as mainly viral or bacterial infections in origin. Data mining algorithms (C4.5, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes) were used to induce classification models to distinguish between clinical groups. The model with the best predictive accuracy was induced using C4.5 algorithm, resulting in 94.7% accuracy on the training set and 88.9% accuracy on the testing set.

Identity management is critical to various organizational practices ranging from customer relationship management to crime investigation. The task of searching for a specific identity is difficult because disparate identity information may exist due to the issues related to unintentional errors and intentional deception. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Naive Bayes model that improves existing identity matching techniques in terms of searching effectiveness. Experiments show that our proposed model performs significantly better than the exact-match based matching technique. With 50% training instances labeled, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves a performance comparable to the fully supervised record comparison algorithm. The semi-supervised learning greatly reduces the efforts of manually labeling training instances without significant performance degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wang, G.

We performed a comparison of somatic, germline, shared (found in both soma and germline) and somatic recurrent mutational spectra for 17 human tumor suppressor genes, which focused upon missense single base-pair substitutions and microdeletions/microinsertions. Somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in relation to C.G>T.A transitions but differed with respect to the frequency of A.T>G.C, A.T>T.A, and C.G>A.T substitutions. Shared missense mutations were characterized by higher mutability rates, greater physicochemical differences between wild-type and mutant residues, and a tendency to occur in evolutionarily conserved residues and within CpG/CpHpG oligonucleotides. Mononucleotide runs (>= 4 bp) were identified as hotspots for shared microdeletions/microinsertions. Both germline and somatic microdeletions/microinsertions were found to be significantly over-represented within the "indel-hotspot" motif, GTAAGT. Using a naive Bayes' classifier trained to discriminate between five missense mutation groups, 63% of mutations in our dataset were on average correctly recognized. Applying this classifier to an independent dataset of probable driver mutations, we concluded that similar to 50% of these somatic missense mutations possess features consistent with their being either shared or recurrent, suggesting that a disproportionate number of such lesions are likely to be drivers of tumorigenesis.

Such a system can be used for the estimation of surface friction during manipulation tasks; quality assurance in the textile, cosmetics, and harvesting industries; and other applications requiring tactile sensing. Several machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, decision trees, and naive Bayes trees, have been trained to distinguish textures sensed by a biologically inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensities of vibrations in the silicone. Consequently, textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger are preprocessed, and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to train classifiers. We show that the classifiers generalize well for unseen datasets with performance exceeding previously reported algorithms. Our classifiers can distinguish between different materials, such as carpet, flooring vinyls, tiles, sponge, wood, and polyvinyl- chloride (PVC) woven mesh with an accuracy of 95% +/- 4% on unseen test data.

Andrew			An alternative approach for statistical single-label document classification of newspaper articles	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						language models; Naive Bayes Classifier; single-label document classification/categorization; statistics	TEXT CLASSIFICATION	Text classification is one of the most important sectors of machine learning theory. It enables a series of tasks among which are email spam filtering and context identification. Classification theory proposes a number of different techniques based on different technologies and tools. Classification systems are typically distinguished into single-label categorization and multi-label categorization systems, according to the number of categories they assign to each of the classified documents. In this paper, we present work undertaken in the area of single-label classification which resulted in a statistical classifier, based on the Naive Bayes assumption of statistical independence of word occurrence across a document. Our algorithm, takes into account cross-category word occurrence in deciding the class of a random document. Moreover, instead of estimating word co-occurrence in assigning a class, we estimate word contribution for a document to belong in a class. This approach outperforms other statistical classifiers as Naive Bayes Classifier and Language Models, as proven in our results.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used to diagnose seizures. Because of the non-linear and dynamic nature of the EEG signals, it is difficult to effectively decipher the subtle changes in these signals by visual inspection and by using linear techniques. Therefore, non-linear methods are being researched to analyze the EEG signals. In this work, we use the recorded EEG signals in Recurrence Plots (RP), and extract Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) parameters from the RP in order to classify the EEG signals into normal, ictal, and interictal classes. Recurrence Plot (RP) is a graph that shows all the times at which a state of the dynamical system recurs. Studies have reported significantly different RQA parameters for the three classes. However, more studies are needed to develop classifiers that use these promising features and present good classification accuracy in differentiating the three types of EEG segments. Therefore, in this work, we have used ten RQA parameters to quantify the important features in the EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Decision Tree (DT), and Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN). Our results show that the SVM classifier was able to identify the EEG class with an average efficiency of 95.6%, sensitivity and specificity of 98.9% and 97.8%, respectively.	[Acharya, U.

This novel has been historically attributed to him but there are some encountered positions about this. The methods used in this paper range from: logistic regression, additive logistic regression, linear, quadratic, regularized, mixture and flexible discriminant analysis, classification tree, k-nearest neighbour, Naive Bayes method and support vector machines. Methods were trained and applied using a corpus of authors contemporary to Cervantes as Lope de Vega, Jeronimo de Pasamonte, Alonso Fernandez de Avellaneda, Mateo Aleman, and Francisco de Quevedo and more than forty variables, mainly words and punctuation marks, measured over written texts by these authors. Respect to these methods, most of them classify the novel as another Cervantes' work; however, is our recommendation to include more texts from these authors and more authors.

Collocation analysis for UMLS knowledge-based word sense disambiguation	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Background: The effectiveness of knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) approaches depends in part on the information available in the reference knowledge resource. Off the shelf, these resources are not optimized for WSD and might lack terms to model the context properly. In addition, they might include noisy terms which contribute to false positives in the disambiguation results. Methods: We analyzed some collocation types which could improve the performance of knowledge-based disambiguation methods. Collocations are obtained by extracting candidate collocations from MEDLINE and then assigning them to one of the senses of an ambiguous word. We performed this assignment either using semantic group profiles or a knowledge-based disambiguation method. In addition to collocations, we used second-order features from a previously implemented approach. Specifically, we measured the effect of these collocations in two knowledge-based WSD methods. The first method, AEC, uses the knowledge from the UMLS to collect examples from MEDLINE which are used to train a Naive Bayes approach. The second method, MRD, builds a profile for each candidate sense based on the UMLS and compares the profile to the context of the ambiguous word. We have used two WSD test sets which contain disambiguation cases which are mapped to UMLS concepts. The first one, the NLM WSD set, was developed manually by several domain experts and contains words with high frequency occurrence in MEDLINE. The second one, the MSH WSD set, was developed automatically using the MeSH indexing in MEDLINE. It contains a larger set of words and covers a larger number of UMLS semantic types. Results: The results indicate an improvement after the use of collocations, although the approaches have different performance depending on the data set. In the NLM WSD set, the improvement is larger for the MRD disambiguation method using second-order features. Assignment of collocations to a candidate sense based on UMLS semantic group profiles is more effective in the AEC method. In the MSH WSD set, the increment in performance is modest for all the methods. Collocations combined with the MRD disambiguation method have the best performance. The MRD disambiguation method and second-order features provide an insignificant change in performance. The AEC disambiguation method gives a modest improvement in performance. Assignment of collocations to a candidate sense based on knowledge-based methods has better performance. Conclusions: Collocations improve the performance of knowledge-based disambiguation methods, although results vary depending on the test set and method used. Generally, the AEC method is sensitive to query drift. Using AEC, just a few selected terms provide a large improvement in disambiguation performance. The MRD method handles noisy terms better but requires a larger set of terms to improve performance.

J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Long, B				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Phillippe; Long, Bernard			Predicting Species Diversity of Benthic Communities within Turbid Nearshore Using Full-Waveform Bathymetric LiDAR and Machine Learners	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEW-SOUTH-WALES; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; HABITAT; FISH; ASSEMBLAGES; PATTERNS; FORESTS; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION	Epi-macrobenthic species richness, abundance and composition are linked with type, assemblage and structural complexity of seabed habitat within coastal ecosystems. However, the evaluation of these habitats is highly hindered by limitations related to both waterborne surveys (slow acquisition, shallow water and low reactivity) and water clarity (turbid for most coastal areas). Substratum type/diversity and bathymetric features were elucidated using a supervised method applied to airborne bathymetric LiDAR waveforms over Saint-Simeon-Bonaventure's nearshore area (Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Quebec, Canada). High-resolution underwater photographs were taken at three hundred stations across an 8-km(2) study area. Seven models based upon state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Regression Tree, Classification Tree, C 4.5, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and CN2 learners were tested for predicting eight epi-macrobenthic species diversity metrics as a function of the class number. The Random Forest outperformed other models with a three-discretized Simpson index applied to epi-macrobenthic communities, explaining 69% (Classification Accuracy) of its variability by mean bathymetry, time range and skewness derived from the LiDAR waveform. Corroborating marine ecological theory, areas with low Simpson epi-macrobenthic diversity responded to low water depths, high skewness and time range, whereas higher Simpson diversity relied upon deeper bottoms (correlated with stronger hydrodynamics) and low skewness and time range. The degree of species heterogeneity was therefore positively linked with the degree of the structural complexity of the benthic cover. This work underpins that fully exploited bathymetric LiDAR (not only bathymetrically derived by-products), coupled with proficient machine learner, is able to rapidly predict habitat characteristics at a spatial resolution relevant to epi-macrobenthos diversity, ranging from clear to turbid waters. This method might serve both to nurture marine ecological theory and to manage areas with high species heterogeneity where navigation is hazardous and water clarity opaque to passive optical sensors.

J	Shan, HH; Banerjee, A				Shan, Hanhuai; Banerjee, Arindam			Mixed-membership naive Bayes models	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Mixed-membership; Generative models; Variational inference; Logistic regression	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMAGES	In recent years, mixture models have found widespread usage in discovering latent cluster structure from data. A popular special case of finite mixture models is the family of naive Bayes (NB) models, where the probability of a feature vector factorizes over the features for any given component of the mixture. Despite their popularity, naive Bayes models do not allow data points to belong to different component clusters with varying degrees, i.e., mixed memberships, which puts a restriction on their modeling ability. In this paper, we propose mixed-membership naive Bayes (MMNB) models. On one hand, MMNB can be viewed as a generalization of NB by putting a Dirichlet prior on top to allow mixed memberships. On the other hand, MMNB can also be viewed as a generalization of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with the ability to handle heterogeneous feature vectors with different types of features, e.g., real, categorical, etc.. We propose two variational inference algorithms to learn MMNB models. The first one is based on ideas originally used in LDA, and the second one uses substantially fewer variational parameters, leading to a significantly faster algorithm. Further, we extend MMNB/LDA to discriminative mixed-membership models for classification by suitably combining MMNB/LDA with multi-class logistic regression. The efficacy of the proposed mixed-membership models is demonstrated by extensive experiments on several datasets, including UCI benchmarks, recommendation systems, and text datasets.

In previous research [15,17], an algorithm for learning LDTs was proposed and its performance on some benchmark classification problems were investigated and compared with a number of well known classifiers. In this paper, a methodology for extending LDTs to prediction problems is proposed and the performance of LDTs are compared with other state-of-art prediction algorithms such as a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system and Fuzzy Semi-Naive Bayes [13] on a variety of data sets. Finally, a method for linguistic query evaluation is discussed and supported with an example. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Higher Order Naive Bayes: A Novel Non-IID Approach to Text Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; statistical relational learning; naive bayes; text classification; IID		The underlying assumption in traditional machine learning algorithms is that instances are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). These critical independence assumptions made in traditional machine learning algorithms prevent them from going beyond instance boundaries to exploit latent relations between features. In this paper, we develop a general approach to supervised learning by leveraging higher order dependencies between features. We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for classification termed Higher Order Naive Bayes (HONB). Unlike approaches that assume data instances are independent, HONB leverages higher order relations between features across different instances. The approach is validated in the classification domain on widely used benchmark data sets. Results obtained on several benchmark text corpora demonstrate that higher order approaches achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy over the baseline methods, especially when training data is scarce. A complexity analysis also reveals that the space and time complexity of HONB compare favorably with existing approaches.

The Value Difference Metric, simply VDM, is proposed to find reasonable distance metric between each pair of instances with nominal attribute values only. In VDM, all of the attributes are assumed to be fully independent, and the difference between two values of an attribute is only considered to be closer if they have more similar correlation with the output classes. It is obvious that the attribute independence assumption in VDM is rarely true in reality, which would harm its performance in the applications with complex attribute dependencies. In this paper, we single out an improved Value Difference Metric by relaxing its unrealistic attribute independence assumption. We call it One Dependence Value Difference Metric, simply ODVDM. In ODVDM, the structure learning algorithms for Bayesian network classifiers, such as tree augmented naive Bayes, are used to find the dependence relationships among the attributes. Our experimental results validate its effectiveness in terms of classification accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The application of naive Bayes model averaging to predict Alzheimer's disease from genome-wide data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; GENETIC ASSOCIATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; NETWORKS	Objective Predicting patient outcomes from genome-wide measurements holds significant promise for improving clinical care. The large number of measurements (eg, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), however, makes this task computationally challenging. This paper evaluates the performance of an algorithm that predicts patient outcomes from genome-wide data by efficiently model averaging over an exponential number of naive Bayes (NB) models. Design This model-averaged naive Bayes (MANB) method was applied to predict late onset Alzheimer's disease in 1411 individuals who each had 312 318 SNP measurements available as genome-wide predictive features. Its performance was compared to that of a naive Bayes algorithm without feature selection (NB) and with feature selection (FSNB). Measurement Performance of each algorithm was measured in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration, and run time. Results The training time of MANB (16.1 s) was fast like NB (15.6 s), while FSNB (1684.2 s) was considerably slower. Each of the three algorithms required less than 0.1 s to predict the outcome of a test case. MANB had an AUG of 0.72, which is significantly better than the AUG of 0.59 by NB (p<0.00001), but not significantly different from the AUG of 0.71 by FSNB. MANB was better calibrated than NB, and FSNB was even better in calibration. A limitation was that only one dataset and two comparison algorithms were included in this study. Conclusion MANB performed comparatively well in predicting a clinical outcome from a high-dimensional genome-wide dataset. These results provide support for including MANB in the methods used to predict outcomes from large, genome-wide datasets.

This classifier requires only a single pass over the dataset to compute the feature frequencies per class, is easy to implement, and has memory usage that is linear in the number of features. Results of experiments performed on 128 binary and multi-class text and web datasets show that FWC's performance is at least comparable to, and often better than that of Naive Bayes, TWCNB, Winnow, Balanced Winnow and linear SVM. On a large-scale web dataset with 12,294 classes and 135,973 training instances, FWC trained in 13 s and yielded comparable classification performance to a state of the art multi-class SVM implementation, which took over 15 min to train.

A topographic latent source model for fMRI data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Bayesian; Spatial; MCMC; Multivariate; Naive Bayes	PATTERN-ANALYSIS; SPATIAL PRIORS; ACTIVATION; INFERENCE; IMAGES; MEMORY; STATES; ICA	We describe and evaluate a new statistical generative model of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The model, topographic latent source analysis (TLSA), assumes that fMRI images are generated by a covariate-dependent superposition of latent sources. These sources are defined in terms of basis functions over space. The number of parameters in the model does not depend on the number of voxels, enabling a parsimonious description of activity patterns that avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional voxel-based approaches. We develop a multi-subject extension where latent sources at the subject-level are perturbations of a group-level template. We evaluate TLSA according to prediction, reconstruction and reproducibility. We show that it compares favorably to a Naive Bayes model while using fewer parameters. We also describe a hypothesis testing framework that can be used to identify significant latent sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Early diagnosis, appropriate choice and immediate initiation of antibiotic therapy can greatly affect the outcome of any kind of infection. Phagocytes play a central role in the innate immune response of the organism to infection. They comprise the first-line of defense against infectious intruders in our body, being able to produce large quantities of reactive oxygen species, which can be detected by means of chemiluminescence (CL). The data preparation approach implemented in this work corresponds to a dynamic assessment of phagocytic respiratory burst localization in a luminol-enhanced whole blood CL system. We have previously applied this approach to the problem of identifying various intra-abdominal pathological processes afflicting peritoneal dialysis patients in the Nephrology department and demonstrated 84.6% predictive accuracy with the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm. In this study, we apply the CL-based approach to a larger sample of patients from two departments (Nephrology and Internal Medicine) with the aim of finding the most effective and interpretable feature sets and classification models for a fast and accurate identification of several infectious diseases. Materials and methods: Whole blood samples were collected from 78 patients (comprising 115 instances) with respiratory infections, infections associated with renal replacement therapy and patients without infections. CL kinetic parameters were calculated for each case, which was assigned into a specific clinical group according to the available clinical diagnostics. Feature selection wrapper and filter methods were applied to remove the irrelevant and redundant features and to improve the predictive performance of disease classification algorithms. Three data mining algorithms, C4.5 048) decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier were applied for inducing disease classification models and their performance in classifying three clinical groups was evaluated by 10 runs of a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Results and conclusions: The results demonstrate that the predictive power of the best models obtained with the three evaluated algorithms after feature selection was found to be in the range of 63.38 +/- 2.18-70.68 +/- 1.43%. The highest disease classification accuracy was reached by C4.5, which also provides the most informative model in the form of a decision tree, and the lowest accuracy was obtained with naive Bayes. The feature selection method attaining the best classification performance was the wrapper method in forward direction. Moreover, the classification models exposed biological patterns specific to the clinical states and the predictive features selected were found to be characteristic of a specific disorder. Based on these encouraging results, we believe that the CL-based data pre-processing approach combined with the wrapper forward feature selection procedure and the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm has a clear potential to become a fast, informative, and sensitive tool for predictive diagnostics of infectious diseases in clinics.

Genetic algorithm for informative basis function selection from the wavelet packet decomposition with application to corrosion identification using acoustic emission	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Acoustic emission; Corrosion monitoring; Feature subset selection; Genetic algorithm; Mutual information; Wavelet Packet Transform	AUSTENITIC STAINLESS-STEELS; FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN-MOTION; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; MUTUAL INFORMATION; VARIABLE SELECTION; PITTING CORROSION; SIGNALS; TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; COEFFICIENTS	Chemical process installations are exposed to aggressive chemicals and conditions leading to corrosion. The damage from corrosion can lead to an unexpected plant shutdown and to the exposure of people and the environment to chemicals. Due to changes within and on the surface of materials subjected to corrosion, energy is released in the form of acoustic waves. This acoustic activity can be captured and used for corrosion monitoring in chemical process installations. Wavelet packet coefficients extracted from the acoustic activity have been considered to determine whether corrosion occurs, and to identify the type of corrosion process, at least for the most important corrosion processes in the chemical process industry. Feature subset selection is then applied to these wavelet coefficients to achieve a much higher accuracy in the identification of different corrosion processes than when no feature subset selection is applied to the acoustic waves. However, due to the statistical dependencies that potentially exist between the wavelet coefficients, the latter should not be selected independently from each other. Local discriminant basis selection algorithms do not take the statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients into account. In this paper, we have used several mutual information-based approaches that take these dependencies into account and compared them to the wavelet-specific local discriminant basis selection algorithm. Furthermore, a hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, which uses a relevance-redundancy approach as a local search procedure, was designed. The highest classification accuracies are obtained with the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, for all classifiers used in this paper. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm easily outperformed one of the most commonly used classifiers in chemometrics: partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A naive Bayes classifier that uses the features selected by the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm was able to identify the absence of corrosion, uniform corrosion, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, with an accuracy of up to 87.20%.

The results show that it is possible to observe differences among species in the wood texture at this magnification. The micrographs have been processed in a simple way using segmentation and object recognition to identify the cross-section tracheids belonging to earlywood of 7 different timber species: Fagus sylvatica. Castanea sativa, Juglans regia, Eucalyptus globulus. Hymenaea courbaril, Pinus silvestris and Pinus radiata. We have analyzed the shape, number and distribution of the tracheids using 5 features: circularity, rectangularity, number of tracheids, distance between tracheids and average area. The extracted features are classified using different statistical methods: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic classification, Logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks. A comparative study using gray level co-occurrence based features is also presented, with the improvement of using the segmentation method. Moreover, some additional results showing the possibility of using fractal analysis in this framework complete the research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given an example x and a class c, a classifier usually works by estimating the probability of x being member of c (i.e., membership probability). Well calibrated classifiers are those able to provide accurate estimates of class membership probabilities, that is, the estimated probability (p) over cap (c vertical bar x) is close to p(c vertical bar(p) over cap (c vertical bar x)), which is the true, (unknown) empirical probability of x being member of c given that the probability estimated by the classifier is (p) over cap (c vertical bar x). Calibration is not a necessary property for producing accurate classifiers, and, thus, most of the research has focused on direct accuracy maximization strategies rather than on calibration. However, non-calibrated classifiers are problematic in applications where the reliability associated with a prediction must be taken into account. In these applications, a sensible use of the classifier must be based on the reliability of its predictions, and, thus, the classifier must be well calibrated. In this paper we show that lazy associative classifiers (LAC) are well calibrated using an MM.:based entropy minimization method. We investigate important applications where such characteristics (i.e., accuracy and calibration) are relevant, and we demonstrate empirically that LAC outperforms other classifiers, such as SVMs, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees (even after these classifiers are calibrated). Additional highlights of LAC include the ability to incorporate reliable predictions for improving training, and the ability to refrain from doubtful predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Xing, CH; Dunson, DB				Xing, Chuanhua; Dunson, David B.			Bayesian Inference for Genomic Data Integration Reduces Misclassification Rate in Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INTERACTION NETWORKS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DRUG DISCOVERY; GENE FUSION; YEAST; SCALE; ORGANISMS; BIOLOGY; MODEL; TEXT	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to most fundamental cellular processes. There has been increasing interest in reconstructing PPIs networks. However, several critical difficulties exist in obtaining reliable predictions. Noticeably, false positive rates can be as high as > 80%. Error correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient due to the difficulty of covering the errors from multiple levels of data processing procedures within a single test. We propose a novel Bayesian integration method, deemed nonparametric Bayes ensemble learning (NBEL), to lower the misclassification rate (both false positives and negatives) through automatically up-weighting data sources that are most informative, while down-weighting less informative and biased sources. Extensive studies indicate that NBEL is significantly more robust than the classic naive Bayes to unreliable, error-prone and contaminated data. On a large human data set our NBEL approach predicts many more PPIs than naive Bayes. This suggests that previous studies may have large numbers of not only false positives but also false negatives. The validation on two human PPIs datasets having high quality supports our observations. Our experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to predict high-throughput PPIs computationally with substantially reduced false positives and false negatives. The ability of predicting large numbers of PPIs both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use computational approaches to correct data errors in general, and may speed up PPIs prediction with high quality. Such a reliable prediction may provide a solid platform to other studies such as protein functions prediction and roles of PPIs in disease susceptibility.

To implement the molecular biology based Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) array concept in structural health monitoring, which has been demonstrated to be superior in disease detection, two types of array expression data have been proposed for the development of the SHM algorithm. For the micro-vibration mode, a two-tier auto-regression with exogenous (AR-ARX) process is used to extract the expression array from the recorded structural time history while an ARX process is applied for the analysis of the earthquake mode. The health condition of the structure is then determined using the NB classification method. In addition, the union concept in probability is used to improve the accuracy of the system. To verify the performance and reliability of the SHM algorithm, a downscaled eight-storey steel building located at the shaking table of the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) was used as the benchmark structure. The structural response from different damage levels and locations was collected and incorporated in the database to aid the structural health monitoring process. Preliminary verification has demonstrated that the structure health condition can be precisely detected by the proposed algorithm. To implement the developed SHM system in a practical application, a SHM prototype consisting of the input sensing module, the transmission module, and the SHM platform was developed. The vibration data were first measured by the deployed sensor, and subsequently the SHM mode corresponding to the desired excitation is chosen automatically to quickly evaluate the health condition of the structure. Test results from the ambient vibration and shaking table test showed that the condition and location of the benchmark structure damage can be successfully detected by the proposed SHM prototype system, and the information is instantaneously transmitted to a remote server to facilitate real-time monitoring. Implementing the bio-inspired two-mode SHM practically has been successfully demonstrated.

J	Twala, B				Twala, Bhekisipho			Predicting Software Faults in Large Space Systems using Machine Learning Techniques	DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Software metrics; machine learning; classifiers; ensemble; fault-proneness prediction	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RISK ANALYSIS; DEFECT; MODELS	Recently, the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has proven to be of great practical value in solving a variety of engineering problems including the prediction of failure, fault, and defect-proneness as the space system software becomes complex. One of the most active areas of recent research in ML has been the use of ensemble classifiers. How ML techniques (or classifiers) could be used to predict software faults in space systems, including many aerospace systems is shown, and further use ensemble individual classifiers by having them vote for the most popular class to improve system software fault-proneness prediction. Benchmarking results on four NASA public datasets show the Naive Bayes classifier as more robust software fault prediction while most ensembles with a decision tree classifier as one of its components achieve higher accuracy rates.

Application of an efficient Bayesian discretization method to biomedical data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; B-CELL LYMPHOMA; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; PREDICT SURVIVAL; BREAST-CANCER; NETWORKS; ADENOCARCINOMA; CARCINOMAS; DISCOVERY; TUMOR	Background: Several data mining methods require data that are discrete, and other methods often perform better with discrete data. We introduce an efficient Bayesian discretization (EBD) method for optimal discretization of variables that runs efficiently on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. The EBD method consists of two components, namely, a Bayesian score to evaluate discretizations and a dynamic programming search procedure to efficiently search the space of possible discretizations. We compared the performance of EBD to Fayyad and Irani's (FI) discretization method, which is commonly used for discretization. Results: On 24 biomedical datasets obtained from high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic studies, the classification performances of the C4.5 classifier and the naive Bayes classifier were statistically significantly better when the predictor variables were discretized using EBD over FI. EBD was statistically significantly more stable to the variability of the datasets than FI. However, EBD was less robust, though not statistically significantly so, than FI and produced slightly more complex discretizations than FI. Conclusions: On a range of biomedical datasets, a Bayesian discretization method (EBD) yielded better classification performance and stability but was less robust than the widely used FI discretization method. The EBD discretization method is easy to implement, permits the incorporation of prior knowledge and belief, and is sufficiently fast for application to high-dimensional data.

J	Loke, PY; Chew, L; Yap, CW				Loke, Pei Yi; Chew, Lita; Yap, Chun Wei			Pilot study on developing a decision support tool for guiding re-administration of chemotherapeutic agent after a serious adverse drug reaction	BMC CANCER			English	Article								Background: Currently, there are no standard guidelines for recommending re-administration of a chemotherapeutic drug to a patient after a serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) incident. The decision on whether to rechallenge the patient is based on the experience of the clinician and is highly subjective. Thus the aim of this study is to develop a decision support tool to assist clinicians in this decision making process. Methods: The inclusion criteria for patients in this study are: (1) had chemotherapy at National Cancer Centre Singapore between 2004 to 2009, (2) suffered from serious ADRs, and (3) were rechallenged. A total of 46 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A genetic algorithm attribute selection method was used to identify clinical predictors for patients' rechallenge status. A Naive Bayes model was then developed using 35 patients and externally validated using 11 patients. Results: Eight patient attributes (age, chemotherapeutic drug, albumin level, red blood cell level, platelet level, abnormal white blood cell level, abnormal alkaline phosphatase level and abnormal alanine aminotransferase level) were identified as clinical predictors for rechallenge status of patients. The Naive Bayes model had an AUC of 0.767 and was found to be useful for assisting clinical decision making after clinicians had identified a group of patients for rechallenge. A platform independent version and an online version of the model is available to facilitate independent validation of the model. Conclusion: Due to the limited size of the validation set, a more extensive validation of the model is necessary before it can be adopted for routine clinical use. Once validated, the model can be used to assist clinicians in deciding whether to rechallenge patients by determining if their initial assessment of rechallenge status of patients is accurate.

J	Akin, M				Akin, Melda			Predicting preferences of university students for prepaid vs post paid cell phone service plans	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Neural networks; LDA; QDA; Naive Bayes; Decision tree; Cell phone service		Information and communication technologies have recently become widely used, especially among the younger population. In this study, the factors affecting the preference of undergraduate students for prepaid or postpaid cell phone service plans were analyzed and a multi-layer perceptron type feed forward neural network model was developed to predict the preferences. Using the responses to the questionnaire administered to a group of undergraduate students in Istanbul University, the factors determining the preference for service plan were determined with chi 2 test for independence. A classification model based on multi-layer perceptron type neural networks was developed. The classification accuracy of this model was compared to linear regression, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes and decision tree approaches and shown to be superior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some data fusion algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Fuzzy Switching (FS) and image processing have been used for these operations in FOFDESS. These algorithms have been brought together by a designed data fusion framework and a novel hybrid algorithm called NABNEF (Naive Bayes Aided Neural-Fuzzy Algorithm) has been improved for fire danger rating in FOFDESS. In this state, FOFDESS is an integrated system which includes the dimensions of prediction, detection and management. As a result of the experiments, it was found out that FOFDESS helped determining the most accurate strategy for fire fighting by producing effective results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lopes, C; Cortez, P; Sousa, P; Rocha, M; Rio, M				Lopes, Clotilde; Cortez, Paulo; Sousa, Pedro; Rocha, Miguel; Rio, Miguel			Symbiotic filtering for spam email detection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Anti-spam filtering; Naive Bayes; Collaborative filtering; Content-Based filtering; Word attacks		This paper presents a novel spam filtering technique called Symbiotic Filtering (SF) that aggregates distinct local filters from several users to improve the overall performance of spam detection. SF is an hybrid approach combining some features from both Collaborative (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF). It allows for the use of social networks to personalize and tailor the set of filters that serve as input to the filtering. A comparison is performed against the commonly used Naive Bayes CBF algorithm. Several experiments were held with the well-known Enron data, under both fixed and incremental symbiotic groups. We show that our system is competitive in performance and is robust against both dictionary and focused contamination attacks. Moreover, it can be implemented and deployed with few effort and low communication costs, while assuring privacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In NIDAAC, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen and detector in the intrusion detection domain are given. Then, in initial IDS, new detectors are generated from the gene library and tested by the negative selection. In every effective IDS node, according to the intrusion network traffic pattern intensity, the change of antibody number is recorded from the process of clone proliferation based on the detector evolution. Finally, building upon the above works, a probabilistic calculation model for intrusion alarm production, which is based on the correlation between the antibody concentration and the intrusion network traffic pattern intensity, is proposed. Compared with Naive Bayes (NB), Multilevel Classifier (AdaBoost) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the false alarm rate of NIDAAC is reduced by 8.66%, 4.93% and 6.36%, respectively. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that NIDAAC has a better performance than previous approaches.

To improve the performance of the spam filtering, feature selection, as an important and indispensable means of text categorization, also plays an important role in spam filtering. We proposed a new method, named Bi-Test, which utilizes binomial hypothesis testing to estimate whether the probability of a feature belonging to the spam satisfies a given threshold or not. We have evaluated Bi-Test on six benchmark spam corpora (pu1, pu2, pu3, pua, lingspam and CSDMC2010), using two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and compared it with four famous feature selection algorithms (information gain, chi(2)-statistic, improved Gini index and Poisson distribution). The experiments show that Bi-Test performs significantly better than chi(2)-statistic and Poisson distribution, and produces comparable performance with information gain and improved Gini index in terms of F1 measure when Naive Bayes classifier is used; it achieves comparable performance with the other methods when SVM classifier is used. Moreover, Bi-Test executes faster than the other four algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automatic classification of I-123-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) SPECT images	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						automatic classification; DaTSCAN; diagnostic accuracy; fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy-3 beta-4-iodophenyltropane; ioflupane; naive Bayes; principal component analysis; singular value decomposition	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER SPECT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; STATISTICAL VARIABLES; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTIFICATION; RADIONUCLIDE; COMPLEX	Introduction We present a method of automatic classification of I-123-fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy-3 beta-4-iodophenyltropane (FP-CIT) images. This technique uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce a training set of patient image data into vectors in feature space (D space). The automatic classification techniques use the distribution of the training data in D space to define classification boundaries. Subsequent patients can be mapped into D space, and their classification can be automatically given. Methods The technique has been tested using 116 patients for whom the diagnosis of either Parkinsonian syndrome or non-Parkinsonian syndrome has been confirmed from post I-123-FP-CIT imaging follow-up. The first three components were used to define D space. Two automatic classification tools were used, naive Bayes (NB) and group prototype. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to repeatedly train and test the automatic classification system. Four commercially available systems for the classification were tested using the same clinical database. Results The proposed technique combining SVD and NB correctly classified 110 of 116 patients (94.8%), with a sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity of 97.3%. The combination of SVD and an automatic classifier performed as well or better than the commercially available systems. Conclusion The combination of data reduction by SVD with automatic classifiers such as NB can provide good diagnostic accuracy and may be a useful adjunct to clinical reporting.

A 'non-parametric' version of the naive Bayes classifier	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Supervised learning; Naive Bayes; Logistic regression; Breast cancer; UCI data sets	GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; HUMAN BREAST-TUMORS; INCOMPLETE DATA; CANCER; SURVIVAL	Many algorithms have been proposed for the machine learning task of classification. One of the simplest methods, the naive Bayes classifier, has often been found to give good performance despite the fact that its underlying assumptions (of independence and a normal distribution of the variables) are perhaps violated. In previous work, we applied naive Bayes and other standard algorithms to a breast cancer database from Nottingham City Hospital in which the variables are highly non-normal and found that the algorithm performed well when predicting a class that had been derived from the same data. However, when we then applied naive Bayes to predict an alternative clinical variable, it performed much worse than other techniques. This motivated us to propose an alternative method, based on naive Bayes, which removes the requirement for the variables to be normally distributed, but retains the essential structure and other underlying assumptions of the method. we tested our novel algorithm on our breast cancer data and on three UCI datasets which also exhibited strong violations of normality. We found our algorithm outperformed naive Bayes in all four cases and outperformed multinomial logistic regression (MLR) in two cases. We conclude that our method offers a competitive alternative to MLR and naive Bayes when dealing with data sets in which non-normal distributions are observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, WW				Wu, Wei-Wen			IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND CAUSAL KNOWLEDGE FOR BETTER CREDIT DECISIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Credit scoring; classification accuracy; Bayesian network classifier; causal knowledge	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; SCORING MODELS; STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION; LEARNING ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; RISK-EVALUATION; MINING APPROACH; FUZZY-SYSTEMS	Numerous studies have contributed to efforts to boost the accuracy of the credit scoring model. Especially interesting are recent studies which have successfully developed the hybrid approach, which advances classification accuracy by combining different machine learning techniques. However, to achieve better credit decisions, it is not enough merely to increase the accuracy of the credit scoring model. It is necessary to conduct meaningful supplementary analyses in order to obtain knowledge of causal relations, particularly in terms of significant conceptual patterns or structures involving attributes used in the credit scoring model. This paper proposes a solution of integrating data preprocessing strategies and the Bayesian network classifier with the tree augmented Naive Bayes search algorithm, in order to improve classification accuracy and to obtain improved knowledge of causal patterns, thus enhancing the validity of credit decisions.

Wrapper selection is a dimension reduction method that has been proposed for improving classification performance. However, the technique is prone to lead to overfitting of the training data, which decreases the generalizability of the obtained results. We claim that previous attempts to apply wrapper selection in the field of music information retrieval (MIR) have led to disputable conclusions about the used methods due to inadequate analysis frameworks, indicative of overfitting, and biased results. This paper presents a framework based on cross-indexing for obtaining realistic performance estimate of wrapper selection by taking into account the simplicity and generalizability of the classification models. The framework is applied on sets of film soundtrack excerpts that are consensually associated with particular basic emotions, comparing Naive Bayes, k-NN, and SVM classifiers using both forward selection (FS) and backward elimination (BE). K-NN with BE yields the most promising results-56.5% accuracy with only four features. The most useful feature subset for k-NN contains mode majorness and key clarity, combined with dynamical, rhythmical, and structural features.

The Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression were used to predict binding sites given transcription factor sequences and to classify factor-site pairs on binding and non-binding ones. Prediction accuracy was estimated using 10-fold cross-validation. Experiments showed that the best prediction of nucleotide densities at selected site positions is obtained using only a few key protein sequence positions. These positions are stably selected by the forward feature selection based on the mutual information of factor-site position pairs.	[Fedonin, G. G.; Laikova, O. N.; Gelfand, M.

Entropy-based discrelization method is used as the discretization method, and support vector machines, C4.5, k-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes are used as the classification methods. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is implemented without using any preprocessing method. Afterwards, the Parkinson's disease dataset is classified after implementing entropy-based discretization on the dataset. Both results are compared, and it is observed that using discretization method increases the success of classification on the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by 4.1% to 12.8%.

J	Yan, ZY; Xu, CF; Pan, YH				Yan, Zhi-yong; Xu, Cong-fu; Pan, Yun-he			Improving naive Bayes classifier by dividing its decision regions	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Naive Bayes classifier; Decision region; NBTree; C4.5 algorithm; Support vector machine (SVM)		Classification can be regarded as dividing the data space into decision regions separated by decision boundaries. In this paper we analyze decision tree algorithms and the NBTree algorithm from this perspective. Thus, a decision tree can be regarded as a classifier tree, in which each classifier on a non-root node is trained in decision regions of the classifier on the parent node. Meanwhile, the NBTree algorithm, which generates a classifier tree with the C4.5 algorithm and the naive Bayes classifier as the root and leaf classifiers respectively, can also be regarded as training naive Bayes classifiers in decision regions of the C4.5 algorithm. We propose a second division (SD) algorithm and three soft second division (SD-soft) algorithms to train classifiers in decision regions of the naive Bayes classifier. These four novel algorithms all generate two-level classifier trees with the naive Bayes classifier as root classifiers. The SD and three SD-soft algorithms can make good use of both the information contained in instances near decision boundaries, and those that may be ignored by the naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we conduct experiments on 30 data sets from the UC Irvine (UCI) repository. Experiment results show that the SD algorithm can obtain better generalization abilities than the NBTree and the averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) algorithms when using the C4.5 algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) as leaf classifiers. Further experiments indicate that our three SD-soft algorithms can achieve better generalization abilities than the SD algorithm when argument values are selected appropriately.

J	Kim, HJ				Kim, Han-joon			An Effective EM Extension of Naive Bayes Text Classifier with Uncertainty-based Selective Sampling	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Text Classification; Machine Learning; Naive Bayes; EM Algorithm; Selective Sampling; Classification Uncertainty		One of the most appropriate algorithms for operational text classification systems is the Naive Bayes because it is not only easy to incrementally update its pre-learned classification model and feature space, but also surprisingly accurate in spite of its wrong independence assumption. This paper focuses on improving Naive Bayes classifier by accelerating the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm. The multinomial Naive Bayes text classifier is extended with an accelerated EM algorithm that is simple yet has a fast convergence speed and allows estimating a more accurate classification model through automatic selective sampling. Throughout experiments using the well-known Reuters-21578 news collection, we show that the traditional Naive Bayes classifier can be significantly improved by the extended Naive Bayes algorithm with EM and selective sampling algorithms.

J	Parks, DH; MacDonald, NJ; Beiko, RG				Parks, Donovan H.; MacDonald, Norman J.; Beiko, Robert G.			Classifying short genomic fragments from novel lineages using composition and homology	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; PHYLOGENETIC CLASSIFICATION; DNA FRAGMENTS; SEQUENCES; COMMUNITIES; METAGENOMICS; EVOLUTIONARY; ASSIGNMENT; READS; SEA	Background: The assignment of taxonomic attributions to DNA fragments recovered directly from the environment is a vital step in metagenomic data analysis. Assignments can be made using rank-specific classifiers, which assign reads to taxonomic labels from a predetermined level such as named species or strain, or rank-flexible classifiers, which choose an appropriate taxonomic rank for each sequence in a data set. The choice of rank typically depends on the optimal model for a given sequence and on the breadth of taxonomic groups seen in a set of close-to-optimal models. Homology-based (e.g., LCA) and composition-based (e. g., PhyloPythia, TACOA) rank-flexible classifiers have been proposed, but there is at present no hybrid approach that utilizes both homology and composition. Results: We first develop a hybrid, rank-specific classifier based on BLAST and Naive Bayes (NB) that has comparable accuracy and a faster running time than the current best approach, PhymmBL. By substituting LCA for BLAST or allowing the inclusion of suboptimal NB models, we obtain a rank-flexible classifier. This hybrid classifier outperforms established rank-flexible approaches on simulated metagenomic fragments of length 200 bp to 1000 bp and is able to assign taxonomic attributions to a subset of sequences with few misclassifications. We then demonstrate the performance of different classifiers on an enhanced biological phosphorous removal metagenome, illustrating the advantages of rank-flexible classifiers when representative genomes are absent from the set of reference genomes. Application to a glacier ice metagenome demonstrates that similar taxonomic profiles are obtained across a set of classifiers which are increasingly conservative in their classification. Conclusions: Our NB-based classification scheme is faster than the current best composition-based algorithm, Phymm, while providing equally accurate predictions. The rank-flexible variant of NB, which we term epsilon-NB, is complementary to LCA and can be combined with it to yield conservative prediction sets of very high confidence. The simple parameterization of LCA and epsilon-NB allows for tuning of the balance between more predictions and increased precision, allowing the user to account for the sensitivity of downstream analyses to misclassified or unclassified sequences.

A Transcriptomic Atlas of Mouse Neocortical Layers	NEURON			English	Article							LONG NONCODING RNAS; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; GENE-EXPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NMDA RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; CELL-TYPES; NEURONS	In the mammalian cortex, neurons and glia form a patterned structure across six layers whose complex cytoarchitectonic arrangement is likely to contribute to cognition. We sequenced transcriptomes from layers 1-6b of different areas (primary and secondary) of the adult (postnatal day 56) mouse somatosensory cortex to understand the transcriptional levels and functional repertoires of coding and noncoding loci for cells constituting these layers. A total of 5,835 protein-coding genes and 66 noncoding RNA loci are differentially expressed ("patterned") across the layers, on the basis of a machine-learning model (naive Bayes) approach. Layers 2-6b are each associated with specific functional and disease annotations that provide insights into their biological roles. This new resource (http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers) greatly extends currently available resources, such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and microarray data sets, by providing quantitative expression levels, by being genome-wide, by including novel loci, and by identifying candidate alternatively spliced transcripts that are differentially expressed across layers.

Although a number of tools have been developed to identify optimal gene expression signatures, they often generate gene lists that are too long to be exploited clinically. Consequently, researchers in the field try to identify the smallest set of genes that provide good sample classification. We investigated the genome-wide expression of the inflammatory phenotype in dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are a complex group of cells that play a critical role in vertebrate immunity. Therefore, the prediction of the inflammatory phenotype in these cells may help with the selection of immune-modulating compounds. Results: A data mining protocol was applied to microarray data for murine cell lines treated with various inflammatory stimuli. The learning and validation data sets consisted of 155 and 49 samples, respectively. The data mining protocol reduced the number of probe sets from 5,802 to 10, then from 10 to 6 and finally from 6 to 3. The performances of a set of supervised classification models were compared. The best accuracy, when using the six following genes -II12b, Cd40, Socs3, Irgm1, Plin2 and Lgals3bp- was obtained by Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbour (91.8%). Using the smallest set of three genes -II12b, Cd40 and Socs3- the performance remained satisfactory and the best accuracy was with Support Vector Machine (95.9%). These data mining models, using data for the genes II12b, Cd40 and Socs3, were validated with a human data set consisting of 27 samples. Support Vector Machines (71.4%) and Nearest Neighbour (92.6%) gave the worst performances, but the remaining models correctly classified all the 27 samples. Conclusions: The genes selected by the data mining protocol proposed were shown to be informative for discriminating between inflammatory and steady-state phenotypes in dendritic cells. The robustness of the data mining protocol was confirmed by the accuracy for a human data set, when using only the following three genes: II12b, Cd40 and Socs3. In summary, we analysed the longitudinal pattern of expression in dendritic cells stimulated with activating agents with the aim of identifying signatures that would predict or explain the dentritic cell response to an inflammatory agent.

Similar to the sliding window-based object detection, action detection finds the reoccurrences of such spatiotemporal patterns through pattern matching, by handling cluttered and dynamic backgrounds and other types of action variations. We address two critical issues in pattern matching-based action detection: 1) the intrapattern variations in actions, and 2) the computational efficiency in performing action pattern search in cluttered scenes. First, we propose a discriminative pattern matching criterion for action classification, called naive Bayes mutual information maximization (NBMIM). Each action is characterized by a collection of spatiotemporal invariant features and we match it with an action class by measuring the mutual information between them. Based on this matching criterion, action detection is to localize a subvolume in the volumetric video space that has the maximum mutual information toward a specific action class. A novel spatiotemporal branch-and-bound (STBB) search algorithm is designed to efficiently find the optimal solution. Our proposed action detection method does not rely on the results of human detection, tracking, or background subtraction. It can handle action variations such as performing speed and style variations as well as scale changes well. It is also insensitive to dynamic and cluttered backgrounds and even to partial occlusions. The cross-data set experiments on action detection, including KTH, CMU action data sets, and another new MSR action data set, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed multiclass multiple-instance action detection method.

Comparative study of supervised classification algorithms for the detection of atmospheric pollution	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; Machine learning; Multilayer perceptron; Artificial neural network; Support vector machine; Bayesian network; Nearest neighbour; Decision tree; Fuzzy model; Air pollution	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	The management of atmospheric pollution using video is not yet widespread. However it is an efficient way to evaluate the polluting rejects coming from large industrial facilities when traditional captors are not usable. This paper presents a comparison of different classifiers for a monitoring system of polluting smokes. The data used in this work are stemming from a system of video analysis and signal processing. The database includes the pollution level of puffs of smoke defined by an expert. Six machine learning techniques are tested and compared to classify the puffs of smoke: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes classifier, artificial neural network, decision tree, support vector machine and a fuzzy model. The parameters of each type of classifier are split into three categories: learned parameters, parameters determined by a first step of the experimentation, and parameters set by the programmer. We compare the results of the best classifier of each type depending on the size of the learning set. A part of the discussion concerns the robustness of the classifier facing the case where classes of interest are under-represented, as the high level of pollution in our data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Tissue-specific prediction of directly regulated genes	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							FACTOR-BINDING-SITES; HUMAN GENOME; CELLS; PLURIPOTENT; MODEL; MAPS	Direct binding by a transcription factor (TF) to the proximal promoter of a gene is a strong evidence that the TF regulates the gene. Assaying the genome-wide binding of every TF in every cell type and condition is currently impractical. Histone modifications correlate with tissue/cell/condition-specific ('tissue specific') TF binding, so histone ChIP-seq data can be combined with traditional position weight matrix (PWM) methods to make tissue-specific predictions of TF-promoter interactions. Results: We use supervised learning to train a naive Bayes predictor of TF-promoter binding. The predictor's features are the histone modification levels and a PWM-based score for the promoter. Training and testing uses sets of promoters labeled using TF ChIP-seq data, and we use cross-validation on 23 such datasets to measure the accuracy. A PWM+histone naive Bayes predictor using a single histone modification (H3K4me3) is substantially more accurate than a PWM score or a conservation-based score (phylogenetic motif model). The naive Bayes predictor is more accurate (on average) at all sensitivity levels, and makes only half as many false positive predictions at sensitivity levels from 10% to 80%. On average, it correctly predicts 80% of bound promoters at a false positive rate of 20%. Accuracy does not diminish when we test the predictor in a different cell type (and species) from training. Accuracy is barely diminished even when we train the predictor without using TF ChIP-seq data.

In this study, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the curvature detection of embedded tactile sensors by proposing a ridged fingertip structure, simulating human fingerprints. In addition, a curvature detection approach based on machine learning methods is proposed to provide the embedded sensors with the ability to discriminate the surface curvature of different objects. For this purpose, a set of experiments were carried out to collect tactile signals from a 2 x 2 tactile sensor array, then the signals were processed and used for learning algorithms. To achieve the best possible performance for our machine learning approach, three different learning algorithms of Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared for various parameters. Finally, the most accurate method was selected to evaluate the proposed skin structure in recognition of three different curvatures. The results showed an accuracy rate of 97.5% in surface curvature discrimination.

An Analysis of Argentina's Infamous Decade Using Supervised Machine Learning	POLITICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							BENFORDS LAW; ELECTORAL FRAUD; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; CLASSIFIER; OPTIMALITY; SYSTEMS; BAYES	In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to diagnose electoral fraud using vote counts. Specifically, we use synthetic data to develop and train a fraud detection prototype. We employ a naive Bayes classifier as our learning algorithm and rely on digital analysis to identify the features that are most informative about class distinctions. To evaluate the detection capability of the classifier, we use authentic data drawn from a novel data set of district-level vote counts in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) between 1931 and 1941, a period with a checkered history of fraud. Our results corroborate the validity of our approach: The elections considered to be irregular (legitimate) by most historical accounts are unambiguously classified as fraudulent (clean) by the learner. More generally, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating and using synthetic data for training and testing an electoral fraud detection system.

In this study, we have used an ensemble of mixed learning algorithms and mixed features for the development of a model to predict hepatic effects. This robust method is based on the premise that no single learning algorithm is optimum for all modelling problems. An ensemble model of 617 base classifiers was built from a diverse set of 1,087 compounds. The ensemble model was validated internally with five-fold cross-validation and 25 rounds of y-randomization. In the external validation of 120 compounds, the ensemble model had achieved an accuracy of 75.0%, sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 64.6%. The model was also able to identify 22 of 23 withdrawn drugs or drugs with black box warning against hepatotoxicity. Dronedarone which is associated with severe liver injuries, announced in a recent FDA drug safety communication, was predicted as hepatotoxic by the ensemble model. It was found that the ensemble model was capable of classifying positive compounds ( with hepatic effects) well, but less so on negatives compounds when they were structurally similar. The ensemble model built in this study is made available for public use.

J	Kang, DK; Kim, MJ				Kang, Dae-Ki; Kim, Myoung-Jong			Propositionalized attribute taxonomies from data for data-driven construction of concise classifiers	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Propositionalization; Taxonomy; Naive Bayes learner		In this paper, we consider the problem of generating concise but accurate naive Bayes classifiers using taxonomy of propositionalized attributes. For the problem, we introduce propositionalized attribute taxonomy guided naive Bayes Learner (PAT-NBL), a machine learning algorithm that effectively utilizes taxonomy to generate compact classifiers. We extend classical naive Bayes learner to the PAT-NBL algorithm that traverses over a propositionalized taxonomy to search for a locally optimal cut. PAT-NBL uses bottom-up search to find the locally optimal cut on a given taxonomy. For the evaluation of candidate cuts, we apply conditional log-likelihood, conditional minimum description length, and conditional Akaike information criterion. The detected cut enables PAT-NBL to construct an instance space which corresponds to the taxonomy and the data. That is, after PAT-NBL determines a cut according to its information-theoretic criteria, the algorithm generates a concise naive Bayes classifier based on the cut. Our experimental results on UCI Machine Learning benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm can generate naive Bayes classifiers that are more compact and often comparably accurate to those produced by standard naive Bayes learners.

Prior to generating all the models for comparison, the initial set of data is also loaded into an ETL (extraction, transformation, loading) system developed to perform feature selection or attribute relevancy analysis using ID3 algorithm, compiling a subset of data with the highest information gain and gain ratio. An extended test is performed to use equal length binning on some attributes to find if it affects the relevancy of each attribute. The selected subset of data of 24 months is used to generate various data mining models using different training and testing sizes and binning sizes. C5 emerged consistently as the technique that have generated the best models with an average predictive accuracy as high as 94.68%. Sample sizes, equal-length binning sizes and training and testing sizes are all shown to have an effect on accuracy in different intensity.

An AR system trained in an environment would only be applicable to that environment. Such a system would not be able to recognize the new activities of interest. In this paper we propose a General-Purpose Activity Recognition System (GPARS) using simple and ubiquitous sensors. It would be applicable to almost any environment and would have the ability to handle growing amounts of activities and sensors in a graceful manner (Scalable). Given a set of activities to monitor, object names (with embedded sensors) and their corresponding locations, the GPARS first mines activity knowledge from the web, and then uses them as the basis of AR. The novelty of our system, compared to the existing general-purpose systems, lies in: (1) it uses more robust activity models, (2) it significantly reduces the mining time. We have tested our system with three real world datasets. It is observed that the accuracy of activity recognition using our system is more than 80%. Our proposed mechanism yields significant improvement (more than 30%) in comparison with its counterpart.

In auditory temporal assimilation, two neighboring physically unequal time intervals marked by three successive tone bursts are illusorily perceived as equal if the two time intervals satisfy a certain relationship. The classifiers could discriminate whether or not the subject was engaged in the task, which was judgment of the subjective equality between the two intervals, at an accuracy of > 79%, and from principal component scores of individual average ERP waveforms, we were able to predict their subjective judgments to each stimulus at an accuracy of > 70%. Chernoff information, unlike accuracy or Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance, suggested brain activation associated with auditory temporal assimilation at an early pre-decision stage. This may provide us with a simple and useful neural decoding scheme in analyzing information processing of temporal patterns in the brain.

To achieve optimal image quality for each halftoning method, the classification of halftone images is highly demanded. This study employed the least mean-square filter for improving the robustness of the extracted features, and employed the naive Bayes classifier to verify all the extracted features for classification. Nine of the most well-known halftoning methods were involved for testing. The experimental results demonstrated that the classification performance can achieve a 100% accuracy rate, and the number of distinguishable halftoning methods is more than that of a former method established by Chang and Yu.

Optimal row and column ordering to improve table interpretation using estimation of distribution algorithms	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						Bertin matrices; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Ordering of tables; Conciseness; Parametrization; Selective naive Bayes	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS	A common information representation task in research as well as educational and statistical practice is to comprehensively and intuitively express data in two-dimensional tables. Examples include tables in scientific papers, as well as reports and the popular press. Data is often simple enough for users to reorder. In many other cases though, there are complex data patterns that make finding the best re-arrangement of rows and columns for optimum readability a tough problem. We propose that row and column ordering should be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using evolutionary computation techniques. The use of genetic algorithms has already been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes for the first time the use of estimation of distribution algorithms for table ordering. We also propose alternative ways of representing the problem in order to reduce its dimensionality. By learning a selective naive Bayes classifier, we can find out how to jointly combine the parameters of these algorithms to get good table orderings. Experimental examples in this paper are on 2D tables.

Document-level classification of CT pulmonary angiography reports based on an extension of the ConText algorithm	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical language processing; ConText; Pulmonary emboli; Computed tomography; CTPA	TEXT; PNEUMONIA; INFORMATION; RADIOLOGY; EVENTS; SYSTEM	In this paper we describe an application called peFinder for document-level classification of CT pulmonary angiography reports. peFinder is based on a generalized version of the ConText algorithm, a simple text processing algorithm for identifying features in clinical report documents. peFinder was used to answer questions about the disease state (pulmonary emboli present or absent), the certainty state of the diagnosis (uncertainty present or absent), the temporal state of an identified pulmonary embolus (acute or chronic), and the technical quality state of the exam (diagnostic or not diagnostic). Gold standard answers for each question were determined from the consensus classifications of three human annotators. peFinder results were compared to naive Bayes' classifiers using unigrams and bigrams. The sensitivities (and positive predictive values) for peFinder were 0.98(0.83), 0.86(0.96), 0.94(0.93), and 0.60(0.90) for disease state, quality state, certainty state, and temporal state respectively, compared to 0.68(0.77), 0.67(0.87), 0.62(0.82), and 0.04(0.25) for the naive Bayes' classifier using unigrams, and 0.75(0.79), 0.52(0.69), 0.59(0.84), and 0.04(0.25) for the naive Bayes' classifier using bigrams.

We apply our method to proteins from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and show that, in comparison with other approaches, it predicts protein functions with significantly higher recall with no loss of precision. Specifically, it achieves 51% precision and 60% recall versus 45% and 26% for Majority and 24% and 61% for chi(2)-statistics, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, HJ; Liu, G; Chow, TWS; Liu, WY				Zhang, Haijun; Liu, Gang; Chow, Tommy W. S.; Liu, Wenyin			Textual and Visual Content-Based Anti-Phishing: A Bayesian Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Bayes theory; classifier; data fusion; phishing detection; web page	EARTH MOVERS DISTANCE; SIMILARITY ASSESSMENT; WEB PAGES; CLASSIFICATION	A novel framework using a Bayesian approach for content-based phishing web page detection is presented. Our model takes into account textual and visual contents to measure the similarity between the protected web page and suspicious web pages. A text classifier, an image classifier, and an algorithm fusing the results from classifiers are introduced. An outstanding feature of this paper is the exploration of a Bayesian model to estimate the matching threshold. This is required in the classifier for determining the class of the web page and identifying whether the web page is phishing or not. In the text classifier, the naive Bayes rule is used to calculate the probability that a web page is phishing. In the image classifier, the earth mover's distance is employed to measure the visual similarity, and our Bayesian model is designed to determine the threshold. In the data fusion algorithm, the Bayes theory is used to synthesize the classification results from textual and visual content. The effectiveness of our proposed approach was examined in a large-scale dataset collected from real phishing cases. Experimental results demonstrated that the text classifier and the image classifier we designed deliver promising results, the fusion algorithm outperforms either of the individual classifiers, and our model can be adapted to different phishing cases.

Medications are not always effectively used and misuse may harm patients. Drugs are the fastest-growing element of Canadian health care spending, second only to hospital spending. Three hundred million prescriptions are filled annually. Prescription drugs accounted for 5.8% of total health care spending in 1980 and close to 18% today. A primary long-term goal of this research is to develop a decision support system for evidence-based management, quality control and best practice recommendations for medical prescriptions. Our results will improve accessibility and management of information by: (1) building an prototype for adaptive information extraction, text and data mining from (online) documents to find evidence on which to base best practices; and (2) employing multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) to infer a probabilistic interpretation to validate evidence for recommendations; MSBNs provide this structure. Best practices to improve drug-related health outcomes; patients' quality of life; and cost-effective use of medications by changing knowledge and behavior. This research will support next generation eHealth decision support systems, which routinely find and verify evidence from multiple sources, leading to cost-effective use of drugs, improve patients' quality of life and optimize drug-related health outcomes.

OCA: Opinion Corpus for Arabic	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Sentiment analysis is a challenging new task related to text mining and natural language processing. Although there are, at present, several studies related to this theme, most of these focus mainly on English texts. The resources available for opinion mining (OM) in other languages are still limited. In this article, we present a new Arabic corpus for the OM task that has been made available to the scientific community for research purposes. The corpus contains 500 movie reviews collected from different web pages and blogs in Arabic, 250 of them considered as positive reviews, and the other 250 as negative opinions. Furthermore, different experiments have been carried out on this corpus, using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines and Naive Bayes. The results obtained are very promising and we are encouraged to continue this line of research.

J	Wang, TY; Chiang, HM				Wang, Tai-Yue; Chiang, Huei-Min			Solving multi-label text categorization problem using support vector machine approach with membership function	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-label; One-against-one support vector machine; Membership function	SIMILARITY MEASURES; RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; SETS	The pervasiveness of information available on the internet means that increasing numbers of documents must be classified. Text categorization is not only undertaken by domain experts, but also by automatic text categorization systems. Therefore, a text categorization system with a multi-label classifier is necessary to process the large number of documents. In this study, a proposed multi-label text categorization system is developed to classify multi-label documents. Data mapping is performed to transform data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space with paired SVM output values, thus lowering the complexity of the computation. A pairwise comparison approach is applied to set the membership function in each predicted class to judge all possible classified classes. To better explain the proposed model, a comparative study using Reuter's data sets is performed on several multi-label approaches such as Naive Bayes, Multi-Label Mixture, Jaccard Kernel and Bp-MLL. Though the comparative results of the empirical experiment indicate that the proposed multi-label text categorization system performs better than other methods in terms of overall performance indices, these comparisons are done under the conditions without knowing original settings of parameters. From these comparative studies, it is found that these probabilities of documents appearing in correctly predicted classes and those of documents appearing in the wrongly predicted classes are important properties and we conclude that the probability of 0.5 for model membership function is a good criterion to judge between correctly and incorrectly classified documents from the results of the empirical experiment.

Performance analysis of a Bayesian classifier for the detection of human presence using total power and correlation radiometry	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							MILLIMETER-WAVE; SECURITY; IDENTIFICATION; THRESHOLD; TERAHERTZ; OBJECTS	This study presents a performance analysis of a new method of detecting and classifying non-moving humans from a moving platform in real time using millimetre-wave radiometry. The implementation of the detection method is a naive Bayes classifier which operates on signals produced by two K-a-band total power receivers, one W-band total power receiver and one K-a-band correlation receiver. Processing of the radiometric signals involves median filtering and passive range estimation prior to the signals being classified by the Bayesian algorithm. Experimental results are shown and a performance evaluation of the classifier is given using the F-1-measure and the receiver operating characteristic. A maximum F-1-measure of 0.68 is achieved, and the area under the receiver operating curve is 0.94 and 0.98 for passive and active ranging, respectively. The maximum true positive rate was 0.85 (passive) and 0.92 (active) both corresponding to F-1 = 0.48. The processing time required for classification is shown to be less than 50% of the experimental time, permitting real-time operation.	[Nanzer, J.

Selecting Relevant Descriptors for Classification by Bayesian Estimates: A Comparison with Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines Approaches for Disparate Data Sets	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Chemoinformatics; Drug design; Feature selection; in silico-ADMET; Machine learning; Molecular descriptors; Naive Bayes classifier	CYTOCHROME-P450 3A4; PHARMACOPHORE MODEL; COMBINED PROTEIN; DRUG-METABOLISM; SHANNON ENTROPY; PREDICTION; CYP2D6; 2C9; 2D6; INFORMATION	Classification algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which leads to overfitting, particularly if the problem is over-determined. Therefore it is of particular interest to identify the most relevant descriptors to reduce the complexity. We applied Bayesian estimates to model the probability distribution of descriptors values used for binary classification using n-fold cross-validation. As a measure for the discriminative power of the classifiers, the symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of their probability distributions was computed. We found that the most relevant descriptors possess a Gaussian-like distribution of their values, show the largest divergences, and therefore appear most often in the cross-validation scenario. The results were compared to those of the LASSO feature selection method applied to multiple decision trees and support vector machine approaches for data sets of substrates and nonsubstrates of three Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which comprise strongly unbalanced compound distributions. In contrast to decision trees and support vector machines, the performance of Bayesian estimates is less affected by unbalanced data sets. This strategy reveals those descriptors that allow a simple linear separation of the classes, whereas the superior accuracy of decision trees and support vector machines can be attributed to nonlinear separation, which are in turn more prone to overfitting.

A statistical signal-processing algorithm known as estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques is used to extract new features from measurements of the voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling as islanding indicators. The new features are defined based on a damped-sinusoid model for power system voltage and frequency waveforms, and include modal initial amplitudes, oscillation frequencies, damping factors, and initial phases. A set of training cases generated on the IEEE 34-bus system was used to train a naive-Bayes classifier that discriminates islanding and nonislanding events. Cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed islanding detection method. The results show that by using the new features extracted from ESPRIT, the classifier is capable of discriminating islanding and nonislanding events with an accuracy close to 100%.	[Najy, Waleed K.

This method is highly sensitive resulting in overall auto-rater agreement of 93%, comparable to an inter-rater agreement between two human scorers (92%), with high sensitivity and specificity values for wake (94% and 96%), NREM sleep (94% and 97%) and REM sleep (89% and 97%) states. In addition to baseline sleep-wake conditions, the performance of the naive Bayes classifier was assessed in sleep deprivation and drug infusion experiments, as well as in aged and transgenic animals using multiple EEC derivations. 24-h recordings from 30 different animals were used, with approximately 5% of the data manually scored as training data for the classification algorithm.

Effect of SVM kernel functions on classification of vibration signals of a single point cutting tool	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision Tree; Statistical features; Support Vector Machine; Tool condition monitoring	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; ROLLER BEARING; WEAR; NETWORKS	The studies on tool condition monitoring along with digital signal processing can be used to prevent damages on cutting tools and workpieces when the tool conditions become faulty. These studies have become more relevant in today's context where the order realization dates are crunched and deadlines are to be met in order to catch up with the competition. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is extensively used to probe into structural health of the tool and the process. This paper discusses condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool using Support Vector Machine and compares the classification efficiency between C-SVC and v-SVC. It further analyses the results with other classifiers like Decision Tree and Naive Bayes and Bayes Net. The vibration signals are acquired for various tool conditions like tool-good condition, tip-breakage, etc. The effort is to bring out the better features-classifier combination.

The presence of class and attribute noise in software measurement datasets degrades the performance of machine learning-based classifiers, and the identification of these noisy modules improves the overall performance. In this study, we propose a noise detection algorithm based on software metrics threshold values. The threshold values are obtained from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. This paper focuses on case studies of five public NASA datasets and details the construction of Naive Bayes-based software fault prediction models both before and after applying the proposed noise detection algorithm. Experimental results show that this noise detection approach is very effective for detecting the class noise and that the performance of fault predictors using a Naive Bayes algorithm with a logNum filter improves if the class labels of identified noisy modules are corrected.

MCE Training Techniques for Topic Identification of Spoken Audio Documents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Discriminative training; machine learning; speech recognition; topic identification		In this paper, we discuss the use of minimum classification error (MCE) training as a means for improving traditional approaches to topic identification such as naive Bayes classifiers and support vector machines. A key element of our new MCE training techniques is their ability to efficiently apply jackknifing or leave-one-out training to yield improved models which generalize better to unseen data. Experiments were conducted using recorded human-human telephone conversations from the Fisher Corpus using feature vector representations from word-based automatic speech recognition lattices. Sizeable improvements in topic identification accuracy using the new MCE training techniques were observed.

J	Atlam, ES; Morita, K; Fuketa, M; Aoe, JI				Atlam, El-Sayed; Morita, Kazuhiro; Fuketa, Masao; Aoe, Jun-ichi			A New Approach for Arabic Text Classification Using Arabic Field-Association Terms	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DOCUMENTS; KNOWLEDGE; WORDS	Field-association (FA) terms give us the knowledge to identify document fields using a limited set of discriminating terms. Although many earlier methods tried to extract automatically relevant FA terms to build a comprehensive dictionary, the problem lies in the lack of an effective method to extract automatically relevant FA terms to build a comprehensive dictionary. Moreover, all previous studies are based on FA terms in English and Japanese, and the extension of FA terms to other languages such as Arabic could benefit future research in the field. We present a new method to build a comprehensive Arabic dictionary using part-of-speech, pattern rules, and corpora in Arabic language. Experimental evaluation is carried out for various fields using 251 MB of domain-specific corpora obtained from Arabic Wikipedia dumps and Alhayah news selected average of 2,825 FA terms (single and compound) per field. From the experimental results, recall and precision are 84% and 79%, respectively. We propose amended text classification methodology based on field association terms. Our approach is compared with Naive Bayes (NB) and kNN classifiers on 5,959 documents from Wikipedia dumps and Alhayah news. The new approach achieved a precision of 80.65% followed by NB (72.79%) and kNN (36.15%).

J	Liu, Z; Zhang, QM; Lu, LY; Zhou, T				Liu, Zhen; Zhang, Qian-Ming; Lu, Linyuan; Zhou, Tao			Link prediction in complex networks: A local naive Bayes model	EPL			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; INTERACTOME	The common-neighbor-based method is simple yet effective to predict missing links, which assume that two nodes are more likely to be connected if they have more common neighbors. In the traditional method, each common neighbor of two nodes contributes equally to the connection likelihood. In this letter, we argue that different common neighbors may play different roles and thus contributes differently, and propose a local naive Bayes model. Extensive experiments were carried out on nine real networks. Compared with the traditional method, the present method can provide more accurate predictions.

In this paper we derive the BIC for the binary graphical tree models where all the inner nodes of a tree represent binary hidden variables. This provides an extension of a similar formula given by Rusakov and Geiger for naive Bayes models. The main tool used in this paper is the connection between the growth behavior of marginal likelihood integrals and the real log-canonical threshold.

When mining knowledge from emerging applications such as sensor networks or location based services, data uncertainty should be handled cautiously to avoid erroneous results. In this paper, we apply probabilistic and statistical theory on uncertain data and develop a novel method to calculate conditional probabilities of Bayes theorem. Based on that, we propose a novel Bayesian classification algorithm for uncertain data. The experimental results show that the proposed method classifies uncertain data with potentially higher accuracies than the Naive Bayesian approach. It also has a more stable performance than the existing extended Naive Bayesian method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A less invasive strategy is to identify neoplasia by analyzing biomarkers from the more accessible rectum to predict the need for a full colonoscopy. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate whether optical markers of rectal mucosa derived from a novel optical technique, partial-wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS), could identify UC patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer (CA) present anywhere in their colon. Methods: Banked frozen nondysplastic mucosal rectal biopsies were used from 28 UC patients (15 without dysplasia and 13 with concurrent HGD or CA). The specimen slides were made using a touch prep method and underwent PWS analysis. We divided the patients into two groups: 13 as a training set and an independent 15 as a validation set. Results: We identified six optical markers, ranked by measuring the information gain with respect to the outcome of cancer. The most effective markers were selected by maximizing the cross-validated training accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier. The optimal classifier was applied to the validation data yielding 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the PWS-derived optical markers can accurately predict UC patients with HGD/CA through assessment of rectal epithelial cells. By aiming for high sensitivity, our approach could potentially simplify the surveillance of UC patients and improve overall resource utilization by identifying patients with HGD/CA who should proceed with colonoscopy.

J	Kotsiantis, SB				Kotsiantis, S. B.			An incremental ensemble of classifiers	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Incremental classifier; Online learning; Classification	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Along with the increase of data and information, incremental learning ability turns out to be more and more important for machine learning approaches. The online algorithms try not to remember irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms). Today, combining classifiers is proposed as a new road for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. For this reason, we propose an incremental ensemble that combines five classifiers that can operate incrementally: the Naive Bayes, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), the 3-Nearest Neighbors, the Non-Nested Generalised Exemplars (NNGE) and the Kstar algorithms using the voting methodology. We performed a large-scale comparison of the proposed ensemble with other state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets and the proposed method produce better accuracy in most cases.

J	Cai, T; Liu, WD				Cai, Tony; Liu, Weidong			A Direct Estimation Approach to Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Classification; Constrained l(1) minimization; Fisher's rule; Naive Bayes rule; Sparsity	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; GENE-EXPRESSION; MATRIX ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER	This article considers sparse linear discriminant analysis of high-dimensional data. In contrast to the existing methods which are based on separate estimation of the precision matrix Omega and the difference delta of the mean vectors, we introduce a simple and effective classifier by estimating the product Omega delta directly through constrained l(1) minimization. The estimator can be implemented efficiently using linear programming and the resulting classifier is called the linear programming discriminant (LPD) rule. The LPD rule is shown to have desirable theoretical and numerical properties. It exploits the approximate sparsity of Omega delta and as a consequence allows cases where it can still perform well even when Omega and/or delta cannot be estimated consistently. Asymptotic properties of the LPD rule are investigated and consistency and rate of convergence results are given. The LPD classifier has superior finite sample performance and significant computational advantages over the existing methods that require separate estimation of Omega and delta. The LPD rule is also applied to analyze real datasets from lung cancer and leukemia studies. The classifier performs favorably in comparison to existing methods.

J	Seymour, E; Damle, R; Sette, A; Peters, B				Seymour, Emily; Damle, Rohini; Sette, Alessandro; Peters, Bjoern			Cost sensitive hierarchical document classification to triage PubMed abstracts for manual curation	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							IMMUNE EPITOPE DATABASE; MEDLINE CITATIONS; ANALYSIS RESOURCE; SUPPORT; CATEGORIZATION	Background: The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) project manually curates information from published journal articles that describe immune epitopes derived from a wide variety of organisms and associated with different diseases. In the past, abstracts of scientific articles were retrieved by broad keyword queries of PubMed, and were classified as relevant (curatable) or irrelevant (not curatable) to the scope of the database by a Naive Bayes classifier. The curatable abstracts were subsequently manually classified into categories corresponding to different disease domains. Over the past four years, we have examined how to further improve this approach in order to enhance classification performance and to reduce the need for manual intervention. Results: Utilizing 89,884 abstracts classified by a domain expert as curatable or uncuratable, we found that a SVM classifier outperformed the previously used Naive Bayes classifier for curatability predictions with an AUC of 0.899 and 0.854, respectively. Next, using a non-hierarchical and a hierarchical application of SVM classifiers trained on 22,833 curatable abstracts manually classified into three levels of disease specific categories we demonstrated that a hierarchical application of SVM classifiers outperformed non-hierarchical SVM classifiers for categorization. Finally, to optimize the hierarchical SVM classifiers' error profile for the curation process, cost sensitivity functions were developed to avoid serious misclassifications. We tested our design on a benchmark dataset of 1,388 references and achieved an overall category prediction accuracy of 94.4%, 93.9%, and 82.1% at the three levels of categorization, respectively. Conclusions: A hierarchical application of SVM algorithms with cost sensitive output weighting enabled high quality reference classification with few serious misclassifications. This enabled us to significantly reduce the manual component of abstract categorization. Our findings are relevant to other databases that are developing their own document classifier schema and the datasets we make available provide large scale real-life benchmark sets for method developers.

J	Yang, L; Agarwal, P				Yang, Lun; Agarwal, Pankaj			Systematic Drug Repositioning Based on Clinical Side-Effects	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE; THERAPY; DISEASE; GLUCOSE; STROKE; MECHANISMS; DISCOVERY; TRIAL; RAT	Drug repositioning helps fully explore indications for marketed drugs and clinical candidates. Here we show that the clinical side-effects (SEs) provide a human phenotypic profile for the drug, and this profile can suggest additional disease indications. We extracted 3,175 SE-disease relationships by combining the SE-drug relationships from drug labels and the drug-disease relationships from PharmGKB. Many relationships provide explicit repositioning hypotheses, such as drugs causing hypoglycemia are potential candidates for diabetes. We built Naive Bayes models to predict indications for 145 diseases using the SEs as features. The AUC was above 0.8 in 92% of these models. The method was extended to predict indications for clinical compounds, 36% of the models achieved AUC above 0.7. This suggests that closer attention should be paid to the SEs observed in trials not just to evaluate the harmful effects, but also to rationally explore the repositioning potential based on this "clinical phenotypic assay''.

J	Li, HN; Wang, N; Gong, P; Perkins, EJ; Zhang, CY				Li, Haoni; Wang, Nan; Gong, Ping; Perkins, Edward J.; Zhang, Chaoyang			Learning the structure of gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression data	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is an approach widely used for reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from time-series microarray data. Its performance in network reconstruction depends on a structure learning algorithm. REVEAL (REVerse Engineering ALgorithm) is one of the algorithms implemented for learning DBN structure and used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRN). However, the two-stage temporal Bayes network (2TBN) structure of DBN that specifies correlation between time slices cannot be obtained by score metrics used in REVEAL. Methods: In this paper, we study a more sophisticated score function for DBN first proposed by Nir Friedman for stationary DBNs structure learning of both initial and transition networks but has not yet been used for reconstruction of GRNs. We implemented Friedman's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score function, modified K2 algorithm to learn Dynamic Bayesian Network structure with the score function and tested the performance of the algorithm for GRN reconstruction with synthetic time series gene expression data generated by GeneNetWeaver and real yeast benchmark experiment data. Results: We implemented an algorithm for DBN structure learning with Friedman's score function, tested it on reconstruction of both synthetic networks and real yeast networks and compared it with REVEAL in the absence or presence of preprocessed network generated by Zou&Conzen's algorithm. By introducing a stationary correlation between two consecutive time slices, Friedman's score function showed a higher precision and recall than the naive REVEAL algorithm. Conclusions: Friedman's score metrics for DBN can be used to reconstruct transition networks and has a great potential to improve the accuracy of gene regulatory network structure prediction with time series gene expression datasets.

In microarray data analyses, two important issues are how to choose genes, which provide reliable and good prediction for disease status, and how to determine the final gene set that is best for classification. Associations among genetic markers mean one can exploit information redundancy to potentially reduce classification cost in terms of time and money. Results: To deal with redundant information and improve classification, we propose a gene selection method, Recursive Feature Addition, which combines supervised learning and statistical similarity measures. To determine the final optimal gene set for prediction and classification, we propose an algorithm, Lagging Prediction Peephole Optimization. By using six benchmark microarray gene expression data sets, we compared Recursive Feature Addition with recently developed gene selection methods: Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination, Leave-One-Out Calculation Sequential Forward Selection and several others. Conclusions: On average, with the use of popular learning machines including Nearest Mean Scaled Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest, Recursive Feature Addition outperformed other methods. Our studies also showed that Lagging Prediction Peephole Optimization is superior to random strategy; Recursive Feature Addition with Lagging Prediction Peephole Optimization obtained better testing accuracies than the gene selection method varSelRF.

Emotional states in judicial courtrooms: An experimental investigation	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Pattern recognition; Application	SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Thanks to the recent progress in the judicial proceedings management, especially related to the introduction of audio/video recording facilities, the challenge of identification of emotional states can be tackled. Discovering affective states embedded into speech signals could help in semantic retrieval of multimedia clips, and therefore in a deep understanding of mechanisms behind courtroom debates and judges/jurors decision making processes. In this paper two main contributions are given: (1) the collection of real-world human emotions coming from courtroom audio recordings; (2) the investigation of a hierarchical classification system, based on a risk minimization method, able to recognize emotional states from speech signatures. The accuracy of the proposed classification approach - named Multilayer Support Vector Machines - has been evaluated by comparing its performance with traditional machine learning approaches, by using both benchmark datasets and real courtroom recordings. Results in recognition obtained by the proposed technique outperform the prediction power achieved by traditional approaches like SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks.

An ensemble of filters and classifiers for microarray data classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature selection; Ensemble methods for classification; Microarray data sets	GENE-EXPRESSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; TUMOR; PREDICTION; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS	In this paper a new framework for feature selection consisting of an ensemble of filters and classifiers is described. Five filters, based on different metrics, were employed. Each filter selects a different subset of features which is used to train and to test a specific classifier. The outputs of these five classifiers are combined by simple voting. In this study three well-known classifiers were employed for the classification task: C4.5, naive-Bayes and IB1. The rationale of the ensemble is to reduce the variability of the features selected by filters in different classification domains. Its adequacy was demonstrated by employing 10 microarray data sets.

Finally, the comparative experiments were carried out to evaluate the new feature set and the seven modelling techniques for customer churn prediction. The experimental results show that the new features with the six modelling techniques are more effective than the existing ones for customer churn prediction in the telecommunication service field.

J	Jiang, SY; Pang, GS; Wu, ML; Kuang, LM				Jiang, Shengyi; Pang, Guansong; Wu, Meiling; Kuang, Limin			An improved K-nearest-neighbor algorithm for text categorization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text categorization; KNN text categorization; One-pass clustering; Spam filtering	CLASSIFICATION; MODEL	Text categorization is a significant tool to manage and organize the surging text data. Many text categorization algorithms have been explored in previous literatures, such as KNN, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. KNN text categorization is an effective but less efficient classification method. In this paper, we propose an improved KNN algorithm for text categorization, which builds the classification model by combining constrained one pass clustering algorithm and KNN text categorization. Empirical results on three benchmark corpora show that our algorithm can reduce the text similarity computation substantially and outperform the-state-of-the-art KNN, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers.

Although, these are usually domain specific, and lack the property of scaling up prediction while handling data sets with huge size and high-dimensionality or imbalance class distribution. This article introduces an accuracy-based learning system called DTGA (decision tree and genetic algorithm) that aims to improve prediction accuracy over any classification problem irrespective to domain, size, dimensionality and class distribution. More specifically, the proposed system consists of two rule inducing phases. In the first phase, a base classifier, C4.5 (a decision tree based rule inducer) is used to produce rules from training data set, whereas GA (genetic algorithm) in the next phase refines them with the aim to provide more accurate and high-performance rules for prediction. The system has been compared with competent non-GA based systems: neural network, Naive Bayes, rule-based classifier using rough set theory and C4.5 (i.e., the base classifier of DTGA), on a number of benchmark datasets collected from UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning repository. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach provides marked improvement in a number of cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Maji, P				Maji, Pradipta			Mutual Information-Based Supervised Attribute Clustering for Microarray Sample Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Microarray analysis; attribute clustering; gene selection; mutual information; classification	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; SUBSET-SELECTION; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PATTERNS; PROFILES; DISEASE; TISSUES; TUMOR	Microarray technology is one of the important biotechnological means that allows to record the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously within a number of different samples. An important application of microarray gene expression data in functional genomics is to classify samples according to their gene expression profiles. Among the large amount of genes presented in gene expression data, only a small fraction of them is effective for performing a certain diagnostic test. Hence, one of the major tasks with the gene expression data is to find groups of coregulated genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with the sample categories or response variables. In this regard, a new supervised attribute clustering algorithm is proposed to find such groups of genes. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories into the attribute clustering process. A new quantitative measure, based on mutual information, is introduced that incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity between attributes. The proposed supervised attribute clustering algorithm is based on measuring the similarity between attributes using the new quantitative measure, whereby redundancy among the attributes is removed. The clusters are then refined incrementally based on sample categories. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of existing supervised and unsupervised gene clustering and gene selection algorithms based on the class separability index and the predictive accuracy of naive bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine on three cancer and two arthritis microarray data sets. The biological significance of the generated clusters is interpreted using the gene ontology. An important finding is that the proposed supervised attribute clustering algorithm is shown to be effective for identifying biologically significant gene clusters with excellent predictive capability.

In the past research work, several text mining approaches have been proposed to predict the severity using advanced learning models. Although these approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of predicting the severity, they do not discuss the problem of how to find the indicators in good quality. In this paper, we discuss whether feature selection can benefit the severity prediction task with three commonly used feature selection schemes, Information Gain, Chi-Square, and Correlation Coefficient, based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes classification approach. We have conducted empirical experiments with four open-source components from Eclipse and Mozilla. The experimental results show that these three feature selection schemes can further improve the predication performance in over half the cases.

Conventional language model (LM)-based TC is solely based on matching the words in the documents and classes by using a naive Bayes classifier (NBC). In the literature, both the term association model (TA), which further considers word-to-word information, and the relevance model (RM), which further considers word-to-document information, have been shown to outperform a simple LM for IR. In this paper, we study a novel integration of TA with RM for LM-NBC-based TC. The new model is called the term relevance dependency model. In the model, the probability of a word given a class is represented by a term association LM probability learned by a RM framework. The results of TC experiments on the 20newsgroups and Reuters-21578 corpora demonstrate that the new model outperforms the standard NBC and several other LM-NBC-based methods.
