Using high-throughput data such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) information to assign putative protein function to the unknown genes has been proposed, since in many cases it is not feasible to annotate the newly discovered genes by sequence-based approaches alone. In addition to PPI data, information such as protein localization within a cell may be employed to improve protein function prediction in two ways: 1) By using such localization information as a direct indicator of protein function (e.g. nucleolus localized proteins might be involved in ribosome biogenesis), and 2) by refining noisy PPI data by localization information. In the latter case, localization information may be used to distinguish different types of PPIs: Namely, interactions between co-localized proteins (more reliable), and interactions between differently localized proteins (potentially less reliable). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method to predict protein function from PPI data and localization information. A Bayesian network is used to model dependencies between protein function, PPI data and localization information. We showed in our cross-validation experiment that in some cases, our method (conditioning PPI data by localization information) significantly improves prediction precision, as compared to a simple Naive Bayes method that assumes PPI data and localization information are conditionally independent given protein function. Finally, we predicted 57 unknown genes as "ribosome biogenesis" proteins.

J	Peng, FC; Huang, XJ				Peng, Fuchun; Huang, Xiangji			Machine learning for Asian language text classification	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						languages; classification; modelling; China; Japan	CATEGORIZATION	Purpose - The purpose of this research is to compare several machine learning techniques on the task of Asian language text classification, such as Chinese and Japanese where no word boundary information is available in written text. The paper advocates a simple language modeling based approach for this task. Design/methodology/approach - Naive Bayes, maximum entropy model, support vector machines, and language modeling approaches were implemented and were applied to Chinese and Japanese text classification. To investigate the influence of word segmentation, different word segmentation approaches were investigated and applied to Chinese text. A segmentation-based approach was compared with the non-segmentation-based approach. Findings - There were two findings: the experiments show that statistical language modeling can significantly outperform standard techniques, given the same set of features; and it was found that classification with word level features normally yields improved classification performance, but that classification performance is not monotonically related to segmentation accuracy. In particular, classification performance may initially improve with increased segmentation accuracy, but eventually classification performance stops improving, and can in fact even decrease, after a certain level of segmentation accuracy. Practical implications - Apply the findings to real web text classification is ongoing work. Originality/value - The paper is very relevant to Chinese and Japanese information processing, e.g. webpage classification, web search.

These recommenders learn a user profile, based on rating feedback from the user on, e.g., books, songs, or TV programs, and use machine learning techniques to infer the ratings of new items. The techniques commonly used are collaborative filtering and naive Bayesian classification, and they are known to have several problems, in particular the cold-start problem and its slow adaptivity to changing user preferences. These problems can be mitigated by allowing the user to set up or manipulate his profile. In this paper, we propose an extension to the naive Bayesian classifier that enhances user control. We do this by maintaining and flexibly integrating two profiles for a user, one learned by rating feedback, and one created by the user. We in particular show how the cold-start problem is mitigated.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a naive Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likes / dislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).

We present an approach based on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for the extraction of user profiles from documents. This approach relies on a knowledge-based WSD algorithm, called JIGSAW, for the semantic indexing of documents: JIGSAW exploits the WordNet lexical database to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. Semantically indexed documents are used to train a naive Bayes learner that infers "semantic", sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes). Two empirical evaluations are described in the paper. In the first experimental session, JIGSAW has been evaluated according to the parameters of the SENSEVAL-3 initiative, that provides a forum where the WSD systems are assessed against disambiguated datasets. The goal of the second, empirical evaluation has been to measure the accuracy of the user profiles in selecting relevant documents to be recommended. Performance of classical keyword-based profiles has been compared to that of sense-based profiles in the task of recommending scientific papers. The results show that sense-based profiles outperform keyword-based ones.

Recently, the transductive approach to reliability estimation has been proved to be very efficient when used with several machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes and decision trees. However, the efficiency of the transductive approach for state-of-the art kernel-based classifiers was not considered. In this work we deal with this problem and apply the transductive reliability methodology with sparse kernel classifiers, specifically the Support Vector Machine and Relevance Vector Machine. Experiments with medical and bioinformatics datasets demonstrate better performance of the transductive approach for reliability estimation compared to reliability measures obtained directly from the output of the classifiers. Furthermore, we apply the methodology in the problem of reliable diagnostics of the coronary artery disease, outperforming the expert physicians' standard approach.

Efficient information theoretic extraction of higher order features for improving neural network-based spam e-mail categorization	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						spam filtering; higher order features; information theoretic feature extraction; naive Bayes; committee machines; Multilayer Perceptrons; linear models for classification		A novel approach for spam e-mail filtering is herein considered based on information theoretic extraction of higher order features and the committee machines neural network models. An extensive experimental study is organized, the most extensive so far in the literature, based on widely accepted benchmarking e-mail data sets, comparing the proposed methodology with the Naive Bayes spam filter as well as with the Boosting tree methodology, the linear models-based classification ( classification via regression) and the nonlinear models-based classification using simple neural network models, including Multilayer Perceptrons. Moreover, several feature extraction approaches based on information theory are evaluated, comparing mainly the proposed higher order feature extraction methodology with information theoretic extraction of single features. It is shown that the former outperforms the latter and, moreover, that the proposed information theoretic Boolean features present a remarkably high spam categorization performance compared to that of their analog counterparts. Finally, it is shown that the committee machines mail categorization performance compares very favorably to the other rival methods' performance, including the Bayes spam filter which is the most widely used approach in the e-mail services market.

A comparative analysis of discretization methods for with Naive Bayesian classifier	ICIT 2006: 9th International Conference on Information Technology, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2006)	DEC 18-21, 2006	Bhubaneswar, INDIA	Orissa Informat Technol Soc, Inst Tech Educ & Res, NJ Inst Technol, Satyam Comp Ltd, IEEE N Jersey Sect				Naive Bayes classifier has gained wide popularity as a probability-based classification method despite its assumption that attributes are conditionally mutually independent given the class label. This paper makes a study into discretization techniques to improve the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes with respect to medical datasets. Our experimental results suggest that on an average, with Minimum Description Length (MDL) discretization the Naive Bayes Classifier seems to be the best performer compared to popular variants of Naive Bayes as well as some popular non-Naive Bayes statistical classifiers.

In this work we describe a Turkish fingerspelling recognition system that recognizes all 29 letters of the Turkish alphabet. A single representative frame is extracted from the sign video, since that frame is enough for recognition purposes of the letters mentioned. Processing a single frame, instead of the whole video, increases speed considerably. The skin regions in the representative frame are extracted by color segmentation in YCrCb space before clearing noise regions by morphological opening. A novel fast alignment method that uses the angle of orientation between the axis of least inertia and y axis is applied to hand regions. This method compensates small orientation differences but increases big ones. This is desirable when differentiating the fingerspelling signs, some of which are close in shape but different in orientation. Also the use of minimum bounding square is advised, which helps in resizing without breaking the alignment. Binary values of this minimum bounding square are directly used as feature values, and that allowed experimenting with different classification schemes. Features like mean radial distance and circularity are also used for increasing success rate. Classifiers like kNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and RBF Network are experimented with, and INN and SVM are found to be the best two of them. The video database was created by 3 different signers, a set of 290 training videos, and a separate set of 174 testing videos are used in experiments. The best classifiers INN and SVM achieved a success rate of 99.43% and 98.83% respectively.

Much work is done manually: curators study large numbers of biomedical documents while updating and annotating organism databases such as MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) and Flybase (a database of the fruit-fly genome). We summarize the annotation process in organism databases, and describe some of the roles played by the Gene Ontology and by document databases such as PubMed Efforts are ongoing to automate parts of the annotation process. Biomedical text mining contests, such as the TREC Genomics Track [6, 7], define annotation subtasks, and provide training and test data. So far, these efforts have focused on the analysis of the text content of documents. We are investigating the analysis of figures in biomedical documents; the information derived from figure analysis may later be combined with the information derived from text analysis. We present an algorithm for using figures in document triage; triage involves determining which documents are relevant to a given annotation task. In our triage algorithm, we segment figures into subfigures and classify the subfigures as Graphical, Gel, Fluorescence Microscopy, and Other Microscopy. A secondary classification into subcategories is performed by clustering, using clusters created from the subfigures in the labeled training data. The classifications of all subfigures in a document are combined to form a document descriptor. The document descriptor is then classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier, as either relevant or irrelevant to the given annotation task.

J	Dong, HC; Hui, SC; He, YL				Dong, Haichao; Hui, Siu Cheung; He, Yulan			Structural analysis of chat messages for topic detection	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						communication; structural analysis; control systems	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Purpose - The purpose of this research is to study the characteristics of chat messages from analysing a collection of 33,121 sample messages gathered from 1,700 sessions of conversations of 72 pairs of MSN Messenger users over a four month duration from June to September of 2005. The primary objective of chat message characterization is to understand the proper-ties of chat messages for effective message analysis, such as message topic detection. Design/methodology/approach - From the study on chat message characteristics, an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection is proposed. In the proposed approach, different techniques such as sessionalisation of chat messages and extraction of features from icon texts and URLs are incorporated for message pre-processing. Naive Bayes, Associative Classification, and Support Vector Machine are employed as classifiers for categorizing topics from chat sessions. Findings - Indicative term-based approach is superior to the traditional document frequency based approach, for feature selection in chat topic categorization. Originality/value - This paper studies the characteristics of chat messages and proposes an indicative term-based categorization approach for chat topic detection.

In this work, we propose a novel method in which the SVMs are generated with the one-vs-rest (OVR) scheme and dynamically organized by the naive Bayes classifiers (NBs). This method might break the ties that frequently occur when working with multi-class classification systems with OVR SVMs. More specifically, we use the Pearson correlation measure to select informative genes and reduce the dimensionality of gene expression profiles when constructing the NBs. The proposed method has been validated on GCM cancer dataset consisting of 14 types of tumors with 16,063 gene expression levels and produced higher accuracy than other methods.

The goal of the present work is to develop user-adaptive temporal thresholds with improved performance characteristics over state-of-the-art fixed ones, which can be accomplished by leveraging both empirical user modeling and machine learning techniques to handle the large individual differences in users' multimodal integration patterns. Using simple Naive Bayes learning methods and a leave-one-out training strategy, our model correctly predicted 88% of users' mixed speech and pen signal input as either unimodal or multimodal, and 91% of their multimodal input as either sequentially or simultaneously integrated. In addition to predicting a user's multimodal pattern in advance of receiving input, predictive accuracies also were evaluated after the first signal's end-point detection-the earliest time when a speech/pen multimodal system makes a decision regarding fusion. This system-centered metric yielded accuracies of 90% and 92%, respectively, for classification of unimodal/multimodal and sequential/simultaneous input patterns. In addition, empirical modeling revealed a.92 correlation between users' multimodal integration pattern and their likelihood of interacting multimodally, which may have accounted for the superior learning obtained with training over heterogeneous user data rather than data partitioned by user subtype. Finally, in large part due to guidance from user-modeling, the techniques reported here required as little as 15 samples to predict a "surprise" user's input patterns.

Our Markov network model is represented as a set of consistent probability distributions on subsets of variables. Inference with such a model can be done efficiently in closed form for problems like class probability estimation. We also propose a highly efficient Bayesian structure learning algorithm for conditional prediction problems, based on integrating along a hill-climb in the structure space. Our prior based on the degrees of freedom effectively prevents overfitting.

But its probability estimation is poor. In many applications, however, accurate probability estimation is often required in order to make optimal decisions. Usually, probability estimation is measured by conditional log likelihood (CLL). There have been some learning algorithms proposed recently to extend naive Bayes for high CLL, such as ERL [8,9] and BNC-2P [10]. Unfortunately, their computational complexity is relatively high. Is there a simple but effective and efficient approach to improve the probability estimation of naive Bayes? In this paper, we propose to use feature selection for this purpose. More precisely, a search process is conducted to select a subset of attributes, and then a naive Bayes is deployed on the selected attribute set. In fact, feature selection has been successfully applied to naive Bayes and achieves significant improvement in classification accuracy. Among the feature selection algorithms for naive Bayes, selective Bayesian classifiers (SBC) by Langley et al. [13] demonstrates good performance. In this paper, we first study the performance of SBC in terms of probability estimation, and then propose an improved SBC algorithm SBC-CLL, in which the CLL score is directly used for attribute selection, instead of using classification accuracy. Our experiments show that both SBC and SBC-CLL achieve significant improvement over naive Bayes, and that SBC-CLL outperforms SBC substantially, in probability estimation measured by CLL. Our work provides an efficient and surprisingly effective approach to improve the probability estimation of naive Bayes.

The heterogeneity among competing standard classification schemes makes the problem only harder. However, the classification task is an indispensable part for successful e-commerce applications. In this paper, we present an automated approach for e-catalog classification. We extend the Naive Bayes Classifier to make use of the structural characteristics of e-catalogs. We show how we can improve the accuracy of classification when appropriate characteristics of e-catalogs are utilized. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through experiments.

Although the pioneering paper based on word length histograms appeared at the very end of the nineteenth century, the resolution power of this and other stylometry approaches is yet to be studied both theoretically and on case studies such that additional information can assist finding the correct attribution. We survey several theoretical approaches including ones approximating the apparently nearly optimal one based on Kolmogorov conditional complexity and some case studies: attributing Shakespeare canon and newly discovered works as well as allegedly M. Twain's newly-discovered works, Federalist papers binary (Madison vs. Hamilton) discrimination using Naive Bayes and other classifiers, and steganography presence testing. The latter topic is complemented by a sketch of an anagrams ambiguity study based on the Shannon cryptography theory.

Inspired by a modified version of the method called the flexible Bayes classifier, we explore the use of linear feature transformations together with the Bayesian classifiers, because it provides us an elegant way to endow the classifier with an external information that is relevant to the task. While the flexible Bayes classifier is based on the idea of using kernel density estimation to obtain the class conditional probabilities of continuously valued attributes, we use the linear transformations to smooth the feature frequency counts of discrete valued attributes. We evaluate the method on the context sensitive spelling error correction problem using the Reuters corpus. For this particular task, we define a positional feature transformation and a word feature transformation that take advantage of the positional information of the context words and the part-of-speech information of words, respectively. Our experimental results show that the performance of the Bayesian classifiers in the natural language disambiguation tasks can be improved with the proposed transformations and that the incorporation of external information via the linear feature transformations is a promising research direction.

In this paper, the impact of lexical feature selection and feature generalization, applied to reviews, on the precision of two probabilistic classifiers (Naive Bayes and Markov Model) with respect to OvOP identification is observed. Feature generalization based on hypernymy as provided by WordNet, and feature selection based on part-of-speech (POS) tags are evaluated. A ranking criterion is introduced, based on a function of the probability of having positive or negative polarity, which makes it possible to achieve 100% precision with 10% recall. Movie reviews are used for training and testing the probabilistic classifiers, which achieve 80% precision.

Due to the highly dynamic and unpredictable characteristic of ubiquitous environments, the trust model should make trust decision dynamically. In this paper, we introduce a novel Naive Bayes classifier based trust model which can dynamically make trust decision in different situations. The trust evaluation is based on service provider's own prior knowledge in stead of assuming variable weights and pre-defined fixed thresholds. This model is also suitable to make decision when only limited information is available in ubiquitous environments. Finally we give the simulation results of our model and the comparison with the related works.

J	Bohme, R; Westfeld, A				Bohme, R; Westfeld, A			Feature-based encoder classification of compressed audio streams	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						MP3 encoder classification; steganography; steganalysis; attacks; digital forensics; naive bayes classifier	STEGANALYSIS; INFORMATION	Today's digital audio coding algorithms use sophisticated models to maximise the encoding rate with minimal audible distortion. As a result of this complexity, different implementations of one encoding standard tend to produce varying output streams for the same uncompressed input data. This article presents a method to distinguish between encoding programs used to compress ISO/MPEG 1 Audio Layer-3 (MP3) files on the basis of statistical features that can be extracted from the compressed streams. The method employs a Bayesian machine learning classifier to determine the most likely encoder from a vector of 10 features. Experimental evidence suggests that the method is reliable enough to decrease the rate of false positives in a stego-detection case. Thus, it can be considered as a generic tool to increase the overall reliability of steganalysis in MP3 files. Moreover, a post-hoc interpretation of the trained classifier's parameters reveals interesting details about the degree of relation between subsets of the 20 encoding programs examined in the study. Further topics, such as implications on the robustness and possible extensions to different file formats are addressed in the discussion.

On the use of likelihood ratios for diagnostic testing with an application to general practice	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Review						Bayes' discriminant function; likelihood ratio; diagnosis; sensitivity; specificity; primary care; urological cancer	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; INFORMATION; SYMPTOMS; SYSTEMS; BAYES; CARE	Purpose. An array of statistical methods is available for 2 6 2 contingency table analysis. These include odds ratios, reliability coefficients and the Chi-squared test. This paper continues the '2 x 2' theme but extends it to look at diagnostic testing. The setting is primary care, the disease is urological cancer. Method. Several statistical indices are discussed to measure diagnostic efficiency; these include sensitivity, specificity and the likelihood ratio. The latter can be converted into a flexible 'weight of evidence', which is equivalent to the naive Bayes' discriminant. Results. The utility of the naive Bayes' discriminant is illustrated in a primary care setting. Conclusion. The naive Bayes' discriminant has proved to be the most durable of statistical discriminants in medical diagnosis. The reason for its durability is ease of use. Despite a concern about independence, it remains a popular choice as a diagnostic aid.

The basic idea is that, if a point or a set of points lies below the line spanned by two other points in ROC space, we can use this information to repair the concavity. This effectively builds a hybrid model combining the two better models with an inversion of the poorer models; in the case of ranking classifiers, it means that certain intervals of the scores are identified as unreliable and candidates for inversion. We report very encouraging results on 23 UCI data sets, particularly for naive Bayes where the use of two validation folds yielded significant improvements on more than half of them, with only one loss.

The Bayesian (or Probabilistic) ANN Classifier is built by the use of a logistic regression model and the back propagation algorithm based on a Bayesian framework. Its performance for this task is evaluated by comparison with other classifiers including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and RBF Networks. A paired West is employed in comparing classifiers to select the optimum model. The system is evaluated using noisy ECG data, to simulate a realworld environment. It is hoped that the system can be further developed and fine-tuned for practical application.

KNN (kappa-nearest neighbor) [11 has been intensively studied as an effective classification model in decades. However, its performance in ranking is unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the ranking performance of KNN. At first, we compare KNN and KNNDW (KNN with distance weighted) to decision trees and naive Bayes in ranking, measured by AUC (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). Then, we propose to improve the ranking performance of KNN by combining KNN with naive Bayes. The idea is that a naive Bayes is learned using the kappa nearest neighbors of the test instance as the training data and used to classify the test instance. A critical problem in combining KNN with naive Bayes is the lack of training data when k is small. We propose to deal with it using sampling to expand the training data. That is, each of the k nearest neighbors is "cloned" and the clones are added to the training data. We call our new model instance cloning local naive Bayes (simply ICLNB). We conduct extensive empirical comparison for the related algorithms in two groups in terms of AUC, using the 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka[2]. In the first group, we compare ICLNB with other types of algorithms C4.4[31, naive Bayes and NBTree[4]. In the second group, we compare ICLNB with KNN, KNNDW and LWNB[5]. Our experimental results show that ICLNB outperforms all those algorithms significantly. From our study, we have two conclusions. First, KNN-relates algorithms performs well in ranking. Second, our new algorithm ICLNB performs best among the algorithms compared in this paper, and could be used in the applications in which an accurate ranking is desired.

We introduce Word Taxonomy guided Naive Bayes Learner for the Multinornial Event Model (WTNBL-MN) that exploits word taxonomy to generate compact classifiers, and Word Taxonomy Learner (WTL) for automated construction of word taxonomy from sequence data. WTNBL-MN is a generalization of the Naive Bayes learner for the Multinomial Event Model for learning classifiers from data using word taxonomy. WTL uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering to cluster words based on the distribution of class labels that co-occur with the words. Our experimental results on protein localization sequences and Reuters text show that the proposed algorithms can generate Naive Bayes classifiers that are more compact and often more accurate than those produced by standard Naive Bayes learner for the Multinomial Model.

In this paper we present four new algorithms for feature/word selection for the purpose of text classification. We use sequential forward selection methods based on improved mutual information criterion functions. The performance of the proposed evaluation functions compared to the information gain which evaluate features individually is discussed. We present experimental results using naive Bayes classifier based on multinomial model, linear support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor classifiers on the Reuters data set. Finally, we analyze the experimental results from various perspectives, including precision, recall and F-1-mcasure.

Each branch of a trained LDT is associated with a probability distribution over classes. In this paper, two hybrid learning models by combining linguistic decision tree and fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier axe proposed. In the first model, an unlabelled instance is classified according to the Bayesian estimation given a single LDT. In the second model, a set of disjoint LDTs axe used as Bayesian estimators. Experimental studies show that the first new hybrid models has both better accuracy and transparency comparing to fuzzy Naive Bayes and LDTs at shallow tree depths. The second model has the equivalent performance to the LDT model.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for this task. Our approach first performs the segmentation of images into regions, followed by the clustering of regions, before learning the associations between concepts and region clusters using the set of training images with pre-assigned concepts. The main focus of this paper and our main contributions are as follows. First, in the learning stage, we perform clustering of regions into region clusters by incorporating pair-wise constraints derived by considering the language model underlying the annotations assigned to training images. Second, in the annotation stage, to alleviate the restriction of the independence assumption between region clusters, we develop a greedy selection and joining algorithm to find the independent sub-sets of region clusters and employ a semi-naive Bayesian (SNB) model to compute the posterior probability of concepts given those independent sub-sets. Experimental results show that our proposed system utilizing these two strategies outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in large image collection.

The system is able to recognize six types of white blood cells (WBC), including a malignancy. This paper investigates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers to recognize WBC for future leukemia diagnosis. Since SVMs are originally designed for the solution of two class problems, several strategies for their extension to this multiclass task are investigated and compared. The experimental results evidence the potential of SVMs to leukemia diagnosis and indicate that an hierarchical tree-based multiclass strategy can be better suited to a future update of the Leuko system.

This paper studies the selective neighborhood-based naive Bayes (SNNB) for lazy classification, and develops three variant algorithms, SNNB-G, SNNB-L, and SNNB-LV, all with linear computational complexity. The SNNB algorithms use local learning strategy for alleviating the independence assumption. The underlying idea is, for a test example, first to construct multiple classifiers on its multiple neighborhoods with different radius, and then to select out the classifier with the highest estimated accuracy to make decision. Empirical results show that both SNNB-L and SNNB-LV generate more accurate classifiers than naive Bayes and several other state-of-the-art classification algorithms including C4.5, Naive Bayes Tree, and Lazy Bayesian Rule. The SNNB-L and SNNB-LV algorithms are also computationally more efficient than the Lazy Bayesian Rule algorithm, especially on the domains with high dimensionality.

User preference learning plays an important role in multimedia personalization. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to acquire and update user preference for multimedia personalization in pervasive computing environment, The approach is based on Master-Slave architecture, of which master device is a device with strong capabilities, such as PC, TV with STB (set-on-box) or PDR (Personal Digital Recorder), etc, and slave devices are pervasive terminals with limited resources. The preference learning and update is done in the master device by utilizing overall user feedback information collected from different devices as opposed to other traditional learning methods that just use partial feedback information in one device. The slave devices are responsible for observing user behavior and uploading feedback information to the master device. The master device is designed to support multiple learning methods: explicit input/modification and implicit learning. The implicit user preference learning algorithm, which applies relevance feedback and Naive Bayes classifier approach, is described in detail.

In this paper, we present a Feature Selection Fish-not learning algorithm to solve the Dual Imbalance problem on text classification. Dual imbalance includes the instance imbalance and feature imbalance. The instance imbalance is caused by the unevenly distributed classes and feature imbalance is due to the different document length. The proposed approach consists of two phases: (1) select a feature subset which consists of the features that are more supportive to difficult minority class; (2) construct classification rules based on the original Fish-net algorithm. Our experimental results on Reuters21578 show that the proposed approach achieves better balanced accuracy rate on both majority and minority class than Naive Bayes MultiNomial and SVM.

After a theoretical exposition on cost-sensitive learning and decision-making methods, we then apply these methods to the claims data at hand to contrast the predictive performance of the documented methods for a selection of decision tree and rule learners. We use standard logistic regression and (smoothed) naive Bayes as benchmarks. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Wang, HJ; Huang, H				Wang, HJ; Huang, H			SED, a normalization free method for DNA microarray data analysis	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURES; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; CANCER; METAANALYSIS; ALGORITHMS	Background: Analysis of DNA microarray data usually begins with a normalization step where intensities of different arrays are adjusted to the same scale so that the intensity levels from different arrays can be compared with one other. Both simple total array intensity-based as well as more complex "local intensity level" dependent normalization methods have been developed, some of which are widely used. Much less developed methods for microarray data analysis include those that bypass the normalization step and therefore yield results that are not confounded by potential normalization errors. Results: Instead of focusing on the raw intensity levels, we developed a new method for microarray data analysis that maps each gene's expression intensity level to a high dimensional space of SEDs ( Signs of Expression Difference), the signs of the expression intensity difference between a given gene and every other gene on the array. Since SED are unchanged under any monotonic transformation of intensity levels, the SED based method is normalization free. When tested on a multi-class tumor classification problem, simple Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbor methods using the SED approach gave results comparable with normalized intensity-based algorithms. Furthermore, a high percentage of classifiers based on a single gene's SED gave good classification results, suggesting that SED does capture essential information from the intensity levels. Conclusion: The results of testing this new method on multi-class tumor classification problems suggests that the SED-based, normalization-free method of microarray data analysis is feasible and promising.

Classification is driven by spatial association rules discovered at multiple granularity levels. Classification is probabilistic and is based on an extension of naive Bayes classifiers to multi-relational data. The method is implemented in a Data Mining system tightly integrated with an object relational spatial database. It performs the classification at different granularity levels and takes advantage from domain specific knowledge in form of rules that support qualitative spatial reasoning. An application to real-world spatial data is reported. Results show that the use of different levels of granularity is beneficial.

In this paper, we put forward an approach to text categorization that requires no labeled documents. The proposed approach automatically learns features using bootstrapping. The input consists of a small set of keywords per class and a large amount of easily obtained unlabeled documents. Using these automatically learned features, we develop a naive Bayes classifier. The classifier provides 82.8% F1 while classifying a set of web documents into 10 categories, which performs better than naive Bayes by supervised learning in small number of features cases.

Question classification received interest recently in the context of question answering systems for which categorizing a given question would be beneficial to allow improved processing of the document to identify an answer. Our approach relies on relative simple preprocessing of the question and uses standard decision tree learning. We also compared our results from decision tree learning with those obtained using Naive Bayes. Both results compare favorably to several very recent studies using more sophisticated preprocessing and/or more sophisticated learning techniques. Furthermore, the fact that decision tree learning proved more successful than Naive Bayes is significant in itself as decision tree learning is usually believed to be less suitable for NLP tasks.

We use the Naive Bayes classifier, the rule-induction algorithm C4.5 and a recently introduced classifier named random forest (RF). We first employ image processing to standardize the images, eliminating the effects of orientation and scale, then perform principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and finally, classify the galaxy images. Our experiments show that RF obtains the best results considering three, five and seven galaxy types.

It does this in a limited sense, by incorporating the conditional probability of each attribute given the class and (at most) one other attribute. The method of boosting has previously proven very effective in improving the performance of Naive Bayes classifiers and in this paper, we investigate its effectiveness on application to the TAN classifier.

We compared the learned networks to naive Bayes classifiers, which are similar to the expert systems previously investigated for breast lesion classification. The learned network structures reflect the difference in the classification of biopsy outcome and the invasiveness of malignant lesions for breast masses and microcalcifications. The difference between masses and microcalcifications should be taken into consideration when interpreting systems for automatic pathological classification of breast lesions. The difference may also affect use of these systems for tasks such as estimating the sampling error of biopsy.

It's a challenging issue that how to achieve good performance efficiently with limited time and space resources. This paper proposes a focused web crawler wHunter that implements incremental and multi-strategy learning by taking the advantages of both SVM (support vector machines) and naive Bayes. On the one hand, the initial performance is guaranteed via SVM classifier; on the other hand, when enough web pages are obtained, the classifier is switched to naive Bayes so that on-line incremental learning is achieved. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is efficient and easy to implement.

To conduct the study, we implement the NBC and choose to use the SVMlight, an application of SVMs developed by Thorsten Joachims. The NBC and the linear SVMs with different C parameters are trained on a set of 2000 emails with 1000 spams and 1000 nonspams, and are tested on 200 new emails with 100 in each class. A program is written that converts emails into feature vectors using both TF and TF-IDF term weighting methods. The evaluation criteria include accuracy rate, recall, precision, miss rate, and false alarm rate. The results indicate that the both approaches have their pros and cons.

However, previous studies have shown that AdaBoost can not obviously improve the performance of Naive Bayes as expected. This paper presents a new boosting algorithm, ActiveBoost, which applies active learning to mitigate the negative effect of noise data and introduce instability into boosting procedure. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that ActiveBoost has clear advantages with respect to the increasing of the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes when compared against Adaboost.

This paper proposes a new strategy for detecting masquerades in a multiuser system. To detect masquerading sessions, one profile of command usage is built from the sessions of the proper user, and a second profile is built from the sessions of the remaining known users. The sequence of the commands in the sessions is reduced to a histogram of commands, and the naive-Bayes classifier is used to decide the identity of new incoming sessions. The standard naive-Bayes classifier is extended to take advantage of information from new unidentified sessions. On the basis of the current profiles, a newly presented session is first assigned a probability of being a masquerading session, and then the profiles are updated to reflect the new session. As prescribed by the expectation-maximization algorithm, this procedure is iterated until both the probabilities and the profiles are self-consistent. Experiments on a standard artificial dataset demonstrate that this self-consistent naive-Bayes classifier beats the previous best-performing detector and reduces the missing-alarm rate by 40%.

In this paper, we present a fuzzy model incorporated with fuzzy Dempster-Shafer Theory. The consequent of fuzzy rule is not fuzzy propositions, but fuzzy Dempster-Shafer granules. The salient aspect of the work is that a very simplified analytic output of fuzzy model which is a special case of Sugeno-type fuzzy model is achieved when all fuzzy sets in fuzzy partition of the output space have the same power (the area under the membership function), and the determination of basic probability assignments associated with fuzzy Dempster-Shafer belief structure using fuzzy Naive Bayes. The construction method of fuzzy Naive Bayes and an learning strategy generating fuzzy rules from training data are proposed in this paper. A well-known example about time series prediction is tested, the prediction results show that our fuzzy modeling is very efficient and has strong expressive power to represent the complex system with uncertain situation.

J	Zhang, H; Ling, CX				Zhang, H; Ling, CX			Numeric mapping and learnability of naive bayes	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								In data-mining applications, it is common to transform (or map) nominal attributes into numeric ones in order to apply a specific model. However, a nominal attribute has typically no specific order in its values and no geometric meaning. An interesting issue is, does such a transformation change the property of a nominal function? How do you measure the geometric complexity of a nominal function independent of the mapping? This paper discusses the issue of converting a nominal function into a numeric one. We propose a three-layer measure for the geometric linearity of a nominal function and explore the geometric property of a nominal function independent of the mapping. Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive-learning algorithms for data mining. It is well known that Naive Bayes is linear in the binary domain; that is, it can learn only linearly separable functions. We show that Naive Bayes is actually nonlinear in the nominal domain, a general case of the binary domain, by exploring the geometric property of Naive Bayes. We investigate the geometric property of Naive Bayes based on the three-layer linearity measure that we propose. Our work helps researchers to understand the influence of numeric mapping on the property of a nominal function, and how numeric mapping affects the learnability of Naive Bayes.

The backscatter from normal and apoptotic cells, using a high frequency ultrasound instrument are modeled through an Autoregressive (AR) modeling technique. The proper model order is calculated by tracking the error criteria in the reconstruction of the original signal. The AR model coefficients, which are assumed to contain the main statistical features of the signal, are passed as the input to Linear and Nonlinear machine classifiers (Fisher Linear Discriminant, Conditional Gaussian Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Neural Networks with nonlinear activation functions).

Observed counts vary more than simple models predict, prompting the use of overdispersed models like Gamma-Poisson or Beta-binomial mixtures as robust alternatives. Another deficiency of standard models is due to the fact that most words never occur in a given document, resulting in large amounts of zero counts. We propose using zero-inflated models for dealing with this, and evaluate competing models on a Naive Bayes text classification task. Simple zero-inflated models can account for practically relevant variation, and can be easier to work with than overdispersed models.

Labeled documents are used to guide the evolution process of each chromosome, which is fuzzy partition on unlabeled documents. The fitness of each chromosome is evaluated with a combination of fuzzy within cluster variance of unlabeled documents and misclassification error of labeled documents. The structure of the clusters obtained can be used to classify future new documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve text classi-fication accuracy significantly, compared to text classifiers trained with a small number of labeled documents only. Also, this approach performs at least as well as the similar approach - EM with Naive Bayes.

This simple approach stands from assumptions of conditional independence among features given the class. Improvements in accuracy of naive Bayes has been demonstrated by a number of approaches, collectively named semi naive Bayes classifiers. Semi naive Bayes classifiers are usually based on the search of specific values or structures. The learning process of these classifiers is usually based on greedy search algorithms. In this paper we propose to learn these semi naive Bayes structures through estimation of distribution algorithms, which are non-deterministic, stochastic heuristic search strategies. Experimental tests have been done with 21 data sets from the UCI repository.

In this paper, we present a new feature and a smoothed naive Bayes classification model. Experimental results are reported comparing the new feature with a set of well-known features.

Of them, text categorization aims at developing a classification system for assigning a number of predefined topic codes to the documents based on the knowledge accumulated in the training process. We propose a framework based on an automatic inductive classifier, called ILA, for text categorization, though this attempt is not a novel approach to the information retrieval community. Our motivation are two folds. One is that there is still much to do for efficient and effective classifiers. The second is of ILA's (Inductive Learning Algorithm) well-known ability in capturing by canonical rules the distinctive features of text categories. Our results with respect to the Reuters 21578 corpus indicate (1) the reduction of features by information gain measurement down to 20 is essentially as good as the case where one would have more features; (2) recall/precision breakeven points of our algorithm without tuning over top 10 categories are comparable to other text categorization methods, namely similarity based matching, naive Bayes, Bayes nets, decision trees, linear support vector machines, steepest descent algorithm.

Recent works in hybrid classification algorithms have proposed the generation of contextual rules, whereby the right-hand side of the production rule is replaced by a classifier, to achieve higher accuracy. In this work, we present a framework to further generalize classification rules such that the left-hand side of a production rule is expressed as a conjunction of classifiers, called space splitters. An intelligent divide-and-conquer approach is designed to construct such generalized classification rules. The construction algorithm, GCTree, is elegant, efficient and scalable. The resulting classifier is able to achieve high predictive accuracy that outperforms Naive Bayes and C4.5. Experiments demonstrate that GCTree is compact and stable.

Annotated genomic data is also rapidly pouring into public databases. Our goal is to develop automated ways of combining these two sources of information to produce insight into the operation of cells under various conditions. Our approach is to use machine-learning techniques to identify characteristics of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in a particular microarray experiment. We seek models that are (a) accurate, (b) easy to interpret, and (c) stable to small variations in the training data. This paper explores the effectiveness of two standard machine-learning algorithms for this task: Naive Bayes (based on probability) and PFOIL (based on building rules). Although we do not anticipate using our learned models to predict expression levels of genes, we cast the task in a predictive framework, and evaluate the quality of the models in terms of their predictive power on genes held out from the training. The paper reports on experiments using actual E coli microarray data, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the two algorithms and demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy, comprehensibility, and stability.

It has seen that even Naive Bayes classifier performs well in many cases, it may be improved by introducing some dependency relationships among variables (Augmented Naive Bayes). Naive Bayes is incremental in nature but, up to now, there are no incremental algorithms for learning Augmented classifiers. When data is presented in short chunks of instances, there is an obvious need for incrementally improving the performance of the classifiers as new data is available. It would be too costly, in computing time and memory space, to use the batch algorithms processing again the old data together with the new one. We present in this paper an incremental algorithm for learning Tree Augmented Naive classifiers. The algorithm rebuilds the network structure from the branch which is found to be invalidated, in some sense, by data.

Since this hypothesis is unfrequent on real-world problems we also provide a framework through class-conditional Independent Component Analysis (CC-ICA) where it can be held on stronger grounds. For this representation, we focus on the problem of feature subset selection for classification, observing that divergence arises as a simple and natural criterion for class separability. Since divergence is monotonic on the dimensionality, optimality can be ensured without the need for an exhaustive search for features. We adapt the Bayes decision scheme to our independence assumptions and framework. A first experiment on Trunk's artificial dataset, where class-conditional independence is already known, illustrates the robustness and accuracy of our technique. A second experiment, on the UCI letter database, evaluates the importance of the representation when, assuming independence. A third experiment on the Corel database illustrates the performance of our criterion on high, dimensional data.

We present a new classification correction technique that successfully addresses the problem of under-estimation of infrequent classes in the training data. We show that the mixture models are boosting-friendly and that both Adaboost and our original correction technique can improve the results of the raw model significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several standard test sets in four languages. With substantially different output to Naive Bayes and other statistical methods, the investigated models are also shown to be effective participants in classifier combination.

NB is based on the assumption of word independence in a text, which makes the computation of it far more efficient. SVMs, on the other hand, have the potential to handle large feature spaces, which makes it possible to produce better performance. The training data for SVMs are extracted using NB classifiers according to the category hierarchies, which makes it possible to reduce the amount of computation necessary for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

Common approach in the extraction process is to represent a page as a "bag of words" and then to perform additional processing on such a flat representation. In this paper we propose, a new, hierarchical representation that includes browser screen coordinates for every HTML object in a page. Using visual information one is able to define heuristics for the recognition of common page areas such as header, left and right menu, footer and center of a page. We show in initial experiments that using our heuristics defined objects are recognized properly in 73% of cases. Finally, we show that a Naive Bayes classifier, taking into account the proposed representation, clearly outperforms the same classifier using only information about the content of documents.

They are modifications of the Naive Bayes Classifier and Hidden Markov Model (where temporal dependence among the examples is ignored and taken into account, respectively) to enable them to predict numerical values by incorporating features from fuzzy systems. This is a generalization of the regression-by-discretization approach of using classifiers for regression. These hybrid systems are successfully compared with two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters exponential smoothing.

Comparing two decision tree induction and one naive-bayes induction algorithms, we find situations in which one algorithm is judged more accurate at the p = 0.05 level with one partition of the training instances but the other algorithm is judged more accurate at the p = 0.05 level with an alternate partition. We recommend a new significance procedure that involves performing cross-validation using multiple instance-space partitions. Significance is determined by applying the paired Student t-test separately to the results from each cross-validation partition, averaging their values, and converting this averaged value into a significance value.

The main goal of the study was to summarize the experience gained over more than 20 years by a surgical team. To this end, two decision trees have been induced from data: a model M1 that contains a full set of prognostic rules derived from the data on the basis of the 20 available factors, and a model M2 that considers only the two most relevant factors. M1 will be used to explicit the knowledge embedded in the data (externalization), while the model M2 will be used to extract operational rules (socialization). The models performance has been compared with the one of a Naive Bayes classifier and have been validated by the expert physicians. The paper concludes that a knowledge management perspective improves the validity of data mining techniques in presence of small data sets, coming from severe pathologies with relative low incidence.

Empirical estimates of weights (likelihood ratios) become unstable when counts are small. Instead of estimating weights for individual words, as Naive Bayes does, words with similar features are grouped into bins, and a single weight is estimated for each bin. This weight is then assigned to all of the words in the bin. The bin-based method is intended for tasks where there is insufficient training data to estimate a separate weight for each word. Experiments show the bin-based method is highly competitive with other current methods. In particular, this method is most similar to Naive Bayes; it generally performs at least as well as Naive Bayes, and sometimes better.

Experimental results show the obtained classifiers, learned using the CI based algorithms, are competitive with (or superior to) the best known classifiers, based on both Bayesian networks and other formalisms; and that the computational time for learning and using these classifiers is relatively small. Moreover, these results also suggest a way to learn yet more effective classifiers; we demonstrate empirically that this new algorithm does work as expected. Collectively, these results argue that BN classifiers deserve more attention in machine learning and data mining communities.

The algorithm has been shown to be surprisingly robust to obvious violations of this condition, but it is natural to ask if it is possible to further improve the accuracy by relaxing this assumption. We examine an approach where naive Bayes is augmented by the addition of correlation arcs between attributes. We explore two methods for finding the set of augmenting arcs, a greedy hill-climbing search, and a novel, more computationally efficient algorithm that we call SuperParent. We compare these methods to TAN; a state-of the-art distribution-based approach to finding the augmenting arcs.

It is developed for the Naive Bayesian classifier applied on text data, since it combines well with the addressed learning problems. We focus on domains with many features that also have a highly unbalanced class distribution and asymmetric misclassification costs given only implicitly in the problem. By asymmetric misclassification costs we mean that one of the class values is the target class value for which we want to get predictions and we prefer false positive over false negative. Our example problem is automatic document categorization using machine learning, where we want to identify documents relevant for the selected category. Usually, only about 1%-10% of examples belong to the selected category. Our experimental comparison of eleven feature scoring measures show that considering domain and algorithm characteristics significantly improves the results of classification.

Attributes included age, sex and education plus responses to the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental Status and Blessed Orientation, Memory and Concentration tests. The machine learning algorithms included decision tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4.5 Rules, FOCL) and naive Bayes. Stepwise logistic regression was used to compare results. The sample was randomly split into training and testing sets, and the results were validated over 30 runs. Although the Functional Activities Questionnaire has been used since 1980, the machine learning algorithms were the first to identify that a single attribute, measuring forgetfulness, equaled or exceeded the accuracy of any other scoring method of this test. Post hoc inspection of the odds ratios obtained by stepwise logistic regression confirmed this finding. The application of machine learning has identified an extremely simple, yet accurate screen for very mild dementia.

We consider the Laplace approximation and the less accurate but more efficient BIC/MDL approximation. We also consider approximations proposed by Draper (1993) and Cheeseman and Stutz (1995). These approximations are as efficient as BIC/MDL, but their accuracy has not been studied in any depth. We compare the accuracy of these approximations under the assumption that the Laplace approximation is the most accurate. In experiments using synthetic data generated from discrete naive-Bayes models having a hidden foot node, we find that (1) the BIC/MDL measure is the least accurate, having a bias in favor of simple models, and (2) the Draper and CS measures are the most accurate, having a bias in favor of simple and complex models, respectively.

It is shown that aggregating such predictions via compression-based weights achieves a slight but consistent improvement of performance over previously existing aggregation methods, including Bayesian Model Averaging and simple average (the approach adopted by the AODE algorithm). Then, attention is given to the problem of choosing the prior probability distribution over the models; this is an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models. To robustly deal with the choice of the prior, the single prior over the models is substituted by a set of priors over the models (credal set), thus obtaining a credal ensemble of Bayesian classifiers. The credal ensemble recognizes the prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class varies when different prior over the models are considered. When faced with prior-dependent instances, the credal ensemble remains reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single class. Two credal ensembles of SPODEs are developed; the first generalizes the Bayesian Model Averaging and the second the compression-based aggregation. Extensive experiments show that the novel ensembles compare favorably to traditional methods for aggregating SPODEs and also to previous credal classifiers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We design a new action feature descriptor for action recognition based on differences of skeleton joints, i.e.,EigenJoints which combine action information including static posture, motion property, and overall dynamics. Accumulated Motion Energy (AME) is then proposed to perform informative frame selection, which is able to remove noisy frames and reduce computational cost. We employ non-parametric Naive-Bayes-Nearest-Neighbor (NBNN) to classify multiple actions. The experimental results on several challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate how many frames are necessary for our method to perform classification in the scenario of online action recognition. We observe that the first 30-40% frames are sufficient to achieve comparable results to that using the entire video sequences on the MSR Action3D dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, B				Zhou, Bing			Multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Bayesian decision theory; Bayes' theorem; Rough sets; Naive Bayes classifier; Three-way decisions	BAYESIAN CONFIRMATION MEASURES; 3-WAY DECISION; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; RULES	As a natural extension to rough set approximations with two decision classes, this paper provides a new formulation of multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets. Instead of making an immediate acceptance or rejection decision, a third option of making a deferment decision is added to each class. This gives users the flexibility of further examining the suspicious objects, thereby reducing the chance of misclassification. Different types of misclassification errors are treated separately based on the notion of loss functions from Bayesian decision theory. The losses incurred for making deferment and rejection decisions to each class are also considered. The presented approach appears to be well suited for cost-sensitive classification tasks where different types of classification errors have different costs. The connections and differences with other existing multi-class rough set models are analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The subjective-objective mismatch in sleep perception among those with insomnia and sleep apnea	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						misperception; paradoxical; self-report; subjective	STATE MISPERCEPTION; TIME-ESTIMATION; LONG-TERM; DURATION; ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; SUFFERERS; ONSET	The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep-wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep-wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n=92), obstructive sleep apnea (n=66) or both (n=119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective-objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.

J	Fang, X				Fang, Xiao			Inference-Based Naive Bayes: Turning Naive Bayes Cost-Sensitive	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cost-sensitive classification; Naive Bayes; classification	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS; CHOICE; TREES	A fundamental challenge for developing a cost-sensitive Naive Bayes method is how to effectively classify an instance based on the cost-sensitive threshold computed under the assumption of knowing the instance's true classification probabilities and the highly biased estimations of these probabilities by the Naive Bayes method. To address this challenge, we develop a cost-sensitive Naive Bayes method from a novel perspective of inferring the order relation (e. g., greater than or equal to, less than) between an instance's true classification probability of belonging to the class of interest and the cost-sensitive threshold. Our method learns and infers the order relation from the training data and classifies the instance based on the inferred order relation. We empirically show that our proposed method significantly outperforms major existing methods for turning Naive Bayes cost-sensitive through experiments with UCI data sets and a real-world case study.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), can assist in diagnosing DM by identifying abnormalities within the signals. In this study, we have developed an algorithm that uses Heart Rate Variability (HRV) obtained from ECG signals to detect diabetes. Third order cumulants of Higher Order Spectra (HOS) is used to analyze the HRV signals. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and student test is employed to extract features and select them before classifying them using seven different classifiers, namely Fuzzy classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The performances of the classifiers were evaluated by calculating values of their accuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy for the classifiers ranges between 52.76% and 79.93%. SVM using RBF kernel has achieved the highest accuracy with 79.93%.

To investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms in the differentiation of glioblastomas multiforme (GB) from metastases, we developed and tested a pattern recognition system based on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) data. Materials and Methods Single and multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were performed on 49 patients with solitary brain tumors (35 glioblastoma multiforme and 14 metastases). Metabolic (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, (Lip Lac)/Cr) and perfusion (rCBV) parameters were measured in both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. The statistical significance of these parameters was evaluated. For the classification procedure, three datasets were created to find the optimum combination of parameters that provides maximum differentiation. Three machine learning methods were utilized: Na < ve-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and -nearest neighbor (KNN). The discrimination ability of each classifier was evaluated with quantitative performance metrics. Results Glioblastoma and metastases were differentiable only in the peritumoral region of these lesions (). SVM achieved the highest overall performance (accuracy 98 %) for both the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Na < ve-Bayes and KNN presented greater variations in performance. The proper selection of datasets plays a very significant role as they are closely correlated to the underlying pathophysiology. Conclusion The application of pattern recognition techniques using 3T MR-based perfusion and metabolic features may provide incremental diagnostic value in the differentiation of common intraaxial brain tumors, such as glioblastoma versus metastasis.

O.; Glen, Robert C.; Bender, Andreas			In Silico Target Predictions: Defining a Benchmarking Data Set and Comparison of Performance of the Multiclass Naive Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SMALL-MOLECULE; DRUG DESIGN; PHARMACOLOGY; DESCRIPTORS; CHEMISTRY; DATABASES; LINKING; SEARCH	In this study, two probabilistic machine-learning algorithms were compared for in silico target prediction of bioactive molecules, namely the well-established Laplacian-modified Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and the more recently introduced (to Cheminformatics) Parzen-Rosenblatt Window. Both classifiers were trained in conjunction with circular fingerprints on a large data set of bioactive compounds extracted from ChEMBL, covering 894 human protein targets with more than 155,000 ligand-protein pairs. This data set is also provided as a benchmark data set for future target prediction methods due to its size as well as the number of bioactivity classes it contains. In addition to evaluating the methods, different performance measures were explored. This is not as straightforward as in binary classification settings, due to the number of classes, the possibility of multiple class memberships, and the need to translate model scores into "yes/no" predictions for assessing model performance. Both algorithms achieved a recall of correct targets that exceeds 80% in the top 1% of predictions. Performance depends significantly on the underlying diversity and size of a given class of bioactive compounds, with small classes and low structural similarity affecting both algorithms to different degrees. When tested on an external test set extracted from WOMBAT covering more than 500 targets by excluding all compounds with Tanimoto similarity above 0.8 to compounds from the ChEMBL data set, the current methodologies achieved a recall of 63.3% and 66.6% among the top 1% for Naive Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window, respectively. While those numbers seem to indicate lower performance, they are also more realistic for settings where protein targets need to be established for novel chemical substances.

J	Raizada, RDS; Lee, YS				Raizada, Rajeev D. S.; Lee, Yune-Sang			Smoothness without Smoothing: Why Gaussian Naive Bayes Is Not Naive for Multi-Subject Searchlight Studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED PATTERNS; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI; CLASSIFIERS; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; CORTEX; TASK	Spatial smoothness is helpful when averaging fMRI signals across multiple subjects, as it allows different subjects' corresponding brain areas to be pooled together even if they are slightly misaligned. However, smoothing is usually not applied when performing multivoxel pattern-based analyses (MVPA), as it runs the risk of blurring away the information that fine-grained spatial patterns contain. It would therefore be desirable, if possible, to carry out pattern-based analyses which take unsmoothed data as their input but which produce smooth images as output. We show here that the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier does precisely this, when it is used in "searchlight" pattern-based analyses. We explain why this occurs, and illustrate the effect in real fMRI data. Moreover, we show that analyses using GNBs produce results at the multi-subject level which are statistically robust, neurally plausible, and which replicate across two independent data sets. By contrast, SVM classifiers applied to the same data do not generate a replication, even if the SVM-derived searchlight maps have smoothing applied to them. An additional advantage of GNB classifiers for searchlight analyses is that they are orders of magnitude faster to compute than more complex alternatives such as SVMs. Collectively, these results suggest that Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers may be a highly non-naive choice for multi-subject pattern-based fMRI studies.

Using a multi-staged strategy based on machine learning and mathematical modeling to predict genotype-phenotype risk patterns in diabetic kidney disease: a prospective case-control cohort analysis	BMC NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						Prediction; Diabetic kidney disease; Genotypes; Phenotypes; Machine learning; Random forest; Support vector machine	CHINESE PATIENTS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GENE POLYMORPHISMS; METABOLIC SYNDROME; NEPHROPATHY; UTEROGLOBIN; POPULATION; UNDERLIE	Background: Multi-causality and heterogeneity of phenotypes and genotypes characterize complex diseases. In a database with comprehensive collection of phenotypes and genotypes, we compared the performance of common machine learning methods to generate mathematical models to predict diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Methods: In a prospective cohort of type 2 diabetic patients, we selected 119 subjects with DKD and 554 without DKD at enrolment and after a median follow-up period of 7.8 years for model training, testing and validation using seven machine learning methods (partial least square regression, the classification and regression tree, the C5.0 decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes classification, neural network and support vector machine). We used 17 clinical attributes and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 54 candidate genes to build different models. The top attributes selected by the best-performing models were then used to build models with performance comparable to those using the entire dataset. Results: Age, age of diagnosis, systolic blood pressure and genetic polymorphisms of uteroglobin and lipid metabolism were selected by most methods. Models generated by support vector machine (svmRadial) and random forest (cforest) had the best prediction accuracy whereas models derived from naive Bayes classifier and partial least squares regression had the least optimal performance. Using 10 clinical attributes (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, age of diagnosis, triglyceride, white blood cell count, total cholesterol, waist to hip ratio, LDL cholesterol, and alcohol intake) and 5 genetic attributes (UGB G38A, LIPC -514C > T, APOB Thr71Ile, APOC3 3206T > G and APOC3 1100C > T), selected most often by SVM and cforest, we were able to build high-performance models. Conclusions: Amongst different machine learning methods, svmRadial and cforest had the best performance. Genetic polymorphisms related to inflammation and lipid metabolism warrant further investigation for their associations with DKD.	[Leung, Ross K. K.; Tsui, Stephen K.

Improvement of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism prediction by employing selected nucleotide positions of the env gene in a Bayesian network classifier	JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article						Bayesian classifier; maraviroc; wrapper	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; GP120 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN; DRUG-RESISTANCE MUTATIONS; V3 LOOP; VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE; GENOTYPIC PREDICTION; EXPERIENCED PATIENTS; PHENOTYPIC ASSAY; IN-VITRO; TYPE-1	This study aimed to develop a genotypic method to predict HIV-1 coreceptor usage by employing the nucleotide sequence of the env gene in a tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) classifier, and to evaluate its accuracy in prediction compared with other available tools. A wrapper data-mining strategy interleaved with a TAN algorithm was employed to evaluate the predictor value of every single-nucleotide position throughout the HIV-1 env gene. Based on these results, different nucleotide positions were selected to develop a TAN classifier, which was employed to predict the coreceptor tropism of all the full-length env gene sequences with information on coreceptor tropism currently available at the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. Employing 26 nucleotide positions in the TAN classifier, an accuracy of 95.6, a specificity (identification of CCR5-tropic viruses) of 99.4 and a sensitivity (identification of CXCR4/dual-tropic viruses) of 80.5 were achieved for the in silico cross-validation. Compared with the phenotypic determination of coreceptor usage, the TAN algorithm achieved more accurate predictions than WebPSSM and Geno2pheno [coreceptor] (P0.05). The use of the methodology presented in this work constitutes a robust strategy to identify genetic patterns throughout the HIV-1 env gene differently present in CCR5-tropic and CXCR4/dual-tropic viruses. Moreover, the TAN classifier can be used as a genotypic tool to predict the coreceptor usage of HIV-1 isolates reaching more accurate predictions than with other widely used genotypic tools. The use of this algorithm could improve the correct prescribing of CCR5 antagonist drugs to HIV-1-infected patients.

A Clinical Risk Stratification Tool for Predicting Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Antidepressant; depression; machine learning; prediction; risk stratification; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; treatment-resistant depression	DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE; ILLNESS RATING-SCALE; QUICK INVENTORY; BREAST-CANCER; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; REGRESSION; MODELS; VALIDATION; SELECTION; BURDEN	Background: Early identification of depressed individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be helpful in selecting optimal setting and intensity of care. At present, validated tools to facilitate this risk stratification are rarely used in psychiatric practice. Methods: Data were drawn from the first two treatment levels of a multicenter antidepressant effectiveness study in major depressive disorder, the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) cohort. This cohort was divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. Only clinical or sociodemographic variables available by or readily amenable to self-report were considered. Multivariate models were developed to discriminate individuals reaching remission with a first or second pharmacological treatment trial from those not reaching remission despite two trials. Results: A logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding .71 in training, testing, and validation cohorts and maintained good calibration across cohorts. Performance of three alternative models with machine learning approaches-a naive Bayes classifier and a support vector machine, and a random forest model-was less consistent. Similar performance was observed between more and less severe depression, men and women, and primary versus specialty care sites. A web-based calculator was developed that implements this tool and provides graphical estimates of risk. Conclusion: Risk for treatment resistance among outpatients with major depressive disorder can be estimated with a simple model incorporating baseline sociodemographic and clinical features. Future studies should examine the performance of this model in other clinical populations and its utility in treatment selection or clinical trial design.

In this study, we introduce class-indexing-based term-weighting approaches and judge their effects in high-dimensional and comparatively low-dimensional vector space over the TF.IDF and five other different term weighting approaches that are considered as the baseline approaches. First, we implement a class-indexing-based TF.IDF.ICF observational term weighting approach in which the inverse class frequency (ICF) is incorporated. In the experiment, we investigate the effects of TF.IDF.ICF over the Reuters-21578, 20 Newsgroups, and RCV1-v2 datasets as benchmark collections, which provide positive discrimination on rare terms in the vector space and biased against frequent terms in the text classification (TC) task. Therefore, we revised the ICF function and implemented a new inverse class space density frequency (ICS delta F), and generated the TF.IDF.ICS delta F method that provides a positive discrimination on infrequent and frequent terms. We present detailed evaluation of each category for the three datasets with term weighting approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed class-indexing-based TF.IDF.ICS delta F term weighting approach is promising over the compared well-known baseline term weighting approaches.

Alleviating Naive Bayes Attribute Independence Assumption by Attribute Weighting	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						classification; naive Bayes; attribute independence assumption; weighted naive Bayes classification	NETWORK CLASSIFIERS	Despite the simplicity of the Naive Bayes classifier, it has continued to perform well against more sophisticated newcomers and has remained, therefore, of great interest to the machine learning community. Of numerous approaches to refining the naive Bayes classifier, attribute weighting has received less attention than it warrants. Most approaches, perhaps influenced by attribute weighting in other machine learning algorithms, use weighting to place more emphasis on highly predictive attributes than those that are less predictive. In this paper, we argue that for naive Bayes attribute weighting should instead be used to alleviate the conditional independence assumption. Based on this premise, we propose a weighted naive Bayes algorithm, called WANBIA, that selects weights to minimize either the negative conditional log likelihood or the mean squared error objective functions. We perform extensive evaluations and find that WANBIA is a competitive alternative to state of the art classifiers like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and A1DE.

The success of these models is strongly related to their capacity to represent and handle dependence relations. Some forms of Bayesian networks have been successfully applied in many classification tasks. In particular, naive Bayes classifiers have been used for intrusion detection and alerts correlation. This paper analyses the advantage of adding expert knowledge to probabilistic classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alerts correlation. As examples of probabilistic classifiers, we will consider the well-known Naive Bayes, Tree Augmented Na < ve Bayes (TAN), Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and decision tree classifiers. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where the outcome is a probability distribution over a set of classes (or decisions). In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as "it is expected that 80 % of traffic will be normal" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise probabilistic classifiers' outputs in order to fit expert knowledge. Experimental results show that our approach improves existing results on different benchmarks from intrusion detection and alert correlation areas.

Data sets are unbalanced when at least one class is represented by only a small number of training examples (called the minority class), while the other class(es) make up the majority. In this scenario, classifiers can have good accuracy on the majority class, but very poor accuracy on the minority class(es). This paper proposes a multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) approach to evolving accurate and diverse ensembles of genetic program classifiers with good performance on both the minority and majority of classes. The evolved ensembles comprise of nondominated solutions in the population where individual members vote on class membership. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of two popular Pareto-based fitness strategies in the MOGP algorithm (SPEA2 and NSGAII), and investigates techniques to encourage diversity between solutions in the evolved ensembles. Experimental results on six (binary) class imbalance problems show that the evolved ensembles outperform their individual members, as well as single-predictor methods such as canonical GP, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, on highly unbalanced tasks. This highlights the importance of developing an effective fitness evaluation strategy in the underlying MOGP algorithm to evolve good ensemble members.

The identification system was constructed from feature extraction and classification algorithms. The feature extraction was based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and energy measures. Feature fitness was established through the statistical t-test method. The extracted features were used as training and test data for a competitive 10-fold cross-validated analysis of six classification algorithms. This analysis showed that, with an accuracy of 95.8%, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm outperforms naive Bayes classification (NBC), fuzzy Sugeno classifier (FSC), probabilistic neural network (PNN), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and decision tree (DT). The 10-fold stratified cross-validation instilled reliability in the result, therefore we are confident when we state that EEG signals can be used to automate both diagnosis and treatment monitoring of alcoholic patients. Such an automatization can lead to cost reduction by relieving medical experts from routine and administrative tasks.

J	Faust, O; Yanti, R; Yu, WW				Faust, Oliver; Yanti, Ratna; Yu, Wenwei			Automated Detection of Alcohol Related Changes in Electroencephalograph Signals	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Alcohol; Electroencephalograph; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Higher Order Spectra; Wavelet Packet Decomposition	EEG SIGNALS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; COUNTRIES; DRINKING; DISEASE; DESIGN	It is difficult to detect and treat alcoholism, because statistics show that statements from patients about their drinking habits are unreliable and diagnosable symptoms appear only in advanced stages of the disease. To address this problem, we propose an automatic system that characterizes alcohol related abnormalities in Electroncephalography (EEG) signals. This system enables clinicians, patients and all other people involved to manage the condition better. Furthermore, it provides deeper insights into the phenomena and thereby it reveals important clinical information about alcohol related changes in EEG signals. For this work, we adopt the widely held, and evidence supported, belief that EEG recordings are fundamentally nonlinear. As direct consequence, the nonlinear feature of Higher Order Spectra (HOS) cumulants was used to extract information about alcohol related changes from the EEG signals. The decision whether or not a particular EEG signal shows alcohol related changes, was established with six different classification algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). To establish the functionality, we tested the proposed diagnosis support system with 300 EEG data sets. The individual classification algorithms achieved different accuracy values, they ranged from 77% (NBC) to 92.4% (FSC). The (FSC) classification result supports our thesis that HOS based cumulants features can be used to discriminate alcohol and normal EEG signals. The fact that there was a wide range of classification accuracies supports our decision to test four different classification algorithms.

Instead of detecting spatio-temporal interest points and using a 'bag of features' approach, we use densely sampled descriptors, either 3D-SIFT or 3D-HOG, and select the most discriminative subset using the AdaBoost algorithm. We obtain maximal accuracy with just 200 of the 3217 possible raw 3D features from each video sequence. Using the extremely simple naive Bayes nearest-neighbor (NBNN) classifier with the most discriminative 3D-SIFT features, we obtain accuracies of: 92.7%, 99.4%, 92.3% and 38.1% on the KTH, Weizmann, IXMAS and HMDB51 datasets, respectively. We also observe that the errors are reasonably equitably distributed across the different action classes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, FJ; Kang, X				Ren, Fuji; Kang, Xin			Employing hierarchical Bayesian networks in simple and complex emotion topic analysis	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Emotion classification; Emotion topic model; Complex emotion; Hierarchical Bayesian network		Traditional emotion models, when tagging single emotions in documents, often ignore the fact that most documents convey complex human emotions. In this paper, we join emotion analysis with topic models to find complex emotions in documents, as well as the intensity of the emotions, and study how the document emotions vary with topics. Hierarchical Bayesian networks are employed to generate the latent topic variables and emotion variables. On average, our model on single emotion classification outperforms the traditional supervised machine learning models such as SVM and Naive Bayes. The other model on the complex emotion classification also achieves promising results. We thoroughly analyze the impact of vocabulary quality and topic quantity to emotion and intensity prediction in our experiments. The distribution of topics such as Friend and Job are found to be sensitive to the documents' emotions, which we call emotion topic variation in this paper. This reveals the deeper relationship between topics and emotions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the prediction of energy values is the most important task aiming to secure the optimal usage of coal energy value. The goal of paper is to identify, examines and evaluate most influential artificial intelligence algorithms that have been widely used in the data mining community, on a real problem of predicting coal quality. Our researches are based on the data achieved under laboratory conditions during the period of five years (2005-2010), and include 33256 coal samples from "Kreka" Coal Mine Company. The goal of the research is to build, based on the described data, a prediction model that will be used for predicting the coal quality class of unknown samples. Four algorithms have been identified: C4.5, kNN, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The idea is to find the best model through the following stages: each of the algorithms is calibrated in order to find appropriate model division techniques which maximize the performance of the algorithms, to assess the importance of input attributes and ultimate comparison of the algorithm orders them with respect to their performance. The final evaluation of the outcomes allowed singling out the MLP to be the best predicting methods for the given domain with optimal structure for input, hidden and output layer.

EDSD Study Grp	Robust Automated Detection of Microstructural White Matter Degeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Using Machine Learning Classification of Multicenter DTI Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY; TRACT INTEGRITY; WORK GROUP; BRAIN; MRI; DAMAGE; AD; BIOMARKERS	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based assessment of white matter fiber tract integrity can support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of DTI as a biomarker, however, depends on its applicability in a multicenter setting accounting for effects of different MRI scanners. We applied multivariate machine learning (ML) to a large multicenter sample from the recently created framework of the European DTI study on Dementia (EDSD). We hypothesized that ML approaches may amend effects of multicenter acquisition. We included a sample of 137 patients with clinically probable AD (MMSE 20.6 +/- 5.3) and 143 healthy elderly controls, scanned in nine different scanners. For diagnostic classification we used the DTI indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and, for comparison, gray matter and white matter density maps from anatomical MRI. Data were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. We used two cross-validation approaches, (i) test and training samples randomly drawn from the entire data set (pooled cross-validation) and (ii) data from each scanner as test set, and the data from the remaining scanners as training set (scanner-specific cross-validation). In the pooled cross-validation, SVM achieved an accuracy of 80% for FA and 83% for MD. Accuracies for NB were significantly lower, ranging between 68% and 75%. Removing variance components arising from scanners using principal component analysis did not significantly change the classification results for both classifiers. For the scanner-specific cross-validation, the classification accuracy was reduced for both SVM and NB. After mean correction, classification accuracy reached a level comparable to the results obtained from the pooled cross-validation. Our findings support the notion that machine learning classification allows robust classification of DTI data sets arising from multiple scanners, even if a new data set comes from a scanner that was not part of the training sample.

J	Giselsson, TM; Midtiby, HS; Jorgensen, RN				Giselsson, Thomas Mosgaard; Midtiby, Henrik Skov; Jorgensen, Rasmus Nyholm			Seedling Discrimination with Shape Features Derived from a Distance Transform	SENSORS			English	Article						object recognition; machine vision; shape characterization	WEED IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; MANAGEMENT; INDEXES	The aim of this research is an improvement of plant seedling recognition by two new approaches of shape feature generation based on plant silhouettes. Experiments show that the proposed feature sets possess value in plant recognition when compared with other feature sets. Both methods approximate a distance distribution of an object, either by resampling or by approximation of the distribution with a high degree Legendre polynomial. In the latter case, the polynomial coefficients constitute a feature set. The methods have been tested through a discrimination process where two similar plant species are to be distinguished into their respective classes. The used performance assessment is based on the classification accuracy of 4 different classifiers (a k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive-Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine, Nonlinear Support Vector Machine). Another set of 21 well-known shape features described in the literature is used for comparison. The used data consisted of 139 samples of cornflower (Centaura cyanus L.) and 63 samples of nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The highest discrimination accuracy was achieved with the Legendre Polynomial feature set and amounted to 97.5%. This feature set consisted of 10 numerical values. Another feature set consisting of 21 common features achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. The results suggest that the Legendre Polynomial feature set can compete with or outperform the commonly used feature sets.

J	Saha, S; Ekbal, A				Saha, Sriparna; Ekbal, Asif			Combining multiple classifiers using vote based classifier ensemble technique for named entity recognition	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Named Entity Recognition (NER); Weighted Vote based Ensemble; Single Objective Optimization; Multiobjective Optimization (MOO); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Naive Bayes; Decision Tree (DT); Memory Based Learner (MBL); Hidden Markov Model (HMM); Maximum Entropy(ME); Conditional Random Field (CRF); Support Vector Machine (SVM)	ALGORITHM	In this paper, we pose the classifier ensemble problem under single and multiobjective optimization frameworks, and evaluate it for Named Entity Recognition (NER), an important step in almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) application areas. We propose the solutions to two different versions of the ensemble problem for each of the optimization frameworks. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system it is necessary to find out either the eligible classes for which a classifier is most suitable to vote (i.e., binary vote based ensemble) or to quantify the amount of voting for each class in a particular classifier (i.e., real vote based ensemble). We use seven diverse classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Memory Based Learner (MBL), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the available features that are identified and selected mostly without using any domain knowledge and/or language specific resources. The proposed technique is evaluated for three resource-constrained languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. Results using multiobjective optimization (MOO) based technique yield the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 94.21%, 94.72% and 94.74%, respectively for Bengali, 99.07%, 90.63% and 94.66%, respectively for Hindi and 82.79%, 95.18% and 88.55%, respectively for Telugu. Results for all the languages show that the proposed MOO based classifier ensemble with real voting attains the performance level which is superior to all the individual classifiers, three baseline ensembles and the corresponding single objective based ensemble.

J	Sniezynski, B; Dajda, J				Sniezynski, Bartlomiej; Dajda, Jacek			Comparison of strategy learning methods in Farmer-Pest problem for various complexity environments without delays	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Multi-agent systems; Machine learning; Supervised learning; Reinforcement learning		In this paper effectiveness of several agent strategy learning algorithms is compared in a new multi-agent Farmer Pest learning environment. Learning is often utilized by multi-agent systems which can deal with complex problems by means of their decentralized approach. With a number of learning methods available, a need for their comparison arises. This is why we designed and implemented new multidimensional Farmer Pest problem domain, which is suitable for benchmarking learning algorithms. This paper presents comparison results for reinforcement learning (SARSA) and supervised learning (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper). These algorithms are tested on configurations with various complexity with not delayed rewards. The results show that algorithm performances depend highly on the environment configuration and various conditions favor different learning algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Activity logging using lightweight classification techniques in mobile devices	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Activity recognition; Life logging; Pattern recognition; Context awareness; Mobile application; Personal health	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; PHONE	Automated activity recognition enables a wide variety of applications related to child and elderly care, disease diagnosis and treatment, personal health or sports training, for which it is key to seamlessly determine and log the user's motion. This work focuses on exploring the use of smartphones to perform activity recognition without interfering in the user's lifestyle. Thus, we study how to build an activity recognition system to be continuously executed in a mobile device in background mode. The system relies on device's sensing, processing and storing capabilities to estimate significant movements/postures (walking at different paces-slow, normal, rush, running, sitting, standing). In order to evaluate the combinations of sensors, features and algorithms, an activity dataset of 16 individuals has been gathered. The performance of a set of lightweight classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Table and Decision Tree) working on different sensor data has been fully evaluated and optimized in terms of accuracy, computational cost and memory fingerprint. Results have pointed out that a priori information on the relative position of the mobile device with respect to the user's body enhances the estimation accuracy. Results show that computational low-cost Decision Tables using the best set of features among mean and variance and considering all the sensors (acceleration, gravity, linear acceleration, magnetometer, gyroscope) may be enough to get an activity estimation accuracy of around 88 % (78 % is the accuracy of the Naive Bayes algorithm with the same characteristics used as a baseline). To demonstrate its applicability, the activity recognition system has been used to enable a mobile application to promote active lifestyles.

Based on functional images, which are subject to noise and segmentation/registration inaccuracies, regional heart motion analysis is acknowledged as a difficult problem and, therefore, incorporation of prior knowledge is desirable to enhance accuracy. Given noisy data and a nonlinear dynamic model to describe myocardial motion, an unscented Kalman smoother is proposed in this study to estimate the myocardial points. Due to the similarity between the statistical information of normal and abnormal heart motions, detecting and classifying abnormality is a challenging problem. We use the Shannon's differential entropy of the distributions of potential classifier features to detect and locate regional heart motion abnormality. A naive Bayes classifier algorithm is constructed from the Shannon's differential entropy of different features to automatically detect abnormal functional regions of the myocardium. Using 174 segmented short-axis magnetic resonance cines obtained from 58 subjects (21 normal and 37 abnormal), the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated by comparison with ground truth classifications by radiologists over 928 myocardial segments. The proposed method performed significantly better than other recent methods, and yielded an accuracy of 86.5% (base), 89.4% (mid-cavity) and 84.5% (apex). The overall classification accuracy was 87.1%. Furthermore, standard kappa statistic comparisons between the proposed method and visual wall motion scoring by radiologists showed that the proposed algorithm can yield a kappa measure of 0.73.

Automatic detection of freezing of gait events in patients with Parkinson's disease	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Freezing of gait; Parkinson's disease; Classification	QUESTIONNAIRE; LEVODOPA; EPISODES; ONSET	The aim of this study is to detect freezing of gait (FoG) events in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) using signals received from wearable sensors (six accelerometers and two gyroscopes) placed on the patients' body. For this purpose, an automated methodology has been developed which consists of four stages. In the first stage, missing values due to signal loss or degradation are replaced and then (second stage) low frequency components of the raw signal are removed. In the third stage, the entropy of the raw signal is calculated. Finally (fourth stage), four classification algorithms have been tested (Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Random Tree) in order to detect the FoG events. The methodology has been evaluated using several different configurations of sensors in order to conclude to the set of sensors which can produce optimal FoG episode detection. Signals recorded from five healthy subjects, five patients with PD who presented the symptom of FoG and six patients who suffered from PD but they do not present FoG events. The signals included 93 FoG events with 405.6 s total duration. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to detect FoG events with 81.94% sensitivity, 98.74% specificity, 96.11% accuracy and 98.6% area under curve (AUC) using the signals from all sensors and the Random Forests classification algorithm.

Our purpose is to suggest the model frame to describe possibility of exposure with low-dose VOC chemicals for long time under normal circumstances at working place. Forensic rhetoric terms, non-exclusion exposure suspicion (NES) and exclusion exposure suspicion (EES), were defined and various statistical methods were combined basis of Bayesian approach. Decision-tree (DT) methods of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and naive Bayes model were evaluated to classify 3 VOCs (toluene, xylene, and ehtybenzene) by means of the results of urinary test, gene expression and methylation expression experiments. Overall procedure is conducted by leave-one-out cross-validation that error rate of NES resulted in 11%.

Exploratory Analysis of Methods for Automated Classification of Laboratory Test Orders into Syndromic Groups in Veterinary Medicine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OUTBREAK DETECTION; SURVEILLANCE; BIOTERRORISM; DISEASES	Background: Recent focus on earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human and animal populations has led to the development of surveillance systems based on automated monitoring of health data. Real-or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes-syndromic surveillance-using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. Methods: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Naive Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. Results: High performance (F-1-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F1-micro score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F1-macro), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F1-micro score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Naive Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F1-micro = 0.994 and F1-macro = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. Conclusion: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.	[Dorea, Fernanda C.; McClure, J.

This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naive Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable. Several strong predictors were also identified that corresponded to categories more detailed than those originally assigned. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although blood conservation and standard transfusion guidelines have been published by different medical groups, actual transfusion practices after cardiac surgery vary widely among institutions. Models can be a useful support for decision making and may reduce the total cost of care. The objective of this study was to propose and evaluate a procedure to develop a simple locally customized decision-support system. Methods We analysed 3182 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University Hospital of Siena, Italy. Univariate statistical tests were performed to identify a set of preoperative and intraoperative variables as likely independent features for planning transfusion quantities. These features were utilized to design a naive Bayes classifier. Model performance was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. All computations were done using spss and matlab code. Results The overall correct classification percentage was not particularly high if several classes of patients were to be identified. Model performance improved appreciably when the patient sample was divided into two classes (transfused and non-transfused patients). In this case the naive Bayes model correctly classified about three quarters of patients with 71.2% sensitivity and 78.4% specificity, thus providing useful information for recognizing patients with transfusion requirements in the specific scenario considered. Conclusions Although the classifier is customized to a particular setting and cannot be generalized to other scenarios, the simplicity of its development and the results obtained make it a promising approach for designing a simple model for different heart surgery centres needing a customized decision-support system for planning transfusion requirements in intensive care unit.

Altay			A DISCRETIZATION METHOD BASED ON MAXIMIZING THE AREA UNDER RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; discretization; area under ROC curve	ROC CURVE; ATTRIBUTES; CLASSIFICATION	Many machine learning algorithms require the features to be categorical. Hence, they require all numeric-valued data to be discretized into intervals. In this paper, we present a new discretization method based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC) measure. Maximum area under ROC curve-based discretization (MAD) is a global, static and supervised discretization method. MAD uses the sorted order of the continuous values of a feature and discretizes the feature in such a way that the AUC based on that feature is to be maximized. The proposed method is compared with alternative discretization methods such as ChiMerge, Entropy-Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP), Fixed Frequency Discretization (FFD), and Proportional Discretization (PD). FFD and PD have been recently proposed and are designed for Naive Bayes learning. ChiMerge is a merging discretization method as the MAD method. Evaluations are performed in terms of M-Measure, an AUC-based metric for multi-class classification, and accuracy values obtained from Naive Bayes and Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) algorithms by using real-world datasets.

With the increasing availability of large databases with a wide range of information there is a growing need to use methods capable of recognizing classification patterns. Based on a dataset of 356 foreign body injuries located in larynx, pharynx, mouth, esophagus or stomach, which occurred in European children aged up to 14 years in 2000-2002, this study is aimed to predict injury severity applying feature selection procedures for identifying the most influential variables among the consumer product characteristics and the circumstances of the injury that can lead to hospitalization and complications. Selective naive Bayes classifiers were implemented on a subset of 307 and 303 injuries, for which hospitalization and complications details were given respectively, using filter and wrapper strategies for inducing feature selection. The variables recognized by the selective naive Bayes were: the injured child age and gender, the foreign body type and its characteristics (volume, consistency, shape), whether the injury occurred in presence or in absence of an adult and the activity the child played before the accident. Filter strategy resulted in the most accurate classification model. Models induced by feature selection approach give an improvement in the comprehensibility of the phenomenon, which is missed when the whole set of variables is considered. The need of fostering the attention of caretakers toward a proper surveillance of children and of the manufactures toward the safety design of the end product emerged. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Under this constraints, optimization techniques perform poorly in particular when little a priori knowledge is available. In this work we investigate the possibility of combining approaches from advanced statistics and optimization algorithms to effectively explore a combinatorial search space sampling a limited number of experimental points. To this purpose we propose the Naive Bayes Ant Colony Optimization (NACO) procedure. We tested its performance in a simulation study.

We introduced a procedure to learn the parameters of the Naive Bayes model, and we discussed two classification rules. The model was estimated and tested on 559 Italians aged 1622. Two experts provided the dental evaluations, and the model was estimated for each of them. We evaluated the coherence of the evidence provided by the experts. Some indexes have been proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the models, emphasizing how the experts ability and the technology affect the results. We introduced two benchmarks, one based on the sample distribution per sex and age: in this case, probability of correct classification increases 22% and the proportion of false adults impressively decreases 80.2%; the other benchmark, obtained by simulating hard evidence, shows how the use of soft evidence increases the proportion of correct classification 3.1% and decreases the crucial proportion of false adults about 20%. Similarly, the proportion of false minors decreases about 5.3%.

Furthermore, we introduce a pair of weight parameters to balance the impact of labeled and pseudolabeled data, and define a hybrid objective function to tune their values during co-training. The final prediction is given by the combination of base classifiers, and we define a pseudo-validation set to regulate their weight. Additionally, we present a strategy of pseudo-labeled data selecting to deal with the class imbalance problem. Experimental results on six datasets show that our method performs much better in practice, especially when the amount of labeled data is small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate classification algorithms based on ASOCT measurements for the detection of gonioscopic angle closure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We included 2047 subjects aged >= 50 years. Methods: Participants underwent gonioscopy and ASOCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure ASOCT parameters in horizontal ASOCT scans. Six classification algorithms were considered (stepwise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion, Random Forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machine, naive Bayes' classification, and recursive partitioning). The ASOCT-derived parameters were incorporated to generate point and interval estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves for these algorithms using 10-fold cross-validation as well as 50: 50 training and validation. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed ASOCT measurements and angle closure. Results: Data on 1368 subjects, including 295 (21.6%) subjects with gonioscopic angle closure were available for analysis. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 62.4 +/- 7.5 years and 54.8% were females. Angle closure subjects were older and had smaller ACW, ACA, and ACV; greater LV; and thicker irides (P<0.001 for all). For both, the 10-fold cross-validation and the 50: 50 training and validation methods, stepwise logistic regression was the best algorithm for detecting eyes with gonioscopic angle closure with testing set AUC of 0.954 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.942-0.966) and 0.962 (95% CI, 0.948-0.975) respectively, whereas recursive partitioning had relatively the poorest performance with testing set AUC 0.860 (95% CI, 0.790-0.930) and 0.905 (95% CI, 0.876-0.933), respectively. This algorithm performed similarly well (AUC, 0.957) in a second independent sample of 200 angle closure subjects and 302 normal controls. Conclusions: A classification algorithm based on stepwise logistic regression that used a combination of 6 parameters obtained from a single horizontal ASOCT scan identified subjects with gonioscopic angle closure >95% of the time.

We propose a new affective sensing approach to evaluate the computer user's affective states as they transition from "relaxation" to "stress," through processing the PD signal. Wavelet denoising and Kalman filtering were used to preprocess the PD signal. Then, three features were extracted from it and five classification algorithms were used to evaluate the overall performance of the identification of "stress" states in the computer users, achieving an average accuracy of 83.16 percent, with the highest accuracy of 84.21 percent reached with a Multilayer Perceptron and a Naive Bayes classifier. The Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) signal was also analyzed to study the comparative efficiency of affective sensing through the PD signal. We compared the discriminating power of the three features derived from the preprocessed PD signal to three features derived from the preprocessed GSR signal in terms of their Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The results confirm that the PD signal should be considered a powerful physiological factor to involve in future automated affective classification systems for human-computer interaction.

J	Song, QB; Ni, JJ; Wang, GT				Song, Qinbao; Ni, Jingjie; Wang, Guangtao			A Fast Clustering-Based Feature Subset Selection Algorithm for High-Dimensional Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Feature subset selection; filter method; feature clustering; graph-based clustering	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; RELEVANCE; SEARCH	Feature selection involves identifying a subset of the most useful features that produces compatible results as the original entire set of features. A feature selection algorithm may be evaluated from both the efficiency and effectiveness points of view. While the efficiency concerns the time required to find a subset of features, the effectiveness is related to the quality of the subset of features. Based on these criteria, a fast clustering-based feature selection algorithm (FAST) is proposed and experimentally evaluated in this paper. The FAST algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, features are divided into clusters by using graph-theoretic clustering methods. In the second step, the most representative feature that is strongly related to target classes is selected from each cluster to form a subset of features. Features in different clusters are relatively independent, the clustering-based strategy of FAST has a high probability of producing a subset of useful and independent features. To ensure the efficiency of FAST, we adopt the efficient minimum-spanning tree (MST) clustering method. The efficiency and effectiveness of the FAST algorithm are evaluated through an empirical study. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare FAST and several representative feature selection algorithms, namely, FCBF, ReliefF, CFS, Consist, and FOCUS-SF, with respect to four types of well-known classifiers, namely, the probability-based Naive Bayes, the tree-based C4.5, the instance-based IB1, and the rule-based RIPPER before and after feature selection. The results, on 35 publicly available real-world high-dimensional image, microarray, and text data, demonstrate that the FAST not only produces smaller subsets of features but also improves the performances of the four types of classifiers.

J	Wang, GT; Song, QB; Xu, BW; Zhou, YM				Wang, Guangtao; Song, Qinbao; Xu, Baowen; Zhou, Yuming			Selecting feature subset for high dimensional data via the propositional FOIL rules	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature subset selection; Feature interaction; Propositional FOIL rule; Filter method	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFIERS	Feature interaction is an important issue in feature subset selection. However, most of the existing algorithms only focus on dealing with irrelevant and redundant features. In this paper, a propositional FOIL rule based algorithm FRFS, which not only retains relevant features and excludes irrelevant and redundant ones but also considers feature interaction, is proposed for selecting feature subset for high dimensional data. FRFS first merges the features appeared in the antecedents of all FOIL rules, achieving a candidate feature subset which excludes redundant features and reserves interactive ones. Then, it identifies and removes irrelevant features by evaluating features in the candidate feature subset with a new metric CoverRatio, and obtains the final feature subset. The efficiency and effectiveness of FRFS are extensively tested upon both synthetic and real world data sets, and it is compared with other six representative feature subset selection algorithms, including CFS, FCBF, Consistency, Relief-F, INTERACT, and the rule-based FSBAR, in terms of the number of selected features, runtime and the classification accuracies of the four well-known classifiers including Naive Bayes, C4.5, PART and IB1 before and after feature selection. The results on the five synthetic data sets show that FRFS can effectively identify irrelevant and redundant features while reserving interactive ones. The results on the 35 real world high dimensional data sets demonstrate that compared with other six feature selection algorithms, FRFS cannot only efficiently reduce the feature space, but also can significantly improve the performance of the four well-known classifiers.

In particular, non-coding RNA-protein interactions play an important role to facilitate biological functions in signalling, transcriptional regulation, and even the progression of complex diseases. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA interactions remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. Here, we develop a novel extended naive-Bayes-classifier for de novo prediction of protein-RNA interactions, only using protein and RNA sequence information. Specifically, we first collect a set of known protein-RNA interactions as gold-standard positives and extract sequence-based features to represent each protein-RNA pair. To fill the gap between high dimensional features and scarcity of gold-standard positives, we select effective features by cutting a likelihood ratio score, which not only reduces the computational complexity but also allows transparent feature integration during prediction. An extended naive Bayes classifier is then constructed using these effective features to train a protein-RNA interaction prediction model. Numerical experiments show that our method can achieve the prediction accuracy of 0.77 even though only a small number of protein-RNA interaction data are available. In particular, we demonstrate that the extended naive-Bayes-classifier is superior to the naive-Bayes-classifier by fully considering the dependences among features. Importantly, we conduct ncRNA pull-down experiments to validate the predicted novel protein-RNA interactions and identify the interacting proteins of sbRNA CeN72 in C. elegans, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

J	Yang, H; Fong, S; Wong, R; Sun, GM				Yang, Hang; Fong, Simon; Wong, Raymond; Sun, Guangmin			Optimizing Classification Decision Trees by Using Weighted Naive Bayes Predictors to Reduce the Imbalanced Class Problem in Wireless Sensor Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Standard classification algorithms are often inaccurate when used in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the observed data occur in imbalanced classes. The imbalanced data classification problem occurs when the number of samples in one class, usually the class of interest, is much lower than the number in the other classes. Many classification models have been studied in the data-mining research community. However, they all assume that the input data are stationary and bounded in size, so that resampling techniques and postadjustment by measuring the classification cost can be applied. In this paper, we devise a new scheme that extends a popular stream classification algorithm to the analysis of WSNs for reducing the adverse effects of the imbalanced class in the data.. is new scheme is resource light at the algorithm level and does not require any data preprocessing. It uses weighted naive Bayes predictors at the decision tree leaves to effectively reduce the impact of imbalanced classes. Experiments show that our modified algorithm outperforms the original stream classification algorithm.

The recently proposed random forests classifier is used to map the local segment features to their corresponding prediction histograms. We compare the results of our approach with those of the baseline Bag-of-Words (BoW) and the Naive-Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) methods on the multi-view IXMAS dataset. Additionally, comparisons between our multi-camera fusion strategy and the normally used early feature concatenating strategy are also carried out using different camera views and different segment scales. It is proven that the proposed sensor fusion technique, coupled with the random forests classifier, is effective for multiple view human action recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

GENERATIVE CLASSIFIERS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; NAIVE BAYES; MODELS; MORTALITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; VOLUME; RATES	Motivated by the need for accurate traffic flow prediction in transportation management, we propose a functional data method to analyze traffic flow patterns and predict future traffic flow. In this study we approach the problem by sampling traffic flow trajectories from a mixture of stochastic processes. The proposed functional mixture prediction approach combines functional prediction with probabilistic functional classification to take distinct traffic flow patterns into account. The probabilistic classification procedure, which incorporates functional clustering and discrimination, hinges on sub-space projection. The proposed methods not only assist in predicting traffic flow trajectories, but also identify distinct patterns in daily traffic flow of typical temporal trends and variabilities.

Although a good number of successful content-based anti-spam filters are available, their current utilization in real scenarios is still a long way off. In this context, the SpamAssassin filter offers a rule-based framework that can be easily used as a powerful integration and deployment tool for the fast development of new anti-spam strategies. This paper presents Grindstone4Spam, a publicly available optimization toolkit for boosting SpamAssassin performance. Its applicability has been verified by comparing its results with those obtained by the default SpamAssassin software as well as four well-known anti-spam filtering techniques such as Naive Bayes, Flexible Bayes, Adaboost and Support Vector Machines in two different case studies. The performance of the proposed alternative clearly outperforms existing approaches working in a cost-sensitive scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, automated QoS management for interactive traffic flows requires quick and timely classification well before the flows finish. Also, interactive flows are often long-lived and should be continuously monitored during their lifetime. We propose to achieve this by using statistics derived from sub-flows-a small number of most recent packets taken at any point in a flow's lifetime. Then, the ML classifier must be trained on a set of sub-flows, and we investigate different sub-flow selection strategies. We also propose to augment training datasets so that classification accuracy is maintained even when a classifier mixes up client-to-server and server-to-client directions for applications exhibiting asymmetric traffic characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the Naive Bayes and C4.5 Decision Tree ML algorithms, for the identification of first-person-shooter online game and VoIP traffic. Our results show that we can classify both applications with up to 99% Precision and 95% Recall within less than 1 s. Stable results are achieved regardless of where within a flow the classifier captures the packets and the traffic direction.	[Nguyen, Thuy T.

Typically one is interested in determining which, of a large number of potentially redundant or noisy features, are most discriminative for classification. The objective of the paper is to exploit machine learning algorithms for automated classification of different angle closure mechanisms based on the quantitative assessment of Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). In this paper, we propose an effective combination of Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), a mutual information feature selection, with AdaBoost, an adaptive boosting to detect angle closure glaucoma. The proposed method effectively combines the best feature selection and classifier to the problem. A sequential forward search was conducted to determine the optimal feature subset by the proposed criteria. The optimal selected feature subset, using only 11.90% of the entire available feature, for our angle closure glaucoma dataset outperforms the result using all 84 features. It also achieves better prediction compared to 4 other methods, i.e., Classification Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The reduced set of features avoids computation of unnecessary features and thus improves the efficiency. Furthermore, 9 out of the 10 selected features have been clinically proven to be important in determining the type of angle closure glaucoma. The algorithm show promising and encouraging results to detect and determine the type of angle closure glaucoma which may help early recognition and treatment of the disease.

In this paper, a hybrid generative/discriminative semisupervised learning algorithm is proposed that utilizes a large number of unlabeled samples to supplement a small number of labeled samples. This hybrid method allows us to combine the modeling power and flexibility of generative models with the superior performance of discriminative approaches. Other related issues, such as learning efficiency enhancement and distribution estimation smoothing, are also discussed. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the calibration effort and exhibit superior performance in terms of localization accuracy and robustness.

IMPRECISE CLASSIFICATION WITH CREDAL DECISION TREES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision trees; imprecise classification; imprecise probabilities; imprecise Dirichlet model; uncertainty measures	PROBABILITY INTERVALS; MULTINOMIAL DATA; DIRICHLET MODEL; DATA SETS; CLASSIFIERS	In this paper, we present the following contributions: (i) an adaptation of a precise classifier to work on imprecise classification for cost-sensitive problems; (ii) a new measure to check the performance of an imprecise classifier. The imprecise classifier is based on a method to build simple decision trees that we have modified for imprecise classification. It uses the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM) to represent information, with the upper entropy as a tool for splitting. Our new measure to compare imprecise classifiers takes errors into account. Thus far, this has not been considered by other measures for classifiers of this type. This measure penalizes wrong predictions using a cost matrix of the errors, given by an expert; and it quantifies the success of an imprecise classifier based on the cardinal number of the set of non-dominated states returned. To compare the performance of our imprecise classification method and the new measure, we have used a second imprecise classifier known as Naive Credal Classifier (NCC) which is a variation of the classic Naive Bayes using the IDM; and a known measure for imprecise classification.

Each probe set on the array consisted of EST (expressed sequence tag) sequence of 20 feature pairs of 25 bp sequence. The data set comprised of 61 samples, divided into two groups of 40 samples for tumor cells (Group 1) and 21 samples for normal cells (Group 2). In order to do background adjustments for the negative expression values, the data was transformed into log base 2 and estimation of missing values was performed by K-nearest neighbor method, followed by normalization using 'minimum mean ratio' among arrays. The basic statistics used for the significance analysis was J5 test, which was computed for each probe and for each contrast with a threshold value of 4.0 and mean as the measure of central tendency. The differentially expressed genes were expressed at high frequency in tumour samples. The Naive. Bayes Classifier Algorithm was used to test defined classification of samples of genes. Correlation distance was measured with the help of Pearson's correlation distance. On the basis of J5 test scores, top 5 upregulated genes, viz., vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin preproprotein, cytochrome, P450 2A7 isoform, major centromere autoantigen B, myelin associated glycoprotein and bone morphogenetic protein 1 isoform 3 precursor, were selected for further analysis. The above said genes have not yet been reported to be differentially overexpressed in colon cancer cells, while their overexpression was reported in other cancers, such as, lung and breast cancer, etc. These genes can be used for prediction and analyses of the gene products, which will help in designing new diagnostic and treatment strategies for the colon cancer.

J	Tamatani, M; Koch, I; Naito, K				Tamatani, Mitsuru; Koch, Inge; Naito, Kanta			Pattern recognition based on canonical correlations in a high dimension low sample size context	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Canonical Correlations; Consistency; High Dimension Low Sample Size; Misclassification; Naive Bayes rule	PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS	This paper is concerned with pattern recognition for 2-class problems in a High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) setting. The proposed method is based on canonical correlations between the predictors X and responses Y. The paper proposes a modified version of the canonical correlation matrix Sigma(-1/2)(X) Sigma(XY) Sigma(-1/2)(Y) which is suitable for discrimination with class labels Y in a HDLSS context. The modified canonical correlation matrix yields ranking vectors for variable selection, a discriminant direction and a rule which is essentially equivalent to the naive Bayes rule. The paper examines the asymptotic behavior of the ranking vectors and the discriminant direction and gives precise conditions for HDLSS consistency in terms of the growth rates of the dimension and sample size. The feature selection induced by the discriminant direction as ranking vector is shown to work efficiently in simulations and in applications to real HDLSS data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Jiang, LX; Cai, ZH; Zhang, H; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Cai, Zhihua; Zhang, Harry; Wang, Dianhong			Not so greedy: Randomly Selected Naive Bayes	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Attribute selection; Random search; Classification; Ranking; Class probability estimation	CLASS PROBABILITY ESTIMATION; DECISION TREE; ROC CURVE; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS; RANKING; AREA	Many approaches are proposed to improve Naive Bayes, among which the attribute selection approach has demonstrated remarkable performance. Algorithms for attribute selection fall into two broad categories: filters and wrappers. Filters use the general data characteristics to evaluate the selected attribute subset before the learning algorithm is run, while wrappers use the learning algorithm itself as a black box to evaluate the selected attribute subset. In this paper, we work on the attribute selection approach of wrapper and propose an improved Naive Bayes algorithm by carrying a random search through the whole space of attributes. We simply called it Randomly Selected Naive Bayes (RSNB). In order to meet the need of classification, ranking, and class probability estimation, we discriminatively design three different versions: RSNB-ACC, RSNB-AUC, and RSNB-CLL. The experimental results based on a large number of UCI datasets validate their effectiveness in terms of classification accuracy (ACC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), and conditional log likelihood (CLL), respectively.

J	Malovini, A; Barbarini, N; Bellazzi, R				Malovini, Alberto; Barbarini, Nicola; Bellazzi, Riccardo			Hierarchical Naive Bayes for genetic association studies	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DISEASE; LASSO; SNPS; POLYMORPHISMS; CLASSIFIERS; REGRESSION; MODEL	Background: Genome Wide Association Studies represent powerful approaches that aim at disentangling the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. The usual "one-SNP-at-the-time" testing strategy cannot capture the multi-factorial nature of this kind of disorders. We propose a Hierarchical Naive Bayes classification model for taking into account associations in SNPs data characterized by Linkage Disequilibrium. Validation shows that our model reaches classification performances superior to those obtained by the standard Naive Bayes classifier for simulated and real datasets. Methods: In the Hierarchical Naive Bayes implemented, the SNPs mapping to the same region of Linkage Disequilibrium are considered as "details" or "replicates" of the locus, each contributing to the overall effect of the region on the phenotype. A latent variable for each block, which models the "population" of correlated SNPs, can be then used to summarize the available information. The classification is thus performed relying on the latent variables conditional probability distributions and on the SNPs data available. Results: The developed methodology has been tested on simulated datasets, each composed by 300 cases, 300 controls and a variable number of SNPs. Our approach has been also applied to two real datasets on the genetic bases of Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Conclusions: The approach proposed in this paper, called Hierarchical Naive Bayes, allows dealing with classification of examples for which genetic information of structurally correlated SNPs are available. It improves the Naive Bayes performances by properly handling the within-loci variability.

Predicting Emergency Department Inpatient Admissions to Improve Same-day Patient Flow	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							AMBULANCE DIVERSION; ADMITTED PATIENTS	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19:10451054 (C) 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate three models that use information gathered during triage to predict, in real time, the number of emergency department (ED) patients who subsequently will be admitted to a hospital inpatient unit (IU) and to introduce a new methodology for implementing these predictions in the hospital setting. Methods: Three simple methods were compared for predicting hospital admission at ED triage: expert opinion, naive Bayes conditional probability, and a generalized linear regression model with a logit link function (logit-linear). Two months of data were gathered from the Boston VA Healthcare Systems 13-bed ED, which receives approximately 1,100 patients per month. Triage nurses were asked to estimate the likelihood that each of 767 triaged patients from that 2-month period would be admitted after their ED treatment, by placing them into one of six categories ranging from low to high likelihood. Logit-linear regression and naive Bayes models also were developed using retrospective data and used to estimate admission probabilities for each patient who entered the ED within a 2-month time frame, during triage hours (1,160 patients). Predictors considered included patient age, primary complaint, provider, designation (ED or fast track), arrival mode, and urgency level (emergency severity index assigned at triage). Results: Of the three methods considered, logit-linear regression performed the best in predicting total bed need, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.887, an R2 of 0.58, an average estimation error of 0.19 beds per day, and on average roughly 3.5 hours before peak demand occurred. Significant predictors were patient age, primary complaint, bed type designation, and arrival mode (p < 0.0001 for all factors). The naive Bayesian model had similar positive predictive value, with an AUC of 0.841 and an R2 of 0.58, but with average difference in total bed need of approximately 2.08 per day. Triage nurse expert opinion also had some predictive capability, with an R2 of 0.52 and an average difference in total bed need of 1.87 per day. Conclusions: Simple probability models can reasonably predict ED-to-IU patient volumes based on basic data gathered at triage. This predictive information could be used for improved real-time bed management, patient flow, and discharge processes. Both statistical models were reasonably accurate, using only a minimal number of readily available independent variables.

Job performance prediction in a call center using a naive Bayes classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Employee turnover; Job performance; Naive Bayesian classifier; Call center	PERSONNEL-SELECTION	This study presents an approach to predict the performance of sales agents of a call center dedicated exclusively to sales and telemarketing activities. This approach is based on a naive Bayesian classifier. The objective is to know what levels of the attributes are indicative of individuals who perform well. A sample of 1037 sales agents was taken during the period between March and September of 2009 on campaigns related to insurance sales and service pre-paid phone services, to build the naive Bayes network. It has been shown that, socio-demographic attributes are not suitable for predicting performance. Alternatively, operational records were used to predict production of sales agents, achieving satisfactory results. In this case, the classifier training and testing is done through a stratified tenfold cross-validation. It classified the instances correctly 80.60% of times, with the proportion of false positives of 18.1% for class no (does not achieve minimum) and 20.8% for the class yes (achieves equal or above minimum acceptable). These results suggest that socio-demographic attributes has no predictive power on performance, while the operational information of the activities of the sale agent can predict the future performance of the agent.

In this study, probabilistic-based methods were employed to develop prediction models on hERG inhibition prediction, which are different from traditional QSAR models that are mainly based on supervised hard point (HP) classification approaches giving yes/no answers. The obtained models can ascertain whether or not a given set of compounds can block hERG ion channels. The results presented indicate that the proposed probabilistic-based method can be a valuable tool for ranking compounds with respect to their potential cardio-toxicity and will be promising for other toxic property predictions.

J	Fernandez-Martinez, F; Zablotskaya, K; Minker, W				Fernandez-Martinez, Fernando; Zablotskaya, Kseniya; Minker, Wolfgang			Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Spoken dialog systems; Naive Bayes classification; Rocchio approach; k-Nearest neighbors	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR	In this paper we investigate whether conventional text categorization methods may suffice to infer different verbal intelligence levels. This research goal relies on the hypothesis that the vocabulary that speakers make use of reflects their verbal intelligence levels. Automatic verbal intelligence estimation of users in a spoken language dialog system may be useful when defining an optimal dialog strategy by improving its adaptation capabilities. The work is based on a corpus containing descriptions (i.e. monologs) of a short film by test persons yielding different educational backgrounds and the verbal intelligence scores of the speakers. First, a one-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the monologs with the film transcription and to demonstrate that there are differences in the vocabulary used by the test persons yielding different verbal intelligence levels. Then, for the classification task, the monologs were represented as feature vectors using the classical TF-IDF weighting scheme. The Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors and Rocchio classifiers were tested. In this paper we describe and compare these classification approaches, define the optimal classification parameters and discuss the classification results obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kose, C; Sevik, U; Ikibas, C; Erdol, H				Kose, Cemal; Sevik, Ugur; Ikibas, Cevat; Erdol, Hidayet			Simple methods for segmentation and measurement of diabetic retinopathy lesions in retinal fundus images	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Automatic diagnosis of DR; Automatic segmentation; Background image extraction; DR; Medical image analysis; Optic disc; Retinal images	BLOOD-VESSEL DETECTION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; OPTIC DISC; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; DIAGNOSIS; PHOTOGRAPHS; DRUSEN; FILTER	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important complications of diabetes mellitus, which causes serious damages in the retina, consequently visual loss and sometimes blindness if necessary medical treatment is not applied on time. One of the difficulties in this illness is that the patient with diabetes mellitus requires a continuous screening for early detection. So far, numerous methods have been proposed by researchers to automate the detection process of DR in retinal fundus images. In this paper, we developed an alternative simple approach to detect DR. This method was built on the inverse segmentation method, which we suggested before to detect Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMDs). Background image approach along with inverse segmentation is employed to measure and follow up the degenerations in retinal fundus images. Direct segmentation techniques generate unsatisfactory results in some cases. This is because of the fact that the texture of unhealthy areas such as DR is not homogenous. The inverse method is proposed to exploit the homogeneity of healthy areas rather than dealing with varying structure of unhealthy areas for segmenting bright lesions (hard exudates and cotton wool spots). On the other hand, the background image, dividing the retinal image into high and low intensity areas, is exploited in segmentation of hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HEMs), separately. Therefore, a complete segmentation system is developed for segmenting DR, including hard exudates, cotton wool spots, MAs, and HEMS. This application is able to measure total changes across the whole retinal image. Hence, retinal images that belong to the same patients are examined in order to monitor the trend of the illness. To make a comparison with other methods, a Naive Bayes method is applied for segmentation of DR. The performance of the system, tested on different data sets including various qualities of retinal fundus images, is over 95% in detection of the optic disc (OD), and 90% in segmentation of the DR.

Nine Data Mining Algorithms vs. the TNM Staging System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LUNG-CANCER PATIENTS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; NODE-METASTASIS; 7TH EDITION; CARCINOMA; CLASSIFICATION; RADIOTHERAPY; MODELS; CART	Objective: Over the past decades, many studies have used data mining technology to predict the 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer, but there have been few reports that compared multiple data mining algorithms to the TNM classification of malignant tumors (TNM) staging system using a dataset in which the training and testing data were from different sources. Here we compared nine data mining algorithms to the TNM staging system for colorectal survival analysis. Methods: Two different datasets were used: 1) the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset; and 2) the dataset from a single Chinese institution. An optimization and prediction system based on nine data mining algorithms as well as two variable selection methods was implemented. The TNM staging system was based on the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system. Results: When the training and testing data were from the same sources, all algorithms had slight advantages over the TNM staging system in predictive accuracy. When the data were from different sources, only four algorithms (logistic regression, general regression neural network, Bayesian networks, and Naive Bayes) had slight advantages over the TNM staging system. Also, there was no significant differences among all the algorithms (p>0.05). Conclusions: The TNM staging system is simple and practical at present, and data mining methods are not accurate enough to replace the TNM staging system for colorectal cancer survival prediction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the predictive accuracy of all the algorithms when the data were from different sources. Building a larger dataset that includes more variables may be important for furthering predictive accuracy.

A framework for personalized medicine: prediction of drug sensitivity in cancer by proteomic profiling	PROTEOME SCIENCE			English	Article							PROTEIN MICROARRAYS; CHALLENGES	Background: The goal of personalized medicine is to provide patients optimal drug screening and treatment based on individual genomic or proteomic profiles. Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology offers proteomic information of cancer patients which may be directly related to drug sensitivity. For cancer patients with different drug sensitivity, the proteomic profiling reveals important pathophysiologic information which can be used to predict chemotherapy responses. Results: The goal of this paper is to present a framework for personalized medicine using both RPPA and drug sensitivity (drug resistance or intolerance). In the proposed personalized medicine system, the prediction of drug sensitivity is obtained by a proposed augmented naive Bayesian classifier (ANBC) whose edges between attributes are augmented in the network structure of naive Bayesian classifier. For discriminative structure learning of ANBC, local classification rate (LCR) is used to score augmented edges, and greedy search algorithm is used to find the discriminative structure that maximizes classification rate (CR). Once a classifier is trained by RPPA and drug sensitivity using cancer patient samples, the classifier is able to predict the drug sensitivity given RPPA information from a patient. Conclusion: In this paper we proposed a framework for personalized medicine where a patient is profiled by RPPA and drug sensitivity is predicted by ANBC and LCR. Experimental results with lung cancer data demonstrate that RPPA can be used to profile patients for drug sensitivity prediction by Bayesian network classifier, and the proposed ANBC for personalized cancer medicine achieves better prediction accuracy than naive Bayes classifier in small sample size data on average and outperforms other the state-of-the-art classifier methods in terms of classification accuracy.

J	Ong, MS; Magrabi, F; Coiera, E				Ong, Mei-Sing; Magrabi, Farah; Coiera, Enrico			Automated identification of extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; CARE	Objectives To explore the feasibility of using statistical text classification to automatically detect extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports. Methods Statistical text classifiers based on Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were trained and tested on clinical incident reports to automatically detect extreme-risk events, defined by incidents that satisfy the criteria of Severity Assessment Code (SAC) level 1. For this purpose, incident reports submitted to the Advanced Incident Management System by public hospitals from one Australian region were used. The classifiers were evaluated on two datasets: (1) a set of reports with diverse incident types (n=120); (2) a set of reports associated with patient misidentification (n=166). Results were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The classifiers performed well on both datasets. In the multi-type dataset, SVM with a linear kernel performed best, identifying 85.8% of SAC level 1 incidents (precision=0.88, recall=0.83, F-measure=0.86, AUC=0.92). In the patient misidentification dataset, 96.4% of SAC level 1 incidents were detected when SVM with linear, polynomial or radial-basis function kernel was used (precision=0.99, recall=0.94, F-measure=0.96, AUC=0.98). Naive Bayes showed reasonable performance, detecting 80.8% of SAC level 1 incidents in the multi-type dataset and 89.8% of SAC level 1 patient misidentification incidents. Overall, higher prediction accuracy was attained on the specialized dataset, compared with the multi-type dataset. Conclusion Text classification techniques can be applied effectively to automate the detection of extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports.

J	Mahfouz, T; Kandil, A				Mahfouz, Tarek; Kandil, Amr			Litigation Outcome Prediction of Differing Site Condition Disputes through Machine Learning Models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data analysis; Decision support systems; Dispute resolution; Artificial intelligence; Construction management; Litigation; Computer models	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONSTRUCTION LITIGATION; DECISION TREES; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; CLAIMS	The construction industry is one of the main sectors of the U.S. economy that has a major effect on the nation's growth and prosperity. The construction industry's contribution to the nation's economy is, however, impeded by the increasing number of disputes that unfold and oftentimes escalate as projects progress. The majority of construction disputes are resolved in courts unless project contracts call for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the numerous advantages offered by the litigation process, the extra financial burdens and additional time required by this process makes litigation less desirable in resolving the disputes of a very dynamic construction industry. It is believed that construction litigation could be reduced or even avoided if parties have a realistic understanding of their actual legal position and the likely outcome of their case. Consequently, researchers in the artificial intelligence field have developed tools and methodologies for modeling judicial reasoning and predicting the outcomes of construction litigation cases. Despite the success of some of these systems, they were not on the basis of detailed analyses of legal concepts that govern litigation outcomes. In an attempt to provide a robust legal decision methodology for the construction industry, this paper develops an automated litigation outcome prediction method for differing site condition (DSC) disputes through machine learning (ML) models. To develop the proposed method, this paper compares the performance of three ML techniques, namely: support vector machines (SVMs), naive Bayes, and rule induction and neural network classifiers (decision trees, boosted decision trees, and the projective adaptive resonance theory). The models were trained and tested using 400 DSC cases filled in the period from 1912 to 2007. Model predictions are on the basis of significant legal factors that govern verdicts in DSC disputes in the construction industry. The third-degree SVM polynomial model performed the best among the nine ML models that were developed, and achieved a prediction precision of 98%. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000148.

Specifically, we empirically evaluate the following in classifying questions into CQA categories: (a) the usefulness of n-gram features and bag-of-word features; (b) the performance of three standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and support vector machines); (c) the performance of the state-of-the-art hierarchical classification algorithms; (d) the effect of training data size on performance; and (e) the effectiveness of the different components of CQA data, including subject, content, asker, and the best answer. The experimental results show what aspects are important for question topic classification in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We believe that the experimental findings from this study will be useful in real-world classification problems.

A Traffic Classification Agent for Virtual Networks Based on QoS Classes	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Traffic Classification; Service Level Agreements; Virtualization	OPENFLOW	Internet growth drives the emergence and usage of new applications, which have specific requirements for Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, differentiation of packets which belong to certain QoS classes becomes a crucial factor to ensure the desirable quality for the applications. Within this context, this paper proposes an agent for real-time traffic classification based on QoS classes for virtual network environments, which aims at forwarding the flow to the adequate virtual network according to the QoS class. The study was made using the Mininet emulator and the Openflow Protocol. And the study showed that the agent using the Naive Bayes method performs the more suitable classification in real time.

To address such challenges, we develop a COst-sensitive Learning-based Positive Example Learning (COLPEL) technique, which constructs an automated classifier from a training sample comprised of positive examples and a much larger number of unlabeled examples. The proposed technique incorporates cost-proportionate rejection sampling to derive, from unlabeled examples, a subset that is likely to feature negative examples in the training sample. Our technique follows a committee machine approach and thereby constructs a set of classifiers that make joint product recommendations while mitigating the potential biases common to the use of a single classifier. We evaluate the proposed method with customers' book ratings collected from Amazon.com and include two prevalent techniques for benchmark purposes: namely, positive naive Bayes and positive example-based learning. According to our results, the proposed COLPEL technique outperforms both benchmarks, as measured by accuracy and positive and negative F1 scores. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most of the previous researches are based on well-structured datasets which are manually collected, structured and normalized by TCM experts. However, the obtained results of the former work could not be directly and effectively applied to clinical practice, because the raw free-text clinical records differ a lot from the well-structured datasets. They are unstructured and are denoted by TCM doctors without the support of authoritative editorial board in their routine diagnostic work. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework of automatic diagnosis of TCM utilizing raw free-text clinical records for clinical practice is proposed and investigated for the first time. A series of appropriate methods are attempted to tackle several challenges in the framework, and the Naive Bayes classifier and the Support Vector Machine classifier are employed for TCM automatic diagnosis. The framework is analyzed carefully. Its feasibility is validated through evaluating the performance of each module of the framework and its effectiveness is demonstrated based on the precision, recall and F-Measure of automatic diagnosis results.

J	Huang, X; Wang, HN; Li, LP				Huang, Xin; Wang, Hua-Ning; Li, Le-Ping			Ensemble prediction model of solar proton events associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						solar proton events; Sun: flares; Sun: coronal mass ejections; methods: statistical; ensemble learning	ENERGETIC PARTICLE EVENTS; ACCELERATION; SOHO	An ensemble prediction model of solar proton events (SPEs), combining the information of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is built. In this model, solar flares are parameterized by the peak flux, the duration and the longitude. In addition, CMEs are parameterized by the width, the speed and the measurement position angle. The importance of each parameter for the occurrence of SPEs is estimated by the information gain ratio. We find that the CME width and speed are more informative than the flare's peak flux and duration. As the physical mechanism of SPEs is not very clear, a hidden naive Bayes approach, which is a probability-based calculation method from the field of machine learning, is used to build the prediction model from the observational data. As is known, SPEs originate from solar flares and/or shock waves associated with CMEs. Hence, we first build two base prediction models using the properties of solar flares and CMEs, respectively. Then the outputs of these models are combined to generate the ensemble prediction model of SPEs. The ensemble prediction model incorporating the complementary information of solar flares and CMEs achieves better performance than each base prediction model taken separately.

Methods and materials: CT is widely considered an effective tool for evaluating patients with minor head trauma who have potentially suffered serious intracranial injury. However, its use poses possible harmful effects, particularly for children, due to exposure to radiation. Safety concerns, along with issues of cost and practice variability, have led to calls for the development of effective methods to decide when CT imaging is needed. Clinical decision rules represent such methods and are normally derived from the analysis of large prospectively collected patient data sets. The CATCH rule was created by a group of Canadian pediatric emergency physicians to support the decision of referring children with minor head injury to CT imaging. The goal of the CATCH rule was to maximize the sensitivity of predictions of potential intracranial lesion while keeping specificity at a reasonable level. After extensive analysis of the CATCH data set, characterized by severe class imbalance, and after a thorough evaluation of several data mining methods, we derived an ensemble of multiple Naive Bayes classifiers as the prediction model for CT imaging decisions. Results: In the first phase of the experiment we compared the proposed ensemble model to other ensemble models employing rule-, tree- and instance-based member classifiers. Our prediction model demonstrated the best performance in terms of AUC, G-mean and sensitivity measures. In the second phase, using a bootstrapping experiment similar to that reported by the CATCH investigators, we showed that the proposed ensemble model achieved a more balanced predictive performance than the CATCH rule with an average sensitivity of 82.8% and an average specificity of 74.4% (vs. 98.1% and 50.0% for the CATCH rule respectively). Conclusion: Automatically derived prediction models cannot replace a physician's acumen. However, they help establish reference performance indicators for the purpose of developing clinical decision rules so the trade-off between prediction sensitivity and specificity is better understood.

The aim is to classify eighteen classes of thalassaemia abnormality, which have a high prevalence in Thailand, and one control class by inspecting data characterised by a complete blood count (CBC) and haemoglobin typing. Two indices namely a haemoglobin concentration (HB) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are the chosen CBC attributes. On the other hand, known types of haemoglobin from six ranges of retention time identified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are the chosen haemoglobin typing attributes. The stratified 10-fold cross-validation results indicate that the best classification performance with average accuracy of 93.23% (standard deviation = 1.67%) and 92.60% (standard deviation = 1.75%) is achieved when the naive Bayes classifier and the multilayer perceptron are respectively applied to samples which have been pre-processed by attribute discretisation. The results also suggest that the HB attribute is redundant. Moreover, the achieved classification performance is significantly higher than that obtained using only haemoglobin typing attributes as classifier inputs. Subsequently, the naive Bayes classifier and the multilayer perceptron are applied to an additional data set in a clinical trial which respectively results in accuracy of 99.39% and 99.71%. These results suggest that a combination of CBC and haemoglobin typing analysis with a naive Bayes classifier or a multilayer perceptron is highly suitable for automatic thalassaemia screening.

J	Sanchis, A; Juan, A; Vidal, E				Sanchis, Alberto; Juan, Alfons; Vidal, Enrique			A Word-Based Naive Bayes Classifier for Confidence Estimation in Speech Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Automatic speech recognition (ASR); confidence measures; naive Bayes; smoothing; posterior probabilities; word graphs	TRANSLATION; MODELS	Confidence estimation has been largely used in speech recognition to detect words in the recognized sentence that have been likely misrecognized. Confidence estimation can be seen as a conventional pattern classification problem in which a set of features is obtained for each hypothesized word in order to classify it as either correct or incorrect. We propose a smoothed naive Bayes classification model to profitably combine these features. The model itself is a combination of word-dependent (specific) and word-independent (generalized) naive Bayes models. As in statistical language modeling, the purpose of the generalized model is to smooth the (class posterior) estimates given by the specific models. Our classification model is empirically compared with confidence estimation based on posterior probabilities computed on word graphs. Empirical results clearly show that the good performance of word graph-based posterior probabilities can be improved by using the naive Bayes combination of features.

A document similarity function (NEBSim) based on NE co-occurrence has been developed to calculate the similarity between two documents given a specific NE mention in one of them. NEBsim is also used in conjunction with the traditional cosine similarity measure to learn a model for ranking. Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are used to re-rank the retrieved documents. Our experiments, carried out on TAC-KBP 2011 data, show NEBsim achieves significant improvement in accuracy as compared with a cosine similarity approach. They also show that re-ranking using learn to rank techniques can significantly improve the accuracy at high ranks.

Fortunately, there are different approaches able to automatically detect and remove most of those messages, and the best-known ones are based on machine learning techniques, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines. However, there are several different models of Naive Bayes filters, something the spam literature does not always acknowledge. In this chapter, we present and compare seven different versions of Naive Bayes classifiers, the well-known linear Support Vector Machine and a new method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Furthermore, we have conducted an empirical experiment on six public and real non-encoded datasets. The results indicate that the proposed filter is easy to implement, incrementally updateable and clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art spam filters.

The first method is the use of the entire new dataset. The second one is related to the consideration that each single classifier is able to select new samples starting from those on which it performs a miss-classification. Finally, by inspecting the multi expert system behavior, a sample misclassified by an expert, is used to update that classifier only if it produces a miss-classification by the ensemble of classifiers. This paper provides a comparison of three approaches under different conditions on two state of the art classifiers (SVM and Naive Bayes) by taking into account four different combination techniques. Experiments have been performed by considering the CEDAR (handwritten digit) database. It is shown how results depend by the amount of the new training samples, as well as by the specific combination decision schema and by classifiers in the ensemble.

J	Chau, YT; Yap, CW				Chau, Yi Ting; Yap, Chun Wei			Quantitative Nanostructure-Activity Relationship modelling of nanoparticles	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							STATISTICAL LEARNING-METHODS; NANOTOXICOLOGY; TOXICITY; CYTOTOXICITY; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION; QSARS	In recent years, the interest of the pharmaceutical industry to explore the use of nanoparticles for disease treatment or drug delivery has increased the need to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy or toxicity. However, evaluation of such properties using experimental means is time-consuming and costly. Thus, researchers are investigating the potential of using Quantitative Nanostructure-Activity Relationship (QNAR) models to predict the properties of nanoparticles prior to their synthesis. In this study, we developed a reliable, user-friendly and freely-accessible QNAR model to predict the cellular uptake of 105 nanoparticles with a single metal core by pancreatic cancer cells. Four modelling methods, namely Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, k nearest neighbour and support vector machine, were used to develop candidate models. A final consensus model was then developed using the top 5 candidate models. Validation of the final consensus model was done using a rigorous process by repeating the entire model development process five times using different combinations of training and validation sets. The final consensus model had a sensitivity of 86.7 to 98.2% and specificity of 67.3 to 76.6%. The majority of the wrong predictions were due to nanoparticles which had O-C-O-C-O bonding. Descriptors that were included in the final consensus models were mainly related to lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding. With the recent advances in QNAR methodology and its encouraging prediction toward virtual nanoparticles, the full potential of QNAR modelling should be exploited in the future to provide critical support to experimental studies over the design of nanomaterials.

The accumulation of stress will result in poor health condition to people. Effectively detecting the stress of human being in time provides a helpful way for people to better manage their stress. Much work has been done on recognizing the stress level of people by extracting features from the bio-signals acquired by physiological sensors. However, little work has been focused on the feature selection. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After the features are selected, their effectiveness in terms of correct rate and computational time are evaluated using five classification algorithms, Linear Discriminant Function, C4.5 induction tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). We use the driver stress database contributed by MIT Media lab for our experiments. Leaving one out as well as 10-fold data preparation approach is implemented as the cross validation method for our evaluation. Paired t-test is then performed to analyze and compare the experimental results, as well as for their statistical significance. Our study demonstrates the importance of feature selection and the effectiveness of the methods used in accurately classifying stress levels.

In this paper, we aimed at developing an effective machine learning scheme which leverages structural magnetic resonance imaging features in order to identify and discriminate individuals affected by mild AD on a single subject basis. Selected features included one-and two-way combinations of subcortical and cortical volumes as well as cortical thickness and curvature of numerous brain regions which are known to be vulnerable to AD. Additionally, several feature combinations were fed into support vector machines (SVMs) as well as Naive Bayes classifiers in order to compare scheme accuracy. The most efficient combination of features and classification scheme, which employed both subcortical and cortical volumes feature vectors and a SVM classifier, was able to distinguish mild AD patients from healthy controls with 86% accuracy (82% sensitivity and 90% specificity). While this investigation is of preliminary nature, and further efforts are currently underway towards automated feature selection, best classifier determination and parameter optimization, our results appear very promising in terms of automated high-accuracy discrimination of disease stages which cannot easily be distinguished though routine clinical investigation.

Furthermore, data uncertainty is prevalent in many real-world applications, such as sensor network, market analysis and medical diagnosis. In this article, we explore the issue of classification on uncertain data when only positive and unlabelled examples are available. We propose an algorithm to build naive Bayes classifier from positive and unlabelled examples with uncertainty. However, the algorithm requires the prior probability of positive class, and it is generally difficult for the user to provide this parameter in practice. Two approaches are proposed to avoid this user-specified parameter. One approach is to use a validation set to search for an appropriate value for this parameter, and the other is to estimate it directly. Our extensive experiments show that the two approaches can basically achieve satisfactory classification performance on uncertain data. In addition, our algorithm exploiting uncertainty in the dataset can potentially achieve better classification performance comparing to traditional naive Bayes which ignores uncertainty when handling uncertain data.

This sentiment is typically quantified in universal star ratings, which are not always available. We propose and compare the performance of several statistical methods of automatically classifying star ratings of reviews represented by means of a binary vector representation, with features signaling the presence of sentiment-carrying words. A nearest neighbor classifier maximizes recall, whereas a naive Bayes classifier excels in terms of precision, accuracy, and the root mean squared error of the assigned number of stars.

These classifiers are compared with fifteen real datasets which are pre-processed with feature selection methods. Up to 15.55% improvement in classification accuracy is observed, and Multilayer Perceptron appears to be the most sensitive classifier to feature selection.

Efficient prediction of phishing websites using supervised learning algorithms	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Antiphishing; Classification; Machine learning; Phishing; Prediction; Supervised learning		Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website. This paper employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Multi layer perceptron, Decision tree induction and Naive bayes classification are used for exploring the results. It has been observed that the decision tree classifier predicts the phishing website more accurately when comparing to other learning algorithms. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor for Image Classification	2012 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 16-21, 2012	Providence, RI	IEEE				We present Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor, an improvement to the NBNN image classification algorithm that increases classification accuracy and improves its ability to scale to large numbers of object classes. The key observation is that only the classes represented in the local neighborhood of a descriptor contribute significantly and reliably to their posterior probability estimates. Instead of maintaining a separate search structure for each class's training descriptors, we merge all of the reference data together into one search structure, allowing quick identification of a descriptor's local neighborhood. We show an increase in classification accuracy when we ignore adjustments to the more distant classes and show that the run time grows with the log of the number of classes rather than linearly in the number of classes as did the original. Local NBNN gives a 100 times speed-up over the original NBNN on the Caltech 256 dataset. We also provide the first head-to-head comparison of NBNN against spatial pyramid methods using a common set of input features. We show that local NBNN outperforms all previous NBNN based methods and the original spatial pyramid model. However, we find that local NBNN, while competitive with, does not beat state-of-the-art spatial pyramid methods that use local soft assignment and max-pooling.

Today most of the intrusion detection approaches focused on the issues of feature selection or reduction, since some of the features are irrelevant and redundant which results lengthy detection process and degrades the performance of an intrusion detection system (IDS). The purpose of this study is to identify important reduced input features in building IDS that is computationally efficient and effective. For this we investigate the performance of three standard feature selection methods using Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain and Gain Ratio. In this paper we propose method Feature Vitality Based Reduction Method, to identify important reduced input features. We apply one of the efficient classifier naive bayes on reduced datasets for intrusion detection. Empirical results show that selected reduced attributes give better performance to design IDS that is efficient and effective for network intrusion detection. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposed a feature selection which focuses on statistical pattern based on SVM Attribute. Experiments have shown that the determination of word importance may increase the speed of the classification algorithm and save their resource used significantly. The proposed method was studied by comparing classification performance among Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The results showed that Support Vector Machine was found to be the best algorithm with F-measure 93.6%. It is found that the feature selection can reduce dimensionality of data significantly.

However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy.

There is an urgent need to find an efficient way to assess the extent and variability of the disease at a broad spatial scale. The aim of this study is to explore the utility of transformed high spatial resolution QuickBird imagery and artificial neural networks, for the detection and mapping of pitch canker disease. Several vegetation indices including the Tasseled Cap Transformation were used to discriminate between healthy and infected P. radiata tree crowns using a feed-forward neural network and a Naive Bayes classifier. The neural network model showed high discriminatory power with an overall accuracy of 82.15% and KHAT of 0.65. These results are promising for the future management of pitch canker disease at a landscape scale.

Although, these are usually domain specific, and lack the property of scaling up prediction while handling data sets with huge size and high-dimensionality or imbalance class distribution. This article introduces an accuracy-based learning system called DTGA (decision tree and genetic algorithm) that aims to improve prediction accuracy over any classification problem irrespective to domain, size, dimensionality and class distribution. More specifically, the proposed system consists of two rule inducing phases. In the first phase, a base classifier, C4.5 (a decision tree based rule inducer) is used to produce rules from training data set, whereas GA (genetic algorithm) in the next phase refines them with the aim to provide more accurate and high-performance rules for prediction. The system has been compared with competent non-GA based systems: neural network, Naive Bayes, rule-based classifier using rough set theory and C4.5 (i.e., the base classifier of DTGA), on a number of benchmark datasets collected from UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning repository. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach provides marked improvement in a number of cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

DYNAMIC BAYESIAN SOCIO-SITUATIONAL SETTING CLASSIFICATION	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAR 25-30, 2012	Kyoto, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Signal Processing Soc, IEEE		Dynamic Bayesian networks; conversation classification; socio-situational setting	TEXT	We propose a dynamic Bayesian classifier for the socio-situational setting of a conversation. Knowledge of the socio-situational setting can be used to search for content recorded in a particular setting or to select context-dependent models in speech recognition. The dynamic Bayesian classifier has the advantage - compared to static classifiers such a naive Bayes and support vector machines - that it can continuously update the classification during a conversation. We experimented with several models that use lexical and part-of-speech information. Our results show that the prediction accuracy of the dynamic Bayesian classifier using the first 25% of a conversation is almost 98% of the final prediction accuracy, which is calculated on the entire conversation. The best final prediction accuracy, 88.85%, is obtained by bigram dynamic Bayesian classification using words and part-of-speech tags.

We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%.

The feature selection methods referenced here improve the accuracy of majority classes and meanwhile decrease the accuracy in minority classes as the cost. As a result, it brings about the multi-class imbalance problem. In this paper, main contributions include two aspects below. 1) An evaluation criterion based on information theory was proposed to assess how much do one feature bias towards one class. 2) A new feature selection method named BFS was proposed to reduce features and alleviate multi-class imbalance. BFS was compared with fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) and full feature set using Naive Bayes and ten skewed datasets. The results show that 1) BFS is more advantage to maintain the balance of multi-class classification results than FCBF, such as the reduction of g-mean is just about 8% using BFS, 2) classification accuracy of Naive Bayes using BFS can achieve to 90%.

Most researches in traditional Naive Bayes classification focus on the improvement of the classification algorithm, ignoring the selection of training data which has a great effect on the performance of classifier. And so a method is proposed to optimize the selection of training data in this paper. Adopting this method, the noisy instances in training data are eliminated by user-defined effectiveness threshold, improving the performance of classifier. Experimental results on large-scale data show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline classifier.

A key element of our new MCE training techniques is their ability to efficiently apply jackknifing or leave-one-out training to yield improved models which generalize better to unseen data. Experiments were conducted using recorded human-human telephone conversations from the Fisher Corpus using feature vector representations from word-based automatic speech recognition lattices.

Optimal row and column ordering to improve table interpretation using estimation of distribution algorithms	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						Bertin matrices; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Ordering of tables; Conciseness; Parametrization; Selective naive Bayes	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS	A common information representation task in research as well as educational and statistical practice is to comprehensively and intuitively express data in two-dimensional tables. Examples include tables in scientific papers, as well as reports and the popular press. Data is often simple enough for users to reorder. In many other cases though, there are complex data patterns that make finding the best re-arrangement of rows and columns for optimum readability a tough problem. We propose that row and column ordering should be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using evolutionary computation techniques. The use of genetic algorithms has already been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes for the first time the use of estimation of distribution algorithms for table ordering. We also propose alternative ways of representing the problem in order to reduce its dimensionality. By learning a selective naive Bayes classifier, we can find out how to jointly combine the parameters of these algorithms to get good table orderings.

Document-level classification of CT pulmonary angiography reports based on an extension of the ConText algorithm	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical language processing; ConText; Pulmonary emboli; Computed tomography; CTPA	TEXT; PNEUMONIA; INFORMATION; RADIOLOGY; EVENTS; SYSTEM	In this paper we describe an application called peFinder for document-level classification of CT pulmonary angiography reports. peFinder is based on a generalized version of the ConText algorithm, a simple text processing algorithm for identifying features in clinical report documents. peFinder was used to answer questions about the disease state (pulmonary emboli present or absent), the certainty state of the diagnosis (uncertainty present or absent), the temporal state of an identified pulmonary embolus (acute or chronic), and the technical quality state of the exam (diagnostic or not diagnostic). Gold standard answers for each question were determined from the consensus classifications of three human annotators. peFinder results were compared to naive Bayes' classifiers using unigrams and bigrams. The sensitivities (and positive predictive values) for peFinder were 0.98(0.83), 0.86(0.96), 0.94(0.93), and 0.60(0.90) for disease state, quality state, certainty state, and temporal state respectively, compared to 0.68(0.77), 0.67(0.87), 0.62(0.82), and 0.04(0.25) for the naive Bayes' classifier using unigrams, and 0.75(0.79), 0.52(0.69), 0.59(0.84), and 0.04(0.25) for the naive Bayes' classifier using bigrams.

J	Liu, YF; Guo, JM; Lee, JD				Liu, Yun-Fu; Guo, Jing-Ming; Lee, Jiann-Der			Halftone Image Classification Using LMS Algorithm and Naive Bayes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Bayes theorem; halftone image classification; halftoning; image analysis; inverse halftoning	DOT DIFFUSION; INVERSE; RESTORATION	Former research on inverse halftoning most focus on developing a general-purpose method for all types of halftone patterns, such as error diffusion, ordered dithering, etc., while fail to consider the natural discrepancies among various halftoning methods. To achieve optimal image quality for each halftoning method, the classification of halftone images is highly demanded. This study employed the least mean-square filter for improving the robustness of the extracted features, and employed the naive Bayes classifier to verify all the extracted features for classification. Nine of the most well-known halftoning methods were involved for testing. The experimental results demonstrated that the classification performance can achieve a 100% accuracy rate, and the number of distinguishable halftoning methods is more than that of a former method established by Chang and Yu.

We apply our method to proteins from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and show that, in comparison with other approaches, it predicts protein functions with significantly higher recall with no loss of precision. Specifically, it achieves 51% precision and 60% recall versus 45% and 26% for Majority and 24% and 61% for chi(2)-statistics, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, TY; Chiang, HM				Wang, Tai-Yue; Chiang, Huei-Min			Solving multi-label text categorization problem using support vector machine approach with membership function	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-label; One-against-one support vector machine; Membership function	SIMILARITY MEASURES; RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; SETS	The pervasiveness of information available on the internet means that increasing numbers of documents must be classified. Text categorization is not only undertaken by domain experts, but also by automatic text categorization systems. Therefore, a text categorization system with a multi-label classifier is necessary to process the large number of documents. In this study, a proposed multi-label text categorization system is developed to classify multi-label documents. Data mapping is performed to transform data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space with paired SVM output values, thus lowering the complexity of the computation. A pairwise comparison approach is applied to set the membership function in each predicted class to judge all possible classified classes. To better explain the proposed model, a comparative study using Reuter's data sets is performed on several multi-label approaches such as Naive Bayes, Multi-Label Mixture, Jaccard Kernel and Bp-MLL. Though the comparative results of the empirical experiment indicate that the proposed multi-label text categorization system performs better than other methods in terms of overall performance indices, these comparisons are done under the conditions without knowing original settings of parameters. From these comparative studies, it is found that these probabilities of documents appearing in correctly predicted classes and those of documents appearing in the wrongly predicted classes are important properties and we conclude that the probability of 0.5 for model membership function is a good criterion to judge between correctly and incorrectly classified documents from the results of the empirical experiment.

J	Kang, DK; Kim, MJ				Kang, Dae-Ki; Kim, Myoung-Jong			Propositionalized attribute taxonomies from data for data-driven construction of concise classifiers	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Propositionalization; Taxonomy; Naive Bayes learner		In this paper, we consider the problem of generating concise but accurate naive Bayes classifiers using taxonomy of propositionalized attributes. For the problem, we introduce propositionalized attribute taxonomy guided naive Bayes Learner (PAT-NBL), a machine learning algorithm that effectively utilizes taxonomy to generate compact classifiers. We extend classical naive Bayes learner to the PAT-NBL algorithm that traverses over a propositionalized taxonomy to search for a locally optimal cut. PAT-NBL uses bottom-up search to find the locally optimal cut on a given taxonomy. For the evaluation of candidate cuts, we apply conditional log-likelihood, conditional minimum description length, and conditional Akaike information criterion. The detected cut enables PAT-NBL to construct an instance space which corresponds to the taxonomy and the data. That is, after PAT-NBL determines a cut according to its information-theoretic criteria, the algorithm generates a concise naive Bayes classifier based on the cut. Our experimental results on UCI Machine Learning benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm can generate naive Bayes classifiers that are more compact and often comparably accurate to those produced by standard naive Bayes learners.

Comparative study of supervised classification algorithms for the detection of atmospheric pollution	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; Machine learning; Multilayer perceptron; Artificial neural network; Support vector machine; Bayesian network; Nearest neighbour; Decision tree; Fuzzy model; Air pollution	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	The management of atmospheric pollution using video is not yet widespread. However it is an efficient way to evaluate the polluting rejects coming from large industrial facilities when traditional captors are not usable. This paper presents a comparison of different classifiers for a monitoring system of polluting smokes. The data used in this work are stemming from a system of video analysis and signal processing. The database includes the pollution level of puffs of smoke defined by an expert. Six machine learning techniques are tested and compared to classify the puffs of smoke: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes classifier, artificial neural network, decision tree, support vector machine and a fuzzy model. The parameters of each type of classifier are split into three categories: learned parameters, parameters determined by a first step of the experimentation, and parameters set by the programmer. We compare the results of the best classifier of each type depending on the size of the learning set. A part of the discussion concerns the robustness of the classifier facing the case where classes of interest are under-represented, as the high level of pollution in our data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the curvature detection of embedded tactile sensors by proposing a ridged fingertip structure, simulating human fingerprints. In addition, a curvature detection approach based on machine learning methods is proposed to provide the embedded sensors with the ability to discriminate the surface curvature of different objects. For this purpose, a set of experiments were carried out to collect tactile signals from a 2 x 2 tactile sensor array, then the signals were processed and used for learning algorithms. To achieve the best possible performance for our machine learning approach, three different learning algorithms of Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared for various parameters.

In this study, the factors affecting the preference of undergraduate students for prepaid or postpaid cell phone service plans were analyzed and a multi-layer perceptron type feed forward neural network model was developed to predict the preferences. Using the responses to the questionnaire administered to a group of undergraduate students in Istanbul University, the factors determining the preference for service plan were determined with chi 2 test for independence. A classification model based on multi-layer perceptron type neural networks was developed. The classification accuracy of this model was compared to linear regression, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes and decision tree approaches and shown to be superior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Entropy-based discrelization method is used as the discretization method, and support vector machines, C4.5, k-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes are used as the classification methods. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is implemented without using any preprocessing method. Afterwards, the Parkinson's disease dataset is classified after implementing entropy-based discretization on the dataset. Both results are compared, and it is observed that using discretization method increases the success of classification on the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by 4.1% to 12.8%.

J	Kim, HJ				Kim, Han-joon			An Effective EM Extension of Naive Bayes Text Classifier with Uncertainty-based Selective Sampling	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Text Classification; Machine Learning; Naive Bayes; EM Algorithm; Selective Sampling; Classification Uncertainty		One of the most appropriate algorithms for operational text classification systems is the Naive Bayes because it is not only easy to incrementally update its pre-learned classification model and feature space, but also surprisingly accurate in spite of its wrong independence assumption. This paper focuses on improving Naive Bayes classifier by accelerating the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm. The multinomial Naive Bayes text classifier is extended with an accelerated EM algorithm that is simple yet has a fast convergence speed and allows estimating a more accurate classification model through automatic selective sampling. Throughout experiments using the well-known Reuters-21578 news collection, we show that the traditional Naive Bayes classifier can be significantly improved by the extended Naive Bayes algorithm with EM and selective sampling algorithms.

Early diagnosis, appropriate choice and immediate initiation of antibiotic therapy can greatly affect the outcome of any kind of infection. Phagocytes play a central role in the innate immune response of the organism to infection. They comprise the first-line of defense against infectious intruders in our body, being able to produce large quantities of reactive oxygen species, which can be detected by means of chemiluminescence (CL). The data preparation approach implemented in this work corresponds to a dynamic assessment of phagocytic respiratory burst localization in a luminol-enhanced whole blood CL system. We have previously applied this approach to the problem of identifying various intra-abdominal pathological processes afflicting peritoneal dialysis patients in the Nephrology department and demonstrated 84.6% predictive accuracy with the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm. In this study, we apply the CL-based approach to a larger sample of patients from two departments (Nephrology and Internal Medicine) with the aim of finding the most effective and interpretable feature sets and classification models for a fast and accurate identification of several infectious diseases. Materials and methods: Whole blood samples were collected from 78 patients (comprising 115 instances) with respiratory infections, infections associated with renal replacement therapy and patients without infections. CL kinetic parameters were calculated for each case, which was assigned into a specific clinical group according to the available clinical diagnostics. Feature selection wrapper and filter methods were applied to remove the irrelevant and redundant features and to improve the predictive performance of disease classification algorithms. Three data mining algorithms, C4.5 048) decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier were applied for inducing disease classification models and their performance in classifying three clinical groups was evaluated by 10 runs of a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Results and conclusions: The results demonstrate that the predictive power of the best models obtained with the three evaluated algorithms after feature selection was found to be in the range of 63.38 +/- 2.18-70.68 +/- 1.43%. The highest disease classification accuracy was reached by C4.5, which also provides the most informative model in the form of a decision tree, and the lowest accuracy was obtained with naive Bayes. The feature selection method attaining the best classification performance was the wrapper method in forward direction. Moreover, the classification models exposed biological patterns specific to the clinical states and the predictive features selected were found to be characteristic of a specific disorder. Based on these encouraging results, we believe that the CL-based data pre-processing approach combined with the wrapper forward feature selection procedure and the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm has a clear potential to become a fast, informative, and sensitive tool for predictive diagnostics of infectious diseases in clinics.

In previous research [15,17], an algorithm for learning LDTs was proposed and its performance on some benchmark classification problems were investigated and compared with a number of well known classifiers. In this paper, a methodology for extending LDTs to prediction problems is proposed and the performance of LDTs are compared with other state-of-art prediction algorithms such as a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system and Fuzzy Semi-Naive Bayes [13] on a variety of data sets. Finally, a method for linguistic query evaluation is discussed and supported with an example. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mamakis, G; Malamos, AG; Ware, JA				Mamakis, Georgios; Malamos, Athanasios G.; Ware, J. Andrew			An alternative approach for statistical single-label document classification of newspaper articles	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						language models; Naive Bayes Classifier; single-label document classification/categorization; statistics	TEXT CLASSIFICATION	Text classification is one of the most important sectors of machine learning theory. It enables a series of tasks among which are email spam filtering and context identification. Classification theory proposes a number of different techniques based on different technologies and tools. Classification systems are typically distinguished into single-label categorization and multi-label categorization systems, according to the number of categories they assign to each of the classified documents. In this paper, we present work undertaken in the area of single-label classification which resulted in a statistical classifier, based on the Naive Bayes assumption of statistical independence of word occurrence across a document. Our algorithm, takes into account cross-category word occurrence in deciding the class of a random document. Moreover, instead of estimating word co-occurrence in assigning a class, we estimate word contribution for a document to belong in a class. This approach outperforms other statistical classifiers as Naive Bayes Classifier and Language Models, as proven in our results.

Improving feature selection algorithms using normalised feature histograms	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								The proposed feature selection method builds a histogram of the most stable features from random subsets of a training set and ranks the features based on a classifier based cross-validation. This approach reduces the instability of features obtained by conventional feature selection methods that occur with variation in training data and selection criteria. Classification results on four microarray and three image datasets using three major feature selection criteria and a naive Bayes classifier show considerable improvement over benchmark results.

Several algorithms have been presented to select the proper set of data and elicit suitable structured environments to handle the queries submitted to OLAP systems, which are called view selection algorithms to materialize. As users' requirements may change during run time, materialization must be viewed dynamically. In this work, the authors propose and operate a dynamic view management system to select and materialize views with new and improved architecture, which predicts incoming queries through association rule mining and three probabilistic reasoning approaches: Conditional probability, Bayes' rule, and Naive Bayes' rule. The proposed system is compared with DynaMat system and Hybrid system through two standard measures. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic view selection system improves these measures. This system outperforms DynaMat and Hybrid for each type of query and each sequence of incoming queries.

This situation makes it necessary to create specialized tools capable of supporting users in their searches. Objective: To apply and compare strategies that were developed to investigate the use of the Portuguese version of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for constructing an automated classifier for Brazilian Portuguese-language web-based content within or outside of the field of healthcare, focusing on the lay public. Methods: 3658 Brazilian web pages were used to train the classifier and 606 Brazilian web pages were used to validate it. The strategies proposed were constructed using content-based vector methods for text classification, such that Naive Bayes was used for the task of classifying vector patterns with characteristics obtained through the proposed strategies. Results: A strategy named InDeCS was developed specifically to adapt MeSH for the problem that was put forward. This approach achieved better accuracy for this pattern classification task (0.94 sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve). Conclusions: Because of the significant results achieved by InDeCS, this tool has been successfully applied to the Brazilian healthcare search portal known as Busca Saude. Furthermore, it could be shown that MeSH presents important results when used for the task of classifying web-based content focusing on the lay public. It was also possible to show from this study that MeSH was able to map out mutable non-deterministic characteristics of the web. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Long term cardiovascular risk models' combination	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Management of cardiovascular diseases; Modeling; Bayesian networks	ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES; ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; HEART-DISEASE; PREVENTION; SCORE; CLASSIFIERS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	The correct diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is a key factor to reduce social and economic costs. In this context, cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools are of fundamental importance. This work addresses two major drawbacks of the currert cardiovascular risk score systems: reduced number of risk factors considered by each individual tool and the inability of these tools to deal with incomplete information. To achieve these goals a two phase strategy was followed. In the first phase, a common representation procedure, based on a Naive-Bayes classifier methodology, was applied to a set of current risk assessment tools. Classifiers' individual parameters and conditional probabilities were initially evaluated through a frequency estimation method. In a second phase, a combination scheme was proposed exploiting the particular features of Bayes probabilistic reasoning, followed by conditional probabilities optimization based on a genetic algorithm approach. This strategy was applied to describe and combine ASSIGN and Framingham models. Validation results were obtained based on individual models, assuming their statistical correctness. The achieved results are very promising, showing the potential of the strategy to accomplish the desired goals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Abellan, J; Cano, A; Masegosa, AR; Moral, S				Abellan, Joaquin; Cano, Andres; Masegosa, Andres R.; Moral, Serafin			A memory efficient semi-Naive Bayes classifier with grouping of cases	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Supervised classification; memory space complexity; semi-Naive Bayes models; grouping of cases; mobile computing	CREDAL SETS; CONSTRUCTION	Previous analysis of learning data can help us to discover hidden relations among features. We can use this knowledge to select the most suitable learning methods and to achieve further improvements in the performance of classification systems. For the known Naive Bayes classifier, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to reconstruct the set of attributes in order to remove or debilitate dependence relations, which can reduce the accuracy of this classifier. These methods are included in the ones known as semi-naive Bayes classifiers. In the present research, we present a semi-Naive Bayes classifier that searches for dependent attributes using a filter approach. In order to prevent the number of cases of the compound attributes from being excessively high, a grouping procedure is always applied after the merging of two variables. This method attempts to group two or more cases of the new variable into a single one, in order to reduce the cardinality of the compound variables. As a result, the model presented is a competitive classifier with respect to the state of the art of semi-Naive Bayes classifiers, particularly in terms of quality of class probability estimates, but with a much lower memory space complexity.

The algorithm is based on previously published signal quality metrics, with some novel additions, designed for intensive care monitoring. The algorithms have been adapted for use on short (10s) 12-lead ECGs. The metrics quantify spectral energy distribution, higher order moments and inter-channel and inter-algorithm agreement. Six metrics are produced for each channel (72 features in all) and presented to machine learning algorithms for training on the provided labeled data (Set-a) for the challenge. (Binary labels were available, indicating whether the data were acceptable or unacceptable for clinical interpretation.) We re-annotated all the data in Set-a as well as those in Set-b (the test data) using two independent annotators, and a third for adjudication of differences. Events were balanced and the 1000 subjects in Set-a were used to train the classifiers. We compared four classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron artificial neural network classifiers. The SVM and MLP provided the best (and almost equivalent) classification accuracies of 99% on the training data (Set-a) and 95% on the test data (Set-b). The binary classification results (acceptable or unacceptable) were then submitted as an entry into the PhysioNetComputing in Cardiology Competition 2011. Before the competition deadline, we scored 92.6% on the unseen test data (0.6% less than the winning entry). After improving labelling inconsistencies and errors we achieved 94.0%, the highest overall score of all competition entrants.	[Clifford, G.

We analysed and manually annotated 4,404 e-mails from citizens to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. and compared two methods for detecting answerable e-mails: manually-created text patterns (rule-based) and machine learning-based methods. We found that the text pattern-based method gave much higher precision at 89 percent than the machine learning-based method that gave only 63 percent precision. The recall was slightly higher (66 percent) for the machine learning-based methods than for the text patterns (47 percent). We also found that 23 percent of the total e-mail flow was processed by the automatic e-mail answering system.

We compare the predictive performance of two approaches for training a learner model with domain data. One is based on the principle of building the model solely from observable data items, such as exercises or test items. Skills modelling is not part of the training phase, but instead dealt with at later stage. The other approach incorporates a single latent skill in the model. We compare the capacity of both approaches to accurately predict item outcome (binary success or failure) from a subset of item outcomes. Three types of item-to-item models based on standard Bayesian modeling algorithms are tested: (1) Naive Bayes, (2) Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and (3) a K2 Bayesian Classifier. Their performance is compared to the widely used IRT-2PL approach which incorporates a single latent skill. The results show that the item-to-item approaches perform as well, or better than the IRT-2PL approach over 4 widely different data sets, but the differences vary considerably among the data sets. We discuss the implications of these results and the issues relating to the practical use of item-to-item models.

In the living area, a fine-grained context may not only contain information about the occupancy of certain furniture, but also the posture of a user on the occupied furniture. This information is useful in the application area of home automation, where, for example, a lying user may effect a different system reaction than a sitting user. In this paper, we present an approach for determining contextual information from furniture, using capacitive proximity sensors. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of Naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees and radial basis function networks, regarding the classification of user postures. Therefore, we use our generic classification framework to visualize, train and evaluate postures with up to two persons on a couch. Based on a data set collected from multiple users, we show that this approach is robust and suitable for real-time classification.

The set of 11 diagnostic variables was used, which included, among others, number of lactation, artificial insemination (AI) season, age of inseminated cow, proportion of HF-genes in cow genotype, sex of calf from preceding calving, length of pregnancy, milk, protein and fat yield. Two conception classes were distinguished: the GOOD class, if a cow conceived after one or two AIs and the "POOR" class, if more than two AIs per conception were required. The models were characterized by capability of predicting the membership of conceptions to either class. Correctness of predictions was 83%. CART proved to be more precise in detecting conceptions of the POOR class (sensitivity) compared with predictions by NBC (P <= 0.01). Specificity was similar for both classifiers (90% and 93%). Among the variables determining conception class, calving-to-conception interval, calving interval and the difference between the mean body condition and condition at AI were the most significant variables for CART. Utilization of these classifiers, particularly of CART, may help a breeder to appropriately prepare cows for AI, thus contributing to the improved financial results of a herd.

In this classification problem, the instances of the dataset are divided into disjoint groups, where there is no certainty about the labels associated with individual samples. However, in each group the number of instances that belong to each class is known. We propose several versions of an EM-algorithm that learns naive Bayes models to deal with the exposed problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The obtained results show a competitive behaviour of our proposals.

Although methods such as collaborative filtering have been shown to be effective in recommendation systems, in a limited user environment, there are not enough users that would make collaborative filtering effective. A general framework, called iScore, is presented for defining and measuring the "interestingness" of articles, incorporating user-feedback. iScore addresses the various aspects of what makes an article interesting, such as topic relevance, uniqueness, freshness, source reputation, and writing style. It employs various methods, such as multiple topic tracking, online parameter selection, language models, clustering, sentiment analysis, and phrase extraction to measure these features. Due to varying reasons that users hold about why an article is interesting, an online feature selection method in naive Bayes is also used to improve recommendation results. iScore can outperform traditional IR techniques by as much as 50.7%. iScore and its components are evaluated in the news recommendation task using three datasets from Yahoo! News, actual users, and Digg. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pon, R. K.; Cardenas, A. F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Buttler, D.

With the increase in number of web users and the websites, the need for website classification gains attraction. The website classification based on URLs alone plays an important role, since the contents of web pages need not be fetched for classification. In this paper, a soft computing approach is proposed for classification of websites based on features extracted from URLs alone. The Open Directory Project dataset was considered and the proposed system classified the websites into various categories using Naive Bayes approach. The performance of the system was evaluated and Precision, Recall and F-measure values of 0.7, 0.88 and 0.76 were achieved by this approach.

The aim is to effectively and automatically classify documents to separate classes based on their topics. The classification with self-organising map was tested with three data sets and the results were then compared to those of six well known baseline methods: k-means clustering. Ward's clustering, k nearest neighbour searching, discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier and classification tree. The self-organising map proved to be yielding the highest accuracies of tested unsupervised methods in classification of the Reuters news collection and the Spanish CLEF 2003 news collection, and comparable accuracies against some of the supervised methods in all three data sets.

By incorporating cognitive tools into plots and character roles, narrative-centered learning environments can promote self-regulated learning in a manner that is transparent to students. In order to adapt narrative plots to explicitly support effective cognitive tool-use, narrative-centered learning environments need to be able to make early predictions about how effectively students will utilize learning resources. This paper presents results from an investigation into machine-learned models for making early predictions about students' use of a specific cognitive tool in the Crystal Island learning environment. Multiple classification models are compared and discussed. Findings suggest that support vector machine and naive Bayes models offer considerable promise for generating useful predictive models of cognitive tool use in narrative-centered learning environments.

With a number of learning methods available, a need for their comparison arises. This paper presents initial comparison results for selected algorithms (SARSA, Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper), which are obtained based on the new multi-dimensional Farmer-Pest problem domain, which is suitable for benchmarking learning algorithms. The results show that supervised learning algorithms can be used to generate agent strategy. It appears that for simple environment reinforcement learning algorithm together with Naive Bayes learning gives best results. Although, in a difficult environment, C4.5 and Ripper are the best.

One standard approach involves first imputing the missing values, then giving the completed data to the learning algorithm. However, this is especially problematic when the features are nominal. This work presents "classifier-based nominal imputation" (CNI), an easy-to-implement and effective nominal imputation technique that views nominal imputation as classification: it learns a classifier for each feature (that maps the other features of an instance to the predicted value of that feature), then uses that classifier to predict themissing values of that feature. Our empirical results show that learners that preprocess their incomplete training data using CNI using support vector machine or decision tree learners have significantly higher predictive accuracy than learners that (1) do not use preprocessing, (2) use baseline imputation techniques, or (3) use this CNI preprocessor with other classification algorithms. This improvement is especially apparent when the base learner is instance-based. CNI is also found helpful for other base learners, such as naive Bayes and decision tree, on incomplete nominal data.

Since the documents can be annotated with multiple keywords (labels), we approach this task by applying and evaluating multi-label classification methods of supervised machine learning. We describe forming a test corpus of 1015 economic documents that we automatically classify using a tool which integrates ontology construction with text mining methods. In our experimental work, we evaluate three groups of multi-label classification approaches: transformation to single-class problems, specialized multi-label models, and hierarchical/ranking models. The classification accuracies of all tested classification models indicate that there is a potential for using all of the evaluated methods to solve this task. The results show the benefits of using complex groups of approaches which benefit from exploiting dependence between the labels. A good alternative to these approaches is also single-class naive Bayes classifiers coupled with the binary relevance transformation approach.

But online content can be misused when the information being distributed, such as radical opinions, is unsolicited or inappropriate. This study introduces a technique that combines machine learning and semantic-oriented approaches to identify radical opinions in hate group Web forums. Four types of text features (syntactic, stylistic, content-specific, and lexicon features) are extracted as text classification predictors, and three classification techniques (SVM, Naive Bayes, and Adaboost) are implemented. Postings from two hate group Web forums are collected and the preliminary results are encouraging. In addition, cross-validation indicates the proposed technique is stable and extendible to timeframes beyond that of the training data. The proposed technique can also be an effective tool for other sentiment classification problems.

J	Ye, ZR; Veneziano, D; Lord, D				Ye, Zhirui; Veneziano, David; Lord, Dominique			Safety impact of Gateway Monuments	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic safety; Gateway Monuments; Empirical Bayes; Before-after study	SEVERITY	Gateway Monuments are free standing roadside structures or signage that communicate the name of a city, country or township to motorists. The placement of such monuments within state-controlled right-of-way is a relatively recent occurrence in California. As a result, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) initiated research to quantify the impacts that this type of signage may or may not have on crashes in their vicinity. To date, no specific research has examined the impact such features have on crashes. To determine whether these features impacted safety, the before-after study method using the Empirical Bayes technique was used, with reference groups and Safety Performance Functions adapted from existing studies, eliminating the need to calibrate new models. Results indicated that, on an individual basis, no deterioration in safety was observed at any monument site. When all sites were examined collectively (using two different scenarios), the calculated index of effectiveness values were 0.978 and 0.680, respectively, corresponding to 2.2% and 32.0% reductions in crashes. In addition to the EB method, naive study methods (with and without AADT taken into account) were applied to the study data. Results (crash reductions) from these methods also showed that the presence of Gateway Monuments did not have negative impact on traffic safety. However, the use of EB technique should be very careful employed when adopting reference groups from different jurisdictions, as these may affect the validity of EB results. In light of these results, Caltrans may continue to participate in the Gateway Monument Program at its discretion with the knowledge that roadway safety is not impacted by monuments.

In this paper, an auxiliary feature method is proposed. It determines features by an existing feature selection method, and selects an auxiliary feature which can reclassify the text space aimed at the chosen features. Then the corresponding conditional probability is adjusted in order to improve classification accuracy. Illustrative examples show that the proposed meth-od indeed improves the performance of naive Bayes classifier. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A novel information theoretic-interact algorithm (IT-IN) for feature selection using three machine learning algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Correlation; Relevance; Redundancy; Consistency	MUTUAL INFORMATION; RELEVANCE	The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and inconsistent features in the data-mining model results in poor predictions and high computational overhead. This paper proposes a novel information theoretic-based interact (IT-IN) algorithm, which concerns the relevance, redundancy, and consistency of the features. The proposed IT-IN algorithm is compared with existing Interact, FCBF, Relief and CFS feature selection algorithms. To evaluate the classification accuracy of IT-IN and remaining four feature selection algorithms, Naive Bayes, SVM, and ELM classifier are used for ten UCI repository datasets. The proposed IT-IN performs better than existing above algorithms in terms of number of features. The specially designed hash function is used to speed up the IT-IN algorithms and provides minimum computation time than the Interact algorithms. The result clearly reveals that the proposed feature selection algorithm improves the classification accuracy for ELM, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers. The performance of proposed IT-IN with ELM classifier is superior to other classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Deisy, C.; Koori, J.

A Naive Bayes Classifier for Intensities Using Peak Ground Velocity and Acceleration	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY; SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS; MOTION PREDICTION EQUATIONS; EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS; PARAMETERS; SELECTION; CALIFORNIA; MAGNITUDE; MODELS	A naive Bayes classifier is determined to predict intensities from peak ground velocity and acceleration. It is trained on the same dataset that was used in the study of Faenza and Michelini (2010). The naive Bayes classifier directly estimates a discrete probability distribution for the ordinal intensities. Comparisons based on generalization error, estimated by cross-validation, show that the naive Bayes classifier performs better than traditionally employed regression models.	[Kuehn, N.

Comparison of Statistical Methods to Classify Environmental Genomic Fragments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian classification; DNA; language models; metagenomics	NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS; SEQUENCES; SIGNATURE; DNA; METAGENOMICS; BIASES; TOOL	"Binning" (or taxonomic classification) of DNA sequence reads is an initial step to analyzing an environmental biological sample. Currently, a homology-based tool, BLAST, is one of the most commonly used tools to label DNA reads, but it is argued that BLAST will quickly lose its classification ability as the genome databases grow. In this paper, we compare the accuracies of a nave Bayes classifier (NBC) and statistical language model to BLAST for binning reads and demonstrate that NBC obtains good performance for the low cost of computational complexity. On the other hand, the back-off n-gram language model can improve accuracy when only partial training data is available (such as in-progress sequencing projects). NBC demonstrates comparable performance to BLAST and can also be optimized on partial training datasets by adjusting the word feature size. A fivefold cross validation is conducted to compare each method's accuracy for determining novel genomes at different taxonomic levels, with NBC outperforming BLAST for species-level classification but BLAST outperforming NBC for genus-level and phyla-level classification. In conclusion, the NBC is a competitive taxonomic classifier, and language models can improve performance when only partial training data is available.

Predicting the start week of respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks using real time weather variables	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							INFANT BRONCHIOLITIS; AIR-POLLUTANTS; GROUP-A; RSV; HEALTH; POPULATION; POLLUTION; EPIDEMICS; UTAH	Background: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a major cause of bronchiolitis, has a large impact on the census of pediatric hospitals during outbreak seasons. Reliable prediction of the week these outbreaks will start, based on readily available data, could help pediatric hospitals better prepare for large outbreaks. Methods: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models were constructed using weather data from 1985-2008 considering only variables that are available in real time and that could be used to forecast the week in which an RSV outbreak will occur in Salt Lake County, Utah. Outbreak start dates were determined by a panel of experts using 32,509 records with ICD-9 coded RSV and bronchiolitis diagnoses from Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and clinics for the RSV seasons from 1985 to 2008. Results: NB models predicted RSV outbreaks up to 3 weeks in advance with an estimated sensitivity of up to 67% and estimated specificities as high as 94% to 100%. Temperature and wind speed were the best overall predictors, but other weather variables also showed relevance depending on how far in advance the predictions were made. The weather conditions predictive of an RSV outbreak in our study were similar to those that lead to temperature inversions in the Salt Lake Valley. Conclusions: We demonstrate that Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models based on weather data available in real time have the potential to be used as effective predictive models. These models may be able to predict the week that an RSV outbreak will occur with clinical relevance. Their clinical usefulness will be field tested during the next five years.

J	Fagni, T; Sebastiani, F				Fagni, Tiziano; Sebastiani, Fabrizio			Selecting Negative Examples for Hierarchical Text Classification: An Experimental Comparison	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CATEGORIZATION; SYSTEM	Hierarchical text classification (HTC) approaches have recently attracted a lot of interest on the part of researchers in human language technology and machine learning, since they have been shown to bring about equal, if not better, classification accuracy with respect to their "flat" counterparts while allowing exponential time savings at both learning and classification time. A typical component of HTC methods is a "local" policy for selecting negative examples: Given a category c, its negative training examples are by default identified with the training examples that are negative for c and positive for the categories which are siblings of c in the hierarchy. However, this policy has always been taken for granted and never been subjected to careful scrutiny since first proposed 15 years ago. This article proposes a thorough experimental comparison between this policy and three other policies for the selection of negative examples in HTC contexts, one of which (BESTLOCAL(k)) is being proposed for the first time in this article. We compare these policies on the hierarchical versions of three supervised learning algorithms (boosting, support vector machines, and naive Bayes) by performing experiments on two standard TC datasets, REUTERS-21578 and RCV1-v2.

Improving a SVM Meta-classifier for Text Documents by using Naive Bayes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						Meta-classification; Support Vector Machine; Naive Bayes; Text document and Performance Evaluation		Text categorization is the problem of classifying text documents into a set of predefined classes. In this paper, we investigated two approaches: a) to develop a classifier for text document based on Naive Bayes Theory and b) to integrate this classifier into a meta-classifier in order to increase the classification accuracy. The basic idea is to learn a meta-classifier to optimally select the best component classifier for each data point. The experimental results show that combining classifiers can significantly improve the classification accuracy and that our improved meta-classification strategy gives better results than each individual classifier. For Reuters2000 text documents we obtained classification accuracies up to 93.87%.

One of the most difficult problems to be solved by metacomputing systems is ensuring accurate and fast prediction of available performance on each resource. The main objective of the present study is to develop a new prediction model that can be used to predict the future CPU load in a distributed computing environment. This prediction model is based on a mixture of Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) via the naive Bayes assumption. Experimental results for different load time series confirm that the new prediction model performs better than other CPU load prediction methods. In addition, a comparison with previous prediction methods to evaluate their accuracy is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessing Drug Treatment Preferences of Patients with Crohn's Disease A Conjoint Analysis	PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; INFORMED DECISION-MAKING; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATIENTS SATISFACTION; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; ADHERENCE; CARE; OUTCOMES; RECOMMENDATIONS; HETEROGENEITY	Background: Patient preference has been recognized as being of increasing importance when choosing a drug therapy for chronic conditions for which there are no cures and for which long-term treatment is needed. Objective: To quantify treatment preferences and priorities of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods: This was a prospective Internet-based survey of adult participants with moderate to severe CD who were recruited through two national survey panels in the US. The survey included questions about diagnostic and treatment histories, attitudes and perceptions related to CD, and CD therapy. In a discrete-choice-based conjoint exercise, respondents selected a preferred biologic treatment option from each of 16 pairs of drug profiles that systematically varied efficacy, convenience, and product history attributes. A hierarchical Bayes probit model was utilized to estimate respondent-level 'utility scores' for each of the attribute levels. In a separate exercise, respondents also directly ranked each specific attribute. Two-tailed tests were conducted to determine statistical significance at p < 0.05. Results: A total of 252 participants were surveyed, 202 (80%) of whom were biologic naive. Mean age was 44.1 years and mean disease duration was 11.6 years. The majority (71.8%) were female. In the conjoint exercise, the three attributes of greatest importance in accounting for patients' biologic therapy preference were (greater) proportion of patients achieving lasting remission, (decreased) frequency of medication administration, and (higher) proportion of patients responding in 2 weeks. In the direct ranking exercise, the proportion of CD patients achieving lasting remission was selected as the most important attribute by the most respondents (27%), followed by the proportion of CD patients responding in 2 weeks (23%). Conclusion: Achievement of lasting remission and a rapid clinical response were the biologic treatment characteristics highly valued by respondents in this survey. It is critical that physicians provide patients with balanced information regarding the benefits and risks, convenience, and medication history of each treatment option available to them in order for patients to make informed therapy choices that reflect their personal priorities.

A common criterion to decide on the number of selected genes is minimizing the classifier error. However, considering the risk of overfitting due to the small sample size, and the fact that the number of selected genes is usually larger than the suspected number of discriminating genes, this work proposes relaxing the minimum error rate criterion. The paper shows that from a small number of feature selection and classification methods, it is possible to find configurations that select few genes without significantly worsening the error rate of the best classifier. Average ranking for 10 to 40 genes shows that SVM-RFE with Naive Bayes and FCBF with SVM behave consistently well.

When applying unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering it is useful to determine which words are event-specific and which topic they relate to. Continuous language models are used to model the generation of news stories over time and from these models two measures are derived: bendiness which indicates whether a word is event specific and shape distance which indicates whether two terms are likely to relate to the same topic. These are used to construct a new clustering technique which identifies and characterises the underlying events within the news stream.

The task of learning from multi-label data can be addressed by methods that transform the multi-label classification problem into several single-label classification problems. The binary relevance approach is one of these methods, where the multi-label learning task is decomposed into several independent binary classification problems, one for each label in the set of labels, and the final labels for each example are determined by aggregating the predictions from all binary classifiers. However, this approach fails to consider any dependency among the labels. In this paper, we consider a simple approach which can be used to explore labels dependency aiming to accurately predict label combinations. An experimental study using decision trees, a kernel method as well as Naive Bayes as base-learning techniques shows the potential of the proposed approach to improve the multi-label classification performance.

This paper presents a bootstrap feature selection for ensemble classifiers to deal with this problem and compares with traditional feature selection for ensemble (select optimal features from whole dataset before bootstrap selected data). Four base classifiers: Multi layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are used to evaluate the performance of UCT machine learning repository and causal discovery datasets. Bootstrap feature selection algorithm provides slightly better accuracy than traditional feature selection for ensemble classifiers.

This paper presents a comparison analysis between correlation-based and causal feature selection for ensemble classifiers. MLP and SVM are used as base classifier and compared with Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. According to the results, correlation-based feature selection algorithm can eliminate more redundant and irrelevant features, provides slightly better accuracy and less complexity than causal feature selection. Ensemble using Bagging algorithm can improve accuracy in both correlation-based and causal feature selection.

It has the potential to build predictive neural network models of polynomial functions using only a reduced set of features which minimizes the prediction error. This paper explores the offline recognition of isolated handwritten numeral characters described with non-Gaussian topological features using GMDH-based polynomial networks. In order to study the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply it on a publicly available dataset of isolated handwritten numerals and compare the results with five other state-of-the-art classifiers: multi layer Perceptron, support-vector machine, radial-basis function, naive Bayes and rule-based classifiers. In addition to improving the classification accuracy and the per-class performance measures, using GMDH-based polynomial neural networks has led to significant feature dimensionality reduction.

We first propose a simple label-filtering algorithm (LFA), which can remove most of the irrelevant labels for a query image while the potential labels are maintained. With a small population of potential labels left, we then apply the Naive-Bayes Nearest-Neighbor (NBNN) classifier as the second stage of our algorithm to identify the labels for the query image. This approach has been evaluated on the Corel database, and compared to existing algorithms. Experiment results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a promising result, as it outperforms existing algorithms.

Users spend a valuable amount of time deleting spam emails. More importantly, ever increasing spam emails occupy server storage space and consume network bandwidth. Keyword-based spam email filtering strategies will eventually be less successful to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes their tricks to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are patterns and these patterns can be modeled to combat spam. This paper investigates the possibilities of modeling spammer behavioral patterns by well-known classification algorithms such as Naive Bayesian classifier (Naive Bayes), Decision Tree Induction (DTI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Preliminary experimental results demonstrate a promising detection rate of around 92%, which is considerably an enhancement of performance compared to similar spammer behavior modeling research.

Efficient Intrusion Detection with Reduced Dimension Using Data Mining Classification Methods and Their Performance Comparison	INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Trends in Business Administration and Information Processing	MAR 26-27, 2010	Trivandrum, INDIA	ACEEE		Intrusion Detection System; Best first Search; ID3; J48; Naive Bayes; OneR; Classifier Performance Evaluator; Cross Validation		Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the science of detection of malicious activity on a computer network. Due to the enormous volume existing and newly appearing network data, Data Mining classification methods are used for Intrusion Detection System. In this paper the classifying methods used are ID3, J48, Naive Bayes and OneR. The data set used for this experiment is kddcup1999. The dimensionality reduction is being performed from 41 attributes to 7 and 14 attributes based on Best First Search method and the 4 classifying methods are being applied. The result shows that ID3 and J48 method carry the highest accuracy and sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes. Naive Bayes holds the highest degree of specification for all three dimensionalities. OneR has the worst Sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes but the time taken by OneR for classification is very less. It is found that the optimal algorithm may vary based on the dimensionality.

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many contexts (e.g., spam identification, text categorization, etc) and are considered a powerful tool for the successful automation of several classification-based tasks. In this paper we present a study on the applicability of five widely used text classification algorithms in the context of web services robustness testing. In practice, we assess the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Large Linear Classification, K-nearest neighbor (Ibk), and Hyperpipes in classifying web services responses. Results indicate that these algorithms can be effectively used to automate the identification of robustness issues while reducing human intervention. However, in all mechanisms there are cases of misclassified responses, which means that there is space for improvement.

However, few research works are on how to select appropriate metrics for fault-proneness prediction currently. We conduct a large-scale comparative experiment of nine different software metrics reduction methods over eleven public-domain data sets from the NASA metrics data repository. The Naive Bayes data miner, with a log-filtering preprocessor on the numeric data, is utilized to construct the prediction model. Comparisons are based on the analysis of variance. Our conclusion is that, reduction methods of software metrics are important to build adaptable and robust software fault-proneness prediction models. Given our results on Naive Bayes and log-filtering, discrete wavelet transformation outperforms other reduction methods, and correlation-based feature selection with genetic search algorithm and information gain can also obtain better predicted performance.

Therefore, fault-prone module detection is one of the major and traditional area of software engineering. Although there are many approaches to detect fault-prone modules, they have their own pros and cons. Consequently, it is recommended to use appropriate approach on the various situations. This paper tries to show an integrated approach using two different fault-prone module detection approaches. To do so, we prepare two approaches of fault-prone module detection: a text feature metrics based approach using naive Bayes classifier and a complexity metrics based approach using logistic regression. The former one is proposed by us and the latter one is widely used approach. For the data for application, we used data obtained from Eclipse, which is publicly available. From the result of pre-experiment, we find that each approach has the pros and cons. That is, the text feature based approach has high recall, and complexity metrics based approach has high precision. In order to use their merits effectively, we proposed an integrated approach to apply these two approaches for fault-prone module detection. The result of experiment shows that the proposed approach shows better accuracy than each approach.

Nursing activity recognition using an inexpensive game controller: An application to infection control	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Infection control; hand hygiene; accelerometer; nursing activities Sony PlayStation; Sixaxis		It is estimated that 10% of the patients admitted to North American hospitals die of hospital acquired infections. Approximately half of these are thought to be a consequence of poor hand hygiene practices by the hospital staff. Electronic hand washing reminders that prompt caregivers to wash their hands before and after the patient/patient's environment contact may help to increase the hand hygiene compliance rate. However, the current systems fail to identify the nursing procedures happening around the patient to issue proper hand hygiene prompt. In this research we used the hardware of a low-cost wireless Sony game controller, which included a 3-axis accelerometer, to identify six nursing activities happening around a patient. We attached five sensors to eight nurses' left and right wrists, left and right upper arms, and the backs. Each nurse performed 10 trials of each nursing activity in sequence, followed by a combined nursing activities trial. We extracted mean, standard deviation, energy, and correlation among axes per sensor and compared the results of 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN), Decision Tree (J48), and Naive Bayes classifiers. 1-NN classifier had the best performance and on average regardless of the sensor locations, we achieved 84% +/- 2% accuracy.

Et is claimed that WSD is essential for those applications that require of language comprehension modules such as search engines, machine translation systems, automatic answer machines, second life agents, etc. Moreover, with the huge amounts of information in Internet and the fact that this information is continuosly growing in different languages, we are encourage to deal with cross-lingual scenarios where WSD systems are also needed. On the other hand, Lexical Substitution (LS) refers to the process of finding a substitute word for a source word in a given sentence. The LS task needs to be approached by firstly disambiguating the source word, therefore, these two tasks (WSD and LS) are somehow related. In this paper, we present a naive approach to tackle the problem of cross-lingual WSD and cross-lingual lexical substitution. We use a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EUROPARL parallel corpus, in order to calculate the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language). Two versions of the probabilistic model are tested: unweighted and weighted. The results were compared with those of an international competition, obtaining a good performance.

The gait of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to identify the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg. Results show that naive Bayes needs more tags and less noise to reach classification accuracy of 98 % than random forest for 99 %.

For this reason, manual observation is not feasible anymore and machine learning methods are progressing to analyze these new data. Specifically, since the number of genes is very high, feature selection methods have proven valuable to deal with this unbalanced - high dimensionality and low cardinality - datasets. Our method is composed by a discretizer, a filter and the FVQIT (Frontier Vector Quantization using Information Theory) classifier. It is employed to classify eight DNA gene-expression microarray datasets of different kinds of cancer. A comparative study with other classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), C4.5, naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor is performed. Our approach shows excellent results outperforming all other classifiers.

We have mainly focused on co-occurrence of non dictionary words across bloggers of different gender and age groups. For this analysis, we have focused on the feature use of slang words to study the stylistic variations of bloggers across various age groups and gender. We have modeled the co-occurrences of slang words used by bloggers as graph based model where nodes are slang words and edges represent the number of cooccurrences and studied the variations in predicting age groups and gender. We have used demographically tagged blog corpus from ICWSM Spinner damsel for these experiments and used Naive Bayes classifier with 10 fold cross validations. Preliminary results shows that the concurrence of of slang words could be a better choice for predicting age and gender.

Given the good performance of SRs compared to other classifiers for both image classification and phonetic classification, in this paper, we extended the use of SRs for text classification, a method which has thus far not been explored for this domain. Specifically, we demonstrate how sparse representations can be used for text classification and how their performance varies with the vocabulary size of the documents. In addition, we also show that this method offers promising results over the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, a standard baseline classifier used for text categorization, thus introducing an alternative class of methods for text categorization.

In this study, our objective is to build precise and accurate classification models to predict the factors, which attribute to the disparity in healthcare coverage in the United States. The study utilizes twenty-three variables and 67,636 records from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In our comparative analysis, three statistical feature extraction methods, Chi-Square, Gain Ratio, and Info Gain, were used to extract a set of relevant features, which were then subjected to the classification models, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to analyze healthcare coverage. The most important factors that were discovered in the model are presented in this paper.

We describe two existing approaches, Shannon entropy and asymmetric entropy, and one new approach, warped entropy. The approaches are used to find cut points for the end point of cardiovascular death for three risk metrics: heart rate variability (HRV LF-HF), morphological variability (MV) and deceleration capacity (DC). When trained on multiple instances of training set containing 2813 patients, warped entropy yielded the most robust cutoffs. The performance of the cutoffs obtained using warped entropy from the training sets was compared with those in the literature using a Naive Bayes classifier on corresponding test sets. Each test set contained 1406 patients. The resulting classifier resulted in a significantly (p<0.05) improved recall rate at the expense of a lower precision.	[Singh, A.; Liu, J.; Guttag, J.

Most existing ensemble methods achieve this goal through resampling the training instances or input features. Inspired by MTForest and AODE that enumerate each input attribute together with the class attribute to create different component classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper, we propose a novel general ensemble method based on manipulating the class labels. It generates different biased new class labels through the Cartesian product of the class attribute and each input attribute, and then builds a component classifier for each of them. Extensive experiments, using decision tree and naive Bayes as base classifier respectively, show that the accuracy of our method is comparable to state-of-the-art ensemble methods. Finally, the bias-variance decomposition results reveal that the success of our method mainly lies in that it can significantly reduce the bias of the base learner.

Traditional methods can only find the linear dependencies or the dependencies among few features. In our research, we try to use feature selection approaches for finding dependencies. We use and compare Relief, CFS, NB-GA and NB-BOA as feature selection approaches to find the dependent features among our artificial data. Unexpectedly, Relief has the best performance in our experiments, even better than NB-BOA, which is a population-based evolutionary algorithm that used the population distribution information to find the dependent features. It may be because sonic weak "link strengths" between features or due to the fact that Naive Bayes classifier which is used in these wrapper approaches cannot represent the dependencies between features. However, the exact reason for these results still is an open problem for our future work.

J	Kim, H; Chen, SS				Kim, Hyunki; Chen, Su-Shing			Associative Naive Bayes classifier: Automated linking of gene ontology to medline documents	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Gene ontology; Document classification		We demonstrate a text-mining method, called associative Naive Bayes (ANB) classifier, for automated linking of MEDLINE documents to gene ontology (GO). The approach of this paper is a nontrivial extension of document classification methodology from a fixed set of classes C = {c(1),c(2),...,c(n)} to a knowledge hierarchy like GO. Due to the complexity of GO, we use a knowledge representation structure. With that structure, we develop the text mining classifier, called ANB classifier, which automatically links Medline documents to GO. To check the performance, we compare our datasets under several well-known classifiers: NB classifier, large Bayes classifier, support vector machine and ANB classifier. Our results, described in the following, indicate its practical usefulness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper analyzes a specific use of this visualization approach in the case of the Naive Bayes (NB) model for text classification and the Binary Independence Model (BIM) for text retrieval. For text categorization, a reformulation of the equation for the decision of classification has to be written in such a way that each coordinate of a document is the sum of two addends: a variable component P(d|c(i)), and a constant component P(c(i)), the prior of the category. When plotted in the Cartesian plane according to this formulation, the documents that are constantly shifted along the x-axis and the y-axis can be seen, This effect of shifting is more or less evident according to which NB model, Bernoulli or multinomial, is chosen. For text retrieval, the same reformulation can be applied in the case of the BIM model. The visualization helps to understand the decisions that are taken to order the documents, in particular in the case of relevance feedback. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, HJ				Kim, Han-joon			Advanced Naive Bayes Text Classifier with Embedded Feature Weighting Approach	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Text classification; Naive Bayes classifier; feature weighting; feature selection; embedded method; chi(2)-statistic		In the real-world operational environment, text classification systems should handle the problem of incomplete training set and no prior knowledge of feature space. In this regard, the most appropriate learning algorithm for operational text classification is the Naive Bayes since it is easy to incrementally update its pre-learned classification model and feature space. Our work mainly focuses on improving Naive Bayes classifier through (embedded) feature weighting approach. The basic idea is that parameter estimation of Naive Bayes can consider the degree of feature importance as well as feature distribution. In addition, we have extended a conventional algorithm for incremental feature update for developing a dynamic feature space in operational environment.

ACCURACY EVALUATION OF C4.5 AND NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIERS USING ATTRIBUTE RANKING METHOD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Breast cancer; C4.5 Decision Tree; Naive Bayes Classifiers; Information gain	BREAST-CANCER; SURVIVAL PREDICTION	This paper intends to classify the Ljubljana Breast Cancer dataset using C4.5 Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers. In this work, classification is carriedout using two methods. In the first method, dataset is analysed using all the attributes in the dataset. In the second method, attributes are ranked using information gain ranking technique and only the high ranked attributes are used to build the classification model. We are evaluating the results of C4.5 Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers in terms of classifier accuracy for various folds of cross validation. Our results show that both the classifiers achieve good accuracy on the dataset.	[Sivakumari, S.; Priyadarsini, R.

On the combination of locally optimal pairwise classifiers	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Multi-class classification; Combining classifiers; Pairwise coupling; Discriminant analysis; Naive Bayes	CLASSIFICATION	Classification methods generally rely on some idea about the data structure. If the specific assumptions are not met, a classifier may fail. in this paper, the possibility of combining classifiers in multi-class problems is investigated. Multi-class classification problems are split into two class problems. For each of the latter problems an optimal classifier is determined. The results of applying the optimal classifiers on the two class problems can be combined using a pairwise coupling algorithm. In this paper, exemplary situations are investigated where the respective assumptions of Naive Bayes or the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) fail. It is investigated at which degree of violations of the assumptions it may be advantageous to use single methods or a classifier combination by pairwise coupling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: 1) To study the relationship between parental rating of calls for participation sent from the school and family risk factors. 2) To study differences in parents' attendance and drop-out for a family-based drug-use prevention programme according to their rating of the calls for participation sent out by the school. Sample: 339 families of children aged 12-14 from 3 state (public) secondary schools in the region of Asturias (Spain). Results and conclusions: It is noteworthy that parents with higher educational level present better parenting practices, and therefore, fewer risk factors in relation to drug use in their children. Furthermore, the presence of fewer risk factors correlated with the items related to attendance and calls for participation and the interest shown in such calls, indicating that the children least likely to use drugs are those whose parents are most actively involved in their education. As regards the effect of the calls for participation on programme attendance and drop-out, we found that parents who attended several sessions have had previous and satisfactory experience of some kind of preventive intervention. and receive with great interest the calls for participation from the school.

In this study, we consider wrapper-based feature ranking where nine performance metrics aided by a particular learner are evaluated. We consider five learners and take two different approaches, each in conjunction with one of two different methodologies: 3-fold Cross-Validation (CV) and 3-fold Cross-Validation Risk Impact (CV-R). The classifiers are Naive Bayes (NB), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR). The performance metrics used as ranking techniques are Overall Accuracy (OA), F-Measure (FM), Geometric Mean (GM), Arithmetic Mean (AM), Area under ROC (AUC), Area under PRC (PRC), Best F-Measure (BFM), Best Geometric Mean (BGM), and Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM). To evaluate the classifier performance after feature selection has been applied, we use AUC as the performance evaluator This paper represents a preliminary report on our proposed wrapper-based feature ranking approach to software defect prediction problems.

We. empirically assess the performances of these methods in terms of accuracy, with respect to mixture models derived by EM-based learning of Naive Bayes models, and EM-based learning of mixtures of trees. We find that the bagged ensembles outperform all other methods while the random ones perform also very well. Since the computational complexity of the former is quadratic and that of the latter is linear in the number of variables of interest, this paves the way towards the design of efficient density estimation methods that may be applied to problems with very large numbers of variables and comparatively very small sample sizes.

Assessing naive Bayes as a method for screening credit applicants	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						credit scorecard; credit scoring; credit risk; naive Bayes; retail banking	COMPARING CLASSIFIERS	The naive Bayes rule (NBR) is a popular and often highly effective technique for constructing classification rules. This study examines the effectiveness of NBR as a method for constructing classification rules (credit scorecards) in the context of screening credit applicants (credit scoring). For this purpose, the study uses two real-world credit scoring data sets to benchmark NBR against linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression analysis, k-nearest neighbours, classification trees and neural networks. Of the two aforementioned data sets, the first one is taken from a major Greek bank whereas the second one is the Australian Credit Approval data set taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/similar to mlearn/MLRepository.html). The predictive ability of scorecards is measured by the total percentage of correctly classified cases, the Gini coefficient and the bad rate amongst accepts. In each of the data sets, NBR is found to have a lower predictive ability than some of the other five methods under all measures used. Reasons that may negatively affect the predictive ability of NBR relative to that of alternative methods in the context of credit scoring are examined.	[Antonakis, A. C.; Sfakianakis, M.

Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure of higher-order probabilistic relations of data. The problem we tackle concerns the prediction of price movements (up/down) on stock markets. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method discovers a large population of variable subpatterns, i.e. local and global patterns, using a novel evolutionary hypernetwork. An output is obtained from combining these patterns. In the paper, we describe two methods for assessing the prediction quality of the hypernetwork approach. Applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index data, the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively learns and predicts the time series information. In particular, the hypernetwork approach outperforms other machine learning methods such as support vector machines, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptrons, and k-nearest neighbors.

Horse breed discrimination using machine learning methods	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						breed discrimination; genetic diversity; horse breeds; machine learning algorithms; microsatellite		Genetic relationships and population structure of 8 horse breeds in the Czech and Slovak Republics were investigated using classification methods for breed discrimination. To demonstrate genetic differences among these breeds, we used genetic information - genotype data of microsatellite markers and classification algorithms - to perform a probabilistic prediction of an individual's breed. In total, 932 unrelated animals were genotyped for 17 microsatellite markers recommended by the ISAG for parentage testing (AHT4, AHT5, ASB2, HMS3, HMS6, HMS7,HTG4, HTG10, VHL20, HTG6, HMS2, HTG7, ASB17, ASB23, CA425, HMS1, LEX3). Algorithms of classification methods - J48 (decision trees); Naive Bayes, Bayes Net (probability predictors); IB1, IB5 (instance-based machine learning methods); and JRip (decision rules)- were used for analysis of their classification performance and of results of classification on this genotype dataset. Selected classification methods (Naive Bayes, Bayes Net, IB1), based on machine learning and principles of artificial intelligence, appear usable for these tasks.

To provide a reliable and dependable cloud computing platform, it is necessary to build a self-diagnosis and self-healing system against various failures or downgrades. This paper is the first to study the self-healing function, a challenging topic in today's clouding computing systems, from the consequence-oriented point of view. To fulfill the self-diagnosis and self-healing requirements of efficiency, accuracy, and learning ability, a hybrid tool that takes advantages from Multivariate Decision Diagram and Naive Bayes Classifier is proposed. An example is used to demonstrate that this proposed approach is effective.

We evaluated several current text categorization and feature selection methodologies on chat posts. Our chat posts are examples of 'micro-text', or text that is generally very short in length, semi-structured, and characterized by unstructured or informal grammar and language. Although this study focused specifically on tactical updates via chat, we believe the findings are applicable to content of a similar linguistic structure. Completion of this milestone is a significant first step in allowing for more complex categorization and information extraction.

Spam has serious negative impact on the usability of electronic mail and network resources. In addition, it provides a medium for distributing harmful code and/or offensive content. The work in this paper is motivated by the dramatic increase in the volume of spam traffic in recent years and the promising ability of ant colony optimization in data mining. Our goal is to develop an ant-colony based spam filter and to empirically evaluate its effectiveness in predicting spam messages. We also compare its performance to three other popular machine learning techniques: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes and Ripper classifiers. The preliminary results show that the developed model can be a remarkable alternative tool in filtering spam; yielding better accuracy with considerably smaller rule sets which highlight the important features in identifying the email category.

The data set analyzed in this paper is about churn prediction in bank credit cards and is obtained from Business Intelligence Cup 2004. The data set under consideration is highly unbalanced with 93.11% loyal and 6.89% churned customers. Since identifying churner is of paramount importance from business perspective, sensitivity of classification model is more critical. Using the available, original unbalanced data only, we observed that the proposed hybrid SVM+NBTree yielded the best sensitivity compared to other classifiers.	[Farquad, M. A.

This study introduces a new ranking filter AS method, the Tree Node Selection (TNS) method. The idea of TNS is to determine significant but fewer attributes by searching through the pre-generated decision tree as information source in the manner of a pruning process. To test the performance of TNS, 33 benchmark datasets (UCI) with various numbers of instances, attributes and classes were investigated along with five known AS methods, and the results were tested with the C4.5 (unpruned) and naive Bayes classifiers. The performance, in terms of classification accuracy improvement, reduction in the number of attributes and the size of the generated decision tree are assessed by various statistical analyses for multiple comparisons. TNS was found to provide the most consistent performance for C4.5 and naive Bayes classifiers, and generated unpruned C4.5 trees with selected fewer attributes were generally found to achieve similar quality to pruned C4.5 trees without any attribute selection.

An application to alcohol consumption in teenagers	ADICCIONES			Spanish	Article						Artificial Neural Networks; Decision Trees; Naive Bayes; Association Rules; alcohol		This paper is aimed mainly at making researchers in the field of drug addictions aware of a methodology of data analysis aimed at knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). KDD is a process consisting of a series of phases, the most characteristic of which is called data mining (DM), whereby different modelling techniques are applied in order to detect patterns and relationships among the data. Common and differentiating factors between the most widely used DM techniques are analysed, mainly from a methodological viewpoint, and their use is exemplified using data related to alcohol consumption in teenagers and its possible relationship with personality variables (N=7030). Although the overall accuracy obtained (% correct predictions) is very similar in the three models analyzed, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique generates the most accurate model (64.10%), followed by Decision Trees (DT) (62.3%) and Naive Bayts (NB) (59.9%).

These examples, which are easily obtained for most of the tasks, are particularly difficult to obtain for this case. Based on this fact, in this paper we investigate the possibility of using a Web-based approach for determining the correct sense of an ambiguous word based only in its Surrounding context. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised method that is specially suited to work with just a few training examples. The method considers the automatic extraction of unlabeled examples from the Web and their iterative integration into the training data set. The experimental results, obtained over a Subset of ten nouns from the SemEval lexical sample task, are encouraging. They showed that it is possible to improve the baseline accuracy of classifiers such as Naive Bayes and SVM Using some unlabeled examples extracted from the Web.

However, previous work generally does not consider the types of links (e.g., whether a person is friend or a close friend) that connect social networks members for classification purposes. Here, we propose modified Naive Bayes Classification schemes to make use of the link type information in classification tasks. Basically, we suggest two new Bayesian classification methods that extend a traditional relational Naive Bayes Classifier, namely, the Link Type relational Bayes Classifier and the Weighted Link Type Bayes Classifier. We then show the efficacy of our proposed techniques by conducting experiments on data obtained from the Internet Movie Database.

The raw frog call samples are first filtered by noise removal, high frequency compensation, and discrete wavelet transform techniques in that order. An adaptive end-point detection segmentation algorithm is proposed to effectively separate the individual syllables from the noise. Eight features, including spectral centroid, signal bandwidth, spectral roll-off, threshold-crossing rate, delta spectrum magnitude, spectral flatness, average energy, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are extracted and serve as the input parameters of the classifier. Three well-known classifiers, the kth nearest neighboring, a backpropagation neural network, and a naive Bayes classifier, are employed in this work for comparison. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the outcome performance of the proposed work. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with the parameters of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients can achieve up to 93.81%. The effectiveness of the proposed frog call identifier is thus verified.

The FB approach is able to account for all uncertainties associated with crash risk and various risk factors by estimating a posterior distribution of the site safety on which various ranking criteria could be based. Moreover, by use of hierarchical model specification, FB approach is able to flexibly take into account various heterogeneities of crash occurrence due to spatiotemporal effects on traffic safety. Using Singapore intersection crash data (1997-2006), an empirical evaluate was conducted to compare the proposed FB approach to the state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that the Bayesian hierarchical models with accommodation for site specific effect and serial correlation have better goodness-of-fit than non-hierarchical models. Furthermore, all model-based approaches perform significantly better in safety ranking than the naive approach using raw crash count. The FB hierarchical models were found to significantly outperform the standard EB approach in correctly identifying hotspots.	[Huang, H.

Keyword-based spam email filtering techniques fall short to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes tactics to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are themselves patterns that can be modeled to combat spam. It has been observed that both Naive Bayes and ANN are best suitable for modeling spammer common patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that both of them achieve a promising detection rate of around 92%, which is considerably an improvement of performance compared to the keyword-based contemporary filtering approaches.

Multiclass cancer diagnosis, based on selected gene profiles, are used as adjunct of clinical diagnosis. However, supervised diagnosis may hinder patient care, add expense or confound a result. To avoid this misleading, a multiclass cancer diagnosis with class-selective rejection is proposed. It rejects some patients from one, some, or all classes in order to ensure a higher reliability while reducing time and expense costs. Moreover, this classifier takes into account asymmetric penalties dependant on each class and on each wrong or partially correct decision. It is based on v-1-SVM coupled with its regularization path and minimizes a general loss function defined in the class-selective rejection scheme. The state of art multiclass algorithms can be considered as a particular case of the proposed algorithm where the number of decisions is given by the classes and the loss function is defined by the Bayesian risk. Two experiments are carried out in the Bayesian and the class selective rejection frameworks. Five genes selected datasets are used to assess the performance of the proposed method. Results are discussed and accuracies are compared with those computed by the Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Linear Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines classifiers.

Generally, clustering refers to the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar. Among clustering approaches, those methods based on probabilistic models have been extensively developed, such as Naive Bayes (NB) with a latent class (cluster identifier) found via in EM algorithm. Probabilistic Decision Graphs (PDGs) are a class of graphical models that can naturally encode some context specific independencies that cannot always be efficiently captured by other commonly used models. In this paper we propose to use a mixture of PDG models in cluster discovery, and an algorithm for automatic induction of the mixture and the models is introduced. The proposed approach was experimentally evaluated on both synthetic and real-world databases, and the presentation of the results includes a comparison with related techniques. The comparison demonstrates competitive performance of the mixture of PDG models with respect; to likelihood. Also, the mixture of PDG models have a tendency to use fewer models (clusters) to represent domains where other models use large amounts of clusters.

The difficulty is attributed to designing classifiers to maximize the accuracy. Researchers call for using several techniques to address this problem including; under-sampling the majority class, employing a probabilistic algorithm; and adjusting the classification threshold. In this paper, we propose a general sampling approach that assigns weights to individual instances according to the cost function. This approach helps reveal the relationship between classification performance and class ratios and allows the identification of an appropriate class distribution for which, the learning method achieves a reasonable performance on the data. Our results show that combining an ensemble of Naive Bayes classifiers with threshold selection and under-sampling techniques works well for imbalanced data.

In this paper, first. we shows that our method provides faster and better performance than 1-NN method by introducing a definition of a similarity concerned with LSH scheme. Next we compare our method with the Naive Bayes with respect to the number of dimensions of features. While the Naive Bayes requires a considerably large dimensional feature space, our method achieves higher performance even where the number of dimensions of a feature space of our method is much smaller than that of Naive Bayes. We explain our method by formalizing as a linear classifier in a very high dimensional space and show it is a special case of Naive Bayes model. Experimental results show that our method provides superior classification rates with small time complexity of learning and classification and is applicable to large data set.

Firstly we weaken the stability of the naive Bayes with oracle strategy, then select the better classifier as the component of ensemble of the naive Bayesian classifiers, finally integrate the classifiers' results with voting method. The experiments show that OSBE ensemble algorithm obviously improves the generalization performance which is compared with the Naive Bayes learning. And it prove in some cases the OSBE algorithm have better classification accuracy than Bagging and Adaboost.

Query by committee [1] suggests that given an ensemble of diverse but accurate classifiers, the most informative data points are those that cause maximal disagreement among the predictions of the ensemble members. However the method for finding ensembles appropriate to a given data set remains an open question. In this paper, the random subspace method is combined with active learning to create multiple instances of different classifier types, and an algorithm is introduced that adapts the ratio of different classifier types in the ensemble towards better overall accuracy. Here we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms C4.5 with uncertainty sampling, Naive Bayes with uncertainty sampling, bagging, boosting and the random subspace method with random sampling. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to adapt the ratio of classifiers in a heterogeneous ensemble for active learning.

The hierarchical classifier consists of a tree of independent naive Bayes classifiers, with output probabilities from parent classifiers propagated to child classifiers as additional features. Each classifier uses Bi-Normal Feature Separation for word feature selection. Experiments were performed using the Weka Toolkit [7] adapted to deal with multi-labeled documents. The hierarchical classifier accuracy marginally out-performed a set of independent binary classifiers trained to classify documents for each class in the taxonomy.

Naive Bayes Text Classification with Positive Features Selected by Statistical Method	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING 2009 (ICAC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Computing	DEC 13-15, 2009	Chennai, INDIA					Text Classification is enduring to be one of the most researched problems due to continuously-increasing amount of electronic documents and digital data. Naive Bayes is an effective and a simple classifier for data mining tasks, but does not show much satisfactory results in automatic text classification problems. In this paper, the performance of Naive Bayes classifier is analyzed by training the classifier with only the positive features selected by CHIR, a statistics based method as input. Feature selection is the most important preprocessing step that improves the efficiency and accuracy of text classification algorithms by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from the training corpus. Experiments were conducted for randomly selected training sets and the performance of the classifier with words as features was analyzed. The proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy compared to other native methods for the 20Newsgroup benchmark.	[Meena, M.

We employ 9 machine learning techniques including AdaBoost, Bagging, Support Vector Machines, Classification and Regression Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. We let these machine learning techniques combine heuristics, and also let, machine learning-based detection methods distinguish phishing sites from others. We analyze Our dataset, which is composed of 1,500 phishing sites and 1,500 legitimate sites, classify them using the machine learning-based detection methods, and measure the performance. In our evaluation, we used f(1) measure, error rate, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as performance metrics along with our requirements for detection methods. The highest f(1) measure is 0.8581, the lowest error rate is 14.15%, and the highest AUC is 0.9342, all of which are observed in the case of AdaBoost. We also observe that 7 out of 9 machine learning-based detection methods outperform the traditional detection method.

We have produced a database consisting of 1,300 images captured by a video camera. On this database we have conducted a systematic experimental study. We used four different preprocessing techniques and designed a generic speed sign segmentation algorithm. Then we selected a range of contemporary speed sign classification algorithms using shape based segmented binary images for training and evaluated their results using four metrics, including accuracy and processing speed. The results indicate that Naive Bayes and Random Forest seem particularly well suited for this recognition task. Moreover, we show that two specific preprocessing techniques appear to provide a better basis for concept learning than the others.

One training procedure is based on the extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm. Similarly: the remaining two approaches iteratively optimize the parameters (initialized to NIL) with a 2-step algorithm. In the first step, either the class posterior probabilities or class assignments are determined based on current; parameter estimates. Based on these posteriors (class assignment, respectively), the parameters are updated in the second step. We show that one of these algorithms is strongly related to EBW. Additionally, we compare all algorithms to conjugate gradient conditional likelihood (CGCL) parameter optimization [1]. We present classification results for frame- and segment-based phonetic classification and handwritten digit recognition. Discriminative parameter learning shows a significant improvement over generative ML estimation for naive, Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) structures on all data sets. In general, the performance improvement of discriminative parameter learning is large for simple Bayesian network structures which are not, optimized for classification.

In the text processing pipeline, classification is a key step for extraction of small sections of relevant text. Consequently, for the task of locating protein-protein interaction sentences, we examine the use of a classifier which has rarely been applied to text, the Gaussian processes (GPs). GPs are a non-parametric probabilistic analogue to the more popular support vector machines (SVMs). We Find that GPs outperform the SVM and naive Bayes classifiers on binary sentence data, whilst showing equivalent performance on abstract and multiclass sentence corpora. In addition, the lack of the margin parameter, which requires costly timing, along with the principled multiclass extensions enabled by the probabilistic framework make GPs an appealing alternative worth of further adoption.

To reduce the Sparsity Rating problem and fulfill the co-rated items in CF table, the current systems create the pseudo ratings usually based on one criteria. This paper proposes pseudo ratings based on multi criteria and also concentrates on the contextual information as multidimensional. To do the pseudo ratings based on multi criteria, the Naive Bayes is applied to classify the multi criteria of user's preferences. To incorporate multidimensional, the multi regression is applied to analyze the contextual information of user. According to the experimental evaluation, the recommender system on movie domain called ModernizeMovie is created and shows that the multi criteria pseudo ratings and multidimensional user profile enhances the quality and accuracy of recommendation results.

Discriminative Mixed-membership Models	2009 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 06-09, 2009	Miami Beach, FL	Knime, Mitre, CRC Press				Although mixed-membership models have achieved great success in unsupervised learning, they have not been widely applied to classification problems. In this paper, we propose a family of discriminative mixed-membership models for classification by combining unsupervised mixed-membership models with multi-class logistic regression. In particular, we propose two variants respectively applicable to text classification based on latent Dirichlet allocation and usual feature vector classification based on mixed-membership naive Bayes models. The proposed models allow the number of components in the mixed membership to be different from the number of classes. We propose two variational inference based algorithms for learning the models, including a fast variational inference which is substantially more efficient than mean-field variational approximation. Through extensive experiments on UCI and text classification benchmark datasets, we show that the models are competitive with the state of the art, and can discover components not explicitly captured by the class labels.

Unlike conventional action rule discovery methods, our method AARUDIA (Achievable Action RUle DIscovery Algorithm) considers the effects of actions and the achievability of the class change for disk-resident data. In AARUDIA, effects of actions are specified using domain rules and the achievability is inferred with Naive Bayes classifiers. AARUDIA takes a new breadth-first search method which manages actionable literals and stable literals, and exploits the achievability to reduce the number of discovered rules. Experimental results with inflated real-world data sets are promising and demonstrate the practicality of AARUDIA.

In auditory temporal assimilation, two neighboring physically-unequal time intervals marked by three successive tone bursts are illusorily perceived to have the same duration if the two time intervals satisfy a certain relationship. The classifiers could discriminate the subject's task, which was judgment of the equivalence between the two intervals, at an accuracy of 86-96% as well as their subjective judgments to the physically equivalent stimulus at an accuracy of 82-86% from individual ERP average waveforms.

This may provide its with a simple but somewhat robust neurodecoding scheme.

We quantify the complexity of a biomedical dataset using five complexity measures: correlation-based feature selection subset merit, noise. imbalance ratio. missing values and information gain. The effect of these complexity measures on classification accuracy is evaluated using five diverse machine learning algorithms: J48 (decision tree), SMO (support vector machines), Naive Bayes (probabilistic). IBk (instance based learner) and JRIP (rule-based induction). The results of our experiments show that noise and correlation-based feature selection subset merit - not a particular choice of algorithm - play a major role in determining the classification accuracy. In the end, we provide researchers with a meta-model and an empirical equation to estimate the classification potential of a dataset on the basis of its complexity. This well help researchers to efficiently pre-process the dataset for automatic knowledge extraction.

A grasp of emotions in songs might be a great help for us to effectively discover music. In this paper, we aimed at automatically classifying moods of songs based on lyrics and metadata, and proposed several methods for supervised learning of classifiers. In future, we plan to use automatically identified moods of songs as metadata in our music search engine. Mood categories in a famous contest about Audio Music Mood Classification (MIREX 2007) are applied for our system. The training data is collected from a LiveJournal blog site in which each blog entry is tagged with a mood and a song. Then three kinds of machine learning algorithms are applied for training classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes and Graph-based methods. The experiments showed that artist, sentiment words, putting more weight for words in chorus and title parts are effective for mood classification. Graph-based method promises a good improvement if we have rich relationship information among songs.

IFFD performs satisfactory by setting the minimal interval frequency for discretized intervals as a fixed number, In this paper, we first argue that this setting cannot guarantee optimal classification performance in terms of classification error. We observed empirically that an optimal minimal interval frequency existed for each dataset. We thus proposed a sequential search and wrapper based incremental discretization method for NB: named Optimal Flexible Frequency Discretization (OFFD). Experiments were conducted on 17 datasets from UCI machine learning repository and performance was compared between NB trained on the data discretized by OFFD, IFFD, PKID, and FFD respectively. Results show that OFFD works better than these alternatives for NB. Experiments between NB discretized on the data with OFFD and C4.5 showed that our new method outperforms C4.5 on most of the datasets we have tested.

In this work the application of Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator as a classifier fusion approach for online learning evaluation has been investigated to combine the decisions of four underlying individual classifiers with different approaches. Considering data which gathered from E-learning platform, the accuracy of OWA-based classifier fusion system has been compared with the individual classifiers. The experiment results show a considerable improvement of online learning evaluation accuracy.

The proposed model generates possible acronym candidates from a definition, and then verifies each acronym-definition pair with a Naive Bayes classifier based on web documents. In order to achieve high dictionary quality, the proposed model utilizes the characteristics of acronym generation types: a syllable-based generation type, a word-based generation type, and a mixed generation type. Compared with a previous model recognizing an acronym-definition pair in a document, the proposed model verifying a pair in web documents improves approximately 50% recall on obtaining acronym-definition pairs from 314 Korean definitions. Also, the proposed model improves 7.25% F-measure on verifying acronym-definition candidate pairs by utilizing specialized classifiers with the characteristics of acronym generation types.

For a given target, the path for designing new drugs with a lower attrition rate is based on an effective mining of the huge amount of experimental in vitro and in vivo data which has been collected. These data often come in various formats, from many different areas such as chemistry, biology, pharmacology, toxicity and extraction of the critical information is not an easy task. To guide the multi-objective optimization, we have developed a decision-support system (KEM(R)), based on the Galois lattices theory and constraint satisfaction programming (CSP). After a brief overview of machine learning applications, we will describe the methodology used in KEM for data mining and prediction. Two examples of applications in the drug discovery area will be discussed.

In order to limit overtraining problem we focus on a class of such functions for which optimal Bayesian learning is tractable. We investigate a few classes of functions that yield to models that are similar to Naive Bayes and logistic classification. We report experimental results for a collection of standard data sets that show that our learning algorithm outperforms standard learning of such these standard models.

The new problem is faced using a new EAPM based on Naive Bayes Models estimation is used to find good features. The result is an evolutionary visual feature selector that is embedded into the Adaboost algorithm in order to build a robust detector. The final system is tested over different object detection problems obtaining very promising results.

The main concept is to first establish a keyword synonymous table by experts for narrowing down the range and getting the consistency of keywords. The Formal Concept Analysis is then used for establishing knowledge ontology through the complex categories and attributes relation. Finally, the ontology is applied to a Naive Bayes Classifier to get the automatic document classifier system. In this system, 319 documents divided into 11 categories are used to assess the effectiveness of classification, where 224 and 95 documents are the training and testing documents respectively, and the F1-measure is as the assessment criteria. The experimental results show that nine from 11 categories reaches 80% effectiveness of the documents classification, whereas the other two categories reached over 60% effectiveness of the documents classification. In sum, the average effectiveness of document classification in 11 categories is about 89%. Thus, the automatic classifier system can indeed reach the effectiveness of document classification.

They grows fast in volume on the Web, but hard to be classified efficiently. The paper presents a practical classification solution using features from file names and extensions of digital resources. The features are easy to get and common to all resource. But they are generally low frequency and sparse, which implies that statistical approach may not work well. Our solution combines Naive Bayes (NB) classifier with Simple Good-Turing (SGT) probability estimation, which shows great promise for this condition with a total accuracy of 80%. In our opinion, the results are due to 1) the features fit the NB's conditional independence hypothesis well; 2) the abound one-time-occurrence features lead to reasonable probability estimation on unobserved features, which also means general feature selection strategy is not needed in this case. A 7.4TB digital resource collection, CDAL, is used to train and evaluate the model.

The performance of ATR system depends on many factors, such as the characteristics of input data, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms. Generally speaking, ATR performance evaluation can be performed either theoretically or empirically. The theoretical evaluation method requires reasonably accurate underlying models for characterizing target/clutter data, which in many cases is unavailable. The empirical (experimental) evaluation method, on the other hand, needs a fairly large data set in order to conduct meaningful experimental tests. In this paper, we present experimental performance evaluation of ATR algorithms using the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data set. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ATR performance under different operating conditions. In the experimental tests, different feature extraction techniques, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and kernel PCA, are employed on target SAR imagery to reduce the feature dimension. A number of classification approaches, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine are tested and compared for their classification accuracy under different conditions such as various feature dimensions, target classes, feature selection methods and input data quality. Our experimental results provide a guideline for selecting features and classifiers in ATR system using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.

The evaluated classifiers are Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), J48 decision trees, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset used contains 843 regions of interest (ROI) of healthy and five pathologic lung tissue patterns identified by two radiologists at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Correlation of the feature space composed of 39 texture attributes is studied. A grid search for optimal parameters is carried out for each classifier family. Two complementary metrics are used to characterize the performances of classification. Those are based on McNemar's statistical tests and global accuracy. SVM reached best values for each metric and allowed a mean correct prediction rate of 87.9% with high class-specific precision on testing sets of 423 ROIs.

The proposed method utilizes the natural multi-label and hierarchical intrinsic nature of proteins to build a multi-label and hierarchical classifier for predicting protein folds. The classifier predicts protein folds in two stages, at the first stage, it predicts the protein structural class, and in the second stage, it predicts the protein fold When comparing our technique with SVM, Naive Bayes, and Boosted C4.5 we get a higher accuracy more than SVM and better than Naive Bayes when using the composition, secondary structure and hydrophobicity feature attributes, and give higher accuracy than C4.5 when using composition; secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and polarity feature attributes. MuLAM was used as a basic classifier in the hierarchy of the implemented framework Two major modifications were made to MuLAM, namely: the pheromone update and term selection strategies of MuLAM were altered.

The model takes information from various sources including a set of scores which have proved to be useful in confidence estimation tasks. Two different approaches are modeled. First a basic model which takes advantages of smoothing techniques used in a previous work, and second an optimized model, which is designed to hold a set of very few but essential characteristics of the model, without decrease in the performance. A considerably reduction in the number of parameters is obtained compared to the basic model. Both models are evaluated with two different corpora and compared to a model previously developed.

Class noise was injected into seven software engineering measurement datasets, and the performance of three learners, random forests, C4.5, and Naive Bayes, was analyzed. The random forest classifier was utilized for this study because of its strong performance relative to well-known and commonly-used classifiers such as C4.5 and Naive Bayes. Further, relatively little prior research in software quality classification has considered the random forest classifier. The experimental factors considered in this study were the level of class noise and the percent or minority instances injected with noise. The empirical results demonstrate that the random forest obtained the best and most consistent classification performance in all experiments.

For a fair comparison, we fine adjust the parameters for each method either through exhaustive search, or through Genetic Algorithm(GA) [9]. Furthermore, we compare these classification methods in two training modes: a cost sensitive training mode where different costs for false positives and false negatives are considered in the training phase; and a plain training mode. The exploration of possible cost-sensitive metaheuristics to be applied is not in the scope of this work and all executions are run using Weka, a publicly available software. Although NN is claimed to be widely used in the market today, the evaluated implementation of NN in plain training leads to quite poor results. Our experiments are consistent with the early result of Maes in [13] which concludes that BN is better than NN. Cost sensitive training substantially improves the performance of all classification methods apart from NB and, independently of the training mode, DT and AIS with, optimized parameters, are the best methods in our experiments.

One essential aspect of this field is music emotion classification by earning from lyrics. This problem is different from traditional text categorization in that more linguistic or semantic information is required for better emotion analysis. Therefore, we focus on how to extract useful and meaningful language features in this paper. We investigate three kinds of preprocessing methods and a series of language grams having different n-order under the well-known n-gram language model framework to extract more semantic features. Then, we employ three supervised learning methods (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) to examine the classification performance. Experimental results show that feature extraction methods improve music emotion classification accuracies. Maximum entropy classification with unigram+bigram+trigram gets best accuracy and it is suitable for music emotion classification.

Improving automatic image annotation based on word co-occurrence	ADAPTIVE MULTIMEDIAL RETRIEVAL: RETRIEVAL, USER, AND SEMANTICS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Adaptive Multimedia Retrieval	JUL 05-06, 2007	Paris, FRANCE		Univ Pierre & Marie Curie		RETRIEVAL	Accuracy of current automatic image labeling methods is under the requirements of annotation-based image retrieval systems. The performance of most of these labeling methods is poor if we just consider the most relevant label for a given region. However, if we look within the set of the top-k candidate labels for a given region, accuracy of most of these systems is improved. In this paper we take advantage of this fact and propose a method (NBI) based on word co-occurrences that uses the naive Bayes formulation for improving automatic image annotation methods. Our approach utilizes co-occurrence information of the candidate labels for a region with those candidate labels for the other surrounding regions, within the same image, for selecting the correct label. Co-occurrence information is obtained from an external collection of manually annotated images: the IAPR-TC12 benchmark. Experimental results using a k-nearest neighbors method as our annotation system, give evidence of significant improvements after applying the NBI method. NBI is efficient since the co-occurrence information was obtained off-line. Furthermore, our method can be applied to any other annotation system that ranks labels by their relevance.

In this paper, we present a combined classification algorithm based on C4.5 and NB, simply C4.5-NB. In C4.5-NB, the class probability estimates of C4.5 and NB are weighted according to their classification accuracy on the training data. We experimentally tested C4.5-NB in Weka system using the whole 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compared it with C4.5 and NB. The experimental results show that C4.5-NB significantly outperforms C4.5 and NB in terms of classification accuracy. Besides, we also observe the ranking performance of C4.5-NB in terms of AUC (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). Fortunately, C4.5-NB also significantly outperforms C4.5 and NB.

Linear discriminant analysis was the best method and next multilayer perceptron neural networks provided that the data was input into a network in the form of principal components. Nearest neighbour searching, k-means clustering and Kohonen neural networks achieved almost as good results as the former, but decision trees slightly worse. Thus, these methods fared well, but Naive Bayes rule could not be used since some data matrices were singular. Otoneurological cases subject to the six diseases given can be reliably distinguished.

J	Lau, HL; Ng, W				Lau, Ho Lam; Ng, Wilfred			A multi-ranker model for adaptive XML searching	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article							RETRIEVAL; RANKING	The evolution of computing technology suggests that it has become more feasible to offer access to Web information in a ubiquitous way, through various kinds of interaction devices such as PCs, laptops, palmtops, and so on. As XML has become a de-facto standard for exchanging Web data, an interesting and practical research problem is the development of models and techniques to satisfy various needs and preferences in searching XML data. In this paper, we employ a list of simple XML tagged keywords as a vehicle for searching XML fragments in a collection of XML documents. In order to deal with the diversified nature of XML documents as well as user preferences, we propose a novel multi-ranker model (MRM), which is able to abstract a spectrum of important XML properties and adapt the features to different XML search needs. The MRM is composed of three ranking levels. The lowest level consists of two categories of similarity and granularity features. At the intermediate level, we define four tailored XML rankers (XRs), which consist of different lower level features and have different strengths in searching XML fragments. The XRs are trained via a learning mechanism called the Ranking Support Vector Machine in a voting Spy Naive Bayes framework (RSSF). The RSSF takes as input a set of labeled fragments and feature vectors and generates as output Adaptive Rankers (ARs) in the learning process. The ARs are defined over the XRs and generated at the top level of the MRM. We show empirically that the RSSF is able to improve the MRM significantly in the learning process that needs only a small set of training XML fragments. We demonstrate that the trained MRM is able to bring out the strengths of the XRs in order to adapt different preferences and queries.

Recently, there has been much interest in mining streaming data. Because streaming data is large and no limited, it is unpractical that passing the entire data over more than one time. A one pass online algorithm is necessary. One of the most successful algorithms for mining data streams is VFDT(Very Fast Decision Tree). we extend the VFDT system to EVFDT(Efficient-VFDT) in two directions: (1)We present Uneven Interval Numerical Pruning (shortly UINP) approach for efficiently processing numerical attributes. (2)We use naive Bayes classifiers associated with the node to process the samples to detect the outlying samples and reduce the scale of the trees. From the experimental comparison, the two techniques significantly improve the efficiency and the accuracy of decision tree construction on streaming data.

A Method for Avoiding Bias from Feature Selection with Application to Naive Bayes Classification Models	BAYESIAN ANALYSIS			English	Article						feature selection; optimistic bias; naive Bayes models; gene expression data		For many classification and regression problems, a large number of features are available for possible use - this is typical of DNA microarray data on gene expression, for example. Often, for computational or other reasons, only a small subset of these features are selected for use in a model, based on some simple measure such as correlation with the response variable. This procedure may introduce an optimistic bias, however, in which the response variable appears to be more predictable than it actually is, because the high correlation of the selected features with the response may be partly or wholly due to chance. We show how this bias can be avoided when using a Bayesian model for the joint distribution of features and response. The crucial insight is that even if we forget the exact values of the unselected features, we should retain, and condition on, the knowledge that their correlation with the response was too small for them to be selected. In this paper we describe how this idea can be implemented for "naive Bayes" models of binary data. Experiments with simulated data confirm that this method avoids bias due to feature selection. We also apply the naive Bayes model to subsets of data relating gene expression to colon cancer, and find that correcting for bias from feature selection does improve predictive performance.

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based on measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the frees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the pre-processing phase, where feature selection and outliers identification is carried out, in order to provide the basis of a high performance automated diagnostic system. The conclusions derived are of more general interest and applicability.

Among several approaches, such as analyzing phylogenetic profiles, homologous protein sequences or gene expression patterns, methods based on protein interaction data are very promising. We propose here a novel method using Naive Bayes which takes advantage of protein interaction network topology to improve low-recall predictions. Our method is tested on proteins from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and on the yeast proteins from the BioGRID and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Analyses of the results, using several methods that include ROC analyses, indicate that our method predicts protein functions with significantly higher recall without lowering precision.

People use genre in a natural way when entering a music store or looking into music collections. Automatic genre classification has become a popular topic in music information retrieval research. This work brings to symbolic music recognition some technologies, like the stochastic language models, already successfully applied to text categorization. In this work we model chord progressions and melodies as n-grams and strings and then apply perplexity and naive Bayes classifiers, respectively, in order to assess how often those structures are found in the target genres. Also a combination of the different techniques as an ensemble of classifiers is proposed. Some genres and sub-genres among popular, jazz, and academic music have been considered. The results show that the ensemble is a good trade-off approach able to perform well without the risk of choosing the wrong classifier.

Threshold based techniques tend to leave out lung regions that have increased attenuation, for example in the presence of interstitial lung disease or in noisy low dose CT scans. The purpose of this work is to perform segmentation of the lungs using a technique that selects an optimal threshold for a given scleroderma patient by comparing the curvature of the lung boundary to that of the ribs. Our approach is based on adaptive thresholding and it tries to exploit the fact that the curvature of the ribs and the curvature of the lung boundary are closely matched. At first, the ribs are segmented and a polynomial is used to represent the ribs' curvature. A threshold value to segment the lungs is selected iteratively such that the deviation of the lung boundary from the polynomial is minimized. A Naive Bayes classifier is used to build the model for selection of the best fitting lung boundary. The performance of the new technique was compared against a standard approach using a simple fixed threshold of -400HU followed by region-growing. The two techniques were evaluated against manual reference segmentations using a volumetric overlap fraction (VOF) and the adaptive threshold technique was found to be significantly better than the fixed threshold technique.

Feature Selection in Automatic Music Genre Classification	ISM: 2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MULTIMEDIA	IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia-ISM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia	DEC 15-17, 2008	Berkeley, CA	IEEE				This paper presents the results of the application of a feature selection procedure to an automatic music genre classification system. The classification system is based on the use of multiple feature vectors and an ensemble approach, according to time and space decomposition strategies. Feature vectors are extracted from music segments from the beginning, middle and end of the original music signal (time-decomposition). Despite being music genre classification a multi-class problem, we accomplish the task using a combination of binary classifiers, whose results are merged in order to produce the final music genre label (space decomposition). As individual classifiers several machine learning algorithms were employed: Naive-Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Nets. Experiments were carried out on a novel dataset called Latin Music Database, which contains 3,227 music pieces categorized in 10 musical genres. The experimental results show that the employed features have different importance according to the part of the music signal from where the feature vectors were extracted. Furthermore, the ensemble approach provides better results than the individual segments in most cases.

In this paper, we propose a framework of imputation-boosted collaborative filtering (IBCF), which first uses an imputation technique, or perhaps machine learned classifier, to fill-in the sparse user-item rating matrix, then runs a traditional Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm on this matrix to predict a novel rating. Empirical results show that IBCF using machine learning classifiers can improve predictive accuracy of CF tasks. In particular, IBCF using a classifier capable of dealing well with missing data, such as naive Bayes, can outperform the content-boosted CF (a representative hybrid CF algorithm) and IBCF using PMM (predictive mean matching, a state-of-the-art imputation technique), without using external content information.

This method adequately used the character of Naive Bayes classifier which assumed independence of the attributes given the class. Our text results on a diversity dataset made up of only hetero-complex proteins achieved 68.1% overall accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.201, 40.2% specificity and 49.9% sensitivity in identify interface residues as estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation. This result indicated that the method performed substantially better than chance (zero correlation).

In this paper, we focus on investigating the use of a bilingual lexicon for cross language text categorization. To this end, we propose a novel refinement framework for cross language text categorization. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a cross language model transfer is proposed to generate initial labels of documents in target language. In the second stage, expectation maximization algorithm based on naive Bayes model is introduced to yield resulting labels of documents. Preliminary experimental results on collected corpora show that the proposed framework is effective.

Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples that need to be analyzed is constantly increasing on a daily basis. An automatic and robust tool to analyze and classify the file samples is the need of the hour. In this paper, resting on the analysis of Windows API execution sequences called by PE files, we use associative classification and post-processing techniques for malware detection. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our malware detection method outperform popular anti-virus scanners such as Norton AntiVirus and Dr. Web, as well as previous data mining based detection systems which employed Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree techniques. In particular, the post-processing techniques we adopt can greatly reduce the number of generated rules which make it easy for the human analysts to identify the useful ones.

Ubiquitous healthcare enables the agents acquire more information on trust evaluation through effectively resource sharing. Yet ubiquitous healthcare also lays the agents in a more dynamic and uncertainty environment for the trust evaluations. This paper contributes to develop a distributed trust management for the ubiquitous healthcare. Our trust management infrastructure is responsible for evaluating the trust value and assigning access rights based on the trust value. Based on each agent's confidence of its personal experience on other agents, three naive Bayes classifier based algorithms are introduced for the trust evaluation: the robust experience algorithm, the weak experience algorithm and the no experience algorithm. The simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our trust management in the ubiquitous healthcare.

The proposed approach combines an evolutionary based fuzzy system with an artificial immune system to generate high quality fuzzy classification rules. The performance of final fuzzy classification system has been investigated using the KDD-Cup99 benchmark dataset. The results indicate that in comparison to several traditional techniques, such as C4.5, Naive Bayes, k-NN and SVM, the proposed hybrid approach achieves better classification accuracies for most of the classes of the intrusion detection classification problem. Therefore, the resulted fuzzy classification rules can be used to produce a reliable intrusion detection system.	[Abadeh, M.

Consistency-based diagnosis is capable of performing automatic fault detection and localization using just correct behaviour models. Nevertheless, it may exhibit low discriminative power among fault candidates. Hence, we combined the consistency based approach with machine learning techniques specially developed for fault identification of dynamic systems. In this work, we apply Stacking to generate time series classifiers from classifiers of its univariate time series components. The Stacking scheme proposed uses K-NN with Dynamic Time Warping as a dissimilarity measure for the level 0 learners, and Naive Bayes at level 1. The method has been tested in a fault identification problem for a laboratory scale continuous process plant. Experimental results show that, for the available data set, the former Stacking configuration is quite competitive, compare to other methods like tree induction, Support Vector Machines or even K-NN and Naive Bayes as stand alone methods.

Three kinds of cry were classified: normal (without detected pathology), hypo acoustic (deal), and asphyxia. The feature vectors were formed by the extraction of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC); these were then processed and reduced through the application of five statistics operations, namely: minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation and variance. For the classification there were used supervised machine learning methods as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, J48, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The ensembles used were combinations of these under different approaches like Majority Vote, Staking, Bagging and Boosting. The 10-fold cross validation technique was used to evaluate precision in all classifiers.

The Naive Bayes classifier has proven to be effective in a wide range of applications, in spite of the fact that the conditional independence assumption is not met in most cases. In the Naive Bayes classifier, each variable has a finite number of values, but in the RoboCup domain, we must deal with continuous variables. To overcome this issue, we use a fuzzy extension known as the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier that generalizes the meaning of an attribute so it does not have exactly one value, but a set of values to a certain degree of truth. We implemented this classifier in a 3D team so an agent could obtain the probabilities of success of the possible action courses given a situation in the field and decide the best action to execute. Specifically, we use the pass evaluation skill as a test bed. The classifier is trained in a scenario where there is one passer, one teammate and one opponent that tries to intercept the ball. We show the performance of the classifier in a test scenario with four opponents and three teammates. After a brief introduction, we present the specific characteristics of our training and test scenarios. Finally, results of our experiments are shown.

Finding cost-effective methods to predict CAD is a major challenge in public health. In this paper we investigate the combined effects of genetic polymorphisms and non-genetic factors on predicting the risk of CAD by applying well known classification methods, such as Bayesian networks, naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor neural networks and decision trees. Our experiments show that all these classifiers are comparable in terms of accuracy, while Bayesian networks have the additional advantage of being able to provide insights into the relationships among the variables. We observe that the learned Bayesian Network identify manY important dependency relationships among genetic variables, which can be verified with domain knowledge. Conforming to current domain understanding, our results indicate that related diseases (e.g., diabetes and hypertension), age and smoking status are the most important factors for CAD prediction, while the genetic polymorphisms entail more complicated influences.

The induction of a BN is a NP problem. Two main approaches can be used for inducing a BN from data, namely, Conditional Independence (CI) and the Heuristic Search (HS) based algorithms. When a BN is induced for classification purposes (Bayesian Classifier - BC), it is possible to impose some specific constraints aiming at an increase in computational efficiency. In this paper a new CI based algorithm (MarkovPC) to induce BCs from data is proposed. MarkovPC uses the Markov Blanket concept in order to impose some constraints and optimize the traditional PC algorithm. Experiments performed with ALARM BN, as well as other UCI and artificial domains revealed that MarkovPC tends to execute fewer comparisons than the traditional PC. The experiments also show that the MarkovPC produces competitive classification rates when compared with both, PC and Naive Bayes.

We introduce new algorithms to infer protein complexes by combining seed proteins with a confidence-weighted network. Two new stochastic methods use averaging over a probabilistic ensemble of networks, and the new deterministic method provides a deterministic ranking of prospective complex members. We compare the performance of these algorithms with three existing algorithms. We test algorithm performance using three weighted graphs: a naive Bayes estimate of the probability of a direct and stable protein-protein interaction; a logistic regression estimate of the probability of a direct or indirect interaction; and a decision tree estimate of whether two proteins exist within a common protein complex. The best-performing algorithms in these trials are the new stochastic methods.

WEB image classification based on the fusion of image and text classifiers	ICDAR 2007: NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, VOLS I AND II, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition	SEP   23, 2007-SEP 26, 2009	Curitiba, BRAZIL	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit TC 10, Int Assoc Pattern Recognit TC 11			RETRIEVAL	This paper presents a novel method for the classification of images that combines information extracted from the images and contextual information. The main hypothesis is that contextual information related to an image can contribute in the image classification process. First, independent classifiers are designed to deal with images and text. From the images color shape and texture features are extracted. These features are used with a neural network, (NN) classifier to carry out image classification. On the other hand, contextual information is processed and used with a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. At the end, the outputs of both classifiers are combined through heuristic rules. Experimental results on a database of more than 5,000 HTML documents have shown that the combination of classifiers provides a meaningful improvement (about 16%) in the cord rect image classification rate relative to the results provided by the NN classifier alone.

In this regard, the most appropriate algorithm for operational text classification is the Naive Bayes since it is easy to incrementally update its pre-learned classification model and feature space. Our work mainly focuses on improving Naive Bayes classifier through feature weighting strategy. The basic idea is that parameter estimation of Naive Bayes can consider the degree of feature importance as well as feature distribution. In addition, we have extended a conventional algorithm for incremental feature update for developing a dynamic feature space in operational environment. Through experiments using the Reuters-21578 and the 20Newsgroup benchmark collections, we show that the traditional multinomial Naive Bayes classifier can be significantly improved by X-2-statistic based feature weighting.

On certain data sets they classify a randomly sampled training subset nearly perfectly, but systematically perform worse than random guessing on cases unseen in training. We demonstrate this phenomenon in classification of a natural data set of cancer genomics microarrays using cross-validation test. Additionally, we generate a range of synthetic datasets, the outcomes of 0-sum games, for which we analyse this phenomenon in the i.i.d. setting. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a remedy that yields promising results for classifying such data as well as normal datasets. We simply transform the classifier scores by an additional 1-dimensional linear transformation developed, for instance, to maximize classification accuracy of the outputs of an internal cross-validation on the training set. We also discuss the relevance to other fields such as learning theory, boosting, regularization, sample bias and application of kernels.

In this paper, a novel model named Bayes perceptron is proposed to take advantage of the generative and discriminative approaches. This model divides every feature vector into several subvectors, each of which is modeled on Bayes assumption. Then subvectors are combined by inducing a weight parameter vector. After some transforms, the weight parameters is fit discriminatively by a perceptron algorithm. Furthermore, we give detailed theoretical analysis and justification on the convergence and robustness to the inseperable data. As an important byproduct, an approach is discribed to generalize the binary classifier perceptron into multiclass classifer. Experimental evaluations on text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach is better than both the pure generative and pure discriminative models under different sizes of training sets.

FADA overcomes the high computational cost problem of current Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (ADA) and also alleviates the overfitting problem implicitly caused by ADA. FADA is tested and evaluated using synthetic dataset, COREL dataset and three different face datasets. The experimental results show FADA is more effective and computationally more efficient than ADA for image classification.

This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic classification of bovine ovaries into temporal categories using information extracted from ultrasound images. The temporal classes corresponded roughly to the metestrus, diestrus, and proestrus phases of the bovine reproductive cycle. Features based on the sizes of ovarian structures formed the patterns on which the classification was performed. A Naive Bayes classifier was able to correctly classify the stage of the estrous cycle for 86.36% of the test patterns. A decision tree classified 100% of the test patterns correctly. The decision tree inference algorithm used to build the classifier constructed a tree that used only two of the five available features indicating that they form a sufficiently rich set of features for robust classification.

A novel thermoplastic elastomer strain sensor was used for measuring strain in the clothing. This sensor has a linear resistance response to strain, a small hysteresis and can be fully integrated into textile. A study was conducted with eight participants wearing the garment and performing a total of 27 upper body postures. A Naive Bayes classification was applied to identify the different postures. Nearly a complete recognition rate Of 97% was achieved when the classification was adapted to the individual participant. A classification rate of 84% was achieved for an all-user classification and 65% for an independent user These results show the feasibility to recognize postures with our setup, even in an unseen user setting. Furthermore, we used the garment prototype in a gym experiment to explore its potential for rehabilitation and fitness training.

In order to extend it to multiclass classification, one popular approach is to consider the problem as a collection of binary classification problems. Majority voting or winner-takes-all is then applied to combine those outputs, but it often causes problems to consider tie-breaks and tune the weights of individual classifiers. This paper presents two novel ensemble approaches: probabilistic ordering of one-vs-rest (OVR) SVMs with nave Bayes classifier and multiple decision templates of OVR SVMs. Experiments with multiclass datasets have shown the usefulness of the ensemble methods.

To solve this problem, we propose a new approach called extreme outlier elimination and hybrid sampling technique. k Reverse Nearest Neighbors (kRNNs) concept used as a data cleaning method for eliminating extreme outliers in minority regions. Hybrid sampling technique, a combination of SMOTE to over-sample the minority data (fraud samples) and random under-sampling to under-sample the majority data (non-fraud samples) is used for improving the fraud detection accuracy. This method was evaluated in terms of True Positive rate and True Negative rate on the insurance fraud dataset. We conducted the experiments with classifiers namely C4.5, Naive Bayes, k-NN and Radial Basis Function networks and compared the performance of our approach against simple hybrid sampling technique. Obtained results shown that extreme outlier elimination from minority class, produce high predictions for both fraud and non-fraud classes.	[Padmaja, T. Maruthi; Dhulipalla, Narendra; Krishna, P.

The problem to detect the fraud is that the dataset is unbalanced where non-fraudulent class heavily dominates the fraudulent class. In this work, we considered the fraud detection problem as unbalanced data classification problem and proposed a model based on hybrid sampling technique, which is a combination of random under-sampling and over-sampling using SMOTE. Here, SMOTE is used to widen the data region corresponding to minority samples and random under-sampling of majority class is used for balancing the class distribution. The value difference metric (VDM) is used as distance measure while doing SMOTE. We conducted the experiments with classifiers namely k-NN, Radial Basis Function networks, C4.5 and Naive Bayes with varied levels of SMOTE on insurance fraud dataset. For evaluating the learned classifiers, we have chosen fraud catching rate, non-fraud catching rate in addition to overall accuracy of the classifier as performance measures. Results indicate that our approach produces high predictions against fraud and non-fraud classes.	[Padmaja, T. Maruthi; Dhulipalla, Narendra; Krishna, P.

This allows us to represent products as sets of such attribute-value pairs to augment product databases. Such a representation is useful for a variety of tasks where treating a product as a set of attribute-value pairs is more useful than as an atomic entity. Examples of such applications include product recommendations, product comparison, and demand forecasting. We formulate the extraction as a classification problem and use a semi-supervised algorithm (co-EM) along with (Naive Bayes). The extraction system requires very little initial user supervision: using unlabeled data, we automatically extract an initial seed list that serves as training data for the supervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms. Finally, the extracted attributes and values are linked to form pairs using dependency information and co-location scores. We present promising results on product descriptions in two categories of sporting goods.

Behavior statistic based neural net anti-spam filters	ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA			English	Article								Current methods for detecting email system mostly work by examining characteristic of incoming messages. Spam detectors calculate statistical features on received email for classification usually dealing with corpus composed of messages from several distinct users. Thus it is not possible to profile that user's behavior. To characterize the user's normal email behavior the outgoing email traffic can be observed, after which abnormal behavior caused by a compromised machine can be detected and contained at the source. The effectiveness of feature selection can be seen in the performance of abnormal mail sending detection via different structure classifiers, and the best results from our data set was reached applying Naive Bayes statistical method. There are also discovered that increasing feature set, the accuracy of classifiers doesn't changes or even reduces. For false positive reduction and gaining classifier accuracy it is essential to combine several distinct methods of user based behavior and content analysis over bidirectional mail traffic. It could form an extremely strong defense against the spread of spam. Ill. 6, bibl. 7 (in English, summaries in English, Russian and Lithuanian).

Efficient Bayesian Task-Level Transfer Learning	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					In this paper, we show how using the Dirichlet Process mixture model as a generative model of data sets provides a simple and effective method for transfer learning. In particular, we present a hierarchical extension of the classic Naive Bayes classifier that couples multiple Naive Bayes classifiers by placing a Dirichlet Process prior over their parameters and show how recent advances in approximate inference in the Dirichlet Process mixture model enable efficient inference. We evaluate the resulting model in a meeting domain, in which the system decides, based on a learned model of the user's behavior, whether to accept or reject the request on his or her behalf. The extended model outperforms the standard Naive Bayes model by using data from other users to influence its predictions.

One of the main problems of document classification is the large dimensionality of the data. To overcome this problem, feature selection is required which reduces the number of selected features and thus improves the classification accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm for multi-label document classification is presented. This algorithm focuses on the reduction of redundant features using the concept of minimal redundancy maximal relevance which is based on the mutual information measure. The features selected by the proposed algorithm are then input to one of two classifiers, the multinomial naive Bayes classifier and the linear kernel support vector machines. The experimental results on the Reuters dataset show that the proposed algorithm is superior to some recent algorithms presented in the literature in many respects like the F(1)-measure and the break-even point.

This interest has yielded several publications where new methods for the discriminative learning of both structure and parameters have been proposed. In this paper we present an empirical study used to illustrate how discriminative learning performs with respect to generative learning using simple Bayesian network classifiers such as naive Bayes or TAN, and we discuss when and why a discriminative learning is preferred. We also analyzed how log-likelihood and conditional log-likelihood scores guide the learning process of Bayesian network classifiers.

This paper describes four novel supervised disambiguation methods which adapt some familiar algorithms. They built on the Vector Space Model using an automatically generated stop list and two different statistical methods of finding index terms. These proceedings allow a fully automated and language independent disambiguation. The first method is based upon Latent Semantic Analysis, an automatic indexing method employed for text retrieval. The second one disambiguates via co-occurrence vectors of the target word. Disambiguation relying on Naive Bayes uses the Naive Bayes Classifier and disambiguation relying on SenseClusters(1) uses an unsupervised word sense discrimination technique. These methods were implemented and evaluated to experience their performance, to compare the different approaches and to draw conclusions about the main characteristic of supervised disambiguation. The results show that the classification approach using Naive Bayes is the most efficient, scalable and successful method.

The result of such a labeling can serve as an indexing step for a context-based image retrieval system or a bio-metric signature verification system. A simple region growing algorithm is first used to segment the document into a number of patches. A label for each such segmented patch is inferred using a CRF model. The model is flexible enough to include signatures as a type of handwriting and isolate it from machine-print and noise. The robustness of the model is due to the inherent nature of modeling neighboring spatial dependencies in the labels as well as the observed data using CRF. Maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates for the parameters of the CRF model are learnt using conjugate gradient descent. Inference of labels is done by computing the probability of the labels under the model with Gibbs sampling. Experimental results show that this approach provides for 95.75 % of the data being assigned correct labels. The CRF based model is shown to be superior to Neural Networks and Naive Bayes.

In this paper, the possibility of combining classifiers in multi-class problems is investigated. Multi-class classification problems are split into two class problems. For each of the latter problems an optimal classifier is determined. The results of applying the optimal classifiers on the two class problems can be combined using the Pairwise Coupling algorithm by Hastie and Tibshirani (1998). In this paper exemplary situations are investigated where the respective assumptions of Naive Bayes or the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA, Fisher, 1936) fail. It is investigated at which degree of violations of the assumptions it may be advantageous to use single methods or a classifier combination by Pairwise Coupling.

However, Euclidean metric is not the best choice for LWNB. For nominal attributes, Euclidean metric has to order and number the values of attributes, or judge whether the attribute values are identical or not. For numeric attributes, Euclidean metric is not appropriate for different attribute scales and variability, and encounters the problem of attribute value outliers when normalizing values. In this paper, we systematically study probability based metrics, such as Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), Extended Short and Fukunaga Metric (SF2), SF2 calibrated by logarithm (SF2LOG) and Minimum Risk Metric (MRM), and apply them to LWNB. These probability based metrics can solve the above problems of Euclidean metric since they depend on the difference between the probabilities to evaluate the distances between the instances. We conduct the experiments to compare the performances of LWNB classifiers using Euclidean metric and probability based metrics on UCI datasets. The results show that LWNB classifiers using IVDM outperform the ones using Euclidean metric and other probability based metrics. We also observe that SF2, SF2LOG and MRM do not perform well due to their inaccurate probability estimates. An artificial dataset is built by logical sampling in a Bayesian network, where accurate probability estimates can be produced. We conduct the experiment on the artificial dataset. The results show that SF2, SF2LOG and MRM using accurate probability estimates perform better than Euclidean metric and IVDM in LWNB.

Detecting worms, especially new, unseen worms, is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new worm detection approach based on mining dynamic program executions. This approach captures dynamic program behavior to provide accurate and efficient detection against both seen and unseen worms. In particular, we execute a large number of real-world worms and benign programs (executables), and trace their system calls. We apply two classifier-learning algorithms (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) to obtain classifiers from a large number of features extracted from the system call traces. The learned classifiers are further used to carry out rapid worm detection with low overhead on the end-host. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to detect new worms in terms of a very high detection rate and a low false positive rate.

This paper proposes an approach for chemical information discovery by using focused crawling. The comparison of combination using various feature representations and classifier algorithms to implement focused crawlers was carried out. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Mutual Information (MI) were used to extract features from documents, while Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were the selected algorithms to compute content relevance score. It was found that the combination of LSI and SVM provided the best solution.

We discuss various steps in the classification process, including class definition, training data preparation, feature selection, and classifier building using SVM and Naive Bayes.

Twin-SVM classifiers give a solution to the multi-label problem. For multi-class situation, naive Bayes classifier constrains the belonging scope of a testing sample within a few most likely classes and greatly reduces the number of binary classifiers needed to make the final prediction. The benefits of the ensemble method are described and preliminary results with Reuters-21578 data set are also presented.

In contrast, non-review documents often present factual information objectively. Separating reviews from non-reviews, or subjectivity classification, is potentially important for many text processing applications, such as information extraction and information retrieval. Also, it is a key process in sentiment classification for online customer reviews. As a type of genre classification, the classifications of subjective and objective texts are different from traditional topic-based classifications. Not many studies have been conducted in this domain and most of them were on English texts. Little work has been done on Chinese subjectivity classification. However, the detailed techniques used in English texts can not be applied directly to Chinese due to the different characteristics between these two languages. This paper proposes an. approach to perform subjectivity classification on Chinese text based on a supervised machine learning. algorithm,Naive Bayes. Experiment studies have been conducted on two kinds of documents: movie reviews and movie plots written in Chinese. The results. show that the performances of the proposed approach are comparable to those of the existing English subjectivity classification studies.

J	Almonayyes, A				Almonayyes, A			Multiple explanations driven Naive Bayes classifier	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						case-based reasoning; data mining; explanation patterns; Naive Bayes; text classification		Exploratory data analysis over foreign language text presents virtually untapped opportunity. This work incorporates Naive Bayes classifier with Case-Based Reasoning in order to classify and analyze Arabic texts related to fanaticism. The Arabic vocabularies are converted to equivalent English words using conceptual hierarchy structure. The understanding process operates at two phases. At the first phase, a discrimination network of multiple questions is used to retrieve explanatory knowledge structures each of which gives an interpretation of a text according to a particular aspect of fanaticism. Explanation structures organize past documents of fanatic content. Similar documents are retrieved to generate additional valuable information about the new document. In the second phase, the document classification process based on Naive Bayes is used to classify documents into their fanatic class. The results show that the classification accuracy is improved by incorporating the explanation patterns with the Naive Bayes classifier.

By adopting the Minimum Description Length criterion for ranking and selecting relevant features, experiments are carried out to investigate the accuracy and effectiveness of the above methods in classifying many targets as well as to study the effects of feature selection on the sensitivity of each classifier. The paper also shows how the knowledge of a domain expert makes it possible to decompose the multi-target classification in a set of binary classifications, one for each target, with a substantial improvement in accuracy. The effectiveness of the MDL criterion to decide on particular feature subsets is asserted by empirical results showing that MDL is comparable with entropy based feature selection methodologies reported by earlier works.

Its performances usually benefit from an accurate estimation of univariate conditional probabilities and from variable selection. However, although variable selection is a desirable feature, it is prone to overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a new regularization technique to select the most probable subset of variables and propose a new model averaging method. The weighting scheme on the models reduces to a weighting scheme on the variables, and finally results in a Naive Bayes with "soft variable selection". Extensive experimental results show that the averaged regularized classifier outperforms the initial Selective Naive Bayes classifier.

In this paper, we precisely formulate and solve the problem of learning classifiers from such data-sources, in a setting where each data source has a hierarchical ontology associated with it and semantic correspondences between data source ontologies and a user ontology are supplied. The proposed approach yields algorithms for learning a broad class of classifiers (including Bayesian networks, decision trees, etc.) from semantically heterogeneous distributed data with strong performance guarantees relative to their centralized counterparts. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach in the case of learning Naive Bayes classifiers from distributed, ontology-extended data sources.

The proposed method uses a mutual information measure to select terms and constructs document descriptor vectors for each category based on these terms. These document descriptor vectors form a document descriptor matrix. It also uses the document descriptor vectors to construct a document-similarity matrix based on the "cosine similarity measure". It then constructs a term-document relevance matrix by applying the inner product of the document descriptor matrix to the document similarity matrix. The proposed method infers the degree of relevance of the selected terms to construct the category descriptor vector of each category. Then, the relevance score between each category and a testing document is calculated by applying the inner product of its category descriptor vector to the document descriptor vector of the testing document. The maximum relevance score L is then chosen. If the relevance score between a category and the testing document divided by L is not less than a predefined threshold value lambda between zero and one, then the document is classified into that category. We also compare the classification accuracy of the proposed method with that of the existing learning methods (i.e., Find Similar, Naive Bayes, Bayes Nets and Decision Trees) in terms of the break-even point of micro-averaging for categorizing the "Reuters-21578 Apte split" data set. The proposed method gets a higher average accuracy than the existing methods.

The Naive Bayes Classifier is based on the assumption of independence among the values of the attributes given the class value. Consequently, its effectiveness may decrease when the attributes are interdependent. We present FBL, a wrapper that uses information about dependencies to guide the search for the optimal subset of features and we use the Naive Bayes Classifier as the black-box Machine Learning algorithm. Experimental results show that FBL allows the Naive Bayes Classifier to achieve greater accuracies, and that FBL performs better than other classical filters and wrappers.

Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating a naive Bayes approach for text categorization with a word sense disambiguation strategy based on the WordNet lexical database (Section 2). Semantic profiles are exploited by the "conference participant advisor" service in order to suggest papers to be read and talks to be attended by a conference participant. Experiments on a real dataset show the effectiveness of the service (Section 3).

Recently, some researchers have studied the use of clickthrough data to adapt a search engine's ranking function. Clickthrough data indicate for each query the results that are clicked by users. As a kind of implicit relevance feedback information, clickthrough data can easily be collected by a search engine. However, clickthrough data is sparse and incomplete, thus, it is a challenge to discover accurate user preferences from it. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called "Spy NaIve Bayes" (SpyNB) to identify user preferences generated from clickthrough data. First, we treat the result items clicked by the users as sure positive examples and those not clicked by the users as unlabelled data. Then, we plant the sure positive examples (the spies) into the unlabelled set of result items and apply a naive Bayes classification to generate the reliable negative examples. These positive and negative examples allow us to discover more accurate user's preferences. Finally, we employ the SpyNB algorithm with a ranking SVM optimizer to build an adaptive metasearch engine. Our experimental results show that, compared with the original ranking, SpyNB can significantly improve the average ranks of users' click by 20%.

However, the problem of segmenting words for Chinese email restricts its performance. In this paper, we present a Bayesian Chinese spam filter based on cross N-gram. This method does not need to carry on segmenting words for Chinese emails, so that it can avoid to be restricted by inaccurate words segmenting. It also needn't to install segmenting word dictionary and is easy to install in the user terminal to construct an individualized spam filter since the space and time efficiency are improved. The restriction on independence assumption of naive bayes method is relaxed in some degree. The results of experiments show that the proposed method can acquire a high accuracy ratio at low cost.

It is the ability to detect the watermark after attacks. A DWT-based semi-blind image watermarking scheme leaves out the low pass band, and embeds a pseudo random number (PRN) sequence (i.e., the watermark) in the other three bands into the coefficients that are higher than a given threshold T-1. During watermark detection, all the high pass coefficients above another threshold T-2 (T-2 >= T-1) are used in correlation with the original watermark. In this paper, we embed a PRN sequence using the same procedure. In detection, however, we apply the Naive Bayes Classifier, which can predict class membership probabilities, such as the probability that a given image belongs to class "Watermark Present" or "Watermark Absent". Experimental results show that the Naive Bayes Classifier gives very promising results for gray scale images in the wavelet domain watermark detection.

Two-dimensional visual imagery, on the other hand, offers dense information about the environment of mobile robots, but is often difficult to exploit. Training a supervised classifier to identify traversable regions within images that generalizes well across a large variety of environments requires a vast corpus of labeled examples. Autonomous learning of the traversable/untraversable distinction indicated by scene appearance is therefore a highly desirable goal of robot vision. We describe here a system for learning this distinction online without the involvement of a human supervisor. The system takes in imagery and range data from a pair of stereo cameras mounted on a small mobile robot and autonomously learns to produce a labeling of scenery. Supervision of the learning process is entirely through information gathered from range data. Two types of boosted weak learners, Nearest Means and naive Bayes, are trained on this autonomously labeled corpus. The resulting classified images provide dense information about the environment which can be used to fill-in regions where stereo cannot find matches or in lieu of stereo to direct robot navigation. This method has been tested across a large array of environment types and can produce very accurate labelings of scene imagery as judged by human experts and compared against purely geometric-based labelings. Because it is online and rapid, it eliminates some of the problems related to color constancy and dynamic environments.

In many real-world applications, however, this assumption is often violated. Responding to this fact, researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve the accuracy of naive Bayes by weakening the conditional independence assumption. The most recent work is the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) [15] that demonstrates good classification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lazy learning algorithm Lazy Averaged One-Dependence Estimators, simply LAODE, by extending AODE. For a given test instance, LAODE firstly expands the training data by adding some copies (clones) of each training instance according to its similarity to the test instance, and then uses the expanded training data to build an AODE classifier to classify the test instance. We experimentally test our algorithm in Weka system [16], using the whole 36 UCI data sets [11] recommended by Weka [17], and compare it to naive Bayes [3], AODE [15], and LBR [19].

However, there exist three main problems confronting KNN according to our observation: 1) KNN's accuracy is degraded by a simple vote; 2) KNN's accuracy is typically sensitive to the value of K; 3) KNN's accuracy may be dominated by some irrelevant attributes. In this paper, we presented an improved algorithm called Dynamic K-Nearest-Neighbor Naive Bayes with Attribute Weighted (DKNAW). We experimentally tested its accuracy, using the whole 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka[1], and compared it to NB, KNN, KNNDW, and LWNB[2]. The experimental results show that DKNAW significantly outperforms NB, KNN, and KNNDW and slightly outperforms LWNB.

Three evaluation criteria are suggested for cost-sensitive filters, and their rationality is discussed. Furthermore, a principle that minimizes the error cost is described to avoid filtering an e-mail of "Legitimate" into "Spam". Comparing with other major methods, the experimental results show that our method of combining multiple filters has preferable performance when appropriate running parameters are adopted.

In this paper, we empirically study traditional decision-tree learning models and their variants in terms of probability estimation, measured by Conditional Log Likelihood (CLL). Furthermore, we also compare decision tree learning with other kinds of representative learning: naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, Bayesian Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine with respect to probability estimation. From our experiments, we have several interesting observations. First, among various decision-tree learning models, C4.4 is the best in yielding precise probability estimation measured by CLL, although its performance is not good in terms of other evaluation criteria, such as accuracy and ranking. We provide an explanation for this and reveal the nature of CLL. Second, compared with other popular models, C4.4 achieves the best CLL. Finally CLL does not dominate another well-established relevant measurement AUC (the Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics), which suggests that different decision-tree learning models should be used for different objectives. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI sample sets that cover a wide range of domains and data characteristics. We run all the models within a machine learning platform - Weka.

The importance of different blocks varies from each other. The estimation of the block importance could be defined as a classification problem. First, an adaptive vision-based page segmentation algorithm is used to partition a web page into semantic blocks. Then spatial features and content features are used to represent each block. Shannon's information entropy is adopted to represent each feature's ability for differentiating. A weighted Naive Bayes classifier is used to estimate whether the block is important or not. Finally, a variation of TF-IDF is utilized to represent weight of each keyword. As a result, the similar blocks are united as topical region. The approach is tested with several important English and Chinese news sites. Both recall and precision rates are greater than 96%.

However, the lack of effective incremental discretization methods has been hindering NB's incremental learning in face of quantitative data. This problem is further compounded by the fact that quantitative data are everywhere, from temperature readings to share prices. In this paper, we present a novel incremental discretization method for NB, incremental flexible frequency discretization (IFFD). IFFD discretizes values of a quantitative attribute into a sequence of intervals of flexible sizes. It allows online insertion and splitting operation on intervals. Theoretical analysis and experimental test are conducted to compare IFFD with alternative methods. Empirical evidence suggests that IFFD is efficient and effective. NB coupled with IFFD achieves a rapport between high learning efficiency and high classification accuracy in the context of incremental learning.

Web filtering based on content has become one of the important techniques to handle and filter inappropriate information on the web. We examine two machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes) for pornographic web filtering based on text content. We then focus initially on Thai-language and English-language web sites. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether machine learning algorithms are suitable for web sites classification. The empirical results show that the classifier based Support Vector Machines are more effective for pornographic web filtering than Naive Bayes classifier after testing, especially an effectiveness for the over-blocking problem.

In [10] we showed that it is possible to predict the best system for target word using word features and that using this 'optimal ensembling method' more accurate WSD ensembles can be built (3-5% over Senseval state of the art systems with the same amount of possible potential remaining). In the interest of developing if more accurate ensembles, w e here define the strong regions for three popular and effective classifiers used for WSD task (Naive Bayes - NB, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Decision Rules - D) using word features (word grain, amount of positive and negative training examples, dominant sense ratio). We also discuss the effect of remaining factors (feature-based).

The proposed approach works in two steps. In the preprocessing step, it takes as input a sliding window of multivariate stream data and discretizes the data in the window into a string of symbols that characterize the signal changes. In the classification step, it uses a simple text classification algorithm to classify the discretized data in the window. We evaluated both supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms. For supervised, we tested Naive Bayes Model and SVM, and for unsupervised, we tested Jaccard, TFIDF, Jaro and JaroWinkler. In our experiments, SVM and TFIDF outperformed the other classification methods. In particular, we observed that classification accuracy is improved when the correlation of attributes is also considered along with the n-gram tokens of symbols.

Our central claim is that the structure of the taxonomy encapsulates background knowledge that can be exploited to improve classification accuracy. Under our hierarchical Dirichlet generative model for the document corpus, we show that the unsupervised classification algorithm provides robust estimates of the classification parameters by performing regularization, and that our algorithm can be interpreted as a regularized EM algorithm. We also propose a technique for the automatic choice of the regularization parameter. In addition we propose a regularization scheme for K-means for hierarchies. We experimentally demonstrate that both our regularized clustering algorithms achieve a higher classification accuracy over simple models like minimum distance, Naive Bayes, EM and K-means.

An important feature of spam recognition is that it is a cost-sensitive classification: misclassification of a nonspam mail as spam is generally a more severe error than misclassifying a spam mail as non-spam. In order to be compared, the methods applied to this field should be all evaluated with the same corpus and within the same cost-sensitive framework. In this paper, the performances of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and Naive Bayes (NB) techniques are compared using a publicly available corpus (LINGSPAM) for different cost scenarios. The training time complexities of the methods are also evaluated. The results show that NN has significantly better performance than the two other, having acceptable training times. NB gives better results than SVM when the cost is extremely high while in all other cases SVM outperforms NB.

Because the naive Bayes classifier prefers to dealing with discrete values, an novel discretization approach is proposed to improve naive Bayes classifier and enhance decision accuracy in this paper. Based on the statistical information of the naive Bayes classifier, a distributional index is defined in the new discretization approach. The distributional index can be applied to find a good solution for discretization of continuous attributes so that the naive Bayes classifier can reach high decision accuracy for instance information systems with continuous attributes. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the naive Bayes classifier with the new discretizer can reach higher accuracy than the C5.0 tree.

It uses averaged global accuracy as the measurement of goodness in the induction process of the tree structure, and chooses the local classifier that is most specific for the target instance to make the decision. This paper mainly introduces a pruning strategy based on local accuracy estimation. Instead of directly using the most specific local classifier (mostly the classifier in a leaf node) to making classification in NBTree, our pruning strategy uses the measurement of local accuracy to guide the selection of local classifier for decision. Experimental results manifest that this pruning strategy is effective, especially for the NBTree with relatively more nodes.

Currently there exist two families of methodologies that ensemble candidate SPODEs for classification. One is to select only helpful SPODEs and uniformly average their probability estimates, a type of model selection. Another is to assign a weight to each SPODE and linearly combine their probability estimates, a methodology named model weighing. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical study comparing model selection and model weighing for ensembling SPODEs. The focus is on maximizing the ensemble's classification accuracy while minimizing its computational time. A number of representative selection and weighing schemes are studied, providing a comprehensive research on this topic and identifying effective schemes that provide alternative trades-off between speed and expected error.

By 'procedural text' we refer to ordered lists of steps, which are very common in some instructional genres such as online manuals. Our initial training corpus is built up by applying some simple heuristics to select documents from a large collection and contains only a few documents with a large proportion of procedural texts. We adapt the Naive Bayes classifier to better fit this less than ideal training corpus. This adapted model is compared with several other classifiers in ranking procedural texts using different sets of features and is shown to perform well when only highly distinctive features are used.

It requires knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle. The project manager's main responsibility is to ensure a successful project outcome. Project success is normally defined as achieving desired project objectives and features within desired cost and schedule. Many factors affect project success including dealing with gathering requirements, customer involvements and project management. Several researchers have investigated the success or failure of software projects using statistical approaches. In this paper, a web based survey and interviews are used to collect project data, about requirements, project sponsor and customers. Tools such as association, neural networks, clustering, naive bayes and decision tree are used to discover common characteristics and rules that govern project success and failure. The results show the power of data mining algorithms to discover the most important factors and associations in project success and failure. Results showed that each mining algorithm has a particular strength to provide knowledge and make predictions about project success opportunities.

The goal is to make the final ranked list of documents accurately represent users' preferences reflected in the click-through data. Our approach combines the ranking result of a traditional IR algorithm (BM25) with that given by a machine learning algorithm (Naive Bayes). The machine learning algorithm is trained on click-through data (queries and their associated documents), while the IR algorithm runs over the document collection. We consider several alternative strategies for combining the result of using click-through data and that of using document data. Experimental results confirm that any method of using click-through data greatly improves the preference ranking, over the method of using BM25 alone. We found that a linear combination of scores of Naive Bayes and scores of BM25 performs the best for the task. At the same time, we found that the preference ranking methods can preserve relevance ranking, i.e., the preference ranking methods can perform as well as BM25 for relevance ranking.

The proposed approach discards features with small discrimination capability measured by Gaussian divergence, so as to enhance the robustness and the discrimination power of the text classification system. To evaluation its performance, some comparison experiments of multinomial naive Bayes classifier model are constructed on Newsgroup and Ruters21578 data collection. Experimental results show that on Newsgroup data set divergence measure outperforms MI measure, and has slight better performance than DF measure, and outperforms both measures on Ruters21578 data set. It shows that discrimination-based feature selection method has good contributions to enhance discrimination power of text classification model.

Many methods have been proposed, such as Rocchio method, Naive bayes based method, and SVM based text classification method. These methods learn labeled text documents and then construct a classifier. A new coming text document's category can be predicted. However, these methods do not give the description of each category. In the machine learning field, there are many concept learning algorithms, such as, ID3 and CN2. This paper proposes a more robust algorithm to induce concepts from training examples, which is based on enumeration of all possible keywords combinations. Experimental results show that the rules produced by our approach have more precision and simplicity than that of other methods.

The previous works for the causality made use of causal patterns such as causal verbs. We concentrate on the information obtained from other causal event pairs. If two event pairs share some lexical pairs and one of them is revealed to be causally related, the causal probability of another event pair tends to increase. We introduce the lexical pair probability and the cue phrase probability. These probabilities are learned from raw corpus in unsupervised manner. With these probabilities and the Naive Bayes classifier, we try to resolve the causal relation extraction problem. Our inter-NP causal relation extraction shows the precision of 81.29%, that is 7.05% improvement over the baseline model. The proposed models are also applied to inter-sentence causal relation extraction.

We apply a k-NN algorithm with a similarity measure called resemblance and compare it with the naive Bayes and the k-NN algorithm with TF-IDF weighting. Experimental evaluation shows that our method produces the lowest-cost results under different cost models of classification. Compared with TF-IDF weighting, our method is more practical in a dynamic environment. Also, our method successfully catches a notorious class of spams called picospams. We believe that it will be a useful member in a hybrid classifier.

Although the main component of structured data plays an important role when designing classifiers, additional components may contain beneficial information for classification. This paper focuses on a probabilistic classifier design for multiclass classification based on the combination of main and additional components. Our formulation separately considers component generative models and constructs the classifier by combining these trained models based on the maximum entropy principle. We use naive Bayes models as the component generative models for text and link components so that we can apply our classifier design to document and web page classification problems. Our experimental results for three test collections confirmed that the proposed method effectively combined the main and additional components to improve classification performance.

A problem from veterinary medicine with assumed independent features led us to look once again at this model. The effectiveness of NB despite violation of the independence assumption is still open for discussion. In this study we try to develop a bound relating dependency level of features and the classification error of Naive Bayes. As dependency between more than two features is difficult to define and express analytically, we consider a simple two class two feature example problem. Using simulations we established empirical bounds measured by Yules Q-statistic between calculable error and error related to the true distribution.

Its classification is simply based on a vote, within the neighborhood, consisting of k nearest neighbors of the test instance. Recently, researchers have been interested in deploying a more sophisticated local model, such as naive Bayes, within the neighborhood. It is expected that there are no strong dependences within the neighborhood of the test instance, thus alleviating the conditional independence assumption of naive Bayes. Generally, the smaller size of the neighborhood (the value of k), the less chance of encountering strong dependences. When k is small, however, the training data for the local naive Bayes is small and its classification would be inaccurate. In the cur-, rently existing models, such as LWNB [3], 4 relatively large k is chosen. The consequence is that strong dependences seem unavoidable. In our opinion, a small k should be preferred in order to avoid strong dependences. We propose to deal with the problem of lack of local training data using sampling (cloning). Given a test instance, clones of each instance in the neighborhood is generated in terms of its similarity to the test instance and added to the local training data. Then, the local naive Bayes is trained from the expanded training data. Since a relatively small k is chosen, the chance of encountering strong dependences within the neighborhood is small. Thus the classification of the resulting local naive Bayes would be more accurate. We experimentally compare our pew algorithm with KNN and its improved variants in terms of classification accuracy, using the 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka [8], and the experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all those algorithms significantly and consistently at various k values.

Adaptive Educational Systems can support different learning characteristics by building a model of the student's learning behaviour and subsequently adapting the learning environment to match different needs. However major challenges exist, as it is not clear how a student model of learning style can be accurately built. One solution may be in the use of machine learning techniques. This paper presents 'First Aid For you, a novel adaptive educational system that dynamically determines learning style using machine learning techniques. The paper describes how it uses the Felder & Solomon Index of Learning Style to design an environment for different learning styles. It also describes how, as the student interacts with the learning environment, it uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the student's preferred learning style and adoptively customize the learning environment.

Although quite accurate, it tends to provide poor estimates of the posterior class probabilities, which hampers its application in the cost-sensitive context. The apparent high confidence with which certain errors are made is particularly problematic when misclassification costs are highly skewed, since conservative setting of the decision threshold may greatly decrease the classifier utility. We propose an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm aiming to discount the confidence with which errors are made. The approach is based on measuring the amount of change to feature distribution necessary to reverse the initial classifier decision and can be implemented efficiently without over-complicating the process of Naive Bayes induction. In experiments with three benchmark document collections, the decision-reversal Naive Bayes is demonstrated to substantially improve over the popular multinomial version of the Naive Bayes algorithm, in some cases performing more than 40% better.

Three methods for improving scalability are analysed: a change in the data representation and therefore in the algorithms' implementation, a partitioning mechanism that breaks down the problem into smaller parts, and a buffering mechanism to improve memory efficiency for large datasets. The classifiers were tested over two Reuters datasets: ModApte a popular but small benchmark, and RCV1 a new large collection of news stories, and compared to more standard implementations of these methods, both experimentally and analitically.

To make our system fit for the application and to embed this model gateway for real-time text filtering, we need to further select more accurate features. In this paper, we proposed a new feature selection method based on Rough set theory. It generate several reducts, but the special point is that between these reducts there are no common attributes, so these attributes have more powerfully capability to classify new objects, especially for real data set in application. We choose two data sets to evaluate our feature selection method, one is a benchmark data set from UCI machine learning archive, and another is captured from Web. We use statistical classification methods to classify these objects, in the benchmark testing set, we get good precision with a single reduct, but in real date set, we get good precision with several reducts, and the data set is used in our system for topic-specific text filtering. Thus we conclude our method is very effective in application. In addition, we also conclude that SVM and VSM methods get better performance, while Naive Bayes method get poor performance with the same selected features on non-balance data set.

We argue that this approach is an important complement to methods such as k-fold cross validation that are based on overall error rates. It is shown how case based imprecision estimates may be used to improve Bayes classifiers under asymmetrical loss functions. In addition, other approaches to making use of case based imprecision estimates are discussed and illustrated on two real world data sets. Contrary to the common assumption, Bayesian bootstrap simulations indicate that the uncertainty associated with the output of a Bayes classifier is often far from normally distributed.

In case the training set consists of instances, chosen randomly from the instance space, the posterior probability estimates are random variables. Their statistical properties can be used to calculate confidence intervals around them, enabling more refined classification strategies than the usual argmax-operator. This may alleviate the cold-start problem and provide additional feedback to the user. In this paper, we give an explicit expression to estimate the variances of the posterior probability estimates from the training data and investigate the strategy that refrains from classification in case the confidence interval around the largest posterior probability overlaps with any of the other intervals. We show that the classification error rate can be significantly reduced at the cost of a lower coverage, i.e., the fraction of classifiable instances, in a TV-program recommender.

The first stage reduces the search space using two heuristics in cascade: 1) In a face image, the average intensity of the eyes is lower than the intensity of the part between the eyes, and 2) The histograms of the grayscale image of a face with uniform lighting have a distinguishable shape. In the second stage we use combinations of different classifiers including: Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Voted Perceptron (VP), C4.5 rule induction and Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN); we also propose a simple lighting correction method. We use the BioID face dataset to test our system achieving up to a 95.13% of correct detections.

Several real-world applications now need to create bridges for smooth integration of semi-structured sources with existing structured databases for seamless querying. This integration requires extracting structured column values from the unstructured source and mapping them to known database entities. Existing methods of data integration do not effectively exploit the wealth of information available in multi-relational entities. We present statistical models for co-reference resolution and information extraction in a database setting. We then go over the performance challenges of training and applying these models efficiently over very large databases. This requires us to break open a black box statistical model and extract predicates over indexable attributes of the database. We show how to extract such predicates for several classification models, including naive Bayes classifiers and support vector machines. We extend these indexing methods for supporting similarity predicates needed during data integration.

Our research deals with learning approaches to build user profiles that accurately capture user interests from content (documents) and that could be used for personalized information filtering. The learning mechanisms analyzed in this paper are relevance feedback and a naive Bayes method.

When dealing with highly skewed data, we observe that typical feature selection metrics like information gain or chi-squared are biased toward selecting features for the minor class, and the metric of bi-normal separation can select features for both minor and major classes. In this work, we investigate how these feature selection metrics impact on the performance of frequently used classifiers such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines via bias analysis for highly skewed data. Three types of biases are metric bias, class bias, and classifier bias. Extensive experiments are designed to understand how these biases can be employed in concert and efficiently to achieve good classification performance. We report our findings and present recommended approaches to text classification based on bias analysis and the empirical study.

Since there are few complete datasets in real world, in this paper, we develop research on how to efficiently learn TAN from incomplete data. We first present an efficient method that could estimate conditional Mutual Information directly from incomplete data. And then we extend basic TAN learning algorithm to incomplete data using our conditional Mutual Information estimation method. Finally, we carry out experiments to evaluate the extended TAN and compare it with basic TAN. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the extended TAN is much higher than that of basic TAN on most of the incomplete datasets; Despite more time consumption of the extended TAN compared with basic TAN, it is still acceptable. Our conditional Mutual Information estimation method can be easily combined with other techniques to improve TAN further.

As the reviews are often too many for customers to go through, how to automatically classify them into different semantic orientations (i.e. recommend/not recommend) has become a research problem. Different from traditional approaches that treat a review as a whole, our approach performs semantic classifications at the sentence level by realizing reviews often contain mixed feelings or opinions. In this approach, a typical feature selection method based on sentence tagging is employed and a naive bayes classifier is used to create a base classfication model, which is then combined with certain heuristic rules for review sentence classification. Experiments show that this approach achieves better results than using general naive bayes classifiers.

Usually, multiple mappings can be obtained from an instance information system. A set of mappings, which are created based on multiple reducts in the instance information system by means of rough set theory, is defined as multi-knowledge in this paper. Uncertain rules are introduced to represent multi-knowledge. A hybrid approach of multi-knowledge and the Naive Bayes Classifier is proposed to make decisions for unseen instances or for instances with missing attribute values. The data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are applied to test this decision-making algorithm. The experimental results show that the decision accuracies for unseen instances are higher than by using other approaches in a single body of knowledge.

This paper formalizes a class of problems of learning from ontology and data, and explores the design space of learning classifiers from attribute value taxonomies (AVTs) and data. We introduce the notion of AVT-extended data sources and partially specified data. We propose a general framework for learning classifiers from such data sources. Two instantiations of this framework, AVT-based Decision Tree classifier and AVT-based Naive Bayes classifier are presented. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithms are able to learn robust high accuracy classifiers with substantially more compact representations than those obtained by standard learners.

In the Naive Bayes classifier, all variables are assumed to be nominal variables, it means that each variable has a finite number of values. But in large databases, the variables often take continuous values or have a large number of numerical values. So many researchers discussed the discretization (or partitioning) for domain of the continuous variables. In this paper we generalize the Naive Bayes classifier to the situation in which the fuzzy partitioning for the variable domains instead of discretization is taken. Therefore each variable in the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier can take a linguistic value represented by a fuzzy set. One method for estimating the conditional probabilities in the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier is proposed. This generalization can decrease the complexity for learning optimal discretization, and increase the power for dealing with imprecise data and the large databases. Some well-known classification problems in machine learning field have been tested, the results show that the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier is an effective tool to deal with classification problem which has continuous variables.

In this article, we explore novel techniques for optimizing queries that contain predicates on the results of application of mining models to relational data. For such queries, we use the internal structure of the mining model to automatically derive traditional database predicates. We present algorithms for deriving such predicates for a large class of popular discrete mining models: decision trees, naive Bayes, clustering and linear support vector machines. Our experiments on Microsoft SQL Server demonstrate that these derived predicates can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating such queries.

Key insights into the action and effects of a disease can be obtained by comparison of the expression of the expressed proteins in normal versus diseased tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) of peptides is a central technology for Proteomics, enabling the identification of thousands of peptides from a complex mixture. With the increasing acquisition rate of tandem mass spectrometers, there is an increasing potential to solve important biological problems by applying data-mining and machine-learning techniques to MS/MS data. These problems include (i) estimating the levels of the thousands of proteins in a tissue sample, (ii) predicting the intensity of the peaks in a mass spectrum, and (iii) explaining why different peptides from the same protein have different peak intensities. In other works, we have focussed on the first two problems. In this paper, we focus on the last problem. In particular, we try to explain why some peptides produce peaks of great intensity, while others produce peaks of low intensity, and we treat this as a classification problem. That is, we experimentally evaluate and compare a variety of discrimination methods for classifying peptides into those that produce high-intensity peaks and those that produce low-intensity peaks. The methods considered include K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Naive Bayes, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Experiments using these methods were conducted on three real-world datasets derived from tissue samples of Mouse. The methods were then evaluated using ROC curves and cross validation.

Testors are features subsets such that no class confusion is introduced. Typical testors are irreducible testors. Then they can be used in order to select which words are relevant to separate the classes, and so, be useful to get better classification rates. Some experiments were done with KNN and Naive Bayes Classifiers, results were compared against frequency threshold and information gain methods.

We derive a measure based on an extension of multinomial naive Bayes classification that combines multiple language models to estimate the most likely grade level for a given passage. The resulting classifier is not specific to any particular subject and can be trained with relatively little labeled data. We perform predictions for individual Web pages in English and compare our performance to widely-used semantic variables from traditional readability measures. We show that with minimal changes, the classifier may be retrained for use with French Web documents. For both English and French, the classifier maintains consistently good correlation with labeled grade level (0.63 to 0.79) across all test sets. Some traditional semantic variables such as type-token ratio gave the best performance on commercial calibrated test passages, while our language modeling approach gave better accuracy for Web documents and very short passages (less than 10 words).

In the extended model (EPMM), latent categories are incorporated in the PMM so that it can adaptively control the model's flexibility according to the data while maintaining the validity of parametric mixture assumption of the original PMM. In the multi-label setting, we experimentally compare a Naive Bayes classifier (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), PMM and EPMM for their robustness against classification noise as well as classification performance. The results show that EPMM provides higher classification performance than PMM while keeping the advantage of greater robustness against noise than that by NB and SVM.

However in many application domains, human-designed AVTs are unavailable. We introduce AVT-Learner an algorithm for automated construction of attribute value taxonomies from data. AVT-Learner uses Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) to cluster attribute values based on the distribution of classes that co-occur with the values. We describe experiments on UCI data sets that compare the performance of AVT-NBL (an AVT-guided Naive Bayes Learner) with that of the standard Naive Bayes Learner (NBL) applied to the original data set. Our results show that the AVTs generated by AVT-Learner are competitive with human-generated AVTs (in cases where such AVTs are available). AVT-NBL using AVTs generated by AVT-Learner achieves classification accuracies that are comparable to or higher than those obtained by NBL; and the resulting classifiers are significantly more compact than those generated by NBL.

Some classification systems contain over 30,000 distinct codes which makes classifying clinical documents a time consuming labor intensive and error prone process. This paper presents a simple methodology for cleaning up and reusing existing manually coded diagnostic statements mainly extracted from clinical notes to build predictive models using a sparse-feature implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. One of the problems addressed is that diagnostic statements often contain several diagnoses and are assigned several codes resulting in a "many-to-many" mapping problem. We investigate one possible way of solving this problem by introducing compound (multiple code) categories. We present experimental results of classifying > 16,000 randomly selected diagnostic strings into 19 top level categories. A small improvement (3%) with using compound categories over simple categories indicates that using multiple code categories is a promising solution, although clearly in need of further research and refinement.

Due to scale on the surface, the reflection property across the intact surface changes and intensity imaging fails. Hence, the light sectioning method is used to acquire the surface range data. The steel block is vibrating on the conveyor during data acquisition which complicates the task. After depth map recovery and feature extraction, segments of the surface are classified by means of CHMMs. We present classification results of the CHMM and compare them to the naive Bayes classifier. The CHMM outperforms the naive Bayes approach.

We present a new learning algorithm, Extended Bayes (EB), which is based on Naive Bayes. EB is still relatively simple, and achieves equivalent or higher accuracy than NB; on a wide variety of the UC-Irvine datasets. EB is based on two ideas, which interact. The first is to find sets of seemingly dependent attributes and to add them as new attributes. The second idea is to exploit "zeroes", that is, the negative evidence provided by attribute values that do not occur at all in particular classes in the training data. Zeroes are handled in Naive Bayes by smoothing. In contrast, EB uses them as evidence that a potential class labeling may be wrong.

Yet in many real-world tasks this is only a rough approximation, as one sample can be labeled with a set of classes and thus techniques for the more general multi-label problem have to be explored. In this paper we review the techniques presented in our previous work and discuss its application to the field of text classification, using the multinomial (Naive Bayes) classifier. Results are presented on the Reuters-21578 dataset, and our proposed approach obtains satisfying results.

Flexible NBTree uses Bayes measure 6 to select proper test and applies post-discretization strategy to construct decision tree. The finial decision tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision trees, but the leaf nodes contain General Naive Bayes, which is a variant of standard Naive Bayesian classifier. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that Flexible NBTree has clear advantages with respect to the generalization ability when compared against its counterpart, NBTree.

It is well established that regarding the performance of machine learning techniques, scale and quality of the corpus are very important. For our purpose we used a database consisted of 5.500 words, distributed in 500 paragraphs. In the present study, pitch accent placement was treated as a binary classification task. Hence, given a word form in its sentential context, it was decide whether it should be unaccented or bear a pitch accent tone.

In many applications, however a ranking of examples are more desirable than just classification. How to extend naive Bayes to improve its ranking performance is an interesting and useful question in practice. Weighted naive Bayes is an extension of naive Bayes, in which attributes have different weights. This paper investigates how to learn a weighted naive Bayes with accurate ranking from data, or more precisely, how to learn the weights of a weighted naive Bayes to produce accurate ranking. We explore various methods: the gain ratio method, the hill climbing method, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the hill climbing method combined with the gain ratio method, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method combined with the gain ratio method. Our experiments show that a weighted naive Bayes trained to produce accurate ranking outperforms naive Bayes.

We propose a hybrid clustering criterion function and bisecting divisive clustering algorithm to improve the quality of clusters. The experimental results show that distributional character clustering is an effective dimensionality reduction method, which reduce the feature space to very low dimensionality (e.g. 500 features) while maintaining high performance. The performance is much better than information gain. Moreover, Naive Bayes classifier with distributional character clustering has state-of-the-art performance in Chinese text classification.

We also examine possible approaches to the problem of deciding when there is sufficient evidence to discontinue testing, and thus avoid the risks and costs associated with unnecessary tests.

Structure adaptive self-organizing map (SASOM) is a variant of SOM that is useful to pattern recognition and visualization. Fusion of classifiers can overcome the limitation of a single classifier by complementing each other. Fuzzy integral is a combination scheme that uses subjectively defined relevance of classifiers. In this paper, fusion of SASOM's using fuzzy integral is proposed for web mining problem. User profile represents different aspects of user's characteristics and needs an ensemble of classifiers that estimate user's preference using web content labeled by user as "like" or "dislike." The proposed method estimates the user profile using subsets of important features extracted from user-rated web documents. Using UCI Syskill & Webert data, the method is tested and compared with other classifiers including ID3, BP and naive Bayes classifier. Experimental results show that the fusion of SASOM's using fuzzy integral can perform better than not only previous studies but also majority voting of SASOM's.

Previous methods of resolving such conflicts between rules include using the most frequent class in the conflicting rules (as done in CN2) and using naive Bayes to calculate the most probable class. An alternative way of solving this problem is presented in this paper: by generating new rules from the examples covered by the conflicting rules. These newly induced rules axe then used for classification. Experiments on a number of domains show that this method significantly outperforms both the CN2 approach and naive Bayes.

A mathematically well-formed framework is suggested, which is based on Bayesian theory. Based on two different assumptions regarding the conditional independence of the input attributes, we have come up with two Bayesian implementations, namely the Naive Bayes and the Bayesian Networks classifiers. As a performance benchmark, we evaluated the experimental result against CART, an acclaimed algorithm in the field of intonational phrase -break detection that has demonstrated stat-of-the-art figures. Our approach utilizes minimal morphological and syntactic resources in a finite length window, i.e. the POS label and the type of syntactic phrase boundary, a novel attribute that has not been applied to the specific task before. On a 5500 word training set, the Bayesian networks approach proved to be the most effective, depicting precision and recall figures in the range of 82% and 77% respectively.

A causal model is developed from the literature, and a procedure to learn Bayesian prior and conditional probabilities is provided. Using a data set of 40 real-life software projects we test our model. Our results indicate that the probabilistic forecasting models allow managers to estimate joint probability distribution over different software effort estimates. A software project manager may use the joint probability distribution to develop a cumulative probability distribution, which in turn may help the manager estimate the uncertainty that the project effort may be greater than the estimated effort.

This simple approach stands from assumptions of conditional independence among features given the class. In this paper a new naive Bayes classifier called Interval Estimation naive Bayes is proposed. Interval Estimation naive Bayes is performed in two phases. First, an interval estimation of each probability necessary to specify the naive Bayes is calculated. On the second phase the best combination of values inside these intervals is calculated using a heuristic search that is guided by the accuracy of the classifiers. The founded values in the search are the new parameters for the naive Bayes classifier. Our new approach has shown to be quite competitive related to simple naive Bayes. Experimental tests have been done with 21 data sets from the UCI repository.

But it does not have much more improvements on a stable learning algorithm. TAN, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, is a tree-like Bayesian network. The standard TAN learning algorithm generates a stable TAN classifier, which is difficult to improve its accuracy by boosting technique. In this paper, a new TAN learning algorithm called GTAN and a TAN classifier combination method called Boosting-MultiTAN are presented. Through comparisons of this TAN classifier combination method with the standard TAN classifier in the experiments, the Boosting-MultiTAN shows higher classification accuracy than the standard TAN classifier on the most data sets.

Very often, researchers need to spend considerable amounts of time reading through entire papers before being able to determine whether or not they should be curated (archived). In this paper, we present an automated text classification system for the classification of biomedical papers. This classification is based on whether there is experimental evidence for the expression of molecular gene products for specified genes within a given paper. The system performs preprocessing and data cleaning, followed by feature extraction from the raw text. It subsequently classifies the paper using the extracted features with a Naive Bayes Classifier. Our approach has made it possible to classify (and curate) biomedical papers automatically, thus potentially saving considerable time and resources. The system proved to be highly accurate, and won honourable mention in the KDD Cup 2002 task 1.

Information from user feedback helps to improve the accuracy of classifiers used for detecting masquerades. Instead of operating in isolation, the online sequential classifier can request feedback from the user. In the full-feedback policy, the classifier verifies every session; in the feedback-on-alarm policy, the classifier confirms only suspicious sessions. Surprisingly, confirming only a few sessions under the feedback-on-alarm policy is enough to be competitive with verifying all sessions under the full-feedback policy. Experiments on a standard artificial dataset demonstrate that the naive-Bayes classifier boosted by the feedback-on-alarm policy beats the previous best-performing detector and reduces the number of missing alarms by 30%.

Collaborative filtering uses a database about user preferences to predict additional topics. Content based systems provide recommendations by matching user interests with topic attributes. In this paper, we describe a method for discovery of user preference by using hybrid two techniques for recommendation that allow the application of machine learning algorithm. The method generates recommendations based on clustering user and categorizing items with feature selection through association word mining by Apriori algorithm. We use Genetic algorithm to group users based on items categorized by Naive Bayes classifier. Then, we recommend web documents to user based on grouped user preference and information of categorized items. We evaluate our method on a large database of user ratings for web document and it significantly outperforms previous proposed methods.

J	Kolcz, A; Alspector, J				Kolcz, A; Alspector, J			Asymmetric missing-data problems: Overcoming the lack of negative data in preference ranking	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						incomplete data problems; imbalanced training data; user modeling; personalization; information retrieval	INFORMATION; ALGORITHM; WEB; EM	In certain classification problems there is a strong a asymmetry between the number of labeled examples available for each of the classes involved. In an extreme case, there may be a complete lack of labeled data for one of the classes while, at the same time, there are adequate labeled examples for the others, accompanied by a large body of unlabeled data. Since most classification algorithms require some information about all classes involved, label estimation for the un-represented class is desired. An important representative of this group of problems is that of user interest/preference modeling where there may be a large number of examples of what the user likes with essentially no counterexamples. Recently, there has been much interest in applying the EM algorithm to incomplete data problems in the area of text retrieval and categorization. We adapt this approach to the asymmetric case of modeling user interests in news articles, where only labeled positive training data are available, with access to a large corpus of unlabeled documents. User modeling is here equivalent to that of user-specific document ranking. EM is used in conjunction with the Naive Bayes model while its output is also utilized by a Support Vector Machine and Rocchio's technique. Our findings demonstrate that the EM algorithm can be quite effective in modeling the negative class under a number of different initialization schemes. Although primarily just the negative training examples are needed, a natural question is whether using all of the estimated labels (i.e., positive and negative) would be more (or less) beneficial. This is important considering that, in this context, the initialization of the negative class for EM is likely not to be very accurate. Experimental results suggest that EM output should be limited to negative label estimates only.

Based on the vector-space model, the performance of this classification particularly depends on the way to weight and select important terms in documents for constructing a prototype class vector for each class. In the past, it was shown that term weighting using statistical term distributions could improve classification accuracy. However, for different data sets, the best weighting systems are different. Towards this problem, we propose a method that uses homogenous centroid-based classification. The effectiveness of this approach is explored using four data sets. Two main factors are taken into account: model selection and score combination. By experiments, the results show that our system can improve classification accuracy zip to 7.5-8.5% comparing to k-NN classifier, 3.7-4.0% comparing with naive Bayes classifier and 1.6-2.7% over the best single-model classification method (p<0.05).

These are implemented in the IBM ProbE(TM) (Probabilistic Estimation) data mining engine, which is an object-oriented framework for building classes of segmented predictive models from massive training data sets. Based on this methodology, an application called ATM-SE(TM) for direct-mail targeted marketing has been developed jointly with Fingerhut Business Intelligence [1]).

BN with decision attribute as a root can be applied to classification of new cases, by synthesis of conditional probabilities propagated along the edges. We consider approximate BNs, which almost keep entropy of a decision table. They have usually less edges than classical BNs. They enable to model and extend the well-known Naive Bayes approach. Experiments show that classifiers based on approximate BNs can be very efficient.

Four secondary structure types are considered, including alpha-helix, beta-strand, beta-turn and coil. A six-letter exchange group is utilized to represent a protein sequence. Training cases are expressed as sequence quaternion. A tool called Predictor is developed in Java that implements the proposed approach. To evaluate the tool, we select, from the Protein Data Bank and based on the principle of one-protein-per-family according to the structure family of SCOP, six hundred and twenty-three known proteins without pair wise sequence homology. Several training/test data splits have been tried. The results show that our proposed approach can produce prediction accuracy comparable to those of the traditional prediction methods. Predictor has user-friendly and easy-to-use GUIs, and is of practical value to the molecular biology researchers.

However, the problem of word mismatch seriously hurts the effectiveness of distributed information retrieval. Automatic query expansion has been suggested as a technique for dealing with the fundamental issue of word mismatch. In this paper, we propose a method - query expansion with Naive Bayes to address the problem, discuss its implementation in IISS system, and present experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. Such technique not only enhances the discriminatory power of typical queries for choosing the right collections but also hence significantly improves retrieval results.

Unlike traditional cepstral based methods, this approach uses histograms of reconstructed phase spaces. A Naive Bayes classifier uses the probability mass estimates for classification. The approach is verified using isolated fricative, vowel, and nasal phonemes from the TIMIT corpus. The results show that a reconstructed phase space approach is a viable method for classification of phonemes, with the potential for use in a continuous speech recognition system.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				We present the Fuzzy Bayes Predictor (FBP), a hybrid system for the task of monthly electric load forecasting. The FBP is a modification we introduce in the Naive Bayes Classifier in order to enable it to predict numerical values. We consider three versions of the FBP, each one with a different dependence among the input data: independence, first-order and second-order dependence. For verifying the efficiency of the FBPs prediction, we compare it with two fuzzy systems and two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters exponential smoothing.

LB uses itemsets to create context-specific probabilistic models of the data and estimate the conditional probability P(c(i)\A) of each class c(i) given a case A. In this paper we use chi-square tests to address several drawbacks of the originally proposed interestingness metric, namely: (i) the inability to capture certain really interesting patterns, (ii) the need for a user-defined and data dependent interestingness threshold, and (iii) the need to set a minimum support threshold. We also introduce some pruning criteria which allow for a trade-off between complexity and speed on one side and classification accuracy on the other. Our experimental results show that the modified LB outperforms the original LB, Naive Bayes, C4.5 and TAN.

TEA provides also a set of additional functions, which can assist users at fine-tuning the text classifiers and improving the classification accuracy, mainly through modifications of dictionaries generated during the training phase. Experiments, described in the paper, aimed at supporting work with medical unstructured text documents downloaded from the Internet.

Some algorithms can be slowed or their performance adversely affected by too much data-some of which may be irrelevant or redundant to the learning task. Feature subset selection, then, is a method for enhancing the performance of learning algorithms, reducing the hypothesis search space, and. in some cases, reducing the storage requirement. This paper describes a feature subset selector that uses a correlation based heuristic to determine the "goodness" of feature subsets, and evaluates its effectiveness with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based learner (IB1). Experiments using a number of standard data sets drawn from real and artificial domains me presented. Feature subset selection gave significant improvement for all three algorithms; C4.5 generated smaller decision trees.

The new classifier builds upon the naive-Bayes classifier, and models the dependencies among patient findings in an attempt to improve its performance, both in terms of classification accuracy and in terms of calibration of the estimated probabilities. This work finds motivation in the argument that highly calibrated probabilities are necessary for the clinician to be able to rely on the model's recommendations. Experimental results are presented, supporting the conclusion that modeling the dependencies among findings improves calibration.

Because staging of dementia severity is economically and clinically important, we used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to identify simpler models for estimating total CDR scores. Compared to a gold standard, which required 34 attributes to derive total CDR scores, ML algorithms identified models with as few as seven attributes. The classification accuracy varied with the algorithm used with naive Bayes giving the highest. (76%) The mildly demented severity class was the only one with significantly reduced accuracy (59%). If one groups the severity classes into normal, very mild-to-mildly demented, and moderate-to-severely demented, then classification accuracies are clinically acceptable (85%). These simple models can be used in community settings where it is currently not possible to estimate dementia severity due to time and cost constraints.

J	Yeow, WL; Mahmud, R; Raj, RG				Yeow, Wei Liang; Mahmud, Rohana; Raj, Ram Gopal			An application of case-based reasoning with machine learning for forensic autopsy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Case-based reasoning; Naive Bayes; Autopsy report system; Decision-support system; Feature-weight learning	BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CRIME ANALYSIS; INTELLIGENCE; METHODOLOGY; SCIENCE; MODEL	Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving. CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge. This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented. Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Naive Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation. Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical advantages.

Extraction and analysis of multiple time window features associated with muscle fatigue conditions using sEMG signals	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Muscle fatigue analysis; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Surface electromyography; Multiple time windows	DYNAMIC CONTRACTIONS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; EMG; ALGORITHMS	In this work, an attempt has been made to differentiate surface electromyography (sEMG) signals under muscle fatigue and non-fatigue conditions with multiple time window (MTW) features. sEMG signals are recorded from biceps brachii muscles of 50 volunteers. Eleven MTW features are extracted from the acquired signals using four window functions, namely rectangular windows, Hamming windows, trapezoidal windows, and Slepian windows. Prominent features are selected using genetic algorithm and information gain based ranking. Four different classification algorithms, namely naive Bayes, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour, and linear discriminant analysis, are used for the study. Classifier performances with the MTW features are compared with the currently used time- and frequency-domain features. The results show a reduction in mean and median frequencies of the signals under fatigue. Mean and variance,of the features differ by an order of magnitude between the two cases considered. The number of features is reduced by 45% with the genetic algorithm and 36% with information gain based ranking. The k-nearest neighbour algorithm is found to be the most accurate in classifying the features, with a maximum accuracy of 93% with the features selected using information gain ranking.

A.; Strachan, Rebecca			Hybrid decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers for multi-class classification tasks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Hybrid; Decision tree; Naive Bayes classifier	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION	In this paper, we introduce two independent hybrid mining algorithms to improve the classification accuracy rates of decision tree (DT) and nave Bayes (NB) classifiers for the classification of multi-class problems. Both DT and NB classifiers are useful, efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease, in our first proposed hybrid DT algorithm, we employ a nave Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the DT induction. Moreover, it is extremely computationally expensive for a NB classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes. Thus, in the second proposed hybrid NB classifier, we employ a DT induction to select a comparatively more important subset of attributes for the production of nave assumption of class conditional independence. We tested the performances of the two proposed hybrid algorithms against those of the existing DT and NB classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods have produced impressive results in the classification of real life challenging multi-class problems. They are also able to automatically extract the most valuable training datasets and identify the most effective attributes for the description of instances from noisy complex training databases with large dimensions of attributes.

Domains of competence of the semi-naive Bayesian network classifiers	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Domains of competence; Semi-naive Bayesian network classifiers; Naive Bayes; AODE; Complexity measures; Discretization	DATA COMPLEXITY-MEASURES; CLASSIFICATION LEARNING ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	The motivation for this paper comes from observing the recent tendency to assert that rather than a unique and globally superior classifier, there exist local winners. Hence, the proposal of new classifiers can be seen as an attempt to cover new areas of the complexity space of datasets, or even to compete with those previously assigned to others. Several complexity measures for supervised classification have been designed to define these areas. In this paper, we want to discover which type of datasets, defined by certain range values of the complexity measures for supervised classification, fits for some of the most well-known semi-naive Bayesian network classifiers. This study is carried out on continuous and discrete domains for naive Bayes and Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), which are two widely used incremental classifiers that provide some of the best trade-offs between error performance and efficiency. Furthermore, an automatic procedure to advise on the best semi-naive BNC to use for classification, based on the values of certain complexity measures, is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Sn-grams differ from traditional n-grams in the manner how we construct them, i.e., what elements are considered neighbors. In case of sn-grams, the neighbors are taken by following syntactic relations in syntactic trees, and not by taking words as they appear in a text, i.e., sn-grams are constructed by following paths in syntactic trees. In this manner, sn-grams allow bringing syntactic knowledge into machine learning methods; still, previous parsing is necessary for their construction. Sn-grams can be applied in any natural language processing (NLP) task where traditional n-grams are used. We describe how sn-grams were applied to authorship attribution. We used as baseline traditional n-grams of words, part of speech (PUS) tags and characters; three classifiers were applied: support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and tree classifier J48. Sn-grams give better results with SVM classifier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

K.; Yao, Xin			Multiobjective genetic programming for maximizing ROC performance	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Classification; ROC analysis; AUC; ROCCH; Genetic programming; Evolutionary multiobjective algorithm; Memetic algorithm; Decision tree	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	In binary classification problems, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs are commonly used for visualizing, organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performances. An important issue in the ROC literature is to obtain the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) that covers potentially optima for a given set of classifiers [1]. Maximizing the ROCCH means to maximize the true positive rate (tpr) and minimize the false positive rate (fpr) for every classifier in ROC space, while tpr and fpr are conflicting with each other. In this paper, we propose multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) to obtain a group of nondominated classifiers, with which the maximum ROCCH can be achieved. Four different multiobjective frameworks, including Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume (SMS-EMOA), and Approximation-Guided Evolutionary Multi-Objective (AG-EMOA) are adopted into GP, because all of them are successfully applied into many problems and have their own characters. To improve the performance of each individual in GP, we further propose a memetic approach into GP by defining two local search strategies specifically designed for classification problems. Experimental results based on 27 well-known UCI data sets show that MOGP performs significantly better than single objective algorithms such as FGP, GGP, EGP, and MGP, and other traditional machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes, and PRIE. The experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of the local search operator in the MOGP framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their design often requires modelling ability and subjective judgments. This can make it difficult to adapt a scoring system to a clinical setting different from that in which the system was developed. The objective of this study was to discuss an approach to derive scoring systems, which can be easily modified and matched to any scenario. MethodsA naive Bayes approach was used to develop a scoring system that is completely defined by descriptive tables obtained by frequency counts from the training set. The approach was implemented to build a locally customized scoring system for planning transfusion requirements after cardiac surgery. The performance of this system was evaluated and compared with that of a logistic regression model designed using the same predictors. The working sample was a set of 3182 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University Hospital of Siena, Italy. ResultsThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was equal to 0.811 and 0.824 for the scoring system and for the logistic regression model, respectively. This result proves that this global index of discrimination capacity was virtually identical and very good for both models. The values of sensitivity, specificity and overall correct-classification percentage obtained by the leave-one-out method were practically the same for the two models (73.9% versus 75.3%). ConclusionsAn easy-fitting and trustworthy scoring system can be directly developed using a naive Bayes approach. The simplicity of its design allows the system to be customized to any specific institution and updated regularly. This aspect has important practical implications because it can encourage the use of scoring systems among clinicians, enabling their performance to be properly assessed in a wider clinical context.

Geological mapping using remote sensing data: A comparison of five machine learning algorithms, their response to variations in the spatial distribution of training data and the use of explicit spatial information	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Geological mapping; Remote sensing; Machine learning; Supervised classification; Spatial clustering; Spatial information	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; BROKEN-HILL BLOCK; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS; WILLYAMA SUPERGROUP; DISCRIMINATION	Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are a powerful group of data-driven inference tools that offer an automated means of recognizing patterns in high-dimensional data. Hence, there is much scope for the application of MLAs to the rapidly increasing volumes of remotely sensed geophysical data for geological mapping problems. We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data. We make a further comparison of MLAs based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classification of lithology using remotely sensed geophysical data. Random Forests is straightforward to train, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, and as accurate as, or substantially more accurate than the other MLAs trialed. The results of our study indicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, MLA predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions. MLAs, such as Random Forests, are valuable tools for generating reliable first-pass predictions for practical geological mapping applications that combine widely available geophysical data.

J	Feldman, J; Monteserin, A; Amandi, A				Feldman, Juan; Monteserin, Ariel; Amandi, Analia			Detecting students' perception style by using games	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Perception style; Learning styles; Games; Naive Bayes classifier	LEARNING STYLES; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENTS; COURSES; DESIGN	Knowing students' learning styles allows us to improve their experience in an educational environment. Particularly, the perception style is one of the most important dimensions of the learning styles since it describes the way students perceive the world as well as the kind of learning content they prefer. Several approaches to detect students' perception style according to Felder's model have been proposed. However, these approaches exhibit several limitations that make their implementation difficult. Thus, we propose a novel approach to detect the perception style of a student by analyzing his/her interaction with games, namely puzzle games. To carry out this detection, we track how students play a puzzle game and extract information about this interaction. Then, we train a Naive Bayes Classifier to infer the students' perception style by using the information extracted. We have evaluated our proposed approach with 47 Computer Engineering students. Experimental results showed that the perception style was successfully predicted through the use of games, with an accuracy of 85%. Finally, we conclude that games are a promising environment where the students' perception style can be detected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Diniz, CAR; Rodrigues, CP; Leite, JG; Pires, RM				Ribeiro Diniz, Carlos Alberto; Rodrigues, Camila Pedrozo; Leite, Jose Galvao; Pires, Rubiane Maria			A Bayesian estimation of lag lengths in distributed lag models	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						distributed lag; lag lengths determination; fractional Bayes factor; Monte Carlo simulation; 62J05; 62F03; 62F10; 62F40	TIME-SERIES; AUTOREGRESSION; BOOTSTRAP; ORDER	Dynamic regression models are widely used because they express and model the behaviour of a system over time. In this article, two dynamic regression models, the distributed lag (DL) model and the autoregressive distributed lag model, are evaluated focusing on their lag lengths. From a classical statistics point of view, there are various methods to determine the number of lags, but none of them are the best in all situations. This is a serious issue since wrong choices will provide bad estimates for the effects of the regressors on the response variable. We present an alternative for the aforementioned problems by considering a Bayesian approach. The posterior distributions of the numbers of lags are derived under an improper prior for the model parameters. The fractional Bayes factor technique [A. O'Hagan, Fractional Bayes factors for model comparison (with discussion), J. R. Statist. Soc. B 57 (1995), pp. 99-138] is used to handle the indeterminacy in the likelihood function caused by the improper prior. The zero-one loss function is used to penalize wrong decisions. A naive method using the specified maximum number of DLs is also presented. The proposed and the naive methods are verified using simulation data. The results are promising for the method we proposed. An illustrative example with a real data set is provided.

J	Zhou, B; Yao, YY; Luo, JG				Zhou, Bing; Yao, Yiyu; Luo, Jigang			Cost-sensitive three-way email spam filtering	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Email spam filtering; Cost-sensitive learning; Ternary classification; Three-way decision; Naive Bayes classifier		Email spam filtering is typically treated as a binary classification problem that can be solved by machine learning algorithms. We argue that a three-way decision approach provides a more meaningful way to users for precautionary handling their incoming emails. Three email folders instead of two are produced in a three-way spam filtering system, a suspected folder is added to allow users make further examinations of suspicious emails, thereby reducing the chances of misclassification. Different from existing ternary email spam filtering systems, we focus on two issues that are less studied, that is, the computation of required thresholds to define the three email categories, and the interpretation of the cost-sensitive characteristics of spam filtering. Instead of supplying the thresholds based on intuitive understandings of the levels of tolerance for errors, we systematically calculate the thresholds based on decision-theoretic rough set model. A loss function is interpreted as the costs of making classification decisions. A decision is made for which the overall cost is minimum. Experimental results show that the new approach reduces the error rate of misclassifying a legitimate email to spam and demonstrates a better performance for the cost-sensitivity aspect.

In this study, we proposed a new method for the prediction of the DNA-binding proteins, by performing the feature rank using random forest and the wrapper-based feature selection using forward best-first search strategy. The features comprise information from primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and position specific scoring matrix. The proposed method, called DBPPred, used Gaussian naive Bayes as the underlying classifier since it outperformed five other classifiers, including decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with polynomial kernel, and support vector machine with radial basis function. As a result, the proposed DBPPred yields the highest average accuracy of 0.791 and average MCC of 0.583 according to the five-fold cross validation with ten runs on the training benchmark dataset PDB594. Subsequently, blind tests on the independent dataset PDB186 by the proposed model trained on the entire PDB594 dataset and by other five existing methods (including iDNA-Prot, DNA-Prot, DNAbinder, DNABIND and DBD-Threader) were performed, resulting in that the proposed DBPPred yielded the highest accuracy of 0.769, MCC of 0.538, and AUC of 0.790. The independent tests performed by the proposed DBPPred on completely a large non-DNA binding protein dataset and two RNA binding protein datasets also showed improved or comparable quality when compared with the relevant prediction methods. Moreover, we observed that majority of the selected features by the proposed method are statistically significantly different between the mean feature values of the DNA-binding and the non DNA-binding proteins. All of the experimental results indicate that the proposed DBPPred can be an alternative perspective predictor for large-scale determination of DNA-binding proteins.

J	Lee, BJ; Kim, JY				Lee, Bum Ju; Kim, Jong Yeol			A Comparison of the Predictive Power of Anthropometric Indices for Hypertension and Hypotension Risk	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE RISK; CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; TO-HEIGHT RATIO; WAIST-HIP RATIO; NECK CIRCUMFERENCE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION; CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK	Background and Aims: It is commonly accepted that body fat distribution is associated with hypertension, but the strongest anthropometric indicator of the risk of hypertension is still controversial. Furthermore, no studies on the association of hypotension with anthropometric indices have been reported. The objectives of the present study were to determine the best predictors of hypertension and hypotension among various anthropometric indices and to assess the use of combined indices as a method of improving the predictive power in adult Korean women and men. Methods: For 12789 subjects 21-85 years of age, we assessed 41 anthropometric indices using statistical analyses and data mining techniques to determine their ability to discriminate between hypertension and normotension as well as between hypotension and normotension. We evaluated the predictive power of combined indices using two machine learning algorithms and two variable subset selection techniques. Results: The best indicator for predicting hypertension was rib circumference in both women (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.813; AUC = 0.669) and men (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.601; AUC = 0.627); for hypotension, the strongest predictor was chest circumference in women (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.541; AUC = 0.657) and neck circumference in men (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.522; AUC = 0.672). In experiments using combined indices, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the prediction of hypertension risk in women and men were 0.721 and 0.652, respectively, according to the logistic regression with wrapper-based variable selection; for hypotension, the corresponding values were 0.675 in women and 0.737 in men, according to the naive Bayes with wrapper-based variable selection. Conclusions: The best indicators of the risk of hypertension and the risk of hypotension may differ. The use of combined indices seems to slightly improve the predictive power for both hypertension and hypotension.

A framework is developed using the following new aspects: Gaussian mixture clustering for the quantization process, the use of an integrated visual vocabulary (IVV), which is built as the union of all centroids obtained from the separate quantization process of each class, and the usage of some features, including edge orientation histogram, CIELab color moments, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The experiments are conducted on IKONOS images with six semantic classes (tree, grassland, residential, commercial/ industrial, road, and water). The results show that the use of an IVV increases the overall accuracy (OA) by 11 to 12% and 6% when it is implemented on the selected and all features, respectively. The selected features of CIELab color moments and GLCM provide a better OA than the implementation over CIELab color moment or GLCM as individuals. The latter increases the OA by only similar to 2 to 3%. Moreover, the results show that the OA of LDA outperforms the OA of C4.5 and naive Bayes tree by similar to 20%.

One challenge in information retrieval is text classification. Current practices rely heavily on the classical naive Bayes algorithm due to its simplicity and robustness. However, results from this algorithm are not always satisfactory. In this article, the limitations of the naive Bayes algorithm are discussed, and it is found that the assumption on the independence of terms is the main reason for an unsatisfactory classification in many real-world applications. To overcome the limitations, the dependent factors are considered by integrating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting algorithm in the naive Bayes classification. Moreover, the TF-IDF algorithm itself is improved so that both frequencies and distribution information are taken into consideration. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two simulation experiments were conducted, and the comparisons with other classification methods have shown that the proposed method has outperformed other existing algorithms in terms of precision and index recall rate.

Speeding up incremental wrapper feature subset selection with Naive Bayes classifier	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Wrapper feature subset selection; Incremental algorithms; Naive Bayes; High-dimensional data		This paper deals with the problem of wrapper feature subset selection (FSS) in classification-oriented datasets with a (very) large number of attributes. In high-dimensional datasets with thousands of variables, wrapper FSS becomes a laborious computational process because of the amount of CPU time it requires. In this paper we study how under certain circumstances the wrapper FSS process can be speeded up by embedding the classifier into the wrapper algorithm, instead of dealing with it as a black-box. Our proposal is based on the combination of the NB classifier (which is known to be largely beneficial for FSS) with incremental wrapper FSS algorithms. The merit of this approach is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, and the results show an impressive speed-up for the embedded FSS process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a new approach of feature extraction by using Matrix Pencil Method in Frequency Domain (MPMFD). The proposed method takes into account not only the magnitude of the signal, but also its phase, so that all the physical characteristics of the target will be considered. With this method, the separation between the early time and the late time is not necessary. The proposed method is compared to Matrix Pencil Method in Time Domain (MPMTD). The methods are applied on UWB backscattered signal from three canonical targets (thin wire, sphere, and cylinder). MPMFD is applied on a complex field (real and imaginary parts of the signal). To the best of our knowledge, this comparison and the reconstruction of the complex electromagnetic field by MPMFD have not been done before. We show the effect of the two extraction methods on the accuracy of three different classifiers: Naive bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show that the accuracy of classification is better when using extracted features by MPMFD with SVM.

Data-Driven Link Quality Prediction Using Link Features	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Design; Measurement; Performance; Link quality estimation; link quality prediction	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single-and multiple-senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20% to 30%. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45%.

An investigation into the application of ensemble learning for entailment classification	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Entailment; Classification; Ensemble learning	RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; STACKED GENERALIZATION	Textual entailment is a task for which the application of supervised learning mechanisms has received considerable attention as driven by successive Recognizing Data Entailment data challenges. We developed a linguistic analysis framework in which a number of similarity/dissimilarity features are extracted for each entailment pair in a data set and various classifier methods are evaluated based on the instance data derived from the extracted features. The focus of the paper is to compare and contrast the performance of single and ensemble based learning algorithms for a number of data sets. We showed that there is some benefit to the use of ensemble approaches but, based on the extracted features, Naive Bayes proved to be the strongest learning mechanism. Only one ensemble approach demonstrated a slight improvement over the technique of Naive Bayes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Extending the ABC-Miner Bayesian Classification Algorithm	NATURE INSPIRED COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES FOR OPTIMIZATION (NICSO 2013)	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization (NICSO 2013)	SEP 02-04, 2013	Canterbury, UNITED KINGDOM	Univ Kent, Sch Comp, Spanish Minist Econ & Competitiveness, Andalusian Govt, European Commiss FP7 Future & Emerg Technol Initiative	Univ Kent	Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Data Mining; Classification; Bayesian Network Classifiers	ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; NETWORKS	ABC-Miner is a Bayesian classification algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic. The algorithm learns Bayesian network Augmented Naive-Bayes (BAN) classifiers, where the class node is the parent of all the nodes representing the input variables. However, this assumes the existence of a dependency relationship between the class variable and all the input variables, and this relationship is a type of "causal" (rather than "effect") relationship, which restricts the flexibility of the algorithm to learn. In this paper, we propose ABC-Miner+, an extension to the ABC-Miner algorithm which is able to learn more flexible Bayesian network classifier structures, where it is not necessary to have a (direct) dependency relationship between the class variable and each of the input variables, and the dependency between the class and the input variables varies from "causal" to "effect" relationships. The produced model is the Markov blanket of the class variable. Empirical evaluations on UCI benchmark datasets show that our extended ABC-Miner+ outperforms its previous version in terms of predictive accuracy, model size and computational time.

In TPR, the dataset is distributed across a large number of users in which each record is owned by two different users, one user only knows the values for a subset of attributes and the other knows the values for the remaining attributes. A miner aims to learn, for example, classification rules on their data, while preserving each user's privacy. In this work we develop a cryptographic solution for frequency-based learning methods in TPR. The crucial step in the proposed solution is the privacy-preserving computation of frequencies of a tuple of values in the users' data, which can ensure each user's privacy without loss of accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of the method by using it to build the privacy preserving protocol for the naive Bayes classifier learning, and briefly address the solution in other applications. Experimental results show that our protocol is efficient.			luongthedung@gmail.com; hungtd@hnue.edu.vn					Agrawal D., 2001, P 20 ACM SIGMOD SIGA, P247, DOI DOI 10.1145/375551.375602; Agrawal R., 2005, P 2005 ACM SIGMOD IN, P251, DOI 10.1145/1066157.1066187; Agrawal R., 1993, P 1993 ACM SIGMOD IN, V22, P207, DOI DOI 10.1145/170035.170072.ACCESSED; Agrawal R, 2000, SIGMOD RECORD, V29, P439; Boneh D., 1998, LNCS, V1423, P48; Charu A.C., 2008, PRIVACY PRESERVING D; Domingos P, 1997, MACH LEARN, V29, P103, DOI 10.1023/A:1007413511361; Du W, 2002, P IEEE INT C PRIV SE, V14, P1; Du W., 2003, P 9 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P505; Evfimievski A., 2002, P 8 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P217; Evfimievski A.

Inspired by affective computing and active listening strategy, in this paper, a research and application framework of recognizing emotion based on textual interaction is presented first. Second, an emotion category model for e-learners is defined. Third, many Chinese metaphors are abstracted from the corpus according to the sentence semantics and syntax. Fourth, as the strategy of active learning, topic detection is used to detect the first turn in dialogs and recognize the type of emotion in the turn, which is different from the traditional emotion recognition approaches that try to classify every turn into an emotion category. Fifth, compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, LogitBoost, Bagging, MultiClass Classifier, RBFnetwork, J48 algorithms and their corresponding cost-sensitive approaches, Random Forest and its corresponding cost-sensitive approaches achieve better results in our initial experiment of classifying the e-learners' emotions. Finally, a case-based reasoning for emotion regulation instance recommendation is proposed to guide the listener to regulate the negative emotion of a speaker, in which a weighted sum method of Chinese sentence similarity computation is adopted. The experimental result shows that the ratio of effective cases is 68%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Verbraken, T; Verbeke, W; Baesens, B				Verbraken, Thomas; Verbeke, Wouter; Baesens, Bart			Profit optimizing customer churn prediction with Bayesian network classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian network classifier; churn prediction; maximum profit criterion	MARKOV BLANKET INDUCTION; LEARNING ALGORITHM; FEATURE-SELECTION; CAUSAL DISCOVERY; LOCAL CAUSAL; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; SATISFACTION; INFORMATION; RETENTION	Customer churn prediction is becoming an increasingly important business analytics problem for telecom operators. In order to increase the efficiency of customer retention campaigns, churn prediction models need to be accurate as well as compact and interpretable. Although a myriad of techniques for churn prediction has been examined, there has been little attention for the use of Bayesian Network classifiers. This paper investigates the predictive power of a number of Bayesian Network algorithms, ranging from the Naive Bayes classifier to General Bayesian Network classifiers. Furthermore, a feature selection method based on the concept of the Markov Blanket, which is genuinely related to Bayesian Networks, is tested. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated with both the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and the recently introduced Maximum Profit criterion. The Maximum Profit criterion performs an intelligent optimization by targeting this fraction of the customer base which would maximize the profit generated by a retention campaign. The results of the experiments are rigorously tested and indicate that most of the analyzed techniques have a comparable performance. Some methods, however, are more preferred since they lead to compact networks, which enhances the interpretability and comprehensibility of the churn prediction models.

While individuals, businesses, and governments are interested in evaluating the sentiments behind this content, there are no consistent conclusions on which sentiment classification technologies are best. Recent studies suggest that ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in sentiment classification. In this study, we conduct a comparative assessment of the performance of three popular ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Random Subspace) based on five base learners (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) for sentiment classification. Moreover, ten public sentiment analysis datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of ensemble learning for sentiment analysis. Based on a total of 1200 comparative group experiments, empirical results reveal that ensemble methods substantially improve the performance of individual base learners for sentiment classification. Among the three ensemble methods, Random Subspace has the better comparative results, although it was seldom discussed in the literature. These results illustrate that ensemble learning methods can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, ZL; Zhao, C; Qiu, S				Wang, Zhelong; Zhao, Cong; Qiu, Sen			A system off human vita signs monitoring and activity recognition based on body sensor network	SENSOR REVIEW			English	Article						Activity recognition; Body sensor network; ECG; Health monitor; SpO(2); Telemedicine		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a health monitoring system that can measure human vital signs and recognize human activity based on body sensor network (BSN). Design/methodology/approach - The system is mainly composed of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal collection node, blood oxygen signal collection node, inertial sensor node, receiving node and upper computer software. The three collection nodes collect ECG signals, blood oxygen signals and motion signals. And then collected signals are transmitted wirelessly to receiving node and analyzed by software in upper computer in real-time. indings - Experiment results show that the system can simultaneously monitor human ECG, heart rate, pulse rate, SpO(2) and recognize human activity. A classifier based on coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM) is adopted to recognize human activity. The average recognition accuracy of CHMM classifier is 94.8 percent, which is higher than some existent methods, such as supported vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree and naive Bayes classifier (NBC). Practical implications - The monitoring system may be used for falling detection, elderly care, postoperative care, rehabilitation training, sports training and other fields in the future. Originality/value - First, the system can measure human vital signs (ECG, blood pressure, pulse rate, SpO(2), temperature, heart rate) and recognizes some specific simple or complex activities (sitting, lying, go boating, bicycle riding). Second, the researches of using CHMM for activity recognition based on BSN are extremely few. Consequently, the classifier based on CHMM is adopted to recognize activity with ideal recognition accuracies in this paper.

Genome-wide essential gene identification has progressed rapidly in certain bacterial species; however, it remains difficult to achieve in most eukaryotic species. Several computational models have recently been developed to integrate gene features and used as alternatives to transfer gene essentiality annotations between organisms. Results: We first collected features that were widely used by previous predictive models and assessed the relationships between gene features and gene essentiality using a stepwise regression model. We found two issues that could significantly reduce model accuracy: (i) the effect of multicollinearity among gene features and (ii) the diverse and even contrasting correlations between gene features and gene essentiality existing within and among different species. To address these issues, we developed a novel model called feature-based weighted Naive Bayes model (FWM), which is based on Naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression, and genetic algorithm. The proposed model assesses features and filters out the effects of multicollinearity and diversity. The performance of FWM was compared with other popular models, such as support vector machine, Naive Bayes model, and logistic regression model, by applying FWM to reciprocally predict essential genes among and within 21 species. Our results showed that FWM significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of essential gene prediction. Conclusions: FWM can remarkably improve the accuracy of essential gene prediction and may be used as an alternative method for other classification work. This method can contribute substantially to the knowledge of the minimum gene sets required for living organisms and the discovery of new drug targets.

Design: Retrospective follow-up study. Methods: Based on a minimum follow-up time of 10 years with HCV infection, 190 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were classified according to their METAVIR score: (1) 25 nonprogressor patients who did not develop fibrosis (F0) and (2) 165 progressor patients who developed fibrosis (F >= 1). Seven polymorphisms of CRS signature and IL28B genotype were performed using the GoldenGate assay. The CRS signature was calculated by naive Bayes formula as previously described. Results: Nonprogressors had CRS values significantly lower than progressors (0.61 versus 0.67; P = 0.043). Among the progressors, we observed similar CRS values through all the fibrosis stages (F1/ F2/F3/F4). The percentage of patients with CRS. 0.70 (high risk of developing fibrosis) was higher in progressors than in nonprogressors; but the percentages with values between 0.50 and 0.70 (intermediate risk) and,0.50 (low risk) were quite similar for each of the fibrosis stages (P = 0.047). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of CRS for discriminating nonprogressor versus progressor was 0.625 (P = 0.043). When clinical variables were considered (age at HCV infection, intravenous drug use, gender, IL28B, and HCV genotype), the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of CRS improved up to 0.739 (P<0.001). Conclusions: CRS itself seems not to be a good marker for identifying HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who are at high risk of developing liver fibrosis. However, CRS score coupled with clinical factors might help to distinguish between nonprogressors and progressors patients.

J	Lethaus, F; Baumann, MRK; Koster, F; Lemmer, K				Lethaus, Firas; Baumann, Martin R. K.; Koester, Frank; Lemmer, Karsten			A comparison of selected simple supervised learning algorithms to predict driver intent based on gaze data	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial Neural Networks; Bayesian Networks; Naive Bayes Classifiers; Driver intent; Eye tracking; Supervised learning	EYE FIXATIONS; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; NOVICE	Gaze behaviour is known to indicate information gathering. It is therefore suggested that it could be used to derive information about the driver's next planned objective in order to identify intended manoeuvres without relying solely on car data. Ultimately this would be practically realised by an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using gaze data to correctly infer the intentions of the driver from what is implied by the incoming gaze data available to it. Neural Networks' ability to approximate arbitrary functions from observed data therefore makes them a candidate for modelling driver intent. Previous work has shown that significantly distinct gaze patterns precede each of the driving manoeuvres analysed indicating that eye movement data might be used as input to ADAS supplementing sensors, such as CAN-Bus (Controller Area Network), laser, radar or LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in order to recognise intended driving manoeuvres. In this study, drivers' gaze behaviour was measured prior to and during the execution of different driving manoeuvres performed in a dynamic driving simulator. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), and Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs) were then trained using gaze data to act as classifiers that predict the occurrence of certain driving manoeuvres. This has previously been successfully demonstrated with real traffic data [1]. Issues considered here included the amount of data that is used for predictive purposes prior to the manoeuvre, the accuracy of the predictive models at different times prior to the manoeuvre taking place and the relative difficulty of predicting a lane change left manoeuvre against predicting a lane change right manoeuvre.

IDS that rely solely on a database of stored known attacks are no longer sufficient for effectively detecting modern day threats. This paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique that can be used to detect previously unknown attacks on a network by identifying attack features. This effects-based feature identification method uniquely combines k-means clustering, Naive Bayes feature selection and C4.5 decision tree classification for pinpointing cyber attacks with a high degree of accuracy in order to increase the situational awareness of cyber network operators.

J	Maruyama, O				Maruyama, Osamu			Heterodimeric protein complex identification by naive Bayes classifiers	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Heterodimeric protein complex; Supervised learning; Naive Bayes classifier; Protein-protein interaction	INTERACTION NETWORKS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; BUDDING YEAST; PPI NETWORKS; RANDOM-WALKS; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM	Background: Protein complexes are basic cellular entities that carry out the functions of their components. It can be found that in databases of protein complexes of yeast like CYC2008, the major type of known protein complexes is heterodimeric complexes. Although a number of methods for trying to predict sets of proteins that form arbitrary types of protein complexes simultaneously have been proposed, it can be found that they often fail to predict heterodimeric complexes. Results: In this paper, we have designed several features characterizing heterodimeric protein complexes based on genomic data sets, and proposed a supervised-learning method for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. This method learns the parameters of the features, which are embedded in the naive Bayes classifier. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the naive Bayes classifier with the parameter values obtained by maximum likelihood estimation gives the score of a given pair of proteins to predict whether the pair is a heterodimeric complex or not. A five-fold cross-validation shows good performance on yeast. The trained classifiers also show higher predictability than various existing algorithms on yeast data sets with approximate and exact matching criteria. Conclusions: Heterodimeric protein complex prediction is a rather harder problem than heteromeric protein complex prediction because heterodimeric protein complex is topologically simpler. However, it turns out that by designing features specialized for heterodimeric protein complexes, predictability of them can be improved. Thus, the design of more sophisticate features for heterodimeric protein complexes as well as the accumulation of more accurate and useful genome-wide data sets will lead to higher predictability of heterodimeric protein complexes.

J	Bigdeli, B; Samadzadegan, F; Reinartz, P				Bigdeli, Behnaz; Samadzadegan, Farhad; Reinartz, Peter			A Multiple SVM System for Classification of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Hyperspectral; Support Vector Machine; Multiple Classifier System; Bayesian Theory	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DECISION FUSION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELECTION; RECOGNITION; BAND	With recent technological advances in remote sensing sensors and systems, very high-dimensional hyperspectral data are available for a better discrimination among different complex land-cover classes. However, the large number of spectral bands, but limited availability of training samples creates the problem of Hughes phenomenon or 'curse of dimensionality' in hyperspectral data sets. Moreover, these high numbers of bands are usually highly correlated. Because of these complexities of hyperspectral data, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifier in these situations, Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) may have better performance than single classifier. This paper presents a new method for classification of hyperspectral data based on a band clustering strategy through a multiple Support Vector Machine system. The proposed method uses the band grouping process based on a modified mutual information strategy to split data into few band groups. After the band grouping step, the proposed algorithm aims at benefiting from the capabilities of SVM as classification method. So, the proposed approach applies SVM on each band group that is produced in a previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes (NB) as a classifier fusion method combines decisions of SVM classifiers. Experimental results on two common hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy in comparison with the standard SVM on entire bands of data and feature selection methods.

J	Borges, HB; Silla, CN; Nievola, JC				Borges, Helyane Bronoski; Silla, Carlos N., Jr.; Nievola, Julio Cesar			An evaluation of global-model hierarchical classification algorithms for hierarchical classification problems with single path of labels	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hierarchical classification; Global approach	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CLASSIFIERS	Several classification tasks in different application domains can be seen as hierarchical classification problems. In order to deal with hierarchical classification problems, the use of existing flat classification approaches is not appropriate. For these reason, there has been a growing number of studies focusing on the development of novel algorithms able to induce classification models for hierarchical classification problems. In this paper we study the performance of a novel algorithm called Hierarchical Classification using a Competitive Neural Network (HC-CNN) and compare its performance against the Global-Model Naive Bayes (GMNB) on eight protein function prediction datasets.

In this paper, we propose a decision system to classify DM fundus images into normal, clinically significant macular edema (CMSE), and non-clinically significant macular edema (non-CMSE) classes. The objective of the proposed decision system is three fold namely, to automatically extract textural features (both region specific and global), to effectively choose subset of discriminatory features, and to classify DM fundus images to their corresponding class of disease severity. The system uses a gamut of textural features and an ensemble classifier derived from four popular classifiers such as the hidden naive Bayes, naive Bayes, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and the tree-based J48 classifiers. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 96.7% using five-fold cross validation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Donnelly, PJ; Sheppard, JW				Donnelly, Patrick J.; Sheppard, John W.			Classification of Musical Timbre Using Bayesian Networks	COMPUTER MUSIC JOURNAL			English	Article							INSTRUMENT CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	In this article, we explore the use of Bayesian networks for identifying the timbre of musical instruments. Peak spectral amplitude in ten frequency windows is extracted for each of 20 time windows to be used as features. Over a large data set of 24,000 audio examples covering the full musical range of 24 different common orchestral instruments, four different Bayesian network structures, including naive Bayes, are examined and compared with two support vector machines and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. Classification accuracy is examined by instrument, instrument family, and data set size. Bayesian networks with conditional dependencies in the time and frequency dimensions achieved 98 percent accuracy in the instrument classification task and 97 percent accuracy in the instrument family identification task. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over the previous approaches in the literature on this data set. Additionally, we tested our Bayesian approach on the widely used Iowa musical instrument data set, with similar results.

Insurance datasets will continue to increase in size as more variables are added to aid in managing client risk and will therefore be even more vulnerable to missing data. This paper proposes a hybrid multi-layered artificial immune system and genetic algorithm for partial imputation of missing data in datasets with numerous variables. The multi-layered artificial immune system creates and stores antibodies that bind to and annihilate an antigen. The genetic algorithm optimises the learning process of a stimulated antibody. The evaluation of the imputation is performed using the RIPPER, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes and logistic discriminant classifiers. The effect of the imputation on the classifiers is compared with that of the mean/mode and hot deck imputation methods. The results demonstrate that when missing data imputation is performed using the proposed hybrid method, the classification improves and the robustness to the amount of missing data is increased relative to the mean/mode method for data missing completely at random (MCAR) missing at random (MAR), and not missing at random (NMAR).The imputation performance is similar to or marginally better than that of the hot deck imputation.

Bayesian networks (BNs) have been explored as a tool for various risk management practices, including the risk management of software development projects. However, much of the present research on software risk analysis focuses on finding the correlation between risk factors and project outcome. Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk management. To obtain proper and effective risk control, risk planning should be performed based on risk causality which can provide more risk information for decision making. In this study, we propose a model using BNs with causality constraints (BNCC) for risk analysis of software development projects. Through unrestricted automatic causality learning from 302 collected software project data, we demonstrated that the proposed model can not only discover causalities in accordance with the expert knowledge but also perform better in prediction than other algorithms, such as logistic regression, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and general BNs. This research presents the first causal discovery framework for risk causality analysis of software projects and develops a model using BNCC for application in software project risk management.

J	Karabulut, M				Karabulut, Mustafa			Fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm in text categorization on top of geometric particle swarm optimization term selection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy rule; Geometric particle swarm optimization; Text categorization; Information gain; Multi-label text categorization; Feature selection	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; WORD	Rapid growth of digital information requires automated handling and organization of documents. The two main stages in automated document categorization are (i) term reduction and (ii) classification. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage term reduction strategy based on Information Gain (IG) theory and Geometric Particle Swarm Optimization (GPSO) search. We evaluate performance of the proposed term reduction approach with use of a new classifier, fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm (FURIA) to categorize multi-label texts. In order to evaluate the performance of FURIA quantitatively, we compared it against two widely used algorithms, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Text Categorization (TC) performance of the proposed term reduction strategy is validated with use of Reuters-21578 and OHSUMED text collection datasets. The experimental results show that performance of the proposed term reduction method is efficient for document organization tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, CQ; Li, HW				Li, Chaoqun; Li, Hongwei			Bayesian network classifiers for probability-based metrics	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Bayesian network classifiers; probability-based metrics; class probability estimation; classification; data mining	ONE-DEPENDENCE ESTIMATORS; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; NAIVE BAYES	A large number of distance metrics have been proposed to measure the difference of two instances. Among these metrics, Short and Fukunaga metric (SFM) and minimum risk metric (MRM) are two probability-based metrics which are widely used to find reasonable distance between each pair of instances with nominal attributes only. For simplicity, existing works use naive Bayesian (NB) classifiers to estimate class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM. However, it has been proved that the ability of NB classifiers to class probability estimation is poor. In order to scale up the classification performance of NB classifiers, many augmented NB classifiers are proposed. In this paper, we study the class probability estimation performance of these augmented NB classifiers and then use them to estimate the class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM. The experimental results based on a large number of University of California, Irvine (UCI) data-sets show that using these augmented NB classifiers to estimate the class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM can significantly enhance their generalisation ability.

Poses in video frames are described by the proposed extensive pyramidal features (EPFs), which include the Gabor, Gaussian, and wavelet pyramids. These features are able to encode the orientation, intensity, and contour information and therefore provide an informative representation of human poses. Due to the fact that not all poses in a sequence are discriminative and representative, we further utilize the AdaBoost algorithm to learn a subset of discriminative poses. Given the boosted poses for each video sequence, a new classifier named weighted local naive Bayes nearest neighbor is proposed for the final action classification, which is demonstrated to be more accurate and robust than other classifiers, e.g., support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes nearest neighbor. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the KTH data set, the Weizmann data set, the multiview IXMAS data set, and the challenging HMDB51 data set. Experimental results manifest that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of recognition rate.

The ECG signal is a P-QRS-T wave representing the cardiac function. The minute variations in the durations and amplitude of these waves cannot be easily deciphered by the naked eye. Hence, there is a need for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of cardiac healthcare. The current paper presents a methodology for ECG based pattern analysis of normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AF) beats. The denoised and registered ECG beats were subjected to independent component analysis (ICA) for data reduction. The weights of ICA were used as features for classification using Naive Bayes and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifiers. The performance and the upper bound on probability of error in classification were analyzed using Chernoff and Bhattacharyya bounds. The Naive Bayes classifier provided an average sensitivity of 99.32%, specificity of 99.33% and accuracy of 99.33%, while the GMM provided an average sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99% and accuracy of 99.42%. The probability of error during classification was less for GMM compared to Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) as GMM provided higher performance than the NBC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Planet, S; Iriondo, I				Planet, Santiago; Iriondo, Ignasi			Children's Emotion Recognition from Spontaneous Speech Using a Reduced Set of Acoustic and Linguistic Features	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Spontaneous speech; Acoustic and linguistic features; Feature selection; Feature-level fusion; Speaker-independent		The aim of this article is to classify children's affective states in a real-life non-prototypical emotion recognition scenario. The framework is the same as that proposed in the Interspeech 2009 Emotion Challenge. We used a large set of acoustic features and five linguistic parameters based on the concept of emotional salience. Features were extracted from the spontaneous speech recordings of the FAU Aibo Corpus and their transcriptions. We used a wrapper method to reduce the acoustic set of features from 384 to 28 elements and feature-level fusion to merge them with the set of linguistic parameters. We studied three classification approaches: a Naive-Bayes classifier, a support vector machine and a logistic model tree. Results show that the linguistic features improve the performances of the classifiers that use only acoustic datasets. Additionally, merging the linguistic features with the reduced acoustic set is more effective than working with the full dataset. The best classifier performance is achieved with the logistic model tree and the reduced set of acoustic and linguistic features, which improves the performance obtained with the full dataset by 4.15 % absolute (10.14 % relative) and improves the performance of the Naive-Bayes classifier by 9.91 % absolute (28.18 % relative). For the same conditions proposed in the Emotion Challenge, this simple scheme slightly improves a much more complex structure involving seven classifiers and a larger number of features.

J	Qin, ZC; Wan, T				Qin, Zengchang; Wan, Tao			Hybrid Bayesian estimation tree learning with discrete and fuzzy labels	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						fuzzy labels; label semantics; random set; probability estimation tree; mass assignment; linguistic decision tree; naive Bayes	DECISION TREE; INDUCTION; FRAMEWORK; SEMANTICS	Classical decision tree model is one of the classical machine learning models for its simplicity and effectiveness in applications. However, compared to the DT model, probability estimation trees (PETs) give a better estimation on class probability. In order to get a good probability estimation, we usually need large trees which are not desirable with respect to model transparency. Linguistic decision tree (LDT) is a PET model based on label semantics. Fuzzy labels are used for building the tree and each branch is associated with a probability distribution over classes. If there is no overlap between neighboring fuzzy labels, these fuzzy labels then become discrete labels and a LDT with discrete labels becomes a special case of the PET model. In this paper, two hybrid models by combining the naive Bayes classifier and PETs are proposed in order to build a model with good performance without losing too much transparency. The first model uses naive Bayes estimation given a PET, and the second model uses a set of small-sized PETs as estimators by assuming the independence between these trees. Empirical studies on discrete and fuzzy labels show that the first model outperforms the PET model at shallow depth, and the second model is equivalent to the naive Bayes and PET.

J	Shekofteh, Y; Almasganj, F				Shekofteh, Yasser; Almasganj, Farshad			Autoregressive modeling of speech trajectory transformed to the reconstructed phase space for ASR purposes	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Speech recognition system; Signal embedding; Reconstructed phase space; Multivariate autoregressive model	RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS	Investigating new effective feature extraction methods applied to the speech signal is an important approach to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Owing to the fact that the reconstructed phase space (RPS) is a proper field for true detection of signal dynamics, in this paper we propose a new method for feature extraction from the trajectory of the speech signal in the RPS. This method is based upon modeling the speech trajectory using the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) method. Moreover, in the following, we benefit from linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimension reduction. The LDA technique is utilized to simultaneously decorrelate and reduce the dimension of the, final feature set. Experimental results show that the MVAR of order 6 is appropriate for modeling the trajectory of speech signals in the RPS. In this study recognition experiments are conducted with an HMM-based continuous speech recognition system and a naive Bayes isolated phoneme classifier on the Persian FARSDAT and American English TIMIT corpora to compare the proposed features to some older RPS-based and traditional spectral-based MFCC features.

It often performs surprisingly well in many real world applications, despite the strong assumption that all features are conditionally independent given the class. In the learning process of this classifier with the known structure, class probabilities and conditional probabilities are calculated using training data, and then values of these probabilities are used to classify new observations. In this paper, we introduce three novel optimization models for the naive Bayes classifier where both class probabilities and conditional probabilities are considered as variables. The values of these variables are found by solving the corresponding optimization problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on several real world binary classification data sets, where continuous features are discretized by applying three different methods. The performances of these models are compared with the naive Bayes classifier, tree augmented naive Bayes, the SVM, C4.5 and the nearest neighbor classifier. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed models can significantly improve the performance of the naive Bayes classifier, yet at the same time maintain its simple structure.

J	Thomas, A; Oommen, BJ				Thomas, A.; Oommen, B. John			Order statistics-based parametric classification for multi-dimensional distributions	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Classification using Order Statistics (OS); Moments of OS; Multi-dimensional OS-based classification		Traditionally, in the field of Pattern Recognition (PR), the moments of the class-conditional densities of the respective classes have been used to perform classification. However, the use of phenomena that utilized the properties of the Order Statistics (OS) were not reported. Recently, in [10,8], we proposed a new paradigm named CMOS, Classification by the Moments of Order Statistics, which specifically used these quantifiers. It is fascinating that CMOS is essentially "anti"-Bayesian in its nature because the classification is performed in a counter-intuitive manner, i.e., by comparing the testing sample to a few samples distant from the mean, as opposed to the Bayesian approach in which the task is based on the central points of the distributions. In our initial works, we proposed the foundational theory of CMOS for the uni-dimensional Uniform and some other distributions. These results were extended for various symmetric and asymmetric uni-dimensional distributions within the exponential family in [8]. In this paper, we generalize these results for multi-dimensional distributions. The multi-dimensional generalization is particularly non-trivial because there is no well-established method for achieving the ordering of multi-dimensional data specified in terms of its uni-dimensional components. The strategy is analogous to a Naive-Bayes' approach, although it really is of an anti-Naive-Bayes' paradigm. We provide here the analytical and experimental results for the 2-dimensional Uniform, Doubly Exponential and Gaussian distributions, and also clearly specify the way by which one should extend the results for higher dimensions. The analogous results for the other distributions in the exponential family, which were discussed in [10,8] are alluded to, but omitted to avoid repetition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The behavior models are not based on assumptions of perfect rationality. Instead, a novel descriptive approach based on naive Bayes' rules is proposed and demonstrated. The en route diversion model is first estimated with behavior data from a driving simulator. Subsequently, the model is recalibrated for Maryland, based on Bluetooth detector data, and applied to analyze two dynamic message sign scenarios on I-95 and I-895. This calibration method allows researchers and practitioners to transfer the en route diversion model to other regions based on local observations. Future research can integrate this en route diversion model with microscopic traffic simulators, dynamic traffic assignment models, and/or activity-based/agent-based travel demand models for various traffic operations and transportation planning applications.
