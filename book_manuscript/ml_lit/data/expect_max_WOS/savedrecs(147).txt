The aim of this study was to compare the subtraction images for cerebral SPECT reconstructed either with FBP or with a 3D iterative reconstruction method (OSEM-3D). Materials and methods: After optimisation of the reconstruction parameters on phantom, the subtraction SPECT images, which were obtained with FBP or with OSEM-3D and coregistered with MRI images, were analyzed in 15 patients with refractory temporal epilepsy. Results: On phantom and with the constrain of high enough spatial resolution (full width at half of maximum for a punctual source less or equal to 11 mm) were reached using: (i) a Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.4 Nyquist at order 6 for FBP and (ii) iterations, 16 subsets and a 9 mm gaussian filter for OSEM-3D. On the subtraction images, which were obtained with these parameters, the temporal foci from patients were smaller with OSEM-3D than with FBP (11 +/- 6 cm(3) versus 17 +/- 10 cm(3), P = mean voxel activities were equivalent between the two methods within temporal foci (6.30 +/- 3.13 counts versus 6.34 +/- 4.93 counts) these activities were dramatically reduced by OSEM-3D within background regions (0.02 +/- 0.02 counts versus 0.19 +/- 0.12 P < 0.001). Conclusion: For the ictal-interictal subtraction SPECT images, which are obtained in patients with refractory temporal epilepsy, the use optimized OSEM-3D method leads to dramatically reduce the volume of temporal foci, as well as the background noise level, two properties are likely to facilitate the detection and localisation of epilepsy foci.

Maximum likelihood estimates of mean and variance of occupation radiation doses subjected to minimum detection levels	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article							CENSORED NORMAL SAMPLE; DETECTION LIMITS; EXPOSURE	Data collection and its analysis in the field of nuclear safety is an important task in the sense that it powers the improvement of safety as well as reliability of the plant. Thus, occupational exposure data analysis is presented to measure the safety or reliability of radiation protection of a given facility. It also is required as a basic input in making decisions on radiation protection regulations and recommendations. A common practice in radiation protection is to record a zero for observation below minimum detection limit (MDL) doses, which leads to an underestimation of true doses and overestimation of the dose-response relationship. Exposure data (both external and internal) are collected by monitoring each individual and this kind of monitoring generally is graded as low-level monitoring. So, in such low-level monitoring, the occurrence of exposure below MDL invites statistical complications for estimating mean and variance because the data are generally censored, i.e observations below MDL are marked. In Type I censoring, the point of censoring (e.g. the detection limit) is 'fixed' a priori for all observations and the number of the censored observations varies. In Type II censoring, the number of censored observations is fixed a priori, and the point of censoring vary. The methodology generally followed in estimating mean and variance with these censored data was the replacement of missing dose by half the MDL. In this paper, authors have used the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach for the estimation of mean and standard deviation. A computer code BDLCENSOR has been developed in which all these MLE-based advanced algorithms are implemented. In addition to the MLE-based method, an expectation maximisation algorithm has also been implemented. The code is written using Visual BASIC 6.0. The paper describes the details of the algorithms adopted for handling such censored data to estimate bias free mean and standard deviation.

J	Zhang, Y; Xu, W				Zhang, Yi; Xu, Wei			Fast exact maximum likelihood estimation for mixture of language model	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information retrieval; language models; mixture model		Language modeling is an effective and theoretically attractive probabilistic framework for text information retrieval. The basic idea of this approach is to estimate a language model of a given document (or document set), and then do retrieval or classification based on this model. A common language modeling approach assumes the data D is generated from a mixture of several language models. The core problem is to find the maximum likelihood estimation of one language model mixture, given the fixed mixture weights and the other language model mixture. The EM algorithm is usually used to find the solution. In this paper, we proof that an exact maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown mixture component exists and can be calculated using the new algorithm we proposed. We further improve the algorithm and provide an efficient algorithm of O(k) complexity to find the exact solution, where k is the number of words occurring at least once in data D. Furthermore, we proof the probabilities of many words are exactly zeros, and the MLE estimation is implemented as a feature selection technique explicitly. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a bivariate Markov chain {(X-t , N-t), t >= 0}, the values of the variable X-t are nodes of a binomial-like tree of order d, where the ith child has i children of its own. We demonstrate that it suffices to solve d quadratic matrix equations to yield the steady state vector, the form of which is matrix geometric. We apply this framework to analyze the multilevel feedback scheduling discipline, which forms an essential part in contemporary operating systems.

Starting from this algorithm, we coarsely group the homogeneous blocks into the known texture classes by the Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering algorithm. Then we refinedly determine the heterogeneous blocks classification by AIGMMN. The new algorithm incorporates Expectation-maximization (EM) with the ideas of the Artificial immune clonal selection (AICS), which can get a global optimal value and overcome the local maximum problems associated with the traditional EM algorithm. Moreover, the new algorithm is capable of determining the optimal number of components automatically in each subnet mixture model, which can approximate the non-gaussian multimodal densities distribution. We compare the proposed method with two common mixture-based segmentation methods for both synthetic and natural texture images, and achieve an overall improvement in performance.

Since ignoring the missing information usually cause bias and inefficiency, an algorithm for estimating parameters is proposed based on the likelihood function of which the missing information is taken account. A binomial response and normal exploratory model for the missing data are assumed. We fit the model using the Monte Carlo EM (Expectation and Maximization) algorithm. The E-step is derived by Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate a sample for missing data, and the M-step is done by Newton-Raphson to maximize the likelihood function. Asymptotic variances and the standard errors of the MLE (maximum likelihood estimates) of parameters are derived using the observed Fisher information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An integer-coded evolutionary approach for mixture maximum likelihood clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						clustering; mixture maximum likelihood; evolutionary algorithms; genetic algorithms	EM ALGORITHM; STRATEGIES	This paper outlines an algorithm for solving the maximum mixture likelihood clustering problem using an integer-coded genetic algorithm (IGA-ML) where a fixed length chromosome encodes the object-to-cluster assignment. The main advantage of the outlined algorithm (IGA-ML) compared with other known algorithms, such as the k-means technique, is that it can successfully discover the correct number of clusters, in addition to carrying out the partitioning process. The algorithm implements a post-fixing sorting mechanism that drastically reduces the searched solution space by eliminating duplicate solutions that appear after applying the genetic operations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm especially with the case of overlapping clusters. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MME is a modular neural network architecture for supervised learning. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was used for training the MME so that the learning process is decoupled in a manner that fits well with the modular structure. In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by spectral analysis methods (fast Fourier transform and model-based methods) and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. In order to discriminate the Doppler ultrasound signals, the ability of designed and trained MME network structure combined with spectral analysis methods was explored. The MME achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the mixture of experts (ME) and feedforward neural network models (multilayer perceptron neural network-MLPNN). The proposed MME approach can be useful in classifying the Doppler ultrasound signals for early detection of arterial diseases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In practice, covariates in NLME models may contain missing data, and the missing data may be nonignorable. Likelihood inference for NLME models with missing covariates can be computationally very intensive. We propose a computationally much more efficient approximate method for NLME models with nonignorably missing covariates. We illustrate the method using a real data example. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Biological systems as a whole are not just the sum of their components, rather ever-changing, complex and dynamic systems over time in response to internal and external perturbation. In the past, biologists have mainly focused on studying either functions of isolated genes or steady-states of small biological pathways. However, it is systems dynamics that play an essential role in giving rise to cellular function/dysfunction which cause diseases, such as growth, differentiation, division and apoptosis. Biological phenomena of the entire organism are not only determined by steady-state characteristics of the biological systems, but also by intrinsic dynamic properties of biological systems, including stability, transient-response, and controllability, which determine how the systems maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal and external perturbations. As a proof of principle, we examine signal transduction pathways and genetic regulatory pathways as biological systems. We employ widely used state-space equations in systems science to model biological systems, and use expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms and Kalman filter to estimate the parameters in the models. We apply the developed state-space models to human fibroblasts obtained from the autoimmune fibrosing disease, scleroderma, and then perform dynamic analysis of partial TGF-beta pathway in both normal and scleroderma fibroblasts stimulated by silica. We find that TGF-beta pathway under perturbation of silica shows significant differences in dynamic properties between normal and scleroderma fibroblasts. Our findings may open a new avenue in exploring the functions of cells and mechanism operative in disease development.

Statistical approach to unsupervised defect detection and multiscale localization in two-texture images	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Machine Vision Applications in Industrial Inspection XV	JAN 29-30, 2007	San Jose, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		defect detection; Gaussian mixture models; Expectation-Maximization; multiscale localization; fabric stain detection	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SEGMENTATION; INSPECTION; VISION; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	We present a novel statistical approach to unsupervised detection and localization of a chromatic defect in a uniformly textured background. The test images are probabilistically modeled using Gaussian mixture models, and consequently defect detection is posed as a model-order selection problem. The statistical model is estimated using a modified Expectation - Maximization algorithm that aids in faster convergence of the scheme. A test image is segmented only if a defective region/blob has been declared to be present, and this improves the efficiency of the entire scheme. This work places equal emphasis on defect localization; hence, an elaborate statistical multiscale analysis is performed to accurately localize the defect in the image. The underlying idea behind the multiscale, approach is that segmented structures should be stable across a wide range of scales. The efficacy of the proposed approach is successfully demonstrated on a large dataset of stained fabric images. The overall detection rate of the system is found to be 92% with a specificity of 95%. All of these factors make the proposed approach attractive for implementation in online industrial applications. (c) 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

Theoretically, increases in the likelihood function are guaranteed as the algorithm iteratively improves upon previously derived parameter estimates. The algorithm is considered to converge when all parameter estimates become stable and no further improvements can be made to the likelihood value. However, to reduce computational time, it is often common practice for the algorithm to he stopped before complete convergence using heuristic approaches. In this paper, we consider various stopping criteria and evaluate their effect on fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to patient length of stay (LOS) date. Although the GMM can be successfully fitted to positively skewed data such as LOS, the fitting procedure often requires many iterations of the EM algorithm. To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the effect of different stopping criteria on fitting GMMs to skewed distributions. Hence, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of various stopping criteria in order to select and justify their use within a patient spell classification methodology. Results illustrate that criteria based on the difference in the likelihood value and on the GMM parameters may not always be a good indicator for stopping the algorithm. In fact we show that the values of the difference in the variance parameters should be used instead, as these parameters are the last to stabilise. In addition, we also specify threshold values for the other stopping criteria.

Capacity analysis of MIMO system over Nakagami-m fading channels using Finite Mixture with Expectation Maximization algorithm	2008 IEEE/ACS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-3	International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA-08)	MAR 31-APR 04, 2008	Doha, QATAR	IEEE, ACS				The capacity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system over wireless channels has been investigated analytically and by simulation over different types of wireless fading channels, such as Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels. In this paper, Finite Mixture (FM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to derive simple approximate expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the capacity distribution over Nakagami-m fading channels. This approximation converts the complicated capacity distribution to a simple weighted sum of univariate normal distributions with appropriate weighting coefficients, means, and variances for a predefined system model and channel statistics. The resultant approximation simplified the mathematical analysis of the average capacity and the outage capacity in terms of well known Q-functions.

On HIV prevalence and AIDS deaths in India	CURRENT THEMES IN ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES	AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS 2007)	OCT 24-26, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Int Assoc Engineers		HIV prevalence; AIDS deaths; E-M algorithm; gamma curves; India		The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of India had estimated, before this year, that there were 5.134 million HIV positive people in India at the end of 2004 and that they were increasing at the rate of more than a quarter of a million people every year. In a recent publication, we estimated that, if the number of reported AIDS cases in India are only 50% efficient i.e. if the number of actual AIDS cases in India is no more than twice the reported number, then the number of HIV positive people in India should have been no more than 2.5 million at the end of 2004. Many other people in the epidemiology community have the same point of view. Now, the government of India is also of the same view and "The latest data released by the government shows that the country has around 2 to 3 million people with HIV, much lower than last year's figure of 5.7 million". However, our assumption that the actual number of AIDS cases in India is only about twice the number reported, has been questioned, and it has been suggested that the Indian system of AIDS reporting is woefully inaccurate and the actual number of AIDS cases there could be three, four or even five times the reported number. In this paper, we consider this suggestion and show that, even if the actual number of AIDS cases was three, four, or even five, times the reported number, the number of HIV positive people in India, at the end of 2004, should still be no more than 2.5 million. This is because our previous estimate was an over estimate and had room to accommodate considerably more number of AIDS cases. We also estimate the number of AIDS deaths in India and show that it should be considerably less than those estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The change in fluorescence between normal and progression to cancer allows to see early cancer and precancerous lesions often missed by white light. Aim: To improve by computer image processing the sensitivity of fluorescence images obtained during examination of skin, oral cavity, vulva and cervix lesions, during endoscopy, cystoscopy and bronchoscopy using Xillix ONCOLIFE. Methods: Function of image f(x.y):R-2 -> R-3 was transformed from original color space RGB to space in which vector of 46 values refers to every point labeled by defined xy-coordinates-f(xy):R-2 -> R-46. By means of Fisher discriminator vector of attributes of concrete point analalyzed in the image was reduced according to two defined classes defined as pathologic areas (foreground) and healthy areas (background). As a result the highest four fisher's coefficients allowing the greatest separation between points of pathologic (foreground) and healthy (background) areas were chosen. In this way new function f(x,y):R-2 -> R-4 was created in which point x,y corresponds with vector Y, H, a*, C-2. In the second step using Gaussian Mixtures and Expectation-Maximisation appropriate classificator was constructed. This classificator enables determination of probability that the selected pixel of analyzed image is a pathologically changed point (foreground) or healthy one (background). Obtained map of probability distribution was presented by means of pseudocolors. Results: Image processing techniques improve the sensitivity, quality and sharpness of original fluorescence images. Conclusion: Computer image processing enables better visualization of suspected areas examined by means of fluorescence diagnostics.

In this work we propose a new probability density function, called the II-sigmoid, from its ability to form the shape of the letter "II" by appropriately combining two sigmoid functions. We demonstrate its modeling properties and the different shapes that can take for particular values of its parameters. We then present the II-sigmoid mixture model and propose a maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate the parameters of such a mixture model using the Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm. We assess the performance of the proposed method using synthetic datasets and also on image segmentation and illustrate its superiority over Gaussian mixture models.

Also this study aims to compare 3D OSEM, with filtered back projection (FBP) with an optimized set of filter parameters, both with and without attenuation correction (AC). The SPECT images of a Jaszczak phantom filled with uniform (99m)Tc solution, and capillary line sources with (99m)Tc were acquired using a Siemens e-Cam Dual Head Gamma Camera. Three noise levels were achieved by acquiring the SPECT images of the Jaszczak phantom for 30, 20 and 10 seconds per projection angle. As expected, noise increases with increasing number of iterations. There is a significant increase in contrast with increasing number of subsets and iterations. In terms of noise, results have shown that 3D OSEM was significantly better than FBP for low count statistics Without AC, there was no significant difference between FBP and 3D OSEM., The key results of the present study arc that improved spatial resolution was achieved using 3D OSEM. and constant resolution was obtained after 17 and 22 iterations in the centre and periphery of the FOV respectively. Furthermore, applying AC with 3D OSEM results in an improved image contrast in comparison to FBP.	[Alzimami, K.; Spryou, N.

In the presence of drift, selections must be constantly revised, calling for adaptive variable selection schemes. An important and novel problem arises front the fact that non-selected variables become missing variables, which induces bias upon subsequent decisions. Here, we consider adaptive variable selection in the context of linear regression, using only a fraction of the available regressors per timepoint. We suggest a scheme that fits a multivariate Gaussian over a sliding window using the EM algorithm and selects which variables to observe next using the Lasso algorithm. We experiment with simulated and real data to demonstrate that very high prediction accuracy may be retained using as little as 10% of the data.

However, there are only a few techniques to infer such models. One of these techniques is the grammatical inference and alignments for transducer inference (GIATI) technique that has proven to be very adequate for speech translation, text-input machine translation, or computer-assisted translation. GIATI is a heuristic technique that requires segmented training data (i.e., the input sentences and the output sentences must be segmented with the restriction that the input segments and the output segments must be monotone aligned). For the purpose of obtaining segmented training data, pure statistical word-alignment models are used. This technique is revisited in this article. The main goal is to formally derive the complete GIATI technique using classical expectation-maximization statistical estimation procedure. This new approach allows us to avoid a hard dependence on heuristic "external" statistical techniques (statistical alignments and n-grams). A first set of experimental results obtained in a machine-translation task are also reported to initially validate this new version of the inference technique of finite-state transducers.

We have taken the approach of using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the image intensity distribution of a selected 3D region that completely covers the tumor, called the "analysis region". The modeling is performed with a predetermined number of Gaussian classes and results in a classification of every voxel into one of these classes. The classes are then grouped together to obtain the tumor volume. The only user interaction required is the selection of the "analysis region" and then the algorithm proceeds automatically to initialize the parameters of the different classes and finds the maximum likelihood estimate with expectation maximization. We used 13 clinical and 19 phantom cases to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the segmentation. Reproducibility was within 10% of the average tumor volume estimate and accuracy was 35% of the true tumor volume and better when compared to two other proposed techniques. The GMM segmentation is extremely user friendly with good precision and accuracy. It has shown great potential to be used in the clinical environment.

The environment of a robot is captured on a sphere. The three dimensional scenes at two different points in the space are related by a transformation from the special Euclidean motion group which is the semi-direct product of the rotation and the translation groups. The motion of the robot is recovered by iteratively estimating the rotation and the translation in an Expectation-Maximization fashion.

These algorithms are based on particle approximation versions of the EM algorithm. We consider two different methods which differ in the way the posterior distribution of the symbols is computed. The first algorithm is based on a novel particle approximation method of the fixed-interval smoothing whereas the second uses fixed lag smoothing. We compare the two algorithms in a Monte-Carlo experiment; these two methods perform significantly better than the EMVA algorithm, which is considered as the state of the art in this area.

It is necessary to perform an evaluation of parameters that are required for image reconstruction based on the measured data.

About a decade ago a new SAGE algorithm was developed and soon it began to be used in image reconstruction. Principles and examples of these algorithms as well as of PET are described in this paper.

Almost all the reported applications are focused on modeling points (fixed length vectors); a different but crucial scenario, where the employment of the GG has received little attention, is the modeling of sequential data, i.e. variable length vectors. This paper explores this last direction, describing a variant of the well known Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where the emission probability function of each state is represented by a GG. A training strategy based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is presented. Different experiments using both synthetic and real data (EEG signal classification and face recognition) show the suitability of the proposed approach compared with the standard Gaussian HMM.

The contribution of this work is the introduction of a smoothing prior over component regression coefficients through a Bayesian framework. This is done by using an appropriate Student-t distribution. The advantages of the sparsity-favouring prior is to make model more robust, less independent on order p of polynomials and improve the clustering procedure. The whole framework is converted into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where the known EM algorithm can be applied offering update equations for the model parameters in closed forms. The efficiency of the proposed sparse mixture model is experimentally shown by applying it on various real benchmarks and by comparing it with the typical regression mixture and the K-means algorithm. The results are very promising.

The generalized aspect comes from the use of the probability density function (pdf) estimation coming from the Pearson system. The bootstrap sample is constructed by randomly selecting a small representative set of pixels from the original image. The application of the Bootstrapped Generalized Mixture Expectation Maximization algorithm BGMEM led us to define a new empirical criterion of representativity of the sample. We give some simulation results for the determination of the empirical criterion. We validate our criterion by the application of the algorithm to the problem of unsupervised image classification.

The developed iterative approach is derived from the Classification Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm [5], in which the parametric modelling of the mixture density is replaced by a non parametric modelling using local kernels, and posterior probabilities account for the coherence of current clusters through the measure of class-conditional entropies. Applications of this method to synthetic and real data including multispectral imagery are presented. Our algorithm is compared with other recent unsupervised approaches, and we show experimentally that it provides a more reliable estimation of the number of clusters while giving slightly better average rates of correct classification.

In a previous paper [1], we described a method for segmenting MR which is based on EM algorithm and a deformable level-set model. However, this method was not fully automatic. In this paper, we present an automated approach guided by digital anatomical atlas, which is an additional source of prior information. Our fully automatic method segments white matter, grey matter and cerebrospinal-fluid. The paper describes the main stages of the method, and presents preliminary results which are very encouraging for clinical practice.

It is based on statistical classification, differential geometry, and multiresolution representation. The Expectation Maximization algorithm and k-means clustering are applied to generate an initial mask of tissue classes of data volume. Then, a hierarchical multiresolution representation is applied to simplify processing. The idea is that the low-resolution description is used to determine constraints for the segmentation at the higher resolutions. Our contribution is the design of a pipeline procedure for brain characterization/labeling by using discrete curvature and multiresolution representation. We have tested our method on several MRI data.

Numerous applications requiring aggregation of models from various sources, or index structures over sets of mixture models for fast access, may benefit from the technique. Variational Bayesian estimation of mixtures is known to be a powerful technique on punctual data. We derive herein a new version of the Variational-Bayes EM algorithm that operates on Gaussian components of a given mixture and suppresses redundancy, if any, while preserving structure of the underlying generative process. A main feature of the present scheme is that it merely resorts to the parameters of the original mixture, ensuring low computational cost. Experimental results are reported on real data.

However, the stations currently in service suffer from numerous false positive detections (due to wind noise) of impulse events and often miss many events of interest. To improve the accuracy of military impulse noise monitoring, an algorithm based upon a Bayesian classifier with inputs of conventional and custom acoustic metrics is proposed. To train and evaluate the noise classifier approximately 1,000 waveforms were field collected. The final Bayesian noise classifier used kurtosis and crest factor and, the frequency domain metrics, spectral slope and weighted square error as inputs. The EM algorithm is utilized to fit multi-Gaussian distributions to the different classes of data. In testing the classifier performed to accuracies of up to 99.6%.

It tends to be numerically stable, reduces execution time compared to other estimation procedures and is easy to implement in latent class models. However, the EM algorithm fails to provide a consistent estimator of the standard errors of maximum likelihood estimates in incomplete data applications. Correct standard errors can be obtained by numerical differentiation. The technique requires computation of a complete-data gradient vector and Hessian matrix, but not those associated with the incomplete data likelihood. Obtaining first and second derivatives numerically is computationally very intensive and execution time may become very expensive when fitting Latent class models using a Newton-type algorithm. When the execution time is too high one is motivated to use the EM algorithm solution to initialize the Newton Raphson algorithm. We also investigate the effect on the execution time when a final Newton-Raphson step follows the EM algorithm after convergence. In this paper we compare the standard errors provided by the EM and Newton-Raphson algorithms for two models and analyze how this bias is affected by the number of parameters in the model fit.

The method partitions an image into a set of overlapping patches, and assumes that the image patches are random,, variables described by a GMM. The distribution parameters of the noise free image patches are estimated from the noisy parameters which are calculated by expectation maximization (EM). Minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation technique is used to estimate the clean image patches. The experimental results show that new method can effectively suppress additive noise and preserve details of image signal.

Given a set of sequences and a similarity measure defined on pairs of sequences, we learn a mixture of experts model by using spectral clustering to learn the hierarchical structure of the model and by using bayesian approaches to combine the predictions of the experts. We evaluate our approach on two important biological sequence labeling problems: RNA-protein and DNA-protein interface prediction problems. The results of our experiments show that global sequence similarity can be exploited to improve the per formance of classifiers trained to label biological sequence data.

Carevic, "Automatic estimation of multiple target positions and velocities using passive TDOA measurements of transients," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 55, no. 2, pp. 424-436, 2007] for the estimation of the motion parameters of multiple targets moving in cluttered three-dimensional (3-D) underwater environments. In many situations, the number of targets in the measurements batch is not known, and the MDAEM algorithm is run for an inexact (guessed) number of the motion models, where, usually, the guessed number of models is larger than the true number of targets. This correspondence describes a detection procedure that determines which of the motion models estimated by the algorithm are related to the true targets in the measurements batch.

The algorithm exploits the inherent multiscale data structure of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to individually decompose each input image into six directional subbands at each scale. Such representation is to facilitate better change detection. The difference resulted from the DT-CWT coefficients of two satellite images taken at two different time instances is analyzed automatically by unsupervised selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the total error probability of change detection, under the assumption that the pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The change maps produced in different subbands are merged by using both inter-and intra-scale information. Furthermore, the proposed technique requires the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged subband coefficients of the two images. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterizes these distributions, an iterative method based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed. For the performance evaluation, the proposed algorithm is exploited for both noise-free and noisy images, and the results show that the proposed method not only provides accurate detection of small changes but also demonstrates attractive robustness against noise interference.

These questions require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents that can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. In this paper, we have experimented with one empirical and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. The feature set includes different kinds of features: lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic. A gradient descent local search technique is used to learn the optimal weights of the features. The effects of the different features are also shown for all the methods of generating summaries.

The hybrid algorithm improves the performance of EM algorithm by using GA, called IEMGA. The main modification is that the randomly neghiborhood local search is changed by genetic algorithm for designing fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers. IEMGA combines the advantages of multiple search, global optimization, and faster convergence. It does not need any gradient information and it is capable of decreasing the computational complexity. Simulation results show that IEMGA has the ability of golbal optimization and faster convergence. In addition, it improve the computation complecity of EM.

At first, an outline has been generated to get the region of interest (ROI) by employing the moving object criterion, which eventually reduces the processing time significantly. In the next step, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to segment the grey scale images into 5 distinct regions. This is done to make them more suitable for further processing and easy to use in the developed software. Finally Level set algorithm added with automatic contour generation module is used for tracking the exact heart boundary to segment it out from the rest of the image. This algorithm gives equally persistent result for both long axis and shot axis cardiac MRI data consisting of a movie (in AVI format) containing 32 separate frames of grayscale images.

We apply this idea in the short time Fourier transform, where most process has the asymptotic stationary property in short time sense. The estimated parameters of the complex Gaussian distribution can be used in the feature extraction or the plug-in hypothesis test for recognition. The problem becomes to estimate the parameters of the complex Gaussian. The windowed short time Fourier coefficients are not simple complex Gaussian but contaminated Gaussian, which means we need to estimate the parameters of mixture Gaussian. The EM-algorithm could estimate the parameters directly but the M-step is still complicate. Recasting the contaminated Gaussian as a finite mixture Gaussian model, we can estimated the mean vector and covariance matrix for each time-frequency bin. Estimate the parameters of a mixture high-dimension joint Gaussian distribution with high accuracy and low computation cost shows a good way to solve the problem of distribution estimation. With the estimated distribution, we can create a statistical model for recognition. This method is examined with a mixture 2 dimension joint Gaussian distribution and the simulation results are discussed with good performance.

Because I distribution can capture the heavy-tailed quality of series of FX returns, the paper introduces the EM algorithm to estimate covariance matrix under multivariate t distribution. And we compare the model with others models using daily data of CAD-USD, GBP-USD, and CHF-USD exchange rate. The result indicates the model using EM algorithm has explicitly iterative formulae and the multivariate GARCH (1,1) model can provide superior estimation of time-varying covariance matrix of FX returns having fat-tailed distributions. However, the model using EM algorithm is simpler and more stable than the multivariate GARCH (1,1) model.

This approach is different from the existing attitude-independent approaches mainly in how the attitude parameters in the attitude sensor measurement model are handled. The attitude-independent approaches rely on a conversion of the body and reference representations of the Earth's magnetic field vector into an attitude-independent scalar observation based on scalar checking. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm essentially maximizes the expectation of the complete likelihood function with respect to the probability distribution of the attitude parameters. Comparisons of the EM algorithm and the attitude-independent approach using simulated magnetometer data are presented.

The first approach is a novel particle filtering based on Bayesian framework, and the seconf one is an approach based on fusion of shape and appearance cues. The shape and appearance based technique involves a layered two pass scheme, where in the first pass-an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to separate infrared images into still background and moving foreground layers. In the second pass: shape cues from the first pass is used to eliminate non-pedestrian moving objects and then appearance cue is used to locate the exact position of pedestrians. Then pedestrians are detected by sequential application of templates of multiple scales. For tracking the pedestrian a graph matching-based algorithm which fuses the shape and appearance information was used. The particle filtering based algorithm on other hand is based on building a scene background model with each pixel represented as a multimodal distribution of colour and thermal images. Then this background model is used to build a particle filter for tracking the pedestrian. The particle filter uses a novel formulation of observation likelihoods The evaluation of the two detection and tracking approaches was done by performing experiments on the thermal and colour dataset from OTCBVS database [1, 2].

Conventional approaches to this problem first attempt to solve the inverse problem to estimate cortical signals and then fit an MVAR model to the estimated signals. Our new approach expresses the measured data in terms of a hidden state equation describing MVAR cortical signal evolution and an observation equation that relates the hidden state to the surface measurements. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to find maximum likelihood estimates of the MVAR model parameters. Simulations show that this one-step approach performs significantly better than the conventional two-step approach at estimating the cortical signals and detecting functional connectivity between different cortical regions.

Such data is a big problem in regression, which retrieve parameters from data. Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation Sample Consensus (MLESAC) are representative researches, which focused on this problem. However, they do not cope with varying data distribution because they need to tune variables according to given data. This paper proposes user-independent parameter estimator, u-MLESAC, which is based on MLESAC. It estimates variables necessary in probabilistic error model through expectation maximization (EM). It also terminates adaptively using failure rate and error tolerance, which can control trade-off between accuracy and running time. Line fitting experiments showed its high accuracy and robustness in varying data distribution. Its results are compared with other estimators. Its application to landmark-based localization also verified its performance compared with other estimator.

Various combinations of Rayleigh, Nakagami, Weibull, and Lognormal distributions are used to form the constituent probability density functions (PDFs) of the FMMs. The FMMs are identified using the Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM) algorithm. Akaike's Information Criterion is used to compare the quality of data fit provided by the FMMs and models containing only one distribution (non-mixtures). The results indicate that UWB channel amplitude statistics are best represented by mixtures of Rayleigh, Lognormal and Weibull PDFs.

Different materials or different phases of a material in a sample lead to different textures in images of that sample. We investigate the application of the expectation-maximization/ maximization of the posterior marginal (EM/MPM) algorithm proposed in [1] for automated texture-based segmentation of these microstructure images. We propose a new method to initialize the parameters used for the observed image under a Gaussian model. In addition, we examine the use of 8-nearest-neighborhood system for segmentation to locate objects edges more precisely. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the EM/MPM algorithm with appropriate choices of model parameters and neighborhood system.

A major challenge for self-calibration techniques is the increased computational burden due to additional perturbation parameters. In this contribution, a novel procedure for array self-calibration is presented. We apply the well known numerical method, the Space Alternating Generalized EM algorithm (SAGE), to simplify the multi-dimensional search procedure required for finding maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods that are based on the small perturbation assumption. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm remain robust in critical scenarios including large sensor position errors and closely located signals.

However, in statistical machine translation (SMT), the use of mixture modelling is currently being explored. Two main advantages of the mixture approach are first, its flexibility to find an appropriate tradeoff between model complexity and the amount of training data available and second, its capability to learn specific probability distributions that better fit subsets of the training dataset. This latter advantage is even more important in SMT, since it is widely accepted that most state-of-the-art translation models proposed have limited application to restricted semantic domains. In this work, we revisit the mixture extension of the well-known M2(1) translation model. The M2 mixture model is evaluated on a word alignment large-scale task obtaining encouraging results that prove the applicability of finite mixture modelling in SMT.

As a neutron beam passes through a fuel cell, it can undergo s-wave scattering. For the dry and wet states of a fuel cell, there are spatially varying neutron attenuation images. Ideally, the difference of these attenuation images is proportional to the water density in the fuel cell. We estimate a non-negative residual attenuation image from joint analysis of the wet and dry state projection data using a penalized likelihood (PL) method with a Huber penalty function that has two adjustable regularization parameters. We also reconstruct using a Filtered Back Projection (FBP) method where we apodize the ramp filter by a window corresponding to a Gaussian kernel with an adjustable standard deviation. We determine the adjustable regularization parameters by a statistical learning method called two-fold cross-validation. We simulate projection data based on Hussey phantom images and neglect beam hardening effects, backgrounds, and model the number of detected photoelectrons as a compound Poisson process. For simulated data, the PL approach yields sharper reconstructions than does the FBP approach.	[Coakley, K. J.; Vecchia, D.

Classical methods, mostly based on the ICP algorithm, are shown to be limited and complicated by an inappropriate parameterization of the problem. First, we show how an adequate parameterization, used in an ICP-like scheme, can lead to a simpler, more accurate and faster algorithm. Then, using this parameterization, we reinterpret the problem in a probabilistic framework, and use the maximum likelihood principle to define the optimal symmetry plane. This problem can be solved efficiently using an EM algorithm. The resulting iterative scheme can be seen as an ICP-like algorithm with multiple matches between the two sides of the object. This new algorithm, implemented using a multiscale, multiresolution approach, is evaluated in terms of accuracy, robustness and speed on ground truth data, and some results on real data are presented.

Each learning sample is assumed to consist in a feature vector and an imprecise and/or uncertain "soft" label m(i) defined as a Dempster-Shafer basic belief assignment over the set of classes. This framework thus generalizes many kinds of learning problems including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Here, it is assumed that the feature vectors are generated from a mixture model. Using the General Bayesian Theorem, we derive a criterion generalizing the likelihood function. A variant of the EM algorithm dedicated to the optimization of this criterion is proposed, allowing us to compute estimates of model parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of this approach to exploit partial information about class labels.

This approach is developed in the segmentation's framework of an image analysis system to automatically detect pleural thickenings. The new technique to carry out the 3D segmentation of lung pleura is based on supervised range-constrained thresholding and a Gibbs-Markov random field model. An initial segmentation is done using the 3D histogram by supervised range-constrained thresholding. 3D connected component labelling is then applied to find the thorax. In order to detect and remove trachea and bronchi therein, the 3D histogram of connected pulmonary organs is modelled as a finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. Parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which leads to the classification of that pulmonary region. As consequence left and right lungs are separated. Finally we apply a Gibbs-Markov random field model to our initial segmentation in order to achieve a high accuracy segmentation of lung pleura. The Gibbs-Markov random field is combined with maximum a posteriori estimation to estimate optimal pleural contours.

While Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are a reasonable choice, the number of components is not easy to determine. A non-parametric technique, based on the transformation and analysis of the D(R) (distortion-rate) curve is proposed for model order identification purposes. This curve is estimated via the popular K-means clustering algorithm. To achieve repeatability and efficiency, various centroid initialization and image down sampling methods are proposed and tested. This technique also provides good starting points for inferring the GMM parameters via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which effectively reduces the segmentation time and the chances of getting trapped in local optima	[Corona, Enrique; Nutter, Brian; Mitra, Sunanda] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA	Corona, E (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

In the case of large project databases with data coming from heterogeneous sources, a single mathematical model cannot properly capture the diverse nature of the projects under consideration. Clustering algorithms can be used to segment the project database, obtaining several segmented models. In this paper, a new toot is presented, Recursive Clustering Tool, which implements the EM algorithm to cluster the projects, and allows use different regression curves to fit the different segmented models. This different approaches will be compared to each other and with respect to the parametric model that is not segmented. The results allows conclude that depending on the arrangement and characteristics of the given clusters, one regression approach or another must be used, and in general, the segmented model improve the unsegmented one.

The aim of this work was to reduce the PVE using a modified iterative expectation maximization (EM) reconstruction algorithm. The goal of the method was to increase the accuracy of tracer concentration values in order to obtain an in vivo better estimate of physiological parameters. The performance of the proposed correction method was evaluated by calculating left ventricle and myocardium mean value using simulated cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) dynamic images.

This enables their application to large-scale multi-feature multinomial classification problems where there is an abundance of training samples, classes and feature spaces. The proposed methods are based on an expectation-maximization (EM)framework employing a multinomial probit likelihood and explicit pruning of non-relevant training samples. We demonstrate the methods on a low-dimensional artificial dataset. We then demonstrate the accuracy and sparsity of the method when applied to the challenging bioinformatics task of predicting protein subcellular localization.

However, there are several physical aspects of fluorescence OPT that pose major challenges for the FBP algorithm. These include blurring, and the fact that for an isotropically emitting point source (or fluorophore), the power received by an objective aperture decreases with the inverse square of the distance to the source. These two effects are shown to result in qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies in fluorescence OPT reconstructions obtained using standard FBP. A model of image formation is developed which includes the effects of isotropic emission and blurring. The model is used to calculate a probabilistic system matrix for use in the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximisation algorithm, which leads to reconstructions that are both qualitatively superior and quantitatively correct.

This paper presents a Non-Data-Aided (NDA) SNR estimation scheme for 32APSK using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Two variants of the EM algorithm are presented, first with an arbitrary initialization and a second version that is initialized by modifying an existing (suboptimal) SNR estimation technique. We demonstrate a significantly faster convergence with the latter form of initialization. We compare the performance of this estimator to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of NDA SNR estimation and show that the estimator performs very close to the CRLB over all SNRs of practical interest even for block sizes of 100 symbols. The estimator has also been implemented on FPGAs and we show that the fixed point implementation also performs very close to the theoretical limit.

SNR often needs to be estimated in the presence of unknown transmitted data symbols in a Non Data Aided (NDA) manner. In this paper we derive a methodology to calculate the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of NDA SNR estimation in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel for any symmetric constellation. In particular, the CRLB is evaluated and presented for QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, 32QAM, 16APSK and 32APSK constellations. We also present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm based iterative estimator, valid for any arbitrary constellation, which performs very close to the CRLBs at all SNRs of practical interest and discuss issues regarding this iterative algorithm such as initialization and convergence speed.

Asynchronous Sensor Registration via Expectation Maximisation	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RADAR, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Radar	SEP 02-05, 2008	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	IEEE			BIAS ESTIMATION	A solution to the problem of sensor bias estimation is presented for a multiple target scenario with asynchronous sensors. Expectation Maximisation is used to decouple the target state and sensor bias estimation problems by treating the target states as missing data. The approach is compared with the EX method, which solves the bias estimation problem by using differences between measurements from different sensors.			samuel.davey@dsto.defence.gov.au; brian.cheung@dsto.defence.gov.au					Davey SJ, 2007, IEEE T ROBOT, V23, P271, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2007.892235; DEMPSTER AP, 1977, J ROY STAT SOC, V140, P1; Li W, 2004, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V40, P824, DOI 10.1109/TAES.2004.1337457; Li Z., 2006, IEEE CAN C EL COMP E, P31; Lin XD, 2004, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V40, P576; Lin XD, 2005, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V41, P899; THRUN S, 1998, AUTON ROBOT, V5, P1; Zia A, 2008, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V56, P921, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2007.907883	8	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-2321-7				2008							594	598				5	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied	Engineering; Physics	BIY71	WOS:000263784000112

Accuracy of inferences in such models depends on the quality of network parameters. Learning reliable parameters of Bayesian networks often requires a large amount of training data, which may be hard to acquire and may contain missing values. On the other hand, qualitative knowledge is available in many computer vision applications, and incorporating such knowledge can improve the accuracy of parameter learning. This paper describes a general framework based on convex optimization to incorporate constraints on parameters with training data to perform Bayesian network parameter estimation. For complete data, a global optimum solution to maximum likelihood estimation is obtained in polynomial time, while for incomplete data, a modified expectation-maximization method is proposed. This framework is applied to real image data from a facial action unit recognition problem and produces results that are similar to those of state-of-the-art methods.

An approach is presented to detect and classify the moving vehicle in static scenes, which is based on GVF-Snake Model and Inertia Ellipse. The difference of two successive traffic-frames was computed,. and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the gray-level distribution of the difference image was constructed, whose parameters were estimated by expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Based on the model, a motion detection operator was introduced to generate a moving vehicle border image. Then, a static vehicle image based on algorithm GVF-Snake, was improved. The energy entry was modified by using the motion border image so that it could be used in video sequences. The image area of the moving vehicle is determined. Finally, the eccentricity of ellipse is calculated and the equivalent of ellipse is formed based on the principal of inertia ellipse of rigid body. All vehicles can be classified into five kinds by fuzzy threshold. As the method is based on statistics, and simple, it can be easily programmed to be applied into the embed system. Experiment results show that it can process 4 road (6 similar to 8 roadway) video signals, and has fast process speed and rate of identifying.

Our approach is based on the geometric characteristics of the cluster of points and in particular in the distribution of the distances between the cluster centers. In the noiseless case the core of the method is conceptually very simple, deterministic, non-iterative and fast. In the noisy case, the core-algorithm must be preceded by a clustering scheme, for example, the EM algorithm in order to identify the centers. The method works directly on the time domain and so no signal transformation is required.

First the theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is extended from emission CT to X-ray scan, then an expectation-maximization (EM) formula is deduced for direct reconstruction of cone-beam CT. EM algorithm is an iterative method that can produce good quality reconstruction, but compared with fast and robust FDK algorithm, EM algorithm is computer intensive and convergence slow. In order to accelerate the convergence speed of EM algorithm, ordered subset (OS) is applied in Cone-beam CT. Experimental results with computer simulated data and real CT data show that OS-EM algorithm can provide good quality reconstructions after only a few iterations. In addition, the point spread function of the OS-EM algorithm is analyzed for evaluating the imaging system performance.

It aims to classify or to cluster (i.e. to find natural groups) patients according to the dynamics of features extracted from their ECG. In this work, the dynamics of the features are modelled with Continuous Density Hidden Semi-Markovian Models (CDHSMM) which are interesting for the characterization of continuous multivariate time series without a priori information. These models can be easily used for classification and clustering. In this last case a specific method, based on a fuzzy Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, is proposed. Both tasks are applied to the analysis of ischemic episodes with encouraging results and a classification accuracy of 71%.

It is established that if the variance estimates and the error covariances are initialized appropriately, the sequence of variance iterates will be monotonically nonincreasing. Under prescribed conditions, the variance estimates will converge to the actual values. An inertial navigation application is discussed in which performance depends on accurately estimating the process variances.

Mine detection in multispectral imagery data using constrained energy minimization	OPTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION XIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Pattern Recognition XIX	MAR 17-18, 2008	Orlando, FL	SPIE		mine detection; constrained energy minimization; morphological operators; stochastic expectation maximization.		Multispectral imagery is used for a wide variety of military and commercial applications, including object detection such as mines. The main reason for using multispectral imagery is that it reveals spectral information about the scene which cannot be obtained from a single spectral band. This paper introduces a new algorithm for mine detection in multispecral imagery using the constrained energy minimization (CEM) approach. The CEM approach is introduced as classifier. The novelty of this idea is that this classifier uses only the information of the mines for training and enabling the potential mines without using information about the clutter in the scene. Using only mines information for detection is a major advantage of the CEM approach. In addition, the CEM approach is modified such that recomputing the autocorrelation matrix is not necessary and using the algorithm became scene independent Then, to reduce the false alarm further, morphological processing and stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm are employed for post-processing. The results of the proposed algorithm were promising when the algorithm is tested using real multispectral imagery.	[Elbakary, M. I.; Alam, M.

The shape prior is derived from a linear combination of vectors of distances between the training boundaries and their common centroid. The appearance prior considers gray levels within each training boundary as a sample of a Markov-Gibbs random field with pairwise interaction. Spatially homogeneous interaction geometry and Gibbs potentials are analytically estimated from the training data. To accurately separate a goal object from an arbitrary background, empirical marginal gray level distributions inside and outside of the boundary are modeled with adaptive linear combinations of discrete Gaussians (LCDG). The evolution of the parametric deformable model is based on solving an Eikonal partial differential equation with a new speed function which combines the prior shape, prior appearance, and current appearance models. Due to the analytical shape and appearance priors and a simple Expectation-Maximization procedure for getting the object and background LCDG, our segmentation is considerably faster than most of the known geometric and parametric models. Experiments with various goal images confirm the robustness, accuracy, and speed of our approach.

It exhibits two important features: Firstly, the proposed framework allows to give an assignment of clusters to the sequences where the b-coloring properties are maintained as long as the clustering process runs. Secondly, it gives each cluster a twofold representation by a generative model (Markov chains) as well as dominant members which ensure the global stability of the returned partition. The proposed framework is evaluated against benchmark datasets in UCl repository and its effectiveness is confirmed.

However, if there is not an appropriate initialization, the iterative computation will stop at initialization trap and lead to improper estimation. In this paper, the moment-EM algorithm is proposed to overcome the problem. It means to compute the moment-estimation of parameter and initialize parameter with moment estimation firstly, and then amend the estimation through EM algorithm. In succession, with the Gaussian filter based on estimated parameter, the paper presents the Rao decision rule of the weak signal with unknown amplitude under Gaussian mixture noise environment. Simulation results indicate that moment-EM algorithm can estimate parameter accurately and the detection performance of Rao test based on moment-EM Algorithm outperforms that of Rao test based on EM Algorithm.

The determination of initial tolerant classes is a challenging and important task for accurate feature selection and classification. In this paper the Expectation-Maximization clustering algorithm is applied to determine similar objects. This method generates fewer features with either a higher or the same accuracy compared with two existing methods, i.e., Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection and Tolerance-based Feature Selection, on a number of benchmarks from the UCI repository.

The Bayesian trees considered here consist of an unconstrained subtree and a set of constrained subtrees. In this tree structure, constraints are imposed on some of the parameters of the parametrized conditional distributions, such that all conditional distributions within the same subtree share the same constraint. We propose a learning method that uses the unconstrained subtree to guide the process of discovering a set of relevant constrained substructures. Substructure discovery and constraint enforcement are simultaneously accomplished using an E.M. algorithm. We show how our tree substructure discovery method can be applied to the problem of learning representative pose models from a set of unsegmented video sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for human motion classification.

In particular, Bayesian networks are one machine learning technique that allows for reasoning with incomplete data, but training such networks on incomplete data may be a difficult task. Many methods were thus proposed to learn Bayesian network structure from incomplete data, based on multiple structure generation and scoring of their adequacy to the dataset. However, this kind of approaches may be time-consuming. Therefore we propose an efficient dependency analysis approach that uses a redefinition of probability calculation to take incomplete records into account while learning BN structure, without generating multiple possibilities. Some experiments on well-known benchmarks are described to show the validity of our proposal.

To speed-up reconstruction time, a hardware projection/backprojection pair has been built following algorithm architecture adequacy principles. Thanks to an original memory access strategy based on an 3D adaptive and predictive memory cache, the external memory wall has been overcome. Thus, for both projector architectures several units run efficiently. Each unit reaches a computational throughput close to 1 operation per cycle. In this paper, we present how from our hardware projection/backprojection pair, an analytic (3D-RP) and an iterative (3D-EM) reconstruction algorithms can be implemented on a System on Programmable Chip (SoPC). First, an hardware/software partitioning is done based on the different steps of each algorithm. Then the reconstruction system is composed of two hardware configurations of the programmable logic resources (FPGA). Each one corresponds mainly to the projection and backprojection step. Our projector/backprojector has been validated with a software 3D-RP and 3D-EM reconstruction on simulated PET-SORTEO data. A reconstruction time evaluation of these reconstruction systems are done based on the measured performances of our projectors IPs and the estimated performances of the additional simple hardware IPs. The expected reconstruction time is compared with the software tomography distribution STIR. A speed-up of 7 can be expected for the 3D-RP algorithm and a speed-up of 3.5 for the 3D-EM algorithm. For both algorithms, the architecture cycle efficiency expected is largely greater than the software implementation 120 times for 3D-RP and 60 times for 3D-EM.

Joint EM channel and covariance estimation with sufficient-statistic chip combining for a SIMO MC-CDMA antijam system	WCNC 2008: IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & NETWORKING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	MAR 31-APR 03, 2008	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE		multicarrier code division multiple access; channel estimation; chip combining; antijamming; expectation maximization; iterative receivers	MULTICARRIER SPREAD-SPECTRUM	Joint iterative channel and covariance estimation with sufficient statistics (SS) based chip combining is studied for a multicarrier code division multiple access (MC CDMA) system operating under partial band noise jamming (PBNJ). The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which exploits the log likelihood ratio (LLR) from the decoder, is employed to estimate the channel impulse response and interference plus noise covariance matrix. The proposed chip combiner guarantees no loss of information in the soft output generated by the demapper. In our approach, the channel estimator or the chip combiner needs only the AWGN plus PBNJ power of each subcarrier to suppress jamming. Therefore, significant complexity reduction is achieved because the receiver does not need to estimate the jammer state information (JSI) and individual variances of AWGN and PBNJ on each subcarrier for chip combining. Simulation results demonstrate that the sufficient statistic chip combiner (SSCC) always provides a smaller bit error rate (BER) than the minimum mean square error (MMSE) chip combiner.

In particular we assume that the data have been generated by a linear factor model with latent variables modeled as gaussian mixtures (thus obtaining dimension reduction) and. we shrink the factor loadings, resorting to a penalized likelihood method, with an L1 penalty (thus realizing automatic variable selection). We derive an EM algorithm to obtain the penalized model estimates and a modified BIC criterion to select the penalization parameter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on simulated data.

However, for the high noise and low contrast degree of infrared images produced by monitoring process, how to remove the noise of images effectively has become the key point of recent research. In this paper, we propose a new insulator infrared image denoising method using significant coefficient rule. In order to incorporate the spatial dependencies into the denoising procedure, HMT model is explored and EM algorithm is proposed to estimate model parameters. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing insulator infrared image denoising methods, the proposed method is not only propitious to keep image edge from damaging and solve the edge blurring problem, but also increasing PSNR of images. In addition, the proposed method also gets a better visual effect.

We also investigate spectral clustering in application to this problem and demonstrate that both methods give rise to similar partitions of the brain based on resting state fMRI data. Second, we demonstrate how to extend this approach to include information about the experimental protocol. Specifically, we formulate a mixture model in the space of possible profiles of brain response to stimuli. In both applications, our methods confirm previously known results in brain mapping and point to new research directions for exploratory analysis of fMRI data.

Identification of Nonlinear State Space Models Using an MLP Network Trained by the EM Algorithm	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1-8	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 01-08, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Identification of nonlinear state space models when no information is available from the state transition or output model has played an important role in the recent research. In this paper, we propose a new approach or modeling a discrete time nonlinear state space system with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used for joint parameter and state estimation of the proposed structure where the particle smoothing algorithm will be applied for estimating hidden states. Because of the non-affine structure of MLP networks compared with some other models such as radial basis functions, the gradient method is used at the M phase of the EM algorithm for parameter and noise estimation. Simulation studies show the superiority and fast convergence of our proposed structure in identification of nonlinear state space models.								ALI A, 2008, 1M IFAC WORLD UNPUB; Anderson B. D.

Therefore, the estimation of several unknown channel amplitudes and taps in a multipath environment is an important approach to mitigate the multipath effects. In professional receivers, viable multipath mitigation approaches are the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, the expectation maximization (EM) approach and the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. However all methods require a high computational complexity when used in spread spectrum systems due to long spreading sequences. Therefore, one contribution of this paper is that we apply sub-space methods to decrease the computational complexity before executing the above iterative estimation algorithms. Further, we assess respective performance of the algorithms and the future Galileo navigation system by using the Galileo receiver analysis and design application (GRANADA) simulator. The complexity reduction algorithms are specifically adjusted to the El Galileo binary offset carrier (BOC) signal, which superimposes data and pilot signals. Moreover, we adapt the complexity reduction so that it can handle any sampling frequency that is not necessarily an integer multiple of the chip rate.

We address the particular instance of parameter learning when tracking motions with a switching state-space model. We present a general algorithm for dealing simultaneously with both unknown fixed model parameters and state variables. Using an Expectation-Maximization approach, we apply a tactic-based multi-model particle filter to estimate the state variables in the E-step, and use particle smoothing to update the parameters in the M-step. We test our algorithm both in simulation and in a team robot soccer environment, as a substrate for applying the learned models to object tracking in a team. One of the soccer robots learns the actuation model of its teammate. The experimental results show that the particle smoothing efficiency is substantially increased and the tracking performance is significantly improved using the learned teammate actuation model.

A background model is built by fusing information from intensity and depth images. While a geometric constraint is employed to improve pixel cluster coherence and reducing the influence of noise, the EM algorithm (Expectation Maximization) is used for tracking moving clusters of pixels significantly different from the background model.

A neighborhood coefficient differential window was used to compute intra-scale correlations of complex wavelet coefficients in high frequency detail subimage,and intra-scale correlational state was identified according to the smallest error rate Bayesian decision-making rules. A HMT was fitted to describe the correlations between the complex wavelet coefficients across decomposition scales and mark inter-scale correlational state. The product results of corresponding positional intra-scale and inter-scale correlational state were looked as a new hidden state transition probability. A set of iterative equations was developed using the expectation-maximization(EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and produce denoising images.

A Statistical Framework for the Registration of 3D Knee Implant Components to Single-Plane X-Ray Images	2008 IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION WORKSHOPS, VOLS 1-3	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 23-28, 2008	Anchorage, AK	IEEE Comp Soc			FLUOROSCOPY	Registration of 3D knee implant components to single-plane X-ray image sequences provides insight into implanted knee kinematics. In this paper a Maximum Likelihood approach is proposed to align the pose-related occluding contour of an object with edge segments extracted from a single-plane X-ray image. This leads to an Expectation Maximization algorithm which simultaneously determines the object's pose, estimates point correspondences and rejects outlier points from the registration process. Considering (nearly) planar-symmetrical objects, the method is extended in order to simultaneously estimate two symmetrical object poses which both align the corresponding occluding contours with 2D edge information. The algorithm's capacity to generate accurate pose estimates and the necessity of determining both symmetrical poses when aligning (nearly) planar-symmetrical objects will be demonstrated in the context of automated registration of knee implant components to simulated and real single-plane X-ray images.

In particular, the TEM algorithm may be used for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based discriminative training. The TEM algorithm has a form similar to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is an efficient iterative procedure to perform maximum likelihood in the presence of hidden variables Ill. The TEM algorithm has been empirically shown to increase a rational objective function. In the concave regions of a rational function, it can be shown that the maximization steps of the TEM algorithm and the hypothesized EM algorithm are identical. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, preliminary experimental results show competitive optimization performance over the conventional discriminative training approaches (in terms of speech and accuracy).

A Comparison of Clustering Fully Polarimetric SAR Images Using SEM Algorithm and G(P)(0) Mixture Model With Different Initializations	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-6	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2008)	DEC 08-11, 2008	Tampa, FL	IEEE			UNSUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a comparison between two types of initializations for multilook polarimetric SAR image segmentation: a random partition and a sample quantile partition. These are the inputs of a srochastic expectation-maximization algorithm that uses a mixture of go distributions to describe the data. The pap rameters are unknown, and estimated by the moments method. The G(P)(0) law is able to describe different type of targets, like urban areas, vegetation and pasture. The experimental results on real PolSAR data are reported, showing that the use of G(P)(0) model with quantile partition inicialization provide good segmentation results with few iterations.

Here we summarize a two-phase project where we first measure the ability of both existing and novel probabilistic message-passing techniques to directly estimate bias and identify backbones for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) Problem. We confirm that methods like Belief Propagation and Survey Propagation-plus Expectation Maximization-based variants-do produce good estimates with distinctive properties. The second phase demonstrates the use of bias estimation within a modern SAT solver, exhibiting a correlation between accurate, stable. estimates and Successful backtracking search. The same process also yields a family of search heuristics that can dramatically improve search efficiency for the hard random problems considered.

Unlike the traditional EM algorithm, NEM has the spatial penalty term incorporated in the objective function. The clustering performance of NEM depends mainly on two factors: the choice of the spatial coefficient, which is used to weigh the penalty term; and the initial state of cluster separation, to which the resultant clustering is sensitive. Existing NEM algorithms usually assign an equal spatial coefficient to every site, regardless of whether this site is in the class interior or on the class border. However, when estimating posterior probabilities, sites in the class interior should receive stronger influence from its neighbors than those on the border. In addition, initialization methods deployed for EM-based clustering algorithms generally do not account for the unique properties of spatial data, such as spatial autocorrelation. As a result, they often fail to provide a proper initialization for NEM to find a good solution in practice. To that end, this paper presents a variant of NEM, called ANEMI, which exploits an adaptive spatial coefficient determined by the correlation of explanatory attributes inside the neighborhood. Also, ANEMI runs from the initial state returned by the spatial augmented initialization method. Finally, the experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets validated the effectiveness of ANEMI.

J	Hu, ZH; Wang, NY				Hu, Zonghui; Wang, Naisyin			Semiparametric latent covariate mixed-effects models with application to a colon carcinogenesis study	STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE			English	Article						Carcinogenesis; Consistency; Generalized estimating equation; Local linear smoothing; Mixed-effects model	DNA ADDUCT LEVELS; LINEAR-MODELS; ERROR; APOPTOSIS	We study a mixed-effects model in which the response and the main covariate are linked by position. While the covariate corresponding to the observed response is not directly observable, there exists a latent covariate process that represents the underlying positional features of the covariate. When the positional features and the underlying distributions are parametric, the expectation-maximization (EM) is the most commonly used procedure. Though without the parametric assumptions, the practical feasibility of a semiparametric EM algorithm and the corresponding inference procedures remain to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, and identify the conditions under which the semiparametric estimators share the same asymptotic properties as the unachievable estimators using the true values of the latent covariate; that is, the oracle property is achieved. We propose a Monte Carlo graphical evaluation tool to assess the adequacy of the sample size for achieving the oracle property. The semiparametric approach is later applied to data from a colon carcinogenesis study on the effects of cell DNA damage on the expression level of oncogene bcl-2. The graphical evaluation shows that, with moderate size of subunits, the numerical performance of the semiparametric estimator is very close to the asymptotic limit. It indicates that a complex EM-based implementation may at most achieve minimal improvement and is thus unnecessary.

During the division process, the initial cluster seeds are produced by a self propagate method according to the density changes. The number of clusters is determined by agglomerating pair of RNN (reciprocal nearest neighbor) cluster seeds, when the density of newly merged cluster is increased. When no more cluster seeds can be merged any more, the remained number of cluster seeds is regarded as the real cluster number Through various experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been proved.

Our contributions are twofold. First, our rbHMM employs a more efficient representation of the image than approaches based on a rectangular lattice or grid; thus, resulting in a faster optimization process. Second, our proposed novel tree-structured parameter estimation algorithm for the rbHMM provides a locally optimal data labeling that is invariant to object rotation. We demonstrate the advantages of our segmentation technique by validating on synthetic images of geometric shapes as well as both simulated and clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain. For the geometric shape data, we show that our method produces more accurate results in less time than a grid-based HMM framework using a similar optimization strategy. For the brain MRI data our white and gray matter segmentation results in substantially greater accuracy than both block-based 3D HAM estimation and expectation-maximization hidden Markov random field (HMRF-EM) approaches.

Firstly, an image is represented as a bag of feature vectors by dividing the image into small blocks, from each of which a six-dimension feature vector is extracted. Secondly, we established the probabilistic formulation for automatic annotation of images through estimating the Gaussian mixtures of each image and the common Gaussian mixtures of all the images with the same semantic label. At lost, the steps of the training and annotation algorithm are given based on our probabilistic formulation. Experimental results show that the proposed supervised formulation achieve higher accuracy than previously published method.

On basis of assumptions for fMRI 3-D image data, a novel analysis method is proposed and applied to synthetic data and human brain data. Synthetic data analysis is conducted using, two statistical noise models (white and autoregressive of order 1) and, for low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) data, reveals better sensitivity and specificity for the new method than for the traditional General Linear Model (GLM) approach. When applied to human brain data, functional activation regions are found to be consistent with those obtained using the GLM approach.

J	Hurnm, A; Hennebert, J; Ingold, R				Hurnm, Andreas; Hennebert, Jean; Ingold, Rolf			Spoken signature for user authentication	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							VERIFICATION; MODELS	We propose a new user authentication system based on spoken signatures, where online signature and speech signals are acquired simultaneously. The main benefit of this multimodal approach is better accuracy at no extra cost for the user in terms of access time or inconvenience. Another benefit lies in a better robustness against intentional forgeries due to the extra difficulty for the forger to produce both signals. We set up an experimental framework to measure these benefits on MylDea, a realistic multimodal biometric database publicly available. More specifically, we evaluate the performance of state of the art modeling systems based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and hidden Markov models (HMM) applied independently to the pen and voice signal, where a simple rule-based score fusion procedure is used. We conclude that the best performance is achieved by the HMMs, provided that their topology is optimized on a per user basis. Furthermore, we show that more precise models can be obtained through the use of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) training instead of the classically used expectation maximization (EM). We also measure the impact of multisession scenarios versus monosession scenanrios, and the impact of skilled versus unskilled signature forgeries attacks. (C) 2008 SPIE and IS&T.

The method combines Kalman filtering and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm in a novel way to deal with observations that obey a Gaussian mixture model instead of a unimodal distribution that is assumed by the ordinary Kalman filter. It also involves a new approach to measuring the object locations using a series of morphological operations with binary masks. The benefit of this approach is that soft assignment of the measurements to corresponding objects can be performed automatically using their a posteriori probabilities. This is a general approach for multi-object tracking, and there are basically various ways to segment the objects, but in this paper we use simple color features simply to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.

Robust Brain Registration Using Adaptive Probabilistic Atlas	MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2008, PT II, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI2008)	SEP 06-10, 2008	New York, NY	Rutgers Univ, New York Univ, Robarts Res Inst, NE Digital Inc, Medtron Inc, Siemens Corp Res, Philips, GE			IMAGE REGISTRATION; MR-IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; MODEL; SYSTEM	Elastic image registration is widely used to adapt brain images to a common template space, and, in complementary fashion, to adapt an anatomical template to a subject's anatomy. Although HAMMER is a very accurate image-registration algorithm, it requires a 3-class segmentation step prior to registration, and its performance is affected by segmentation quality. We here propose a new framework to improve this algorithm's robustness to poor initial segmentation. Our new framework is based on Adaptive Generalized Expectation Maximization (AGEM) for unified segmentation and registration, in which we use an adaptive strategy to incorporate spatial information from a probabilistic atlas to improve segmentation and registration simultaneously. Our experiments using real MR brain images indicate that our integrated approach improves registration accuracy; we have also found that our iterative approach renders HAMMER robust to low tissue contrast, which hinders 3-class segmentation.

However, in the case of congested traffic scenes with a cluttered environment including vehicles or pedestrians, there are severe difficulties in aligning a pair of snapshots. In such cases, some objects would be taken only in one of the image pair, thereby resulting in failure in stitching the pair of images. This paper deals with three types of techniques for performing an image mosaicing: Homography estimation for determining geometrical relationships between the image pair, Expectation-Maximization algorithm for removing inconsistent overlapping region, and Graph Cuts for seamless stitching and background estimation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique is effective to synthesize a panoramic image from a series of narrow-field-of-view snapshots.

This paper proposes a method that aids unconscious guidance in mutual imitation for infant development based on a biasing element with two different kinds of modules. The first is based on the normal magnet effect in perceiving heard vocal sounds as the listener's own vowels (perceptual magnet) and also includes another magnet effect for imitating vocal sounds that resemble the imitator's vowels (articulatory magnet). The second is based on what we call "auto mirroring bias," by which the heard vowel is much closer to the expected vowel because the other's utterance is an imitation of the listener's own utterance. Computer simulation results of mother-infant interaction show the validity of the proposed bias. Finally future issues are discussed.

The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed to solve this problem, which begins a search from the primitive initial point (PIP). Then, proposed was the mes-EM algorithm, which runs the EM repeatedly in many various directions from the PIP, and achieves good solution quality with high computing cost. This paper proposes a variant of the mes-EM, called mes-EM(beta), which uses the temperature to select a small promising portion of the mes-EM runs. Our experiments for the Gaussian mixture estimation showed the proposed algorithm was much faster than the original mes-EM without degrading its solution quality.

When the fading channel is approximated by an Autoregressive (AR) process, it can be estimated by means of Kalman filtering. Nevertheless, the AR model order has to be selected. In addition, the AR parameters must be estimated. One standard solution to obtain the AR parameters consists in first fitting the AR process autocorrelation function to the theoretical Jakes one and then solving the resulting Yule-Walker Equations (YWE). However, this approach requires the Doppler frequency which is usually unknown. To avoid the estimation of the Doppler frequency, the joint estimation of both the channel and its AR parameters can be addressed. Instead of using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm which results in large storage requirements and high computational cost, we propose to consider a structure based on two-cross-coupled Kalman filters. It should be noted that the Kalman filters are all the more interactive as the variance of the innovation of the first filter is used to drive the Kalman gain of the second. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach especially in high Doppler rate environments.

The computational issues were noticed for maximum likelihood based methods, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach revealed that the estimates of absorption and lag parameters might be unreliable. Non-identifiability of these parameters may be the source of computational problems with other methods. Simultaneous use of different approaches to population pharmacokinetics is therefore advised, since it allows for verification of the obtained results.

Not knowing the true number of mixing components is a major learning problem for a mixture classifier using expectation-maximization (EM). To overcome this problem, the training algorithm uses a combination of covariance constraints, dynamic pruning, splitting and merging of mixture kernels of the Gaussian mixture to correctly automate tire learning process. This structural learning of Gaussian mixtures is employed to model and classify, Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) data. The results from the HSI experiments suggested that this new methodology is a potential alternative to the traditional mixture based modeling and classification using general EM.

A key notion in design alternative selection is that of "preference" in which a designer assigns priorities to a set of design choices. This paper presents a preliminary approach for extracting a projection of aggregated design team preferences from design team discussion. This approach further takes into consideration how the design preferences of a team can evolve over time as the team changes its priorities based on new design information. Two initial models are given for representing the most probable and preferred design alternative from the transcriptions of design team discussion, and for predicting how preferences might change from one time interval to the next. These models are applied to an illustrative, real-world case example.

We first apply an improved Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to segment the images into regions, and then extract the texture features of each region with Gabor filters. To improve the robustness of retrieval system against segmentation-related uncertainties, WFFM maps the intensity features of each region into fuzzy features with the exponential membership functions. Based on fuzzy features, regions between images are matched and the texture features serve as weighting factors when calculating the similarities between the images. Experiments show that the retrieval method performs better than some similar methods in the application to retrieve cerebral hemorrhage CT images.

In the proposed scheme, the channel response and the frequency offset are described as auto-regressive (AR) model and generalized AR model, respectively. The carrier frequency offset can be estimated using the particle filter, and the distribution of the fading channel is updated analytically using the Kalman filter, which is associated with each particle. Furthermore, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is evolved to learn model parameters recursively. Simulation results show that the proposed RBPF algorithm has lower block error rate (BLER) than the conventional particle filter and the Rao-Blackwellized Gauss-Hermite filter (RB-GHF), while the processing complexity is rather reasonable.

Challenges addressed in this paper include robust object tracking in the presence of color projections on the ground plane and partial/complete occlusions. To improve tracking in such complex environment, false candidates introduced by ground plane projection or mismatching of objects between views are removed by using the epipolar constraint and the planar homography. A mixture of Gaussian is learned using the expectation-maximization algorithm for each target to further refine the 3D location estimates. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of robust and accurate 3D object tracking in a complex environment with a great amount of visual projections and partial/complete occlusions.

Mohammad			Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Bernoulli Model: An alternative to Hidden Markov Model for automatic speech recognition	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-12	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAR 30-APR 04, 2008	Las Vegas, NV			Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Bernoulli Model; Hidden Markov Model; speech recognition; acoustic modeling; phone recognition; phone duration modeling; Persian (Farsi); spoken language		In this paper, a new acoustic model called Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Bernoulli Model (TI-HBM) is introduced as an alternative to Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in automatic speech recognition. Contrary to HMM, the state transition process in TI-HBM is not a Markov process; rather it is an independent (generalized Bernoulli) process. This difference leads to elimination of dynamic programming at state-level in TI-HBM decoding process. Thus, the computational complexity of TI-HBM for Probability Evaluation and State Estimation is O(NL) (instead of O((NL)-L-2) in the HMM case). As a new framework for phone duration modeling, TI-HBM is able to model acoustic-unit duration (e.g. phone duration) by using a built-in parameter named survival probability. Similar to the HMM case, three essential problems in TI-HBM have been solved. An EM-algorithm based method has been proposed for training TI-BBM parameters. Experiments in phone recognition for Persian (Farsi) spoken language show that the TI-HBM has some advantages over HMM (e.g. more simplicity and increased speed in recognition phase), and also outperforms HMM in terms of phone recognition accuracy.

Probabilistic image registration and anomaly detection by nonlinear warping	2008 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-12	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 23-28, 2008	Anchorage, AK	IEEE Comp Soc			INTENSITY; SECTIONS; POINT	Automatic, defect tolerant registration of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images poses an important and challenging problem for biomedical image analysis, e.g. in computational neuroanatomy. In this paper we demonstrate a fully automatic stitching and distortion correction method for TEM images and propose a probabilistic approach for image registration. The technique identifies image defects due to sample preparation and image acquisition by outlier detection. A polynomial kernel expansion is used to estimate a non-linear image transformation based on intensities and spatial features. Corresponding points in the images are not determined beforehand, but they are estimated via an EM-algorithm during the registration process which is preferable in the case of (noisy) TEM images. Our registration model is successfully applied to two large image stacks of serial section TEM images acquired from brain tissue samples in a computational neuroanatomy project and shows significant improvement over existing image registration methods on these large datasets.

We show that the localization problem can be recast as the task Of Clustering the audio-visual Observations into coherent groups. We propose a probabilistic generative model that captures the relations between audio and visual observations. This model maps the data to a representation of the common 3D scene-space, via a pair of Gaussian mixture models.

Image features are measured by employing an appropriate Gabor filter with adaptively chosen size, orientation, frequency and phase for each pixel. An image property called phase divergence is used for the selection of the appropriate filter size. Characteristic features related to the change in brightness, color, texture and position are extracted for each pixel at the selected size of the filter In order to cluster the pixels into different regions, the joint distribution of these pixel features is modeled by a mixture of Gaussians utilizing two variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The two different versions of EM used in this work for unsupervised clustering are: 1) Penalized EM, and 2) Penalized Stochastic EM. Given the desired number of Gaussian mixture components, both the EM algorithms estimate the parameters of the mixture of Gaussians model that represents the joint distribution of pixel features. We determine the value of the number of models that best suits the natural number of clusters present in the image based on Schwarz criterion, which maximizes the posterior probability of the number of groups given the samples of observation. This segmentation algorithm has been tested on the images of the Berkeley segmentation benchmark and the performance have demonstrated the effectiveness, accuracy and superiority of the proposed method.

To construct a database for moving sounds, we developed a moving sound creation tool using the API library developed by the ARINIS Company. We developed a two-channel-based sound source localization system integrated with a cross-power spectrum phase (CSP) analysis and EM algorithm. The CSP of sound signals obtained with only two microphones is used to localize the sound source without having to use prior information such as impulse response data. The EM algorithm helps the system cope with several moving sound sources and reduce localization error. We evaluated our sound localization method using artificial moving sounds and confirmed that it can well localize moving sounds slower than 1.125 rad/sec. Finally, we solve the problem of distinguishing whether sounds are coming from the front or back by rotating a robot's head equipped with only two microphones. Our system was applied to a humanoid robot called SIG2, and we confirmed its ability to localize sounds over the entire azimuth range.

Evaluation of two-channel-based sound source localization using 3D moving sound creation tool	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS EDUCATION AND RESEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE-CIRCULATING SOCIETY, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Informatics Education and Research for Knowledge-Circulating Society	JAN   17, 2008	Kyoto, JAPAN					We proposed the way that can repeatedly evaluate the localization methods for moving sounds in the same condition regardless of a kind of methods and a number of microphones. And, we developed two-channel-based sound source localization integrated with a cross power spectrum phase (CSP) analysis and EM algorithm. This one can localize several moving sounds and reduce localization error. Many sound source localization methods have already been developed. However, they could not be evaluated for moving sound in the same condition because it is hard to build database for moving sounds with accurate track information whenever making experiments. Also, to localize several moving sounds, conventional methods need a lot of microphone and/or prior information such as impulse response data. In this paper; we evaluated our sound localization method using 3D moving sound creation tool and confirmed that our method with two microphones can well localize the voices of a moving talker without impulse response data.

At low frequencies, an MMSE spectral amplitude estimator divided by the spectral amplitude of a representative impulse response produces optimal performance. In the high frequency range, the MMSE estimator is computed based on its sufficient statistic: the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate. Inference is factored using a two-step algorithm: the maximum likelihood value of the source spectrum is first estimated using expectation-maximization (EM) under the assumption of the hidden room response with complex Gaussian pdf, then the MMSE source spectral estimate is computed.

For this, a new method for chromatin texture characterization employing a new feature, contour complexity, is proposed and evaluated using nuclear images obtained from paraffin-wax embedded sections of human breast cancer on slides. The proposed feature is calculated on the basis of a contour length of nucleus obtained by setting different threshold values of intensity for a grayscale image, and it is a quantitative measure of chromatin texture. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm-based segmentation and an effective initial parameter search method for EM are used for the automatic calculation of the feature. The results for breast cancer cell detection showed that the average contour complexity value for malignant cells (19.6 +/- 4.1) is found to be significantly greater (p < 10(-6), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) than that of benign cells (0.35 +/- 0.17). By the comparison with the conventional fractal dimension approach, it is shown that the proposed feature is much more sensitive feature than the fractal dimension for the individual cancer cell detection.

This so-called Variational Bayes Incremental Expectation Maximization (VB-IEM) algorithm has two virtues: first, it non-decreases an objective function at each iteration and secondly, it adopts the convergence properties of the exact EM algorithm if the parameter estimate is consistent and maximum a posteriori. When the VB-IEM algorithm is applied to joint multi-user decoding and multi-channel estimation in flat Rayleigh fading, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed scheme supports extremely high effective system loads.

The techniques include listwise deletion, imputations by mean, k-nearest neighbor, and expectation maximization. The completed data are used to predict the presence or absence of NPC recurrence in each year by means of logistic regression, multilayer perceptron with backpropagation training, and naive bayes. Five year predictions are carried out. Validity of each predictive model is assured by 10-fold cross validation. Their results are compared in order to determine proper missing data treatment and the most efficient prediction technique. The results showed that EM imputation was superior to the other missing data techniques because it can be efficiently applied to all predictive models. The multilayer perceptron with backpropagation training gave the highest prediction performance and it was the most robust to the data completed by different missing data techniques.

The method is based on the expectation maximization (EM) principle combined with a basis expansion model (BE) of the doubly selective channel. To alleviate the problem of convergence of the EM to a local maximum, we propose an initialization scheme to the EM iterations based on a small number of pilot symbols. We further derive an optimal pilot positioning scheme to minimize the probability of convergence to a local maximum. The resulting algorithm is shown to be superior over previously proposed equalization schemes and to perform in many cases close to the maximum likelihood equalizer with perfect channel knowledge. Our proposed method is also applicable to the case of short, independent fading blocks.

Although we are now able to estimate the 3D position of every slice with respect to the frame, the reconstruction of the cell from the positioned slices remains a problem that this paper address. In our context, 3D spatially-varying PSF and missing data are the two main particularities of this problem. Experiments illustrate the ability of the classical EM algorithm to deconvolve efficiently cell volume and also to deal with missing data.

Although artifacts caused by bias filed may carry important information, e.g., shadowing behind a lesion, they are generally disturbing in the process of automatic boundary delineation for sonographic breast lesions. This paper presents a new segmentation algorithm aiming to decompose the region of interest (ROI) into prominent components while estimating the bias field in the ROI. A prominent component is a contiguous region with a visually perceivable boundary, which might be a noise, an artifact, a substructure of a tissue or a part of breast lesion. The prominent components may be used as the basic constructs for a higher level segmentation algorithm to identify the lesion boundary. The bias field in an ROI is modeled as a spatially-variant Gaussian distribution with a constant variance and spatially-variant means, which is a polynomial surface of order n. The true gray levels of the pixels in a prominent component are assumed to be Gaussian-distributed. The proposed algorithm is formulated as an EM-algorithm composed of two major steps. In the E-step, the ROI is decomposed into prominent components using a new fuzzy cell-competition algorithm based on the bias field and model parameters estimated in the previous M-step. In the M-step, the bias field and model parameters are estimated based on the prominent components derived in the E-step using a least squared approach.

IVA, as an extension of independent component analysis (ICA) from univariate components to multivariate components, provides an efficient framework for avoiding the well-known permutation problem in frequency-domain blind source separation (BSS). However, since IVA has been mostly employing pre-specified and simple source priors which are good fits to speech signals, the performance degrades when the mixture includes unknown sources other than speech. Also, sensor noise has not been considered. To tackle these limitations, we employ multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the source priors and add sensor noise into the model. We derive an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that estimates the separating matrices and the parameters of the unknown source prior together. The performance is demonstrated by experimental results that include the comparison with the IVA results using fixed source priors.

We build on previous work, adopting a multiscale representation of the Poisson process in which the ratios of the underlying Poisson intensities (rates) in adjacent scales are modeled as mixtures of conjugate parametric distributions. Our main novel contributions are (1) a rigorous and robust regularized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of the rate-ratio density parameters directly from the observed Poisson data (counts); (2) extension of the method to work under a scale-recursive Hidden Markov Tree model (HMT) which couples the mixture label assignments in consecutive scales, thus modeling inter-scale coefficient dependencies in the vicinity of edges; and (3) exploration of a fully 2-D quad-tree image partitioning, involving Dirichlet-mixture rate-ratio densities, instead of the conventional separable binary image partitioning involving Beta-mixture rate-ratio densities. Experimental intensity estimation results on standard images with artificially simulated Poisson noise and photon-limited images with real shot noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We represent time series segments by feature vectors that reflect the dynamical patterns of single and multi-dimensional physiological time series. Features include regression slopes at varying time scales, maximum transient changes, auto-correlation coefficients of individual signals, and cross correlations among multiple signals. We model the dynamical patterns with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) learned with the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and compute similarity between segments as Mahalanobis distances. We evaluate the use of our algorithm in three applications: search-by-example based data retrieval, event classification, and forecasting, using synthetic and real physiologic time series from a variety of sources.

This framework is equivalent to a mixed data-type hierarchical Bayes graphical model assumption with latent variables constrained to a low-dimensional parameter subspace. We show that within this framework exponential PCA and SP-PCA are similar to the Bregman soft clustering technique with the addition of a linear constraint in the parameter space. We implement the resulting modifications to SP-PCA and Bregman soft clustering for mixed (continuous and/or discrete) data sets, and add a nonparametric estimation of the point-mass probabilities to exponential PCA. Finally, we compare the relative performances of the three algorithms in a clustering setting for mixed data sets.

The aero-optics effect is yielded when the objects (e.g, missile, aircraft etc.) are flying in high speed or ultrasonic speed. In this situation, the PSF and the observation noise are unknown a priori. The identification and the restoration of the turbulence degraded images is a challenging problem in the world. The algorithm based on the nonnegativity and support constraints recursive inverse filtering (NAS-RIF) is proposed in order to identify and restore the turbulence degraded images. The NAS-RIF technique applies to situations in which the scene consists of a finite support object against a uniformly black, grey, or white background. The restoration procedure of NAS-RIF involves recursive filtering of the blurred image to minimize a convex cost function. The algorithm proposed in this paper is that the turbulence degraded image is filtered before it passes the recursive filter. The conjugate gradient minimization routine was used for minimization of the NAS-RIF cost function. The algorithm based on the NAS-RIF is used to identify and restore the wind tunnel tested images. The experimental results show that the restoration effect is improved obviously.

This paper attempts to impute item nonresponses in person-trip (PT) survey data collected in a developing city (i.e., Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area, Indonesia) based on expectation maximization (EM) imputation method. As a case study, an aggregate multinomial logit model is used to represent travel mode choice at zonal level. It shows that even in case of low missing rate, the issues of item nonresponses could result in serious biased model estimation and consequently may lead to wrong policy decisions.

In this article, we propose a novel learning approach, namely Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized Expectation- Maximization ( CFSEM), to address the above problems. The CFS-EM is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming ( CGP) and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. CFS-EM is especially suitable for image retrieval because the images can be searched in the synthesized low-dimensional feature space, while a kernel-based method has to make classification computation in the original high-dimensional space. Experiments on real image databases show that CFS-EM outperforms Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine ( RBF-SVM), CGP, Discriminant-EM ( D-EM) and Transductive-SVM ( TSVM) in the sense of classification performance and it is computationally more efficient than RBF-SVM in the query phase.

We propose a class of functions determined by only two parameters but. flexible enough to model realistic time courses. This serves as a basis for a mixed model clustering method. This method takes into account (1) genetic function profile induced or controlled by other regulators, (2) unobservable random effects producing heterogeneity within gene clusters, and (3) autoregressive components defining the stochastic and autocorrelation structures. We employ an EM algorithm to fit the mixture model and clustering follows monitoring via Bayesian posterior probabilities. Our method is applied to a mouse ESC line during the first 24 hours of differentiation period. We assess the biological credibility of the results by detecting significantly associated FatiGO Gene Ontology terms for each cluster.

Specifically, we propose to encode actions in a weighted directed graph, referred to as action graph, where nodes of the graph represent salient postures that are used to characterize the actions and shared by all actions. The weight between two nodes measures the transitional probability between the two postures. An action is encoded as one or multiple paths in the action graph. The salient postures are modeled using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Both the salient postures and action graph are automatically learned from training samples through unsupervised clustering and expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results have verified the performance of the proposed model, its tolerance to noise and viewpoints and its robustness across different subjects and datasets.

In space object detection stage, PCA provides compact and decorrelated feature space, the tracked object feature is statistically represented as GMM in RGB color space, objects are detected by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In temporal tracking stage, the tracked object is determined by the Bhattacharyya similarity measurement, the object position of consecutive frame is predicted by EM Kalman filter algorithm. The integration of object detection and tracking spatio-temporal mutual feedback scheme can decrease the accumulation error. We have applied the proposed method to object detection and tracking under the partial occlusion and the changes of moving speed with encouraging results.

In this paper we propose a feature selection algorithm for semi-supervised clustering. In our method, features are conditionally independent. Feature saliency is first computed in unsupervised clustering using the Expectation Maximization model. Then, it is refined in the Tuning step to minimize the Feature-wise Constraint Violation Measure, calculated based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experimental results show that a small amount of supervision can improve the performance of clustering and feature selection.

First, image is modeled by a mixture model, and then with the techniques of factor analyzer the underlying structure of image content is inferred automatically Different from the traditional EM algorithm that seriously suffers from component number selection, the proposed method can accurately infer the underlying image structure including suitable component number without usual sub- or over-segmentation problem. To overcome the problem of local optimization, a component split strategy is adopted in inference optimization process. Extensive experiments on various images validate the proposed method.

This article is proposing an EM algorithm technique to estimate the parametric component and the nonparametric coefficient function. From simulation we can see clearly that. in order to get the general consistent estimator of the parametric part. we need not undersmoothing the nonparametric part.. Unlike other method in estimating the parameter and the nonoparametric coefficient function, the optimal bandwidth for the model is similar to nonparametric model. so the method of leaving-one-cluster-out cross-validation could be directly used in selecting bandwidth.

The RREM is a level set segmentation method while the evolution of the contours was driven by the force field composed by the probability density functions of the Gaussian models. Each tissue is modeled by one or more Gaussian models restricted by free shaped contour so that the Gaussian models are adaptive to the local intensities. The RREM is guaranteed to be convergency and achieving the local minimum. The segmentation avoids to be trapped in the local minimum by the split and merge operation. A fuzzy rule based classifier finally groups the regions belonging to the same tissue and forms the segmented 3D image of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) which are of major interest in numerous applications. The presented method can be extended to segment brain images with tumor or the images having part of the brain removed with the adjusted classifier.

The electronic migration formulation considering the effects of the electron wind force, stress gradients, temperature gradients, as well as the atomic concentration gradient has been developed for the electromigration failure mechanisms. Due to introducing the atomic concentration gradient driving force in atomic flux formulation, the conventional atomic flux divergence method cannot be used in the new EM algorithm. Therefore the corresponding EM atomic concentration redistribution method is proposed using FORTRAN code. A link between ANSYS and FORTRAN code is developed to transfer the data. The atomic concentration information is imported into ANSYS Multi-physics and then the atomic concentration distribution of the studied structure can be gotten. Finally, the comparison of voids generation through numerical example of a SWEAT structure with the measurement result is studied and discussed.

This paper presents a learning algorithm to incorporate qualitative domain knowledge to regularize the otherwise ill-posed problem, limit the search space, and avoid local optima. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where an objective function is defined as a combination of the likelihood function and penalty functions constructed from the qualitative domain knowledge. Then, a gradient-descent procedure is systematically integrated with the E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm, to estimate the parameters iteratively until it canverges. The experiments show our algorithm improves the accuracy of the learned BN parameters significantly over the conventional EM algorithm.			wenhui.liao@thomsonreuters.com; qji@ecse.rpi.edu					Binder J, 1997, MACH LEARN, V29, P213, DOI 10.1023/A:1007421730016; Dempster A.P., 1977, ROYAL STAT SOC B, V39, P1; Ekman P., 1978, FACIAL ACTION CODING; ELIDAN G, 2003, INFORM BOTTLENECK AL, P200; ELIDAN G, 2002, DATA PERTURBATION ES; GEMAN S, 1984, PAMI, V6; JAEGER M, 2006, AI M PROCEDURE LEARN, P225; KANADE T, 2000, P FG00; Ramoni M, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P147, DOI 10.1023/A:1010968702992; YONG Y, 2006, INERRING FAICAL ACTI	10	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1051-4651	978-1-4244-2174-9	INT C PATT RECOG			2008							543	546				4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BJC36	WOS:000264729000133

The relevance vector machine (RVM) has a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework and has good generalization capability. The RVM consists of the sum of product of weight and kernel function which projects input space into high dimensional feature space. Although having the same function form as support vector machine (SVM), the RVM not only has sparser solutions, but also has not restrictions on the selection of kernel functions. An improved EM-based learning algorithm of RVM is also proposed to deal with the problem of computing the inverse matrix in the classical RVM when the model is too sparse. As a case study, the EM-base RVM is used for functional regression with noises. The simulation results illustrate effectiveness of the presented improved RVM. Both the classical and EM-based RVM are superior to SVM, and EM-base RVM is more robust faced with different kernel width.

Inspired by Maximum Likelihood estimation, we modify Voting EM algorithm, which is an online parameter learning method proposed by Cohen, et al, to gain better results, making the parameters of the algorithm easier to be specified It adjusts the learning rate by changing the weights of samples according to the time they arrived at. And that means it is more suitable to be applied in practice. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through the comparison with Voting EM. The result confirms that the proposed method is easier to get a better estimate of the Bayesian network parameters, and also adapts to the new parameters quickly.

The end points of isolated utterance can be determined accurately enough in the training and recognition process. A function for the distance measure between two speech blocks is derived. The feature vector is then defined. The speech model for each word is represented as a left-to-right finite-state machine. Viterbi algorithm and EM algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal model for each isolated word. When an utterance is to be recognized, the Viterbi algorithm is applied to search for the model which gives the smallest accumulated distance along the optimum path. The performance of the proposed recognition process is evaluated by comparing to the method using DTW. The comparison is in three aspects: namely, the recognition accuracy, the noise-resistance capability, and the effectiveness of speech enhancement pre-processing. Experiments showed that the proposed speech recognition process is superior to DTW in these three aspects.

A video sequence processing method has developed in this paper to identify and eliminate crop shadows. The method comprises pixel models and algorithms explained in a probable learning framework. Expectation maximization (EM) for mixture models is established and an incremental EM method is proposed. This method performs a probable reasoning unsupervised classification of pixels for real-time implementation. The results show that the method is quite robust and can successfully remove shadows under natural lighting conditions.

The result is a continuous downward and upward message propagation in the factor graph instead of discrete probability distributions. Using continuous downward messages, the computation complexity of belief propagation is reduced without performance degradation. With both continuous upward and downward messages, belief propagation almost achieves the same performance as expectation-maximization under good initialization and outperforms it under bad initialization.

We propose to replace these densities by standard messages where the channel estimate is accurately modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Upward messages include symbol extrinsic information and downward messages carry a mean and a variance for the Gaussian modeled channel estimate. Such unquantized message propagation leads to a complexity reduction and a performance improvement. For QAM modulated symbols, the proposed belief propagation almost achieves the performance of Expectation-Maximization under good initialization and surpasses it under bad initialization.

A flight-delay and delay propagation model is established based on Bayesian network (BN). After trained the network by real data with Expectation-Maximization (EM) arithmetic, the influences from the Arrival-delay and the Flight-cancellation on the departure-delay are analyzed under different all kinds of states. The conclusion of study indicates that the propagation from arrival-delays to the departure-delays is very obvious, especially when the degree of arrival-delay was MEDIUM or HEAVY the influence of propagation couldn't be eliminated The flight-cancellation is one efficient method to deal with the influence. Flight-cancellation is involved to build our model. After trained, the model proved that Flight-cancellation could be adopted when delay propagation happened seriously which can weaken the propagation in a certain extent and the weakening degree is related to the number of canceled flights.

The method whose performances are described here uses visible data (catalog and image) as the starting reference point for the analysis in the far and near UV channels of GALEX. The unique point of our procedure is the Bayesian approach under the Poisson noise assumption. The solution is reached with a EM algorithm. Its photometric performance has been estimated by inserting randomly a large set of artificial stars into original UV images and measuring the whole as original images. This study shows that photometric performance depends on: 1) PSF accuracy, 2) background accuracy, 3) position accuracy and 4) catalog's precision.

To do this automatically and without the need for extensive a priori models of the environment, these systems have to be able to autonomously discover the different dynamic behaviors of entities in their environment as well as to predict points at which objects' behaviors and interactions change. This paper presents a technique to simultaneously learn to identify segmentation points and to extract a discrete set of models of the behaviors of objects from a stream of sensor observations. The approach presented here uses unsupervised learning techniques to learn these models in the form of Representative sensor signatures which, once acquired, are used to interpret the robot's observations and to represent the actual sensor data more compactly as a sequence of behaviors. To enable the system to simultaneously learn to segment the continuous data stream and to build appropriate models for the data segments, a set of similarity metrics for sensor streams is derived and used in an Expectation Maximization algorithm. This algorithm alternates between segmenting the sensor data based on the existing behavior models and clustering the data segments to derive better models, thus iteratively improving both the quality of the segmentation and of the behavior models. To illustrate the approach, experiments are performed using simulated observations derived from different types of sensors which observe the dynamic interactions of objects.

In the previous literatures, DWI-based brain tissue segmentation was carried out using the parametric images, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). However, the information of directions of neural fibers was very limited in the parametric images. To fully utilize the directional information, we propose a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly on the DWI raw image data. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering (HC) technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The whole brain DWI raw data of five normal subjects were analyzed. The results demonstrated that HC-EM is effective in multi-tissue classification on DWI raw data.

Being aware of this, we propose a new approach of extracting objects of interest (OOIs) using attention-driven model. In this approach, images are coarsely segmented into regions using EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm, and then we use the modified Itti-Koch model (M-Itti-Koch) of visual attention to find salient peaks, if these peaks overlap with regions generated by EM algorithm, we proceed to extract attentive object around those points. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives good performance, as compared with the current peer method in the literature.

Accurate likelihood evaluation for multiple model PMHT algorithms	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			EM ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	A variety of authors have incorporated multiple target motion models into the Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (PMHT) algorithm using a discrete Markov chain to model the motion model switching process. However, in these papers the observed data likelihood function is not written down for this model, nor is it evaluated because all possible model assignment sequences must be considered over the PMERT batch. These two issues are addressed in this paper under the assumption that the Markov chain switching model affects the target state process but not the target measurement process: the observed data likelihood function for the PMHT algorithm is given along with a method for evaluating it. A closely related method of including multiple target motion models in the PMHT algorithm that results in a finite mixture distribution of motion models is described as well. In addition, it is shown that using multiple-model smoothing algorithms such as an]MM smoother to estimate the target states in a multiple model PMHT algorithm will not maximize the observed data likelihood function. Finally, it is shown that the MAP target state estimates for linear Gaussian targets with multiple motion models can be computed using a bank of Kalman smoothers. This result fills a gap in the existing literature.(1 2).

In supervised-based machine teaming algorithm, insufficient Labeled training data and the unlabeled data in one RF circle can not represent scatter of features space for all irrelevant images, such algorithm used for CBIR did not show a high performance. As a research hot point, semi-supervised, it can utilize unlabeled data to estimate model of RF so that boost the retrieval performance. This paper proposed a new algorithm for RF: make use of expectation maximization (EM) to learn RBF function for RBF neutral network, integrated active teaming to void a local value EM learned, and reduce iterations of feedback, as a result this algorithm learned a R-F model based on RBF. Experience indicated that: compare to EM and Bayes, efficiency of learner is improved, user's query concept is grasped quickly.

We examine what information initial customer betting behavior provides about this probability distribution, and consider how to use this to estimate the probability distribution for remaining customers.

We first extend the theory of 2D hidden Markov models (HMMs) to arbitrary causal multi-dimensional HMMs and provide the classification and training algorithms for this model. The proposed extension of causal multi-dimensional HMMs allows state transitions in arbitrary causal directions and neighbors. We subsequently generalize this framework further to non-causal models by distributing the non-causal models into multiple causal multi-dimensional HMMs. The proposed training and classification process consists of the extension of three fundamental algorithms to multi-dimensional causal systems, i.e. (1) Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm,(2) General Forward-Backward (GFB) algorithm; and (3) Viterbi algorithm. Simulation results performed using real-world images and videos demonstrate the superior performance, higher accuracy rate and promising applicability of the proposed DHMM framework.

The proposed model can represent, for example, multiple motion trajectories of objects and their interaction activities in a scene; it is capable of conveying not only dynamics of each trajectory, but also interactions information between multiple trajectories, which can be critical in many applications. We firstly provide a solution for non-causal, multi-dimensional hidden Markov model (HMM) by distributing the non-causal model into multiple distributed causal HMMs. We approximate the simultaneous solution of multiple HMMs on a sequential processor by an alternate updating scheme. Subsequently we provide three algorithms for the training and classification of our proposed model. A new Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm suitable for estimation of the new model is derived, where a novel General Forward-Backward (GFB) algorithm is proposed for recursive estimation of the model parameters. A new conditional independent subset-state sequence structure decomposition of state sequences is proposed for the 2D Viterbi algorithm. The new model can be applied to many other areas such as image segmentation and image classification. Simulation results in classification of multiple interacting trajectories demonstrate the superior performance and higher accuracy rate of our distributed HMM in comparison to previous models.

The proposed 2D-DHMM model is result of a novel solution to a more general non-causal two-dimensional hidden Markov model (2D-HMM) that we proposed.

By temporally segmenting the frequency bins of the residual signal spectrum into blocks and modelling the data in each block and each frequency bin as realizations of a random variable, we can compute the probability of presence of residual echo and derive an appropriate ML suppression rule based on this probability. The computation of the probabilities is based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The proposed method shows better performance as compared to state of the art methods for residual echo suppression while producing no audible degradation in the near end signal and no musical noise. Test results indicate that the proposed approach provides an increase in the ERLE of up to 3 dB more than the state of the art echo suppressor while yielding a comparable mean opinion score (MOS) for the near end speech quality. Furthermore, the proposed method is independent of the double talk detector - which makes it robust to misclassifications on the part of the AEC algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a component reduction technique, that collapses a mixture model into a mixture with fewer components. For fitting a mixture model to data, the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is usually used. Our algorithm is derived by extending mixture model learning using the EM-algorithm. In this extension, a difficulty arises from the fact that some crucial quantities cannot be evaluated analytically. We overcome this difficulty by introducing an effective approximation. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a simple synthetic component reduction task and a phoneme clustering problem.

In the paper we develop a probabilistic approach, to deal with the heterogeneity and variability of the load distribution based on the estimation of the hourly peak load distribution by Mixture of Generalized Gaussian distribution (MGG). The model has more flexibility to approximate and to adapt the shape of load data. The update of the model parameters is carried out using an extension of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results, obtained from the Tunisian power system indicate that MGG technique is accurate, efficient and robust.	[Mahmoud, M.

It is assumed that the unknown noise-gain is time invariant. Two objectives are addressed in this work, 1) compute an estimation scheme that is fast, and 2) compute an estimation scheme without recourse to stochastic integration. To address the first objective we avoid the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, instead we develop an estimation scheme for a finite number of candidate model hypotheses. To address the second objective we develop a version of the Gauge-Transformation technique introduced by J. M. C. Clark.	[Malcolm, W.

This model is a 2-Dimensional (2D) model where the propagating plane waves are assumed to arrive only from the azimuthal direction and does not include the elevation domain. As a result of this assumption the derived Angle of Arrival (AoA) distribution is characterized only by the azimuth direction of these waves. In this paper the AoA distribution of multipaths is modeled in a novel 3-Dimensional (3D) approach. The Von Mises Fisher (VMF) and Fisher Bingham (FB5) Probability Density Functions (PDF) are used to describe their distribution within the propagation environment in azimuth and co-latitude. More specifically two separate models are proposed. The first model uses a mixture of VMF distributions and the second one uses a mixture of FB5 and VMF distributions. The parameters of the individual cluster of scatterers within the mixture are derived and an estimation of those parameters is achieved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The two models are compared. The results indicate that both mixture models perform really well. However the FB5 mixture model is proposed because it is more flexible. Both models are validated with the use of MIMO experimental data obtained from a measurement campaign in Germany.								*3GPP 3GPP2, 2003, SCM121 3GPP3GPP2; AKAIKE H, 1974, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, VAC19, P716, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705; Banerjee A, 2004, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V15, P702, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2004.824416; Banerjee A, 2005, J MACH LEARN RES, V6, P1345; Fisher NI, 1984, AUST J STAT, V26, P142; Fisher N.I., 1987, STAT ANAL SPHERICAL; KENT JT, 1982, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V44, P71; Kent T, 2005, PRESERVATION, V57, P60; Lotter MP, 1999, IEEE COMMUN LETT, V3, P128, DOI 10.1109/4234.766845; MAMMASIS K, 2008, IEEE 2008 W IN PRESS; MAMMASIS K, 2008, IET ELECT LETT, V44, P136; MAMMASIS K, 2007, IET J COMMUNIC UNPUB; Mardia K., 1972, STAT DIRECTIONAL DAT; Mardia K.

In this contribution, we present a novel code-aided fractional CFO estimation algorithm based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm exchanges soft information from the channel decoder, in the form of a posteriori probabilities of the coded symbols, between the demapper, the decoder, and the CFO estimator in an iterative way. The proposed estimation scheme can work with any detector as long as the detector is able to compute the a posteriori probabilities (APPs) of the data symbols.

Spectral graph theory can be used to map these graphs onto lower dimensional spaces and match shapes by aligning their embeddings in virtue of their invariance to change of pose. Classical graph isomorphism schemes relying on the ordering of the eigenvalues to align the eigenspaces fail when handling large data-sets or noisy data. We derive a new formulation that finds the best alignment between two congruent K-dimensional sets of points by selecting the best subset of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian matrix. The selection is done by matching eigenfunction signatures built with histograms, and the retained set provides a smart initialization for the alignment problem with a considerable impact on the overall performance. Dense shape matching casted into graph matching reduces then, to point registration of embeddings tinder orthogonal transformations; the registration is solved using the framework of unsupervised clustering and the EM algorithm. Maximal subset matching of non identical shapes is handled by defining an appropriate outlier class. Experimental results on challenging examples show how the algorithm naturally treats changes of topology, shape variations and different sampling densities.

EM Channel Estimation in a Low-Cost UWB Receiver Based on Energy Detection	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ISWCS 2008)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems	OCT 21-24, 2008	Reykjavik, ICELAND	IEEE			PARAMETER	The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is studied to perform channel estimation in a low cost and high data rate impulse radio UWB receiver. The system under consideration uses a pulse position modulation with a simple analog energy detector., In order to overcome the problems inherent to high data rates, such as inter-symbol interferences, a probabilistic equalizer is used. The EM algorithm and the equalizer are embedded into the loop of an iterative channel decoder. This permits to refine both the channel parameters and the signal probability at each iteration.

The new algorithm goes beyond previously published MCE-based approaches. It has the advantage that it is applicable to general measures, as opposed to only the Sugeno class of measures. In addition, the monotonicity constraints are handled easily with minimal time or storage requirements. Learning the fuzzy measure is framed as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) parameter learning problem. In order to maintain the constraints, this MAP problem is solved with a Gibbs sampler using an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework. For these reasons, the new algorithm is referred to as the MAP-EM MCE Logistic LASSO algorithm. Results are given on synthetic and real data sets, the latter obtained from a landmine detection problem. Average reductions in false alarms of about 25% are achieved on the landmine detection problem and probabilities of detection in the interesting and meaningful range of 85%-95%.

Tracking with contours in a filtering framework requires a dynamical model for prediction. Recently, Particle filter, is widely used because its multiple hypotheses and versatility within framework. However, the good choice of the propagation function is still its main problem. In this paper, an improved particle filter, EM-PF algorithm is proposed which using the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm to learn the dynamical models. The EM algorithm can explicitly learn the parameters of the dynamical models from training sequences. The advantage of using the EM algorithm in particle filter is that it is capable of improve tracking contour by having accurate model parameters. Though the experiment results, we show how our EM-PF can be applied to produces more robust and accurate extracting.

Classic maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm can not work well due to the high computation demand. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was proposed in our previous paper to approximate the optimal solution with lower computational complexity. However that algorithm is centralized in nature in which all the observed data from each sensor node must be sent to the fusion centre. It has several drawbacks including the relying on the centre which may be damaged or shut down, poor scalability with the increasing of network size, and the high communication overhead requirement when a sensor is far away from the centre. In this paper we propose a distributed EM algorithm for multi-source localization in energy-based WSN. It can achieve satisfactory localization accuracy with significantly low communication and computation cost.

For the purpose of many network measurement and monitoring tasks, it is desirable to have an accurate yet information-compact profiling or the behavior of massive event sequences. This paper proposes a new method to achieve this goal. On a given set of event sequences, the proposed method automatically learns a mixture model which fully captures the sequence behavior including both event pattern and duration between events. The learned mixture model is information-compact as it classifies sequences into a set of behavior templates, each of which is described by a Markov Chain. The model parameters are estimated in an iterative procedure which is developed from the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Two network management applications are proposed based on the method: a visualization tool for network administrators to conduct exploratory traffic analysis, and an efficient anomaly detection mechanism. In the evaluation, we validate the method accuracy as well as the usefulness of the two applications by using three networking datasets with different types: TCP packet traces, VoIP calls, and syslog traces in wireless networks.

MCyT Signature database which contains data for 100 users, with 25 genuine and 25 forged signatures per user, has been used to test the proposed methods. Dynamic Time Warping is used to remove intrinsic variability from user's signatures by aligning the signals acquired from digital tablet with the user's models. Experimenting with the data we extracted 25 features called later the pseudo-distances. Quality investigations enabled to select a subset of those features that made it possible to keep or even improve the error rates, and improve the processing time and computational costs. Gaussian Mixture Modelling has been used to model the probabilistic distribution of the set of pseudo-distances and to calculate the likelihood ratio between the user's signatures and its model stored. A modified Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed, which additionally improves the error rates.

In recent developments, targeted drug delivery is effectuated using microbubbles. Microbubbles may be destroyed by inertial cavitation if the insonification amplitude is chosen high enough. The minimum threshold for inertial cavitation or a microbubble population is thus an important characteristic of an ultrasound contrast agent. This article proposes a method for the determination of ultrasound contrast agent destruction by inertial cavitation. Detection is implemented by transmission of a destruction and a probing pulse with a fixed time delay. Using an expectation maximization algorithm, modulated Gaussian pulses are fitted to the received waveform.

Typically, the failure distribution and its parameters are determined using product manufacturing data for each month of production and the corresponding monthly failure counts derived from the warranty claims. If the data is collected systematically, the product ages at the times of failure can be derived. Classical methods are then used to determine the failure time distribution and parameters. However, our experience shows that, in many cases, it may not be possible to know the failure ages of components. The information available each month might be limited to the volume of shipments and total claims or product returns. In such cases, the data hides the component age at the time of failure. In this paper, we show that when the failure history information is incomplete, the failure distribution of the product can be determined using Bayesian analysis techniques applicable for handling incomplete data. We apply the popular Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the failure distribution parameters using incomplete data. The effectiveness of the EM algorithm is compared using several sets of incomplete warranty data generated using simulation. We observed that the EM algorithm is powerful in capturing the hidden failure patterns from the incomplete warranty data.

Composite interval mapping (CIM) is a generalized version of interval mapping. However, the traditional IM and CIM approaches both are sensitive to outliers. This paper discusses a new robust CIM algorithm for QTL mapping in an experimental organisms by minimizing beta-divergence using the EM algorithm. Simulation studies show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance over the traditional CIM method for QTL mapping in presence of outliers; otherwise, it keeps equal performance.

L *a* b color space is used to replace the more straightforward spaces such as the RGB color space and YUV color space. This algorithm is capable of automatically selecting the number of components of the model using Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion.

Besides mares and widely acknowledged benefits, the method suffers severe limitations due to the high motion,sensitivity and inter-operator dependency to the point where it provides only qualitative information, not having, until now, any real quantification means. In this paper we present an automatic segmentation method for elastographic images based on statistical techniques. First a probabilistic model is built,for every pixel in the image, derived by processing a video sequence instead of a single image. The built image contains the values with highest probability for each pixel. Next a DAEM (Deterministic Annealing Expectation Maximization) method is used,for automatic image segmentation. Finally a numerical quantification of tissue elasticity is provided based on the segmentation.

The maximum a-posteriori estimator is derived for this model using the Bayesian Expectation-Maximization. It is demonstrated that the solution forms an elegant and simple iteration which can be easily implemented.

WAVELET RESTORATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL MEDICAL PULSE-ECHO ULTRASOUND DATASETS IN AN EM FRAMEWORK	ACOUSTICAL IMAGING, VOL 29	ACOUSTICAL IMAGING		English	Proceedings Paper	29th International Symposium on Acoustical Imaging	APR 15-18, 2007	Shonan Village, JAPAN			Restoration; Deconvolution; Wavelet; Expectation-maximisation; EM; Speckle	BLIND DECONVOLUTION; IMAGES	The application of pulse-echo ultrasound to the non-invasive imaging of soft biological tissues is now well established in modern clinical practice. In spite of this, however, the quality of pulse-echo ultrasound images remains poor because of inherent blurring and low image resolution, and there exists significant scope for the development of restoration algorithms to address this problem. Like other similar inverse problems, the performance of a particular restoration algorithm is highly contingent on the appropriateness of its underlying image model. The modelling of piecewise smooth natural images has been well studied in mainstream image processing, and it is known that the sparsifying properties of the wavelet transform are especially useful to provide simple but effective image models, leading to computationally efficient wavelet shrinkage methods for denoising. In a previous publication, we showed how wavelet-based models of natural images could be used in the context of pulse-echo ultrasound for image restoration; in particular, we proposed a simple model for the acoustic reflectivity functions of typical soft biological tissues that was able to account for their different behaviours on macroscopic and microscopic scales. We demonstrated how this model could be used in an expectation-maximisation (EM) restoration algorithm that simply alternated between Wiener filtering and wavelet shrinkage. Our previous results for two-dimensional images showed excellent performance compared to other methods based on less sophisticated image models, and in this paper, we extend our algorithm to the restoration of three-dimensional datasets to correct also for out-of-plane blurring.

As a result, it is difficult to interpret the obtained clustering outcomes from a statistical standpoint. Mixture model-based clustering has received much attention from the gene expression community due to its sound statistical background and its flexibility in data modeling. However, current clustering algorithms following the model-based framework suffer from two serious drawbacks. First, the performance of these algorithms critically depends on the starting values for their iterative clustering procedures. And second, they are not capable of working directly with very high dimensional data sets whose dimension might be up to thousands. We propose a novel normalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to tackle the two challenges. The normalized EM is stable even with random initializations for its EM iterative procedure. Its stability is demonstrated through the performance comparison with other related clustering algorithms such as the unnormalized EM (The conventional EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture model-based clustering) and spherical k-means. Furthermore, the normalized EM is the first mixture model-based clustering algorithm that is shown to be stable when working directly with very high dimensional microarray data sets in the sample clusterin g problem, where the number of genes is much larger than the number of samples. Besides, an interesting property of the convergence speed of the normalized EM with respect to the squared radius of the hypersphere in its corresponding statistical model is uncovered.

On the first image of the video sequence, lip region is detected using the Bayesian's rule in which lip color information is modeled by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which is trained by Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The lip region is then used to initialize the lip shape model. A single feature-based ASM presents good performance only in particular conditions but gets stuck in local minima for noisy conditions (like beard, wrinkle, poor texture, low contrast between lip and skin, etc). To enhance the convergence, we propose to use 2 features: normal profile and grey level patches, and combine them with a voting approach. The standard ASM is not able to take into account temporal information from previous frames therefore the tip contours are tracked by replacing the standard ASM with a hybrid active shape model (HASM) which is capable to take advantage of the temporal information. Initial experimental results on video sequences show that MF-HASM is more robust to local minimum problem and gives a higher accuracy than traditional single feature-based method in lip tracking problem.

Firstly, we use the correlation between each centre pixel and its neighboring pixels in 30 window in building the prior probability, and this centre pixel is used to construct the conditional density function. Finally, to estimate the posterior probabilities of each pixel, instead of using expectation maximization algorithm as usual, we present a new maximum likelihood neural network (MaxNet) to optimize the parameters by using the error back propagation. Extensive experimental results illustrate the better performance compared to mixture model based on Markov random fields.	[Nguyen, Thanh Minh; Wu, Q. M.

In the literature, Bayesian Mixtures of Experts (BME) was successfully used to represent the multimodal image-to-pose distributions. However, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that learns the BME model may converge to a suboptimal local maximum. And the quality of the final solution depends largely on the initial values. In this paper, we propose an efficient initialization method for BME learning. We first partition the training set so that each subset can be well modeled by a single expert and the total regression error is minimized. Then each expert and gate of BME model is initialized on a partition subset. Our initialization method is tested on both a quasi-synthetic dataset and a real dataset (HumanEva). Results show that it greatly reduces the computational cost in training while improves testing accuracy.

A special case arises in Syntactical Pattern Recognition when the points (proto-types) are represented by strings. However, when the edit distance is used, finding the median becomes a NP-Hard problem. Then, either the search is restricted to strings in the data (set-median) or some heuristic approach is applied. In this work we use the (conditional) stochastic edit distance instead of the plain edit distance. It is not yet known if in this case the problem is also NP-Hard so an approximation algorithm is described. The algorithm is based on the extension of the string structure to multistrings (strings of stochastic vectors where each element represents the probability of each symbol) to allow the use of the Expectation Maximization technique.

Here the data of interest are the speaker supervectors, where each supervector is a concatenation of all the mean vectors in the speaker's speaker-dependent (SD) model. One problem is that we often do not have enough speaker-specific data to establish the individual SD models (having unseen phones). To address this issue, an approach to eigenspace estimation by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in situations where the training samples contain missing values is proposed, applied to eigenvoice adaptation, and experimentally evaluated in this paper.

Under some approximation and relaxation conditions, large margin estimation (LME) of MMMs can be formulated as linear programming (LP) problems, which can be efficiently and reliably solved by many general optimization tools even for very large models. The text categorization experiments on the standard RCV1 text corpus show that the LME method of MMMs can largely improve classification accuracy over the traditional training method based on the EM algorithm. Comparing with the EM method, the proposed LME method can achieve over 20% relative error reduction on three independent test sets of RCV1.

We, first, segment the medical volume data using the Markov random field model and the ICM algorithm and extract the surface region of the object from a segmented volume data. Second, we use the hidden labeling variables and likelihood method to statistically model the intensity distribution of each voxel at the surface region. We adopt the Bernoulli probability model to formulate a prior distribution of the labeling variable for the transformed voxels. The Gaussian mixture model is taken as a probability distribution function for the intensity of the transformed voxel. We use the EM algorithm to get the proper estimators for the parameters of the complete-data log likelihood function. The EM algorithm consists of two steps: the E-step and M-step. In the E-step, we compute the posterior distribution of the labeling variable by taking the expectation for the log-likelihood function. Next, we drive the estimators for all of the parameters by maximizing this function iteratively in the M-step. Then, we define a new registration measure with the Q-function obtained by the EM algorithm. We evaluate the precision of the proposed approach by comparing the registration traces of the Q-function obtained from the original image and its transformed image with respect to x-translation and rotation. The experimental results show that our method has great potential power to register various medical images given by different modalities.

However, to solve ill-posed problems in the area of computer vision, a variety of methods has been proposed; some of the solutions are to estimate latent information or to apply model based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel method to reconstruct a 3D face from a single 2D face image based on pose estimation and a deformable model of 3D face shape. For 3D face reconstruction from a single 2D face image, it is the first task to estimate the depth lost by 2D projection of 3D faces. Applying the EM algorithm to facial landmarks in a 2D image, we propose a pose estimation algorithm to infer the pose parameters of rotation, scaling, and translation. After estimating the pose, much denser points are interpolated between the landmark points by a 3D deformable model and barycentric coordinates. As opposed to previous literature, our method can locate facial feature points automatically in a 2D facial image. Moreover, we also show that the proposed method for pose estimation can be successfully applied to 3D face reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can produce reliable results for reconstructing photorealistic 3D faces.

The method is based on a Gaussian hidden Markov random field (GHMRF) model that represents an advanced version of a finite Gaussian mixture (FGM) model as it encodes spatial information through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. To fit the GHMRF model an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used. We applied the method to a magnetic resonance data sets (each of them composed by T1-weighted, Contrast Enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted images) for a total of 49 tumor-contained slices. We tested GHMRF performances with respect to FGM by both a numerical and a clinical evaluation. Results show that the proposed method has a higher accuracy in quantifying lesion area than FGM and it can be applied in the evaluation of tumor response to therapy.

The joint probability distribution is modeled by a mixture of low dependence Bayesian networks, and maintained by an on-line EM-algorithm. Modeling the joint probability function by a mixture of low dependence Bayesian networks is motivated by two key observations. First, the probability distribution can be maintained with time cost linear in the number of data points and constant time per data point. Whereas other methods like Bayesian networks have polynomial time complexity. Secondly, looking at the literature there is empirical indication [1] that mixtures of Naive-Bayes structures can model the data as accurate as Bayesian networks. In this paper we relax the constraints of the mixture model of Naive-Bayes structures to that of the mixture models of arbitrary low dependence structures. Furthermore we propose an on-line algorithm for the maintenance of a mixture model of arbitrary Bayesian networks. We empirically show that speed-up is achieved with no decrease in performance.

In this paper, we present a normalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach for the problem of gene-based clustering. The normalized EM clustering also follows the framework of generative clustering models but for the data in a fixed manifold. We illustrate the effectiveness of the normalized EM on two real microarray data sets by comparing its clustering results with the ones produced by other related clustering algorithms. It is shown that the normalized EM performs better than the related algorithms in term of clustering outcomes.	[Phuong, N. M.; Tuan, H.

J	Pilla, RS; Kim, Y; Lee, H				Pilla, Ramani S.; Kim, Yongdai; Lee, Hakbae			On casting random-effects models in a survival framework	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						censoring; logistic random-effects model; mixture model; multivariate Gaussian; multivariate t; parameter expansion; PX-EM algorithm; survival time; variance components	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONVERGENCE	Logistic random-effects models are often employed in the analysis of correlated binary data. However, fitting these models is challenging, since the marginal distribution of the response variables is analytically intractable. Often, the random effects are treated as missing data for constructing traditional data augmentation algorithms. We create a novel alternative data augmentation scheme that simplifies the likelihood-based inference for logistic random-effects models. We cast the random-effects model in a 'survival framework', where each binary response is the censoring indicator for a survival time that is treated as additional missing data. Under this augmentation framework, the conditional expectations are free of unknown regression parameters. Such a construction has a particular advantage that, in the case of discrete covariates, the score equations for regression parameters have analytical solutions. Consequently, one does not need to resort to a search algorithm in estimating the regression parameters. We further create a parameter expansion scheme for logistic random-effects models under this survival data augmentation framework. The proposed data augmentation is illustrated when the random-effects distribution follows a multivariate Gaussian and multivariate t-distribution. The performance of the method is assessed through simulation studies and a real data analysis.

Labelled instances however are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there has been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labelled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice. The paper discusses various important approaches to semi-supervised learning such as self-training, co-training(CO), expectation maximization (EM) ,CO-EM, Then how graph-based methods are useful is explained All semi-supervised learning methods are classified into generative and discriminative methods. But experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm gives better classification accuracy.

Emphasis is given to the underdetermined and sparse case, i.e., fewer observations than regression coefficients and the belief that only a few regression coefficients are non-zero. The fast update allows for a low-complexity method of reporting a set of models with high posterior probability and their exact posterior odds. As a byproduct, this Bayesian model averaged approach yields the minimum mean squared error estimate of unknown coefficients. Algorithm complexity is linear in the number of unknown coefficients, the number of observations and the number of nonzero coefficients. For the case in which hyperparameters are unknown, a maximum likelihood estimate is found by a generalized expectation maximization algorithm.

The first topic is the use of non-blind deconvolution to improve the clarity of the data, particularly in the direction perpendicular to the individual B-scans. The second topic is strain imaging. We present a robust and efficient approach to the estimation and display of axial strain information. For deconvolution, we calculate an estimate of the point-spread function at each depth in the image using Field II. This is used as part of an Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework in which the ultrasound scatterer field is modelled as the product of (a) a piecewise smooth function and (b) a fine-grain varying function. In the E step, a Wiener filter is used to estimate the scatterer field based on an assumed piecewise smooth component. In the M step, wavelet de-noising is used to estimate the piecewise smooth component from the scatterer field. For strain imaging, we use a quasi-static approach with efficient phase-based algorithms. Our contributions lie in robust and efficient 3D displacement tracking, point-wise quality-weighted averaging, and a stable display that shows not only strain but also an indication of the quality of the data at each point in the image. This enables clinicians to see where the strain estimate is meaningful and where it is mostly noise. For deconvolution, we present in-vivo images and simulations with quantitative performance measures. With the blurred 3D data taken as 0dB, we get an improvement in signal to noise ratio of 4.6dB with a Wiener filter alone, 4.36dB with the ForWaRD algorithm and 5.18dB with our EM algorithm. For strain imaging we show images based on 2D and 3D data and describe how full 3D analysis can be performed in about 20 seconds on a typical computer. We will also present initial results of our clinical study to explore the applications of our system in our local hospital.

Robust Channel Tracking in Fast Fading MIMO channels	GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 08)	NOV 30-DEC 04, 2008	New Orleans, LA	IEEE				Channel estimation for Alamouti space frequency coded (ASFC) 2x2 and 2x1 MIMO OFDM systems, employing Decision Directed Channel tracking (DDCT) for high fade rates and long frame durations is studied here. Errors in the regression matrix (i.e. equalisation errors) have a Gaussian distribution, but due to error propagation problem of DDCT at high fade rates and long symbol durations, large deviations from the Gaussian model is observed. Hence the problem of channel estimation can be formulated as an outlier contaminated Gaussian linear regression problem. Most of the classical estimators like Least squares (LS) and Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm perform poorly in presence of outliers. Moreover, for a MIMO system the source of outliers are the erroneous decisions of any of the multiple input channels. Here, we propose to use the EM algorithm to partition multiple input channel into independent estimations for each transmit-receive antenna pair and provide an iterative framework for solving the multiple regression problem. EM algorithm is made robust using the Huber's M principle (for the E and the M steps) and it is shown analytically that mean square error (MSE) performance improves as compared to existing schemes which assume Gaussian noise. The simulated symbol error rate (SER) and MSE performances demonstrate the significant gains of the proposed robust EM algorithm over existing DDCT techniques at high normalised fade rates for the given system.

This paper proposes to model the shape of a single trajectory as a sequence of angles described using a Mixture of Von Mises (MoVM) distribution. A complete EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm is derived for MoVM parameters estimation and an on-line version proposed to meet real time requirement. Maximum-A-Posteriori is used to encode the trajectory as a sequence of symbols corresponding to the MoVM components. Iterative k-medoids clustering groups trajectories in a variable number of similarity classes. The similarity is computed aligning (with dynamic programming) two sequences and considering as symbol-to-symbol distance the Bhattacharyya distance between von Mises distributions.

Classification of Light Charged Particles in a Nuclear Physics Experiment	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE International Conference on Control Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	SEP 03-05, 2008	San Antonio, CA	IEEE			IDENTIFICATION	The problem considered in this work is Pulse Shape Discrimination in a nuclear physics experiment. Each nucleus produced in the collision of a heavy ion beam over a target enters a detector and creates a tight pulse signal measured by a digital acquisition system. The pulse shape contains complete information on the hitting particle, but it includes also the dynamics of the charge preamplifier used in the measurement. In this work, a complete procedure for the particle identification is proposed. First, a model of the charge preamplifier is estimated using experiments specifically devoted to this aim. Then, the measured pulses are filtered through the inverse model of the preamplifier and, then, a subspace method is used to estimate a linear model of the light generation process in the detector. Finally, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used for particle classification on the basis of the estimated parameters of the light pulses. This work focuses on Light Charged Particles (LCP), which are the most difficult to detect and to classify. All the experiments are made with the large detector array CHIMERA (Charge Heavy Ions Mass and Energy Resolving Array).

In some situations, the physical one-to-one correspondence may not exist due to the presence of "outlier" objects (called gross outliers) that appear in one image but not the other. In this paper, a novel robust method is presented to address the problem of tumor-like gross outliers in non-rigid image registration. First, two salient point sets are extracted from the two images to be registered, and classified by means of clustering analysis which is based on Gaussian mixture models and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then by means of joint saliency map that represents the joint salient regions of the overlapping volume of the two images, the regions including tumor-like gross outliers could be automatically recognized. After screening out of salient points and elimination of outlier points, some stable control points that well represent the corresponding structures within the joint salient regions of the two images could be obtained. By iteratively finding correspondences between the control points in the joint salient regions, the smooth deformation field is approximated based on radial basis functions (RBFs) with compact support until the convergence to the steady-state solution is achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to recover local deformation caused by tumor resection in brain.

This suggests the importance of parallel data analysis and data mining applications with good multicore, cluster and grid performance. This paper considers data clustering, mixture models and dimensional reduction presenting a unified framework applicable to bioinformatics, cheminformatics and demographics. Deterministic annealing is used to lessen effect of local minima.

The transmitted signal waveform of interest is assumed to be known at the receiver side, and we address the problem of the channel impulse response estimation in a bayesian framework: the channel is modeled via a Bernoulli-Gaussian process, and estimation is achieved via a Gibbs sampler. As the processing of PASSTIME data emphasizes distorsions of the transmitted signal, we add a preliminary processing step for estimating the distorded waveform by means of a simple iterative procedure that alternatively estimates the channel impulse response via a Matching Pursuit approach, and the waveform itself by maximizing the likelihood, The proposed algorithms are applied to PASSTIME records, and prove to be very satisfactory.			olivier.rabaste@enst-bretagne.fr; thierry.chonavel@enst-bretagne.fr	Tseng, Yao-Ting/A-1423-2008				Akaike H., 1973, P 2 INT S INF THEOR, P267; BESAG J, 1986, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V48, P259; Bourguignon S., 2005, P IEEE WORKSH STAT S, P811; CHALMOND B, 1989, PATTERN RECOGN, V22, P747, DOI 10.1016/0031-3203(89)90011-3; Cheng QS, 1996, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V34, P377; Cotter SF, 2002, IEEE T COMMUN, V50, P374, DOI 10.1109/26.990897; DEMPSTER AP, 1977, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V39, P1; FEDER M, 1988, IEEE T ACOUST SPEECH, V36, P477, DOI 10.1109/29.1552; Fuchs JJ, 1999, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V47, P237, DOI 10.1109/78.738263; GEMAN S, 1984, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V6, P721; Ghosh M, 1996, IEEE T COMMUN, V44, P145, DOI 10.1109/26.486604; IDIER J, 1990, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V28, P975, DOI 10.1109/36.58988; KIRKPATRICK S, 1983, SCIENCE, V220, P671, DOI 10.1126/science.220.4598.671; KORMYLO JJ, 1982, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V28, P482, DOI 10.1109/TIT.1982.1056496; LAVIELLE M, 1993, SIGNAL PROCESS, V33, P67, DOI 10.1016/0165-1684(93)90079-P; MALLAT SG, 1993, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V41, P3397, DOI 10.1109/78.258082; MARROQUIN J, 1987, J AM STAT ASSOC, V82, P76, DOI 10.2307/2289127; MAZET V, 2005, THESIS U H POINCARE; MUNK W, 1979, DEEP-SEA RES, V26, P123, DOI 10.1016/0198-0149(79)90073-6; Poor H.

Analytic system matrix resolution modeling in PET: An application to Rb-82 cardiac imaging	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING: FROM NANO TO MACRO, VOLS 1-4	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	MAY 14-17, 2008	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE		positron emission tomography; image reconstruction; image enhancement; positrons; compton scattering	POINT-SOURCE MEASUREMENTS; EM ALGORITHM; RECONSTRUCTION	An area of growing interest in PET imaging has been that of incorporating increasingly more accurate system matrix elements into the reconstruction task, thus arriving at images of higher quality. This work explores application of an analytic approach which individually models and combines the various resolution degrading phenomenon in PET (inter-crystal scattering, inter-crystal penetration, photon non-collinearity and positron range), and does not require extensive experimental measurements and/or simulations. The approach is able to produce considerable enhancements in image quality. The reconstructed resolution is seen to improve from 5.1mm-7.7mm across the field-of-view (FoV) to approximate to 3.5mm nearly uniformly across the FoV. Furthermore, phantom studies indicate clearly improved images, while similar significant improvements are seen for the particular task of Rb-82 cardiac imaging.	[Rahmim, A.; Lodge, M.

Our approach first smoothens the likelihood function and then applies the EM algorithm to obtain a promising solution on this smoothened surface. Using the most promising solutions as initial guesses, the EM algorithm is applied again on the original likelihood. This effective optimization procedure eliminates extensive search in the non-promising regions of the parameter space. Empirical results on some standard datasets show the reduction of the number of local maxima and improvements in the log-likelihood values.

The proposed method consists of three steps: extraction of the arterial lumen centerline, segmentation of the lumen and arterial wall based on a locally-adaptive mixture-model using the expectation-maximization algorithm, and detection of soft plaques based on effective cross-sectional areas of the lumen and of the wall. Preliminary results using clinical acquisitions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Classifier dependent feature preprocessing methods	MOBILE MULTIMEDIA/IMAGE PROCESSING, SECURITY, AND APPLICATIONS 2008	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security, and Applications	MAR 18-20, 2008	Orlando, FL	SPIE		feature ranking; feature extraction; feature extraction; data preparation; outlier removal; expectation maximization; Fisher's linear discriminant and Parzen window		In mobile applications, computational complexity is an issue that limits sophisticated algorithms from being implemented on these devices. This paper provides an initial solution to applying pattern recognition systems on mobile devices by combining existing preprocessing algorithms for recognition. In pattern recognition systems, it is essential to properly apply feature preprocessing tools prior to training classification models in an attempt to reduce Computational complexity and improve the overall classification accuracy. The feature preprocessing tools extended for the mobile environment are feature ranking, feature extraction, data preparation and outlier removal. Most desktop systems today are capable of processing a majority of the available classification algorithms without concern of processing while the same is not true on mobile platforms. As an application of pattern recognition for mobile devices, the recognition system targets the problem of steganalysis, determining if an image contains hidden information. The measure of performance shows that feature preprocessing increases the overall steganalysis classification accuracy by an average of 22%. The methods in this paper are tested on a workstation and a Nokia 6620 (Symbian operating system) camera phone with similar results.

Such system would have to make safety critical decisions based on poor quality images shot in real-time from the unstable moving vehicles. The proposed system offers a simple yet very effective detection methodology based on mixture of Gaussians (MoG) aided by an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm. The algorithm operates on a number of features built by aggregation of different variations of the first and second order pixel gradients related to the aggregated templates of pedestrian and non-pedestrian classes. For each class the algorithm fits a fixed number of clusters and using Gaussian kernels optimises the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture model such that the probabilities of belonging to the intra-class clusters is maximised. Given a new image the system instantly generates relative features and uses mixture model to build posterior probability densities for all clusters and after aggregation and renormalisation, posterior class probabilities. The system has been fine-tuned against its parameters and feature subsets and tested using almost 10000 real images provided by DaimlerChrysler. Reaching the testing performance in excess of 95% the model was announced the winner of the NISIS Competition 2007.

The proposed real-coded variable string length genetic clustering technique (VGALS clustering) is able to evolve the number of clusters present in the data set automatically. Here assignment of points to different clusters are done based on the line symmetry based distance rather than the Euclidean distance. The cluster centers are encoded in the chromosomes, whose value may vary. A newly developed line symmetry based cluster validity index, LineSym-index, is used as a measure or 'goodness' of the corresponding partitioning. This validity index is able to correctly indicate the presence of clusters of different sizes as long as they are line symmetrical. A Kd-tree based data structure is used to reduce the complexity of computing the line symmetry distance. The proposed method is applied on several simulated T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density normal magnetic resonance brain images. The proposed method is able to detect most of the regions well. Superiority of the proposed method over Fuzzy C-means and Expectation Maximization clustering algorithms are demonstrated quantitatively. The automatic segmentation obtained by VGALS clustering technique is also compared with the available ground truth information.

The different clustering algorithm generally used in biological science does not take into consideration the underlying probability distribution of the data. In this sense, they are heuristic in nature. In this work we proposed a clustering algorithm based on EM Algorithm. It gives 28% less misclassification than the K-means algorithm (which is mostly use in Bio science). We have also shown on a real data set that this algorithm can be efficiently used for detecting the genes which are responsible for a particular disease.

According to this prior, the local differences of the contextual mixing proportions (i.e. the probabilities of class labels) are Student's t-distributed. The generative properties of the Student's t-pdf allow this prior to impose smoothness and simultaneously model the edges between the segments of the image. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm is used for Bayesian inference. An important feature of this algorithm is that all the parameters are automatically estimated from the data in closed form. Numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model for image segmentation as compared to standard GMM-based approaches and to GMM segmentation techniques with "standard" spatial smoothness constraints.

There has been much work on finding those correlations, including linear and nonlinear correlation clusters. In this paper we present KLNCC, a novel nonlinear correlation clustering algorithm which adopts a dynamic two-phase approach. In the first phase, we find microclusters by EM algorithm. In the second phase, these microclusters are merged in a bottom-up manner resulting in a dendrogram. The final clustering is determined by the users. When merging microclusters, we adopt the KL-divergence as the distance between two microclusters, which has explicit form when we use the EM clustering algorithm to find the microclusters. Our experimental evaluation on several real datasets demonstrates that KLNCC indeed discovers meaningful and accurate nonlinear correlation clusters.

We assume that the channel is unknown at the receiver Thus, we develop a AMP iterative burst by burst channel estimation algorithm using the Eapectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It needs a convenient representation of the channel based on the Karhunen-Loeve expansion theorem. It also needs a posteriori probabilities (APPs) on the coded symbols. These probabilities are provided by the MAP decoder at each iteration of the receiver. Simulations show that the performance of our iterative receiver approaches the performance obtained when the channel is perfectly known.

Performing robust statistical analysis on such data is particularly challenging when the number of observed meetings is much smaller than the number of people in the network. Our novel approach to anomaly detection in this high-dimensional setting is based on hypergraphs, an important extension of graphs which allows edges to connect more than two vertices simultaneously. In particular, the distribution of meetings is modeled as a two-component mixture of a "nominal" distribution and a distribution of anomalous events. A variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm is then used to assess the likelihood of each observation being anomalous. The computational complexity of the proposed method scales linearly with both the number of observed events and the number of people in the network, making it well-suited to very large networks, and it requires no tuning. The algorithm is validated on synthetic data and it is shown that, for a useful class of distributions, it can outperform related state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection performance and computational complexity.

When all phrase pairs are estimated (no length cut-off), this estimator slightly outperforms the heuristic estimator.

As HGMEM performs, it is efficient in reducing a large mixture of Gaussians into a smaller mixture while still preserving the component structure of the original mode. Compared with HGMEM algorithm, it takes covariance into account in Expectation-Step without affecting the Maximization-Step, avoiding excessive expansion of some components, and we simply call it Cov-HGMEM. Image retrieval experiments indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms previously suggested method.

Basic human actions, such as walking or standing still, are frequently observed at particular locations in an observation scene. By observing human actions for a long period of time, we can identify regions that are more likely to be occupied by a person. These regions have a high probability of a person existing compared with others. The key idea of our approach is to incorporate this probability as a bias in generating samples under the framework of a particle filter for tracking people. We call this bias the environmental existence map (EEM). The EEM is iteratively updated at every frame by using the tracking results from our tracker which leads to more stable tracking of people. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a new method based on Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed for segmentation of MR brain images. We consider the low-level MRF as a linear combination of Gaussians (LCG) with positive and negative component, and we use the modified Expectation-maximization (MEM) algorithm to estimate the mean, variance and proportion for each distribution. The MEM algorithm is sensitive to initial parameters, so we improve the method of initialization. In high-level MRF, we use Potts model to describe the label image. By using the Bayesian maximum a posterior (AMP) rule, the segmentation problem is converted to precisely identify the models parameters. The MAP estimation is obtained using the Metroplis algorithm to search the optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for segmentation of MR brain images.

However, the insulator infrared image is always contaminated by noise. In this paper, an effective denoising algorithm for contaminated insulator infrared images is proposed. First, the component-wise expectation maximization is used to adoptively select the optimal number of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) components, and a more accurate model is obtained. Then an insulator infrared image denoising algorithm based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is derived. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithm is tested. Experimental results we obtained confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the traditional EM-based GMM methods and threshold-based denoising methods.

A continuous stream of track data is used for online and on-demand creation and training of HMMs, where tracks may be of highly variable length and scenes may be very complex with an unknown number of motion patterns. We show how these HMMs can be used for on-line clustering of tracks that represent normal behavior and for detection of deviant tracks. The track clustering algorithm uses a Hierarchical Agglomerative HMM Clustering technique that jointly determines all the HMM parameters (including the number of states) via an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and the Akaike Information Criteria. Results are demonstrated on a highly complex scene containing dozens of routes, significant occlusions and hundreds of moving objects.	[Swears, Eran; Hoogs, Anthony; Perera, A. G.

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used in the alignment step of Cryo-EM reconstructions. The EM step is often a serious computational bottleneck for 3D reconstructions. This paper proposes a computationally adaptive version of the EM algorithm that speeds up the algorithm by a factor of 20 - 30. Experiments with noisy real-world data are included to show that the algorithm achieves this speedup without any significant loss of accuracy. Such speed ups are significant, allowing the reconstruction to converge in cpu-days rather than cpu-months.

In order to recover high-resolution relative depth without using the complex Markov random field (MRF) that includes a line process, we construct a recovery algorithm based on a belief propagation scheme using a multi-scale Bayesian network. With this algorithm, relative 3-D motion between a camera and an object can be determined together with relative depth, and the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization. (MAP-EM) algorithm is effectively used to determine a suitable approximation.

In this paper we focus on the learning aspect of the parser and propose a learning algorithm based on the Expectation Maximization technique where the dynamic programming (DP) technique is used for efficient process. We apply the proposed algorithm to acquire a stochastic parser for information extraction from scanned document images and show that learned stochastic grammar extracts bibliographic data with high accuracy.			takasu@nii.ac.jp					BAEZAYATES R, 1999, MODERN INFROMATION R; BUNKE H, 1997, HDB CHARACTER RECOGI; KRISHNAMOORTHY M, 1992, IEEE COMPUT, V25, P10; Nagy G., 1984, P 7 INT C PATT REC M, P347; NAGY G, 1992, COMPUTER, V25, P10, DOI 10.1109/2.144436; NEVES LAP, 2007, P ACM S APPL COMP SA, P622, DOI 10.1145/1244002.1244144; Platt JC, 2000, ADV NEUR IN, P61; STORY G, 1992, IEEE COMPUT, V25, P17; Takasu A., 1996, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, DOI 10.1109/ICPR.1996.546933; Takasu A., 2003, Proceedings 2003 Joint Conference on Digital Libraries; TAKASU A, 2008, P 23 ACM S APPL COMP, P447, DOI 10.1145/1363686.1363795; TAKASU A, 1994, INT C PATT RECOG, P463, DOI 10.1109/ICPR.1994.576983; Vapnik V.N., 1995, NATURE STAT LEARNING; VISWANATHAN M, 1996, P DOC REC, V3, P101; Wang Y., 2002, P 11 INT C WORLD WID, P242; Wang YL, 2004, PATTERN RECOGN, V37, P1479, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2004.01.012; Zanibbi R., 2004, International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, V7, DOI 10.1007/s10032-004-0120-9	17	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1082-3409	978-0-7695-3440-4	PROC INT C TOOLS ART			2008							333	340		10.1109/ICTAI.2008.106		8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering	Computer Science	BIR42	WOS:000262214700044

A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT HMM-BASED HANDWRITING VERIFICATION SYSTEM	2008 IEEE INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5	IEEE INSTRUMENTATION & MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	25th IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference	MAY 12-15, 2008	Victoria, CANADA	IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc		handwriting verification; hidden Markov models; expectation maximization; Viterbi algorithm	INFORMATION	In this paper, we present a novel/framework for HMM-based handwriting verification in which the training is performed using a one-shot algorithm for segmentation and HMM parameter estimation using a constrained k-means clustering procedure, instead of the recursive expectation maximization algorithm. This new framework allows training based on a single observation set which results in a straight forward reference model construction and elimination of computationally expensive re-training. Results of a human study using this verification system for handwritten signature and password verification demonstrate that this new efficient approach is still able to maintain high accuracy of 99 % while only three training sets were used.

Registration of these acquisitions forms a vectorial volume, which contains a more complete anatomical information. In order to outline the anatomical structures, multi-dimensional classification is necessary for analyzing this vectorial volume. Because of the partial volume effect (PVE), probability distributions are assigned to the different material types within this vectorial volume instead of a definite material distribution. Gaussian mixture model is often used in probability classification problems to model such distributions, but it relies only on the intensity distributions, which will lead a misclassification on the boundaries and inhomogeneous regions with noises. In order to solve this problem, a neighborhood weighted Gaussian mixture model is proposed in this paper. Expectation Maximization algorithm is used as optimization method. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can get a better classification result and less affected by the noise.

Because the basic grammar of Metrical PCFG model is too simple, we also propose a grammar expansion method that improves the grammar by duplicating a nonterminal symbol and its rules. At first, a simple PCFG model which that represent the metrical structure by a derivation just like parse tree in natural language processing. The grammar expansion operator duplicates a symbol and its rules in the PCFG model. Then the parameters of PCFG are estimated by EM algorithm. We conducted two experiments. The first one shows the expansion method specialized symbols and rules to adapt to the training data. Rhythmic patterns in a piece were represented by expanded symbols. And in the second experiment, we investigated how the expansion method improves performance of prediction for new pieces with large corpus.

Traditional re-ranking which based on pseudo relevance feedback face a common difficulty how many the top k is. In this paper, we regard document re-ranking as classification technique based on PU learning when the number of positive document is quite small. We focus the ranking position of each document in initial retrieval. It depends on probability of classifier via EM algorithm. The result shows the method effectively upgrades the initial rank position for the relevant documents.

One bottleneck in using BN is that learning the BN model parameters often requires a large amount of reliable and representative training data, which proves to be difficult to acquire for many computer vision tasks. On the other hand, there is often available qualitative prior knowledge about the model. Such knowledge comes either from domain experts based on their experience or from various physical or geometric constraints that govern the objects we try to model. Unlike the quantitative prior, the qualitative prior is often ignored due to the difficulty of incorporating them into the model learning process. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form solution to systematically combine the limited training data with some generic qualitative knowledge for BN parameter learning. To validate our method, we compare it with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method under sparse data and with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm under incomplete data respectively. To further demonstrate its applications for computer vision, we apply it to learn a BN model for facial Action Unit (AU) recognition from real image data. The experimental results show that with simple and generic qualitative constraints and using only a small amount of training data, our method can robustly and accurately estimate the BN model parameters.

The expectation-maximization (EM)-based estimation algorithm is applied to an interference-limited network with multiple source-relay pairs. After the initial blind estimation, the soft decoder output is used to recompute the channel coefficient and noise-PSD values. The cooperative system with blind EM estimation is found to have a decoding performance comparable to that obtained with time-multiplexed and superimposed pilot-assisted channel estimation (PACE) methods. At the same time, the proposed scheme is shown to have a higher throughput than the PACE methods considered for comparison.

Doubly Iterative LDPC-Coded DS-CDMA Receivers with Coherent Detection, EM Channel Estimation, and No Pilot Symbols	2008 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE: MILCOM 2008, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2008)	NOV 16-19, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE			FADING CHANNELS; INTERFERENCE	In this paper, we describe direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems with M-ary modulation in which channel estimation, coherent demodulation, and decoding are iteratively performed without the use of any training or pilot symbols. An expectation-maximization channel-estimation algorithm for the fading amplitude and interference-plus-noise power spectral density (PSD) is proposed for CDMA systems with low-density parity-check codes. The elimination of pilot symbols simplifies the system design and allows either an enhancement in information throughput or greater spectral efficiency by increasing the information-symbol duration. After initial estimates of the fading amplitude and noise PSD are obtained from the received symbols, subsequent values of these parameters are iteratively updated by using the soft feedback from the channel decoder. The updated estimates are combined with the received symbols and iteratively passed to the decoder. Although the bit error rates of the proposed systems may be slightly larger than those of comparable systems with pilot-assisted channel estimation, the throughputs are higher.

Iterative EM channel estimation for turbo-coded DS-CDMA receiver under time-varying interference	2008 INTERNATIONAL ITG WORKSHOP ON SMART ANTENNAS			English	Proceedings Paper	International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas	FEB 23-27, 2008	Darmstadt, GERMANY	ITG				This paper proposes a scheme of iteratively obtaining an estimate of channel coefficients and noise power spectral density (PSD) using expectation maximization (EM) for turbo-coded code-division multiple access receivers. The EM channel estimation is tested under two scenarios - time-varying interference environment with pilot symbol-aided modulation, and a single-user environment without any pilot symbols. For the time-varying interference scenario, the initial estimate of channel coefficient and the noise PSI) are obtained from pilots and further estimations are refined using turbo decoder soft outputs. In contrast, pilot symbols are eliminated for the single-user iterative receiver with initial - estimation performed from the received code symbols, followed by the iterative updates using the feedback from the turbo decoder as before.

The number of clusters and initial cluster centers are two critical parameters that influence the reliability of clustering results highly. We propose a Clustering-Oriented Star Coordinate Translation (COSCT) method to help users determining the two parameters more confidently. Through COSCT all objects from a multi-dimensional space are adaptively translated to a 2D star-coordinate plane, so that the clustering parameterization can be easily conducted by observing the clustering phenomenon in the plane. To enhance the cluster-displaying quality of the star-coordinate plane, the feature weighting and coordinate arrangement procedures are developed. The effectiveness of the COSCT method is demonstrated using a set of experiments.

Parametric density estimation using EM algorithm for collaborative spectrum sensing	2008 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE RADIO ORIENTED WIRELESS NETWORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications	MAY 15-17, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Huawei				Collaborative sensing of spectral occupancy can increase accuracy and relax the required sensitivity of individual sensing units. Collaborative sensing requires knowledge about the densities of collected sensing statistics to form the correct decision statistics for the optimum likelihood ratio test. In this paper, a parametric density estimation scheme using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters of densities that are drawn from a given family. When the log-likelihood function for the EM algorithm satisfies a certain condition, the maximization procedure is shown to require only a weighted sum of the collected sensing statistics. Numerical examples show that in various scenarios the proposed EM algorithm produces more accurate estimates than the sample average does.

Among many proposed approaches towards solving the genotype phasing problem, PHASE and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are the most commonly used methods to obtain haplotype phase. This study has applied both methods to two important genetic regions - Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Cystic Fibrosis (CF) - with 166 (spans 51kb) and 238 (spans 188kb) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) respectively, genotyped from 90 unrelated individuals. For analysis, the phased haplotypes from the PHASE and EM algorithms were used to observe the level of difference. The analyses found a significant difference in allele frequency (p < 0.001 for IL-1 and p < 0.05 for CF). In contrast to other comparison studies, the analysis was extended to find variability in common haplotype blocks. In comparison between the two algorithms, the performance of the PHASE algorithm is more robust than the EM-algorithin.

The guard interval is filled with pilot symbols and the remaining part of the pilot symbols is put on some of the OFDM carriers. To start up the EM algorithm an initial channel estimate is obtained by using only the pilot symbols. Then the EM algorithm is applied until convergence is reached. The performance of this estimator is compared with the performance of the iterative joint data-aided (DA) / decision-directed (DD) estimator proposed in [1]. The EM algorithm converges to the performance of the all pilot estimator for lower SNR than the iterative joint DA/DD estimator, but the gain in performance results in a higher computational complexity.

In this paper we rely on a probabilistic imaging model that distinguishes between inliers and outliers, and formulate the problem as a Maximum-Likelihood estimation problem. To signal which imaging model to use a hidden binary inlier map is introduced, which, to account for the fact that inlier/outlier pixels typically group together, is modelled as a Markov Random Field. To make inference of model parameters and hidden variables tractable a mean field Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used. If for each pixel we add the scaled normal, i.e. albedo and normal combined, to the model parameters, it would not be possible to obtain a confidence estimate in the result. Instead, each scaled normal is added as a hidden variable, the distribution of which, approximated by a Gaussian, is also estimated in the EM algorithm. The covariance matrix of the recovered approximate Gaussian distribution serves as a confidence estimate of the scaled normal. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness or our approach.

Accelerating the computationally intensive reconstruction process improves the medical work flow, matches the reconstruction speed to the acquisition speed, and allows fast batch processing and interactive or near-interactive parameter tuning. Recently, much effort has been focused on using the computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general purpose computations. This paper presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reconstruction based on an ordered-subset expectation maximization algorithm. The algorithm uses models for the point-spread-function (PSF) to improve spatial resolution in the reconstruction images. Instead of computing the PSF directly, it is modeled as efficient blurring of slabs on the CPU in order to accelerate the process. The algorithm for the calculation of accumulated attenuation factors that allows correcting the generated volume according to the attenuation properties of the volume is optimized for processing on the CPU. Since these factors can be reused between different iterations, a cache is used that is adapted to different sizes of the video memory so that only those factors have to be recomputed that do not fit onto,graphics memory These improvements make the reconstruction of typical SPECT volume near interactive.

The forward model of DOT is described by the diffusion approximation of radiative transform equation (RTE) while the DOT is to recover optical parameters of a medium from the boundary measurements induced by external near-infared (NIB,) light. In this paper, we propose a mathematic model of DOT and then give a novel iterative reconstruction method of the proposed model. The new iterative reconstruction method is based on the assumption that the measurement noise is Poissonian while previous iterative reconstruction methods are mostly base on the assumption that the measurement noise is Gaussian, and are of least-squares type. The proposed algorithm is a variant of the well-known EM algorithm. It can also be used to deal with the incomplete boundary measurements.

However, the EM algorithm may be trapped into a local maximum of the likelihood and even leads to a wrong result if the number of components is not appropriately set. Recently, the competitive EM (CEM) algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, a new kind of split-and-merge learning algorithm with certain competitive mechanism on estimated components of the EM algorithm, has been constructed to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, we construct a new CEM algorithm through the Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) harmony stop criterion, instead of the previously used MML criterion. It is demonstrated by the simulation experiments that our proposed CEM algorithm outperforms the original one on both model selection and parameter estimation.

First, the latent variables in latent Dirichlet location model for cluster ensemble(LDA-CE) are defined and some terminologies are defined. Second,. Variational approximation inference for LDA-CE is stated in detail. Third, base on the variational approximation inference, we design a distributed and parallelled EM algorithm for cluster ensemble(DPEM). Finally, some datasets from UCI are chosen for experiment, Compared with cluster-based similarity partitioning algorithm (CSPA),hyper-graph partitioning algorithm(HGPA) and meta-clustering algorithm(MCLA), the results show DPEM algorithm does work better and DPEM can work distributed and parallelled, so DPEM can protect privacy information more and can save time.

The idea is that for cluster ensemble we think every base clustering is not equally important, and thus we give the different weight to each base clustering and assume that the results of each base clustering is a multinomial ditribution. First, we state a soft cluster ensemble model of WLDA and the latent variables in WLDA is defined for cluster ensemble. Second, WLDA is inferred with variation approximation and EM algorithm for WLDA is stated. Third, we choose some dataset of large number of instances for experiment.

In this paper we propose a new text clustering algorithm SFFCM which use the supervised feature selection method to select the feature. The SFFCM is based on the EM algorithm. In the E-step, to calculate the expectation, we use the supervised feature selection algorithm to calculate the relevancy score for each term. In the M step we use the FCM algorithm to obtain the cluster results based on the selected terms. Our experimental results on standard document clustering benchmark corpuses: OHSUMED, 20-Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 show that the SFFCM text clustering algorithm can generate better clustering results than other control clustering methods and the supervised feature selection can improve the performance of the text clustering algorithm. We also propose a supervised feature selection measure CRF-CHI measure which is based on the chi(2) statistic and the category relative frequency. The experimental results also confirm that the CRF-CHI is an effective supervised feature selection measure.

However the. existing semantic smoothing model is not effective for partitional clustering because it can not assign fit weight to "general" word in a collection. In this paper inspired by mixture probability model, we put forward a mixture language model for document clustering. The new model can alleviate the effect of "general" word, simultaneously, it can integrate the context information and solve the polysemy problems in a document. Based the new model, an EM algorithm for partitional clustering is present. The experimental results show our algorithms are more effective than the previous methods to improve the cluster quality.

This study proposed a simultaneous equation model (SEM) and used the expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate. We then constructed a simulation to compare the performance of estimates of price elasticity using SEM with those estimates from the two-part model and the sample selection model. The simulation shows that the estimates of price elasticity by SEM are more precise than those by the sample selection model and the two-part model when the model includes limited independent variables. Finally, we analyzed a real example of cigarette consumption as an application.

While this approach is today's standard for value function-based methods, fewer approaches are known that apply similar reductions to policy search methods. Recently, it has been shown that immediate RL problems can be solved by reward-weighted regression, and that the resulting algorithm is an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with strong guarantees. In this paper, we extend this algorithm to the episodic case and show that it can be used in the context of LSTM recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The resulting RNN training algorithm is equivalent to a weighted self-modeling supervised learning technique. We focus on partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) where it is essential that the policy is nonstationary in order to be optimal. We show that this new reward-weighted logistic regression used in conjuction with an RNN architecture can solve standard benchmark POMDPs with ease.

The base distributions used were normal, lognormal and gamma. The expectation-maximization algorithm was used to learn the model parameters. Experiments with articifial data were performed to ascertain the robustness of learning. Applying the procedure to data from two publicly available microarray datasets, we conclude that lognormal performed the best function for modeling the marginal distributions of gene expression. Our results should provide guidances in the development of informed priors or gene specific normalization for use with gene network inference algorithms.

Bayesian Clustering and Tracking of Neuronal Signals for Autonomous Neural Interfaces	47TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL, 2008 (CDC 2008)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 09-11, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO	IEEE, Soc Ind & Appl Math (SIAM), Inst Operat Res & Management Sci (INFORMS), Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engn (SICE), European Union Control Assoc (EUCA), Taylor & Francis Grp, StatoilHydro	IEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS)		ACTION-POTENTIALS; CONTROL ALGORITHM; SPIKE DETECTION	This paper introduces a new, unsupervised method for sorting and tracking the non-stationary spike signals of individual neurons in multi-unit extracellular recordings. While this method may be applied to a variety of problems that arise in the field of neural interfaces, its development is motivated by a new class of autonomous neural recording devices. The core of the proposed strategy relies upon an extension of a traditional expectation-maximization (EM) mixture model optimization to incorporate clustering results from the preceding recording interval in a Bayesian manner. Explicit filtering equations for the case of a Gaussian mixture are derived. Techniques using prior data to seed the EM iterations and to select the appropriate model class are also developed. As a natural byproduct of the sorting method, current and prior signal clusters can be matched over time in order to track persisting neurons. Applications of this signal classification method to recordings from macaque parietal cortex show that it provides significantly more consistent clustering and tracking results than traditional methods.

A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel measurement system is used to determine the statistical accuracy of the indoor AOA estimation when performed at an 802.11n wireless access point (AP). Two different channel parameter estimation algorithms are used to perform AOA estimation; a simple maximum-likelihood (ML) scheme and the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) technique. Results indicate that general channel parameter estimation algorithms, such as SAGE, are ill suited to estimate AOA for positioning purposes. However, results show that with the use of a specialized channel parameter estimation algorithm, such as the simple ML algorithm, quality AOA estimates for positioning might be achieved with low computational complexity. A positioning simulation that incorporates the AOA estimates from the simple ML algorithm achieves a positioning accuracy of 1.7 m with the help of an extended Kalman filter.

However, the appropriate optimization (search) algorithms are still in pursuit by researchers since different aspects about the effectiveness of such algorithms have to be addressed on different circumstances. In this paper, we focus on the two popular source localization methods for wideband acoustic signals, namely the alternating projection (AP) algorithm and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We explore the respective limitations of these two methods and design a new hybrid approach thereupon. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the trade-off can be achieved between the computational complexity and the localization accuracy using our newly proposed scheme.

In this paper, we integrate these two approaches to compactly represent 2D images and 3D volume data. Once a wavelet (packet) decomposition has been performed, the coefficients are subdivided into small blocks most of which have small energy and are pruned. Surviving blocks usually exhibit strong redundancy among different channels and subbands. To exploit this property, we organize the surviving blocks into small tensors, group the tensors into clusters using an EM algorithm, and compactly approximate each cluster using tensor ensemble approximation. Experimental results on images and medical volume data indicate that our approach achieves better approximation quality than wavelet (packet) transforms.

Using the Forney-style factor graph (FFG), a forward-and-backward signal processing method is developed to recursively solve the EM problem for joint estimation and detection (JED) in MIMO fading channels. By proper message scheduling and passing over the FFG, simulations show that the proposed algorithm is effective for joint MIMO channel tracking and symbol detection in fast fading channels.

Each object in an image has its activity scope, which conforms to semantic concept invariance. To find the maximum and fair activity scope for every object in an image in the best way is to discriminate the hidden semantic differences. A special property of SVM is known as maximum margin classifier, which simultaneously minimizes the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin. In this paper, the hidden semantic concepts based on the low-level features of region (object) will be found by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique. The activity scope of each object and support vector will be decided by the SVM decision boundary and principal axis analysis which is used to construct a hyper-plane projection line with minimum inertia. Furthermore, a similarity measure, by integrating the high-level semantic distance and low-level features, is used to retrieve images. The proposed semantic learning scheme provides a way to bridge the gap between the high-level semantic concept and low-level features for content-based image retrieval. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is excellent when compared with that of other methods.

In recent years, extensive methodological research on QTL mapping has been performed, Chen and Chen (2005) recently considered the statistical inference problems in the interval mapping method under finite normal mixture models. This article examines the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test in finite mixture models with general kernel functions. The limiting null distribution is found to be free of the choice of a kernel function. Technical details are given to the kernel functions with a single parameter under backross populations. Extension to the finite mixture models with presence of a structure parameter is discussed and proposed. The EM algorithm for approximating the MLE's is also discussed.

However, this method is based upon a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which will cause power leakage and result in an error floor in a multipath channel with non-sample-spaced time delays. In order to overcome this problem, a low rank approximation method is presented by using the signal subspace of the channel frequency autocorrelation matrix. Furthermore, a modified fast subspace tracking algorithm is introduced to adaptive estimate the signal subspace by using a space-time block coded training blocks, sent at regular interval. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed technique for MIMO-OFDM systems in time-varying non-sample-spaced wireless channels.

In this paper, the EM algorithm is employed as a basis to derive diagnostic measures for the models by treating them as a mixed Poisson regression with the weights from the inverse Gaussian distributions. Several diagnostic measures are obtained in both case-deletion model and local influence analysis, based on the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function in the EM algorithm. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.

Compared to the conventional MAP methods with Markov Random Field (MRF) prior models, the proposed method, named WD-MAP method, has better performance in characterize both local and global feature of reconstructed image due to the wavelet transform.

For clinical x-ray CT systems utilizing energy-integrating detectors, it has been shown that the detected x-ray intensity is compound Poisson distributed,(1-3) instead of the Poisson distribution that is often studied in the literature. We model the electronic noise contaminated signal Z as the sum of a compound Poisson distributed random variable (r.v.) Y and a Gaussian distributed electronic noise N with known mean and variance. We formulate the iterative x-ray CT reconstruction problem with electronic noise compensation as a maximum-likelihood reconstruction problem. However the likelihood function of Z is not analytically trackable; instead of working with it directly, we formulate the problem in the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, and iteratively maximize the conditional expectation of the complete log-likelihood of Y. We further demonstrate that the conditional expectation of the surrogate function of the complete log-likelihood is a legitimate surrogate for the incomplete surrogate. Under certain linearity conditions on the surrogate function, a reconstruction algorithm with electronic noise compensation can be obtained by some modification of one previously derived without electronic noise considerations; the change incurred is simply replacing the unavailable, uncontaminated measurement Y by its conditional expectation E(Y vertical bar Z). The calculation of E(Y vertical bar Z) depends on the model of Y. N, and Z. We propose two methods for calculating this conditional expectation when Y follows a special compound Poisson distribution - the exponential dispersion model (ED). Our methods can be regarded as an extension of similar approaches using the Poisson model(4,5) to the compound Poisson model.	[Xu, Jingyan; Tsui, Benjamin M.

In order to implement variant design effectively in this condition, a design parameter vector model was proposed to describe the design parameters of customized product. These design parameters were distinguished as known design parameters and unknown design parameters according to the result of customer's customization, and were rearranged into two different parameter subsets. Then maximum likelihood estimation method was presented to infer unknown design parameters based on known design parameters and existing mature product design specification. In order to simplify the calculation process of maximum likelihood estimation, EM algorithm was introduced to deal with this calculation process. At the same time, the main iterative steps of EM algorithm were put forward. After maximum likelihood estimation process, the value of unknown design parameters can be confirmed approximately. Therefore, the design parameter data of customized product are all known. Based on parametric CAD system, all these known design parameter data can be used to drive 3D model to variant design. So a product instance which can satisfy with customer's requirement can be conducted rapidly. Finally, an example was given out to verify these principles and methods.

The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of the Kondo 2001 where the class membership of a local aperture depends only on the contents of itself without taking any consideration of the contents of all the other training apertures, and all the features in an aperture share one single break point. We show that more effective classification con be achieved by making the break points adaptive to the content of all the training apertures. We propose to iteratively find the break points and the filtering coefficients in an Expectation-Maximization framework. The break points partition the entire training, sample space into distinctive segments through axis-parallel splitting on each of the feature variables. The optimal coefficients for each segment are then obtained by LMS optimization. The partition-regression leads to a Classification and Regression Tree. The proposed method exhibits improved performance over previous up-conversion approaches.

Given a query image, our approach first classifies the image into one of the three categories: microaneurysm (MA), neovascularization (NV) and normal, and then it retrieves DR images that are clinically-relevant to the query image from an archival image database. In the classification stage, the query DR images are classified by the Multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (McMIL) approach, where images are viewed as bags, each of which contains a number of instances corresponding to non-overlapping blocks, and each block is characterized by low-level features including color, texture, histogram of edge directions, and shape. McMIL first learns a collection of instance prototypes for each class that maximizes the Diverse Density function using Expectation-Maximization algorithm.. A nonlinear mapping is then defined using the instance prototypes and maps every bag to a point in a new multi-class bag feature space. Finally a multi-class Support Vector Machine is trained in the multi-class bag feature space. In the retrieval stage, we retrieve images from the archival database who bear the same label with the query image, and who are the top K nearest neighbors of the query image in terms of similarity in the multi-class bag feature space. The classification approach achieves high classification accuracy, and the retrieval of clinically-relevant images not only facilitates utilization of the vast amount of hidden diagnostic knowledge in the database, but also improves the efficiency and accuracy of DR lesion diagnosis and assessment.

The combination channel estimation is used in the proposed algorithm. The pilot sequences are used to estimate the channel information at the first iteration. The pilot and the soft estimates from the decoders are combined to refine the channel coefficients in the following estimation iterations. The proposed approach greatly reduces the complexity. The simulation results indicate that the bit-error-rate performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to that of ideal channel estimation and the algorithm based on posteriori information is more accurate than that using extrinsic information.

The channel estimation algorithm herein designed Introduces linear Interpolation to compensate the original value offered by expextation-maximization (EM) algorithm for iterative step. With the utilization of the coherence among both subcarriers and symbols, the performance is improved substantially. We conduct particular simulations with comparing the bit-error-rate (BER) obtained from traditional EM algorithm and our algorithm for QPSK/16QAM. Moreover, the convergence behavior of the two algorithms Is also investigated through the simulations under frequency-selective multi-path conditions. The results show that our method performs better than the conventional EM algorithm both In BER and convergence performances.

SPECT data were acquired in a 128x128 matrix, in 120 views with a single circular orbit. Two sets of numerical Defrise phantoms were. used to simulate CBC SPECT scans, and low noise and scatter-free projection datasets were obtained using the SimSET Monte Carlo package. The reconstructed images, obtained using OSEM with a line-length system model (LLSM) and a 3D Gaussian post-filter, and OSEM with FVSM and a 3D Gaussian post-filter were quantitatively studied. Overall improvement in the image quality has been observed, including better transaxial resolution, higher contrast-to-noise ratio between hot and cold disks, and better accuracy and lower bias in OSEM-CVSM, compared with OSEM-LLSM.

This paper studies a slightly easier but very useful alternative where only the background layer has substantial image gradients and structures. We propose to solve this useful alternative by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that employs the hidden markov model (HMM), which maintains spatial coherency of smooth and overlapping layers, and helps to preserve image details of the textured background layer We demonstrate that, using a small amount of user input, various seemingly unrelated problems in computational photography can be effectively addressed by solving this alternative using our EM-HMM algorithm.

Distributed data association and filtering for multiple target tracking	2008 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-12	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 23-28, 2008	Anchorage, AK	IEEE Comp Soc			OBJECTS	This paper presents a novel distributed framework for multi-target tracking with an efficient data association computation. A decentralized representation of trackers' motion and association variables is adopted. Considering the interleaved nature of data association and tracker filtering, the multi-target tracking is formulated as a missing data problem, and the solution is found by the proposed variational EM algorithm. We analytically show that 1) the posteriori distributions of trackers' motions (the real interests in terms of tracking applications) can be effectively computed in the E-step of the EM iterations, and 2) the solution of trackers' association variables can be pursued under a derived graph-based discrete optimization formulation, thus efficiently estimated in the M-step by the recently emerging graph optimization algorithms. The proposed approach is very general such that sophisticated data association priori and likelihood function can be easily incorporated. This general framework is tested with both simulation data and real world surveillance video. The reported qualitative and quantitative studies verify the effectiveness and low computational cost of the algorithm.

This paper studies an interesting problem: can the supervision come from inside, i.e., the unsupervised training data themselves? If the data samples are not independent, we can capture the contextual information reflecting the dependency among the data samples, and use it as supervision to improve the clustering. This is called context-aware clustering. The investigation is substantialized on two scenarios of (1) clustering primitive visual features (e.g., SIFT features) with help of spatial contexts, and (2) clustering '0'-'9' hand written digits with help of contextual patterns among different types of features. Our context-aware clustering can be well formulated in a closed-form, where the contextual information serves as a regularization term to balance the data fidelity in original feature space and the influences of contextual patterns.

By exploring the dependent structure of the data samples, this method is completely unsupervised, as no outside supervision is introduced.

Detecting digital forgery is one of most important emerging technology to solve digital forgery of digital images taken by a digital camera. This paper proposes a new method for detecting digital forgery using an image interpolation technique from digital images. When digital forgery is produced from digital images, it always includes the interpolated image between the images. Our approach is to compute the interpolated coefficient for the images using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate detecting the forgery images used to each filter for the tool of Adobe Photoshop (R) and show a ratio of detecting the forgery images.

Nonnegative Tensor Factorization with smoothness constraints	ADVANCED INTELLIGENT COMPUTING THEORIES AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS: WITH ASPECTS OF THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Intelligent Computing	SEP 15-18, 2008	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA				MATRIX FACTORIZATION; EM ALGORITHM; RECONSTRUCTION; RESTORATION; TOMOGRAPHY; EMISSION	Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) is an emerging technique in multidimensional signal analysis and it can be used to find parts-based representations of high-dimensional data. In many applications such as multichannel spectrogram processing or multiarray spectra analysis, the unknown features have locally smooth temporal or spatial structure. In this paper, we incorporate to an objective function in NTF additional smoothness constrains that considerably improve the unknown features. In our approach, we propose to use the Markov Random Field (MRF) model that is commonly-used in tomographic image reconstruction to model local smoothness properties of 2D reconstructed images. We extend this model to multidimensional case whereby smoothness can be enforced in all dimensions of a multi-dimensional array. We analyze different clique energy functions that are a subject to MRF. Some numerical results performed on a multidimensional image dataset are presented.

Based on the non-decimated wavelet which is shift invariant, in this paper, we develop a new edge detecting technique using Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) model. With this proposed model (NWHMC), each wavelet coefficient contains a hidden state, herein, we adopt Laplacian model and Gaussian model to represent the information of the state "big" and the state "small". The model can be trained by EM algorithm, and then we employ Viterbi algorithm to reveal the hidden state of each coefficient according to AMP estimation. The detecting results of several images are provided to evaluate the algorithm. In addition, the algorithm can be applied to noisy images efficiently.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive Bayesian framework to detect the image attention in color image. Firstly, three simple semantics and subtractive clustering are used to construct Attention Gaussians Mixture Model (AGMM) and Background Gaussians Mixture Model (BGMM). Secondly, the Bayesian framework is utilized to classify each pixel into attention objects and background objects. Thirdly, EM algorithm is used to update the parameters of AGMM BGMM and Bayesian framework according to the detection results. Finally, the above classification and update procedures are repeated until the detection results become steady. Experimental results on typical images exhibit the robustness of the proposed method	[Zhang, Wei; Wu, Q. M.

A mixture Gaussian model is employed to characterize workload in data-intensive applications. Using a small subset of workload information in systems, the DLBEM strategy reduces considerable communication overheads caused by workload information exchange and job migration. In the meantime, based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, DLBEM achieves near accurate estimation of the global system state with significantly less communication overheads and results in efficient workload balancing. Simulation results for some representative cases on a two-dimensional 16*16 grid demonstrate that DLBEM approach achieves even resource utilization and over 90% accuracy in the estimation of the global system state information with over 70% reduction on communication overheads compared to a baseline strategy.

The presented algorithm compared the performance of four different chrominance spaces for the distribution of hair color and built a human hair color model in YCbCr space. A Gaussian mixture density model was used to describe the distribution of hair color and segmentation threshold value in Cb-Cr plate is obtained though parameter estimation using Expectation-Maximization algorithm. By combining chrominance information with other features of head, color segmentation and subsequent detection of human head detection have been performed in two-dimensional static images: Experimental results show that the presented method can detect human head in complex background effectively and provide a new approach of human head detection.

It deals with multiple views extracted from a time-stamped image sequence through ECG gating. This statistics-based vessel reconstruction method relies on a new imaging model by considering both the effect of background tissues and the image representation using spherically-symmetric basis functions, also called 'blobs'. These blobs have a closed analytical expression for the X-ray transform, which makes easier to compute a cone-beam projection than a voxel-based description. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is used with a Poisson distributed projection data instead of the Gaussian approximation often used in tomography reconstruction. A heavy-tailed distribution is proposed as image prior to take into account the sparse nature of the object of interest. The optimization is performed by an expectation-maximization like (EM) block iterative algorithm which offers a fast convergence and a sound introduction of the non-negativity constraint for vessel attenuation coefficients. Simulations are performed using a model of coronary tree extracted from multidetector CT scanner and a performance study is conducted.

The method hinges in the use of quasi-random sampling to retrieve those images in a database which are related to a query image provided by the user Departing from random sampling theory, we make use of the EM algorithm so as to organize the images in the database into compact clusters that can then be used for stratified random sampling. For the purposes of retrieval, we use the similarity between the query and the clustered images to govern the sampling process within clusters. In this way, the sampling can be viewed as a stratified sampling one which is random at the cluster level and takes into account the intra-cluster structure of the dataset. This approach leads to a measure of statistical confidence that relates to the theoretical hard-limit of the retrieval performance. We show results on the Oxford Flowers dataset.

Given a collection of biomedical literature from a digital library addressing a set of objects (e.g., proteins) and their descriptions (e.g., protein functions), the tasks of class-attribute mining include: (1) to identify and summarize latent classes in the space of objects, (2) to discover latent attribute themes in the space of object descriptions, and (3) to summarize the commonalities and differences among identified classes along each attribute theme. We approach this mining problem through a mixture language model and estimate the parameters of the model using the EM algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model with an application called protein community identification and annotation from Medline, the largest biomedical literature digital library with more than 16 millions abstracts.

'BAG OF SEGMENTS' FOR MOTION TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS	2008 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Motion analysis; Pattern classification; Information retrieval	TRACKING	We propose a novel method to represent: motion trajectory 'bag of segments'. Motivated by the 'bag of words' approach in text mining acid more recently in image categorization, we represent each trajectory as a collection of segments, each assigned a membership to a codeword of a dictionary. The trajectory segments are represented by their shape and motion information while, the; inter-segment relationship is ignored. In the 'bag of trajectory segments' representation, the trajectories are transformed to a vector in the codeword space. The codebook is generated by clustering a large amount of trajectory segments using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and each codeword is a weighted regression model. Given the codebook, trajectories art: segmented and associated with a sof-frequency vector in codeword space as an intermediate representation. With the 'bag of segments' representation, trajectory analysis can be carried out in vector space; as traditional data. Experiments show the 'bag of segments' method is very effective in trajectory similarity search and classification.

In this paper, we propose a 3D-MRF image model based on 2D MRF by extending 2D planar to 3D space, define and describe the 3D neighbor, clique and potential function. We segment medical image using the 3D-MRF and the steps are as follows: 1. Initial images are segmented by using k-means clustering, to reduce the computational burden by using a special data structure: the k-d tree. 2. The parameters are estimated by using the maximum a posteriori (AMP) for the 3D-MRF model. 3. Computing optimal Solution is done using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the Iterated Conditional Models (ICM) algorithm. Experiments show the 3D-MRF includes more neighboring information and the results of segmentation are more stable and practical.

By using Hammerseley-Clifford theorem, an image field assumed to be a Markov random field is Gibbs distributed. An edge-orient diffusion function is introduced and employed in the Gibbs prior. According to Bayesian theorem, the solution to the maximum likelihood function is equal to that to maximum a posterior function. Therefore we incorporate ML with a prior distributed function. Experimental results illustrate that our method has a powerful super-resolution restoration performance. Compared with traditional ML method, our approach can not only obtain super-resolution images, but also eliminate noise artifacts effectively without smoothing edges.

When applied to clustering analysis, it generates good results only with reasonably good initialization, which can be produced by hierarchical agglomeration. However, hierarchical agglomeration has poor scalability due to its computational complexity. This paper presents a novel method, called ISOEM, to overcome this limitation. It uses a data range aware seeding algorithm to create an initial classification to initialize an iterative self-organizing process. The process alternates between EM and agglomeration coupled with classification EM. Evaluation using two imagery datasets showed the method had very good performance. The paper also presents the results of using a skewness measure and a separation-cohesion index as indicators for determining the number of clusters in the data.

Firstly, the elevator traffic flow is classified off-line into patterns by the two-stage Clustering Algorithm, Artificial Immune C-Means Clustering Algorithm (AI C-Means CA). Then Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to model the multi-mode elevator traffic flow. And the EM algorithm is utilized to estimate the parameters of GMM to predict elevator traffic flow on line. Finally, the effectivity of this prediction method is validated by comparing simulation results with other prediction methods.

The mixture of Gaussian-based appearance similarity model incorporates the appearance variance between different cameras to address changes in varying lighting conditions. To address the problem of limited labeled training data, we propose the use of semi supervised Expectation-Maximization algorithm for activity classification. The human activities observed in a simulated camera network with nine cameras and twenty-five erodes arc classified into our normal and three anomalous classes. A similar camera network is built and tested in real-life experiments, in which the proposed approach achieves satisfactory performance.

It enables some classical criteria such as the well-known k-means criterion to be explained. To classify the rows or the columns of a contingency table, an adapted version of k-means known as Mndki2, which uses the chi-square distance, can be used. Unfortunately, this simple, effective method which can be used jointly with correspondence analysis based on the same representation of the data, cannot be associated with a mixture model in the same way as the classical k-means algorithm. In this paper we show that the Mndki2 algorithm can be viewed as an approximation of a classifying version of the EM algorithm for a mixture of multinomial distributions. A comparison of the algorithms belonging in this context are experimentally investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

But it has some disadvantage such as long computation time and bad reconstruction quality. Filtered back projection (FBP), that has many advantages such as simple structure and short reconstruction time, is firstly introduced into the initialization stage of the OS-EM to fast the reconstruction process. Then, the smoothness method is applied after the OS-EM algorithm to improve the reconstruction speed and quality. The reconstructed images are compared for both the simulated phantom data and the brain magnetic resonance imaging data. The improved OS-EM is shown to be more feasible than the standard OS-EM within the same iteration steps and in higher signal noise ratio (SNR) condition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tan, CM; Beach, MA				Tan, C. M.; Beach, M. A.			Estimation of propagation channel parameters using multi-dimensional hybrid-space SAGE algorithm	IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION			English	Article								To-date, most multipath propagation parameters are estimated in the element-space domain due to implementation simplicity. Although estimation in the beam-space domain can reduce both the dimensionality of the data size and numerical complexity, it is only beneficial if applied to arrays with a large number of uniformly spaced elements. A new implementation of the space-alternating generalised expectation-maximisation (SAGE) algorithm is presented in joint element-space and beam-space, namely the 'hybrid-space' (HS), such that the underlying features of these dual domains can be simultaneously exploited. The resultant algorithm, namely HS-SAGE algorithm, retains the advantages of the individual domains as the user can specify which parameter should be evaluated in each domain, thus optimising the overall performance. Here, the efficient execution flow of the HS-SAGE algorithm is presented, where the estimation quality is demonstrated through results obtained from both synthetic and real-measurement environments employing circular arrays. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant timesaving when compared with the classical implementation approach, whilst maintaining accuracy.	[Tan, C.

The proposed EM approach can directly compute not only the eigen-system of sample covariance matrix in data space but also that of kernel matrix. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an unified framework for EM-based principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). Particularly, when it is applied to KPCA, it is a dual form of the commonly used constrained EM algorithm for performing KPCA. And thus it is a beneficial complementarity or dual description of the constrained EM method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MCLV models extend latent class analysis or latent transition analysis to allow flexible measurement and structural components between endogenous categorical latent variables and exogenous covariates. Therefore, modeling frameworks in conventional structural equation models, for example, CFA and MIMIC models are feasible in the MCLV circumstances. Parameter estimations for the MCLV models are performed by using generalized expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm. In addition, the adjusted Bayesian information criterion provides help for model selections. A substantive study of reading development is analyzed to illustrate the feasibility of MCLV models.

J	Oudin, A; Bjork, J; Stromberg, U				Oudin, Anna; Bjork, Jonas; Stromberg, Ulf			Efficiency of two-phase methods with focus on a planned population-based case-control study on air pollution and stroke	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article							LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; ASSOCIATION; 2-STAGE; SUBTYPES; DESIGN; SWEDEN; MODEL	Background: We plan to conduct a case-control study to investigate whether exposure to nitrogen dioxide ( NO(2)) increases the risk of stroke. In case-control studies, selective participation can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. A two-phase design can reduce bias and improve efficiency by combining information on the non-participating subjects with information from the participating subjects. In our planned study, we will have access to individual disease status and data on NO2 exposure on group (area) level for a large population sample of Scania, southern Sweden. A smaller sub-sample will be selected to the second phase for individual-level assessment on exposure and covariables. In this paper, we simulate a case-control study based on our planned study. We develop a two-phase method for this study and compare the performance of our method with the performance of other two-phase methods. Methods: A two-phase case-control study was simulated with a varying number of first- and second-phase subjects. Estimation methods: Method 1: Effect estimation with second-phase data only. Method 2: Effect estimation by adjusting the first- phase estimate with the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted second-phase estimate. The first- phase estimate is based on individual disease status and residential address for all study subjects that are linked to register data on NO(2)-exposure for each geographical area. Method 3: Effect estimation by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm without taking area-level register data on exposure into account. Method 4: Effect estimation by using the EM algorithm and incorporating group-level register data on NO(2)-exposure. Results: The simulated scenarios were such that, unbiased or marginally biased (< 7%) odds ratio (OR) estimates were obtained with all methods. The efficiencies of method 4, are generally higher than those of methods 1 and 2. The standard errors in method 4 decreased further when the case/ control ratio is above one in the second phase. For all methods, the standard errors do not become substantially reduced when the number of first- phase controls is increased. Conclusion: In the setting described here, method 4 had the best performance in order to improve efficiency, while adjusting for varying participation rates across areas.

The distribution of road contribution data to total suspended particles according to the source receptor model MCF, source correlation modeling, is nearly a Gamma distribution. Chi-square goodness of fit is used to model statistically. This test for goodness of fit also allows to estimate the parameters of the distribution utilizing maximum likelihood method. As a convergency criteria, the Estimation Maximization Algorithm is used.

J	Tseng, SM				Tseng, Shu-Ming			A fuzzy PIC multiuser detection/vector channel estimation scheme in Rayleigh fading channels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy logic; parallel interference cancellation; time-varying fading channels; vector channel estimation	SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM; CDMA	We propose a fuzzy parallel interference cancellation (PIC) multiuser detection/vector channel estimation (VCE) scheme in Rayleigh fading channels. The VICE is based on a first-order auto-regressive model and an expectation-maximization algorithm. The signal-to-interference ratio and signal-to-noise ratio are estimated from the vector channel model's parameters, and we adapt the weight of each interference cancellation path via fuzzy inference mechanism. The proposed fuzzy PIC and VCE cooperate in a way such that some of the fuzzy PIC input parameters come from the channel predictor and the fuzzy PIC makes the channel predictor be more accurate at the next PIC stage. Computing weights via fuzzy adaptive method adds insignificant complexity because it involves only table lookup. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy PIC/VCE scheme performs better than the improved PIC/vector channel estimation scheme with optimal parameter in fast-varying Rayleigh fading channels.

J	Bakker, B; Heskes, T				Bakker, Bart; Heskes, Tom			Learning and approximate inference in dynamic hierarchical models	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						time series; dynamic linear model; maximum likelihood estimation; variational approximation; expectation propagation	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS	A new variant of the dynamic hierarchical model (DHM) that describes a large number of parallel time series is presented. The separate series, which may be interdependent, are modeled through dynamic linear models (DLMs). This interdependence is included in the model through the definition of a 'top-level' or 'average' DLM. The model features explicit dependences between the latent states of the parallel DLMs and the states of the average model, and thus the many parallel time series are linked to each other. The combination of dependences within each time series and dependences between the different DLMs makes the computation time that is required for exact inference cubic in the number of parallel time series, however, which is unacceptable for practical tasks that involve large numbers of parallel time series. Therefore, two methods for fast, approximate inference are proposed: a variational approximation and a factorial approach. Under these approximations, inference can be performed in linear time, and it still features exact means. Learning is implemented through a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the model parameters. This estimation is realized through an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with approximate inference in the E-step. Examples of learning and forecasting on two data sets show that the addition of direct dependences has a 'smoothing' effect on the evolution of the states of the individual time series, and leads to better prediction results. The use of approximate instead of exact inference is further shown not to lead to inferior results on either data set. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Age is computed by adding the tooth eruption age to the count of annual incremental lines which are called tooth rings and appear in the cementum band. The number of rings is computed from an intensity (gray scale) image of the cementum band, by estimating the average ring width and then dividing the area of the cementum band by this estimate. The ring width is estimated by modelling the image by a hidden Markov random field, where intensities are assumed to be pixelwise conditionally independent and normally distributed, given a Markov random field of hidden binary labels, representing the "true scene". To incorporate image macro-features (the long-range dependence among intensities and the quasi-periodicity in the placement of tooth rings), the label random field is defined by an energy function that depends on a parametric Gabor filter, convolved with the true scene. The filter parameter represents the unknown of main interest, i.e. the average width of the rings. The model is estimated through an EM algorithm, relying on the mean field approximation of the hidden label distribution and allows to predict the locations of the rings in the image.

An accelerated penalized maximum likelihood algorithm for positron emission tomography	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						accelerated penalized maximum likelihood (APML) method; positron emission tomography (PET); regularized image reconstruction	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS; ORDERED SUBSETS ALGORITHMS; EM ALGORITHM; TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY	We develop a "fast" algorithm for obtaining regularized estimates of emission means in positron emission tomography (PET). The algorithm, which iteratively minimizes a penalized maximum likelihood (PML) objective function (i.e., negative log likelihood function plus a scaled penalty function), is based on a "pattern search" and a previously developed PML algorithm. As desired, the proposed accelerated PML (APML) algorithm guarantees nonnegative estimates and monotonically decreases the PML objective function with increasing iterations. For the case where the PML objective function is strictly convex, which is true for the class of penalty functions under consideration, we prove that the APML algorithm converges to the unique minimizer of the PML objective function. To demonstrate the utility of the APML algorithm, we applied it to real thorax phantom data and compared it to two existing PML algorithms.

That approach is compared with iterative methods and non-object-dependent exact methods in both the space domain and the frequency one. Since the mean-projection precorrection method is the concern of some actual 3D methods of compensation for distance-dependent spatial resolution and is thought right for competing with different methods able to quantify the tracer density in the object of interest, it is also examined in the course of the analysis. The direct approach may also augment the simulation power of the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox concerning the direct and inverse Radon transform from parallel projection data, the Toolbox being actually restricted to the ideal transform in the frequency domain.

In our previous work, we introduced a new FAT algorithm for tracking with ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and high resolutional range (HRR) measurements, where features were extracted from an HRR sensor using the technique of mixture density estimation. Although satisfactory results were achieved, an additional improvement is expected if a target rigidity constraint is incorporated. In this paper, we exploit the rigidity property of targets to alleviate the inherent local convergence problem of the expectation-maximization algorithm used in mixture density estimation. Simulation results show a performance improvement over the previous FAT algorithm.

For the purpose, this paper presents a semi-supervised method for classifying evaluative expressions, that is, tuples of subjects, their attributes. and evaluative words, that indicate either favorable or unfavorable opinions towards a specific subject. Due to its characteristics, our semi-supervised method can classify evaluative expressions in a corpus by their polarities, starting from a very small set of seed training examples and using contextual information in the sentences the expressions belong to.

J	You, JS; Wang, J; Liang, ZR				You, Jiangsheng; Wang, Jing; Liang, Zhengrong			Range condition and ML-EM checkerboard artifacts	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						attenuated Radon transform; computed tomography; consistent condition; noise analysis; SPECT	EXPONENTIAL RADON-TRANSFORM; X-RAY TRANSFORMATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; NOISE PROPERTIES; ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; INVERSION-FORMULA; ALGORITHM; ROTATION; SPECT	The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the maximum likelihood (ML) image reconstruction criterion generates severe checkerboard artifacts in the presence of noise. A classical remedy is to impose an a priori constraint for a penalized ML or maximum a posteriori probability solution. The penalty reduces the checkerboard artifacts and also introduces uncertainty because a priori information is usually unknown in clinic. Recent theoretical investigation reveals that the noise can be divided into two components: one is called null-space noise and the other is range-space noise. The null-space noise can be numerically estimated using filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. By the FBP algorithm, the null-space noise annihilates in the reconstruction while the range-space noise propagates into the reconstructed image. The aim of this work is to investigate the relation between the null-space noise and the checkerboard artifacts in the ML-EM reconstruction from noisy projection data. Our study suggests that removing the null-space noise from the projection data could improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the projection data and, therefore, reduce the checkerboard artifacts in the ML-EM reconstructed images. This study reveals an in-depth understanding of the different noise propagations in analytical and iterative image reconstructions, which may be useful to single photon emission computed tomography, where the noise has been a major factor for image degradation. The reduction of the ML-EM checkerboard artifacts by removing the null-space noise avoids the uncertainty of using a priori penalty.

J	Metaxoglou, K; Smith, A				Metaxoglou, Konstantinos; Smith, Aaron			Efficiency of the California electricity reserves market	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS			Rumanian	Article							STATE-SPACE MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PRICES	We test the efficiency of the California electricity reserves market by examining systematic differences between its day- and hour-ahead prices. We uncover significant day-ahead premia, which we attribute to market design characteristics. On the demand side, the market design established a principal-agent relationship between the markets' buyers (principal) and their supervisory authority (agent). The agent had very limited incentives to shift reserve purchases to the lower priced hour-ahead markets. On the supply side, the market design raised substantial entry barriers by precluding purely speculative trading and by introducing a complicated code of conduct that induced uncertainty about which actions were subject to regulatory scrutiny. We use a high-dimensional vector moving average model to estimate the premia and conduct correct inferences. To obtain exact maximum likelihood estimates of the model, we develop a new EM algorithm that seamlessly incorporates missing data and applies directly to general moving average time series models. Our algorithm uses only analytical expressions: the Kalman filter and a fixed interval smoother in the E step and least squares-type regressions in the M step.

The framework provides estimates of the sources, the mixing matrix and the noise parameters, and is flexible with respect to choice of source prior and the number of sources and sensors. Inside the engine of the method are two mean field techniques-the variational Bayes and the expectation consistent framework-and the cost function relating to these methods are optimized using the adaptive overrelaxed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the easy gradient recipe. The entire framework, implemented in a Matlab toolbox, is demonstrated for non-negative decompositions and compared with non-negative matrix factorization. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Estimating a survival curve with unlinked entry and failure times	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						broken survival data; EM algorithm; self-consistency algorithm; study monitoring table; survival analysis	EXPECTED MARGINAL TOTALS; BROKEN RANDOM SAMPLE; TABLES	In monitoring a clinical trial or other observational study with a survival endpoint, sometimes the numbers of patients entering and dying at each time point are presented, but the connections between them are kept confidential. Hence, the exact time to failure or censoring for each individual is missing. We refer to such a study monitoring table with missing pairing information between the entry and death times as a 'broken' survival data set. In this paper we study the problem of estimating the survival distribution from a broken survival data set. We have developed two methods, likelihood-based estimation and self-consistency estimation, to estimate the survival curve parametrically and empirically, respectively. We use simulations to study the properties of these methods, and illustrate them with data from the STELLAR-3 trial. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Srinivas			Unsupervised image segmentation using finite doubly truncated Gaussian mixture model and hierarchical clustering	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						EM algorithm; image segmentation; image quality metrics; truncated Gaussian mixture distribution		A new image segmentation method based on finite truncated Gaussian mixture model has been proposed. The truncated Gaussian distribution includes several of the skewed and asymmetric distributions as particular cases with a finite range. It also includes the Gaussian distribution as a limiting case. We used the Estimation Maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters of the image data and the number of mixture components was estimated using hierarchical clustering algorithm. This algorithm was also utilized for developing the initial estimates of the EM algorithm. Segmentation was carried out by clustering each pixel into the appropriate component according to the maximum likelihood estimation criteria. The advantage of our method lies in its efficiency on initialization of the model parameters and segmenting images in a totally unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that this segmentation method can provide better results than the other methods.

Optimizing the number of equivalent iterations of 3D OSEM in SPECT reconstruction of I-131 focal activities	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium on Rediation Measurements and Applications	MAY 23-26, 2006	Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	quantification; Activity quantification; SPECT; OSEM; I-131; I-131 total activity; I-131 activity uniformity	RESOLUTION; RECOVERY	To externally estimate the radiation dose to a tumor during therapy with I-131 radiopharmaceuticals, and its distribution, one must accurately estimate activity, and its distribution, by means of SPECT imaging. Our objective is to characterize the quantification of the total activity in focal targets and in their uniform background, and of the activity distribution within the targets, after 3D Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) reconstruction with attenuation and scatter correction and no post smoothing, in the good-counting-statistics case. A cylindrical phantom containing seven spheres simulating tumors, ranging in volume from 209 to 4.2 cm(3), and filled with an 1-131 water solution containing background, was imaged. A Siemens Symbia SPECT/CT scanner was used to acquire 128 x 128 projection images, employing 60 angles over 360 degrees. With dynamic SPECT, 10 sequential acquisitions of 15 min duration each were obtained and each was reconstructed with particular values of the number of subsets and the number of iterations. Let the product of the number of subsets times the number of iterations equal the equivalent number of iterations, El. The counts-to-activity conversion factor was derived from the average ratio of total count divided by true activity for the largest sphere at the largest value of EI. Then, for the activity of each sphere at each of the values of EL we evaluated (1) the fractional variance (variance in estimate over true activity), (2) the fractional bias (average estimate bias over true activity) and (3) the fractional error (the root mean square error (RMSE) in the estimate divided by the true activity). The fractional bias and fractional variance were smaller for the larger spheres compared to the smaller (the fractional bias decreased faster with an increase in the fractional variance for them as well). The RMSE was dominated by the bias. The fractional error decreased as El increased for all sphere sizes. The minimum average value was 25.8% and occurred for El = 480 although that image had texture and was noisy. The average fractional error was already approaching that value by El = 80 at 30.7%, and that image was less noisy. For the water background surrounding the spheres, the fractional error in the activity estimate varied but little with El; its smallest value was 13.1% at EI = 480. The error in a measure of estimated sphere activity non-uniformity worsened as El increased. (The OSEM initial guess of identical counts/voxel everywhere was perfect as far as uniformity for these uniform-activity targets.)

J	Ghosh, S; Das, K				Ghosh, Santu; Das, Kalyan			Analysis of marginally specified semi-non parametric models for clustered binary data	STATISTICA NEERLANDICA			English	Article						GLMM; semi-non parametric density; metro-polis-hastings algorithm; MCEM	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; MIXED MODELS; ALGORITHMS	Generalized linear mixed models are widely used for analyzing clustered data. If the primary interest is in regression parameters, one can proceed alternatively, through the marginal mean model approach. In the present study, a joint model consisting of a marginal mean model and a cluster-specific conditional mean model is considered. This model is useful when both time-independent and time-dependent covariates are available. Furthermore our model is semi-parametric, as we assume a flexible, smooth semi-non parametric density of the cluster-specific effects. This semi-non parametric density-based approach outperforms the approach based on normality assumption with respect to some important features of 'between-cluster variation'. We employ a full likelihood-based approach and apply the Monte Carlo EM algorithm to analyze the model. A simulation study is carried out to demonstrate the consistency of the approach. Finally, we apply this to a study of long-term illness data.

The mixture multiscale autoregressive (MMAR) model is introduced to characterize and exploit the scale-to-scale statistical variations and statistical variations in same scale in SAR imagery due to radar speckle, and the estimation of parameters in MMAR model is given by combining the CA algorithm with EM algorithm. This algorithm is capable of selecting the number of components of the model using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Our approach benefits from the properties of Genetic algorithms (GA) and the EM algorithm by combination of both into a single procedure. The population-based stochastic search of the CA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables escaping from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. Some experiment results are given based on our proposed approach, and compared to that of the EM algorithms. The experiments on the SAR images show that the GA-EM outperforms the EM method.

In text classification, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is often used as a general framework estimating the parameters of a probability model from labeled and unlabeled data sets. Unfortunately, EM suffers from the following problems: 1). The algorithm lack robustness while there exists inconsistency between the probability distribution of labeled data sets and unlabeled background data sets; 2). The algorithm is frequently trapped in local optimum; 3). The stop condition for existing algorithm is ambiguous or inoperable. In this paper, by casting basic EM algorithm in a Bagging theoretic framework, a robust improvement is proposed. Specifically, an effective stop condition is given using transduction. Effectiveness of the models and feasibility of the present method are verified by experiments on spam detection.

J	Yang, R; Fang, M				Yang, Runqing; Fang, Ming			Mapping quantitative trait loci in line cross with repeat records	BMC GENETICS			English	Article							COVARIANCE	Background: Phenotypes with repeat records from one individual or multiple individuals were often encountered in practices of mapping QTL in linecross. The current genetic mapping method for a trait with repeat records is adopted by simply replacing the phenotype by the average value of the repeat records. This simple treatment has not sufficiently utilized the information from the replication and ignored the impacts of the permanent environmental effects on the accuracy of the estimated QTL. Results: We propose to map QTL by using the repeatability model to directly analyze the repeat records rather than simply analyze the mean phenotype, improving the efficiency of QTL detecting because of adequately utilizing the information from data and allowing for the permanent environmental effects. A maximum likelihood method implemented via the expectation-maximization ( EM) algorithm is applied to perform the parameter estimation of the repeatability model. The superiority of the mapping method based on the repeatability model over simple analysis using the mean phenotype was demonstrated by a series of simulations. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the proposed method can serve as a powerful alternative to existing methods. By mean of the repeatability model, utilizing the repeat records on individual may improve the efficiency of QTL detecting in line cross.

The problem has been discussed by many authors and they mainly focused when p is restricted by linear constraints or log-linear constraints. In this paper, we construct the relationship between the the maximum likelihood estimation of p restricted by p is an element of C and EM algorithm and demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator can be computed through the EM algorithm (Dempster et al. in J R Stat Soc Ser B 39:1-38, 1997). Several examples are analyzed by the proposed method.

In the presence of informative dropouts and missing covariates, however, standard complete-data methods may not be applicable. In this article, we consider a likelihood method and an approximate method for GLMM with informative dropouts and missing covariates. The methods are implemented by Monte-Carlo EM algorithms combined with Gibbs sampler. The approximate method may lead to inconsistent estimators but is computationally more efficient than the likelihood method. The two methods are evaluated via a simulation study for longitudinal binary data, and appear to perform reasonably well. A dataset on mental distress is analyzed in details.

J	Xie, L; Yang, HW				Xie, Lei; Yang, Hongwu			Dynamic Bayesian network inversion for robust speech recognition	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						speech recognition; hidden Markov model; dynamic Bayesian network		This paper presents an inversion algorithm for dynamic Bayesian networks towards robust speech recognition, namely DBNI, which is a generalization of hidden Markov model inversion (HMMI). As a dual procedure of expectation maximization (EM)-based model reestimation, DBNI finds the 'uncontaminated' speech by moving the input noisy speech to the Gaussian means under the maximum likelihood (ML) sense given the DBN models trained on clean speech. This algorithm can provide both the expressive advantage from DBN and the noise-removal feature from model inversion. Experiments on the Aurora 2.0 database show that the hidden feature model (a typical DBN for speech recognition) with the DBNI algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of word error rate reduction.			xielei21st@gmail.com					Choi KH, 2001, J VLSI SIG PROC SYST, V29, P51, DOI 10.1023/A:1011171430700; DEPSTER A, 1977, J ROYAL STAT SOC B, V39, P89; JENSEN F, 2001, BAYESIAN NETWORKS DE; LIVESCU K, 2003, EUROSPEECH 03, P2529; MOON SY, 1995, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P145; PEARCE D, 2000, ICSLP 2000, V4, P29; XIE L, 2006, ICMLC 06 LNCS 3930, P994; ZWEIG G, 1996, THESIS UC BERKELEY; Zweig G, 2003, COMPUT SPEECH LANG, V17, P173, DOI 10.1016/S0885-2308(03)00007-X	9	0	0	IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG	TOKYO	KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG MINATO-KU SHIBAKOEN 3 CHOME, TOKYO, 105, JAPAN	0916-8532		IEICE T INF SYST	IEICE Trans.

J	Duan, JY; Lu, RZ; Li, XN				Duan, Jianyong; Lu, Ruzhan; Li, Xuening			Multi-engine collaborative bootstrapping for word sense disambiguation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						bootstrapping algorithms; machine learning; word sense disambiguation		In this paper we propose a new word sense disambiguation method called Multi- engine Collaborative Bootstrapping ( MCB) that combines different types of corpora and also uses two languages for bootstrapping. MCB uses the bilingual bootstrapping as its core algorithm that leading to incremental knowledge acquisition. The EM model is applied to train parameters in a base learner. The feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi- engine selection to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manually selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned involved in our experiments because the EM algorithm is sensitive to starting values. Limitation of resources is also a concern.

A sequential Monte Carlo EM approach to the transcription factor binding site identification problem	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS; MOTIFS	Motivation: A significant and stubbornly intractable problem in genome sequence analysis has been the de novo identification of transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions. Although theoretically pleasing, probabilistic methods have faced difficulties due to model mismatch and the nature of the biological sequence. These problems result in inference in a high dimensional, highly multimodal space, and consequently often display only local convergence and hence unsatisfactory performance. Algorithm: In this article, we derive and demonstrate a novel method utilizing a sequential Monte Carlo-based expectation-maximization (EM) optimization to improve performance in this scenario. The Monte Carlo element should increase the robustness of the algorithm compared to classical EM. Furthermore, the parallel nature of the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm should be more robust than Gibbs sampling approaches to multimodality problems. Results: We demonstrate the superior performance of this algorithm on both semi-synthetic and real data from Escherichia coli.

J	Seidel, W; Sevcikova, H; Sever, K				Seidel, Wilfried; Sevcikova, Hana; Sever, Krunoslav			Testing against nonparametrle alternatives in mixture models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						bootstrap; likelihood ratio tests; nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation; number of components; sequence of tests; tests for homogeneity	LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS; EM-ALGORITHM; FINITE MIXTURES; HOMOGENEITY; COMPONENTS; BOOTSTRAP; DISTANCE; VALUES; NUMBER	Likelihood ratio tests in parametric mixture models suffer from several sources of instability, therefore tests against a nonparametric alternative are proposed. Their performance depends on the strategies for likelihood maximization. This article develops a fast and statistically powerful combination of methods under the null hypothesis and under the alternative hypothesis; the method also includes elimination of spurious components. Modifying a strategy proposed by McLachlan, a sequence of such tests is applied for assessing the number of components and its performance is analyzed in a number of simulation studies in exponential mixture models. Although critical values have to be bootstrapped, the probability of overestimating is still bounded by the nominal level of the individual tests. Taking into account the number of components that can be reliably detected on the basis of a certain sample size, the proposed procedure yields the minimum number of components that is required for an adequate representation of the sample. It is compared to methods based on the Bayesian and the Akaike information criterion, and a recommendation is given to identify a range of meaningful model orders compatible with a given sample.

A strict lower bound on the source prior is derived by using a variational method, which naturally enables the intractable posterior to be represented as a gaussian form. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in closed form is therefore derived for estimating the mixing matrix and inferring the sources. Simulation results show that the proposed variational expectation-maximization algorithm can perform blind separation of not only speech source of more sources than mixtures, but also binary source of more sources than mixtures.

Marginal maximum likelihood estimation of item response models in R	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE			English	Article						item response theory; partial credit model; two-parameter logistic model; mixed effects models; marginal maximum likelihood; Gauss-Hermite quadrature	LATENT TRAIT; EM ALGORITHM; RASCH MODEL; RATIO; SUM; IRT	Item response theory (IRT) models are a class of statistical models used by researchers to describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of categorically scored items. The most common IRT models can be classified as generalized linear fixed-and/or mixed-effect models. Although IRT models appear most often in the psychological testing literature, researchers in other fields have successfully utilized IRT-like models in a wide variety of applications. This paper discusses the three major methods of estimation in IRT and develops R functions utilizing the built-in capabilities of the R environment to find the marginal maximum likelihood estimates of the generalized partial credit model. The currently available R packages ltm is also discussed.

Towards automated lexicography, this paper proposes a word-sense discrimination method based on two modern techniques; EM algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA). The spherical Gaussian EM algorithm enhanced with PCA for robust initialization is proposed to cluster word senses of a target word automatically. Three variants of the algorithm, namely PCA, sGEM, and PCA-sGEM, are investigated using a gold standard dataset of two polysemous words. The clustering result is evaluated using the measures of purity and entropy as well as a more recent measure called normalized mutual information (NMI). The experimental result indicates that the proposed algorithms gain promising performance with regard to discriminate word senses and the PCA-sGEM outperforrns the other two methods to some extent.

Blur and image restoration of nonlinearly degraded images using neural networks based on modified nonlinear ARMA model	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						blind image deconvolution; image restoration; blur identification; nonlinear ARMA models; neural networks	EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, an image restoration algorithm is proposed to identify nonlinear and noncausal blur funclon using artificial neural networks. Image and degradation processes include both linear and nonlinear phenomena. The proposed neural network model, which combines an adaptive auto-associative network with a random Gaussian process, I is used to restore the blurred image and blur function, simultaneously. The noisy and blurred images are modeled as nonlinear continuous associative networks. The auto-associative part determines the image model coefficients and the hetero-associative part determines the blur function of the image degradation process. The self-organization like structure of the proposed neural network provides the potential solution of the blind image restoration problem. The estimation and restoration are implemented by using an iterative gradient based algorithm to minimize the error function.

J	Jenkinson, C; Harris, R; Fitzpatrick, R				Jenkinson, Crispin; Harris, Robert; Fitzpatrick, Ray			The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ-40): Evidence for a method of imputing missing data	AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS			English	Article						motor neuron disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis assessment questionnaire; ALSAQ-40; missing data; data imputation	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE; SCORE RELIABILITY; HEALTH-STATUS; RESPONSE RATE; TRIALS; TESTS	The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ-40) is the most widely validated measure of health status for use with patients diagnosed with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). The questionnaire was designed to be used in studies evaluating treatment regimes where missing data may cause problems with data analyses.The purpose of this paper is to evaluate an algorithm for the imputation of missing dimension scores on the ALSAQ-40. We used a postal survey of patients diagnosed with MND/ALS. One thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine patients were surveyed and 1093 (55.2%) questionnaires returned. Of these, complete ALSAQ-40 data was available in 854 (85.8%) cases. Data were deleted from this complete dataset, and in a randomly selected subset of 100 cases, and then imputed using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm: results were then compared to the dataset prior to data deletion. Descriptive statistics, mean scores and spread of scores were almost identical between original and imputed datasets. Furthermore, the two datasets were highly correlated (intra-class correlation coefficient= 0.95 or greater), and mean differences were small (+/- 1.00). We concluded that EM imputation for the ALSAQ-40 provides data that closely mirrors the original when this has been deliberately removed. Consequently, EM is likely to be appropriate for studies using the ALSAQ-40 that contain missing data points.

J	Razzazi, F; Sayadiyan, A				Razzazi, Farbod; Sayadiyan, Abolghasem			Evaluation of soft segment modeling on a context independent phoneme classification system	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						automatic speech recognition; duration modeling; expectation maximization algorithm; segmental HMM; soft segment modeling	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; HMMS	The geometric distribution of states ' duration is one of the main performance limiting assumptions of hidden Markov modeling of speech signals. Stochastic segment models, generally, and segmental HMM, specifically, overcome this deficiency partly at the cost of more complexity in both training and recognition phases. In addition to this assumption, the gradual temporal changes of speech statistics has not been modeled in HMM. In this paper, a new duration modeling approach is presented. The main idea of the model is to consider the effect of adjacent segments on the probability density function estimation and evaluation of each acoustic segment. This idea not only makes the model robust against segmentation errors, but also it models gradual change from one segment to the next one with a minimum set of parameters. The proposed idea is analytically formulated and tested on a TIMIT based context independent phoneme classification system. During the test procedure, the phoneme classification of different phoneme classes was performed by applying various proposed recognition algorithms. The system was optimized and the results have been compared with a continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) with similar computational complexity. The results show 8-10% improvement in phoneme recognition rate in comparison with standard continuous density hidden Markov model. This indicates improved compatibility of the proposed model with the speech nature.

The traditional FWER controlling procedures are not very useful in this situation since the experiments are exploratory by nature and researchers are more interested in controlling the rate of false positives rather than controlling the probability of making a single erroneous decision. This has led to increased use of FDR (False Discovery Rate) controlling procedures. Genovese and Wasserman proposed a single-step FDR procedure that is an asymptotic approximation to the original Benjamini and Hochberg stepwise procedure. In this paper, we modify the Genovese-Wasserman procedure to force the FDR control closer to the level alpha in the independence setting. Assuming that the data comes from a mixture of two normals, we also propose to make this procedure adaptive by first estimating the parameters using the EM algorithm and then using these estimated parameters into the above modification of the Genovese-Wasserman procedure. We compare this procedure with the original Benjamini-Hochberg and the SAM thresholding procedures. The FDR control and other properties of this adaptive procedure are verified numerically.

Blind source separation of speech sources in wavelet packet domains using Laplacian mixture model expectation maximization estimation in overcomplete cases	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						structural correlations ( theory); data mining ( experiment); signal transduction ( experiment)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SIGNAL SEPARATION; IMAGE CODES; SPARSE; REPRESENTATION; DECOMPOSITION; FRAMEWORK; NOISE; MRI	Speech processing has benefited a great deal from wavelet transforms. Wavelet packets decompose signals into broader components using linear spectral bisecting. The mixing matrix is the key issue in the blind source separation literature especially in underdetermined cases (more sources than sensors). In this paper, algorithms are proposed for estimating the mixing matrix and separation of speech signals from noise free linear mixtures in overcomplete cases. Mixtures of speech signals are decomposed using wavelet packets, the phase difference between the two mixtures is defined and used in the wavelet domain, and histograms of phase differences are obtained for every wavelet packet. In our method, the Laplacian mixture model is considered in the wavelet packet domain, and is applied to each histogram of packets. An expectation maximization algorithm is used to train the model and calculate the model parameters. We also propose a novel method for obtaining the best wavelet packet node for finding source directions in scatter plots using variance calculations. A comparison is made to evaluate the performances of different mother wavelets in the estimation of the mixing matrix and the best wavelet has been chosen. On the basis of the geometrical model, a two-step adaptive algorithm is proposed for separating sources from mixtures.

The high-luminosity e+e- linear collider no longer produces a monochromatic energy spectrum in the center of mass system, but a continuous and rather broad energy spectrum due to beamstrahlung of colliding e(+) and e(-) beams. Without precise knowledge of this energy spectrum alias the luminosity spectrum, the precision experiment in the linear collider should be confronted with a crucial problem. A statistical method based on new developments in information technology is examined with a view of determining the luminosity spectrum. A statistical model is formulated and a likelihood fitting is carried out to determine the luminosity spectrum by using Bhabha events. The e(+) and e(-) beam parameters, describing the luminosity spectrum, can be determined with an uncertainty of several percent by using 10 k Bhabha events under an ideal detector condition.

Analysis of interval-censored data from circular migrant and non-migrant sexual partnerships using the EM algorithm	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						interval censored; EM algorithm; frailty; HIV; sexual partnerships	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; FAILURE TIME DATA; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; HIV-INFECTION; SURVIVAL	In epiderniological Studies Where Subjects are seen periodically on follow-up visits, interval-censored data Occur naturally. The exact time the change of state (such as HIV seroconversion) Occurs is not known exactly, only that it Occurred sometime within a specific time interval. Methods of estimation for interval-censored data are readily available when data are independent. However, methods for correlated interval-censored data are not well developed. This paper considers an approach for estimating the parameters when data are interval-censored and correlated within Sexual partnerships. We consider the exact event times for interval-censored observations as unobserved data, only known to be between two time points. Dependency induced by Sexual partnerships is modelled as frailties assuming a gamma distribution for frailties and an exponential distribution on the time to infection. This formulation facilitates application of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Maximization process maximizes the standard Survival frailty model. Results Show high degree of heterogeneity between sexual partnerships. Intervention strategies aimed at combating the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI)s Should treat sexual partnerships as social units and fully incorporate the effects of migration in their strategies.

A Framework for Classification and Segmentation of Massive Audio Data Streams	KDD-2007 PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	AUG 12-15, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Speaker Recognition		In recent years, the proliferation of VOIP data has created a number of applications in which it is desirable to perform quick online classification and recognition of massive voice streams. Typically such applications are encountered in real time intelligence and surveillance. In many cases, the data streams can be in compressed format, and the rate of data processing can often run at the rate of Gigabits per second. All known techniques for speaker voice analysis require the use of an offline training phase in which the system is trained with known segments of speech. The state-of-the-art method for text-independent speaker recognition is known as Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM), and it requires an iterative Expectation Maximization Procedure for training, which cannot be implemented in real time. In this paper, we discuss the details of such an online voice recognition system. For this purpose, we use our micro-clustering algorithms to design concise signatures of the target speakers. One of the surprising and insightful observations from our experiences with such a system is that while it was originally designed only for efficiency, we later discovered that it was also more accurate than the widely used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). This was because of the conciseness of the micro-cluster model, which made it less prone to over training. This is evidence of the fact that it is often possible to get the best of both worlds and do better than complex models both from an efficiency and accuracy perspective.

This work focuses on the phase spectra of the harmonics and provides a methodology to analyze and subsequently to model the statistics of the harmonic phases. To do so, we propose the use of a Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model (WGMM), a model suitable for random variables that belong to circular spaces, and provide an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for training. The WGMM is then used to construct a phase quantizer. The quantizer is employed in a prototype variable rate narrowband VoIP sinusoidal codec that is equivalent to iLBC in terms of PESQ-MOS, at similar to 13 kbps.

However in wireless systems, performance and mobility can be further enhanced by operating semi-blind channel estimation refinement between reference symbols. A channel tracking method based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and on a block representation of the channel variations has been proposed. It performs better than already existing recursive algorithms with the additional advantage of a linear arithmetic complexity. In this paper, we study the matrix governing the behaviour of this method. This leads to a practical rule for choosing optimally (with respect to the convergence rate) the unique parameter of the method. The proposed iterative procedure is applicable to both single carrier and OFDM systems. Simulations are presented in the context of 5 GHz WLANs, showing the practical interest of the method.

We explain this concept and how the model is trained by the EM algorithm. We then show how the AHMM can be applied to the analysis of group action events in meetings from both clear and disturbed data. The AHMM outperforms an early fusion HMM by 5.7% recognition rate (a rel. error reduction of 38.5%) for clear data. For occluded data, the improvement is in average 6.5% recognition rate (rel. error red. 40%). Thus asynchronity is a dominant factor in meeting analysis, even if the data is disturbed. The AHMM exploits this and is therefore much more robust against disturbances.

The growth estimates are obtained using segmentation and registration based methods. The segmentation approach used an expectation maximisation (EM) method to classify tissue types and the registration approach used tensor based morphometry (TBM) applied to a free form deformation (FFD) model. The two methods show very good agreement indicating that the registration and segmentation approaches can be used interchangeably. The advantage of the registration based method, however, is that it can provide more local estimates of tissue growth. This is the first longitudinal study of growth in early childhood, previous longitudinal studies have focussed on later periods during childhood.

Receiver design for MIMO OFDM transmission over time variant channels	2007 IEEE 8TH WORKSHOP ON SIGNAL PROCESSING ADVANCES IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications	JUN 17-20, 2007	Helsinki, FINLAND	IEEE			DISPERSIVE FADING CHANNELS; SYSTEMS	This paper considers receiver design for space time block coded MIMO OFDM transmission over frequency and time selective channels. The receiver employs the expectation-maximization algorithm for joint channel and data recovery. It makes collective use of the data and channel constraints of the communication problem. The data constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, the finite alphabet constraint, and space-time block coding. The channel constraints include the finite delay spread and frequency and time correlation as well as spatial correlation. The channel estimation part of the receiver boils down to an EM-based forward-backward Kalman filter. To avoid the latency and storage associated with smoothing, we introduce a forward-only Kalman that performas channel (and data) recovery with no latency. Simulations show that the receiver outperforms other least-squares based iterative receivers.

The pattern recognition scheme proposed, utilizes fused dynamic and morphological features extracted from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). The performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated through extensive training and testing on several patient cases, where the staging of their condition has been previously evaluated by both ultrasound-guided biopsy and radiological assessment. The classification scheme is based on Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs), whose parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm during a training phase. Fusion of the image characteristics is performed by properly aligning the respective T1-weighted dynamic and T2-weighted morphological images, allowing accurate feature selection from both images. The proposed classification scheme as well as the effect of fusion on the extracted features is tested, with respect to the correct classification rate (CCR) of each case.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting the current location of a mobile user and describe how the method can be used to facilitate paging process. Based on observation that most mobile users have mobility patterns that they follow in general, the proposed method discovers common mobility patterns from a collection of user moving logs. To do this, the method models cell-residence times as generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the model parameters. Mobility patterns, each is characterized by a common trajectory and a cell-residence time model, are then used for making predictions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has better prediction performance when compared with two other prediction methods.			ancntt2002@yahoo.com.au; phuongtm@fpt.com.vn					AGRAWAL R, 1995, PROC INT CONF DATA, P3, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.1995.380415; Akyildiz IF, 1996, IEEE ACM T NETWORK, V4, P629, DOI 10.1109/90.532871; BHATTACHARYA A, 2002, ACM KLUWER WIRELESS, V8, P121; Chakraborty G, 2002, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2571, P142; DEMPSTER AP, 1987, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V39, P1; Katsaros D, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2810, P319, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-45231-7_30; Liu T, 1998, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V16, P922; LYBEROPOULOS GL, 1995, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V44, P543, DOI 10.1109/25.406621; Majumdar K, 2005, WIREL NETW, V11, P275, DOI 10.1007/s11276-005-6611-x; Mitchell T., 1997, MACHINE LEARNING; Rajagopal S., 2002, Proceedings 10th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON 2002).

Two methods of tomographic reconstruction for emission images were implemented: Filtered Backprojection (FBP) and an Maximum Likelihood-Expectation Maximization (MLEM). Filters were also implemented. Validation tests were carried out with simulated images of geometric models and an anthropomorphic model through Monte Carlo method. The analysis of convergence of the iterative method through the estimate of the relationship between the average uptake and the standard deviation resulted in an indication of reconstruction with 10 to 15 iterations. The images reconstructed through the ML-EM method with attenuation correction presented better visual quality than the non-corrected images. For 128x128 pixel images, MLEM time is 33 times longer than FBP. When attenuation correction is carried out time increases 3.5x.	[Andrade, M.

Creating accurate models involves both selection of the model complexity and optimum training given the data. Using models with fixed complexity and trained using the standard EM algorithm poses a risk of overfitting, which can lead to a reduction in diarization performance. In this paper a technique proposed by the author to estimate the complexity of a model is combined with a novel training algorithm called "Cross-Validation EM" to control the number of training iterations. This combination leads to more robust speaker modeling and results in an increase in speaker diarization performance. Tests on the NIST RT (MDM) datasets for meetings show a relative improvement of 10.6% relative on the test set.

The localization problem is transformed into the retrieval of the unobservable state of a dynamical model through noisy measures. Though effective, two problems are related to particle filter: the degeneracy phenomenon (all particles but one are not significative) and the loss of diversity (all particles collapse on the same point). By using Regularized particle filter (RPF) and Expectation Maximization (EM) we propose a solution to both problems. Experimental results validate the proposed solution: Regularized Particle Filter enables to obtain a RMS error lower than 0.2m with a reverberation time of 0.6s.

Complicating this approach is the fact that the noise distribution is rarely fully known to the fusion center. Here we assume the distribution is known but not the defining parameters, e.g., variance. The resulting incomplete data estimation problem is approached from a expectation-maximization (EM) perspective. The critical initialization and convergence aspects of the EM algorithm are investigated. Furthermore, the estimation of the source parameter is extended to the blind case where both the channel and sensor noise parameters are unknown. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of the propose estimators.

In contrast with Expectation Maximization (EM), the proposed technique does not rely on any space discretization. Namely, the activity distribution - normalized emission intensity of the spatial poisson process - is considered as a spatial probability density and observations are the projections of random emissions whose distribution has to be estimated. This approach is nonparametric in the sense that the quantity of interest belongs to the set of probability measures on R-k (for reconstruction in k-dimensions) and it is Bayesian in the sense that we define a prior directly on this spatial measure. In this context, we propose to model the nonparametric probability density as an infinite mixture of multivariate normal distributions. As a prior for this mixture we consider a Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) with a Normal-Inverse Wishart (MW) model as base distribution of the Dirichlet Process. As in EM-family reconstruction, we use a data augmentation scheme where the set of hidden variables are the emission locations for each observed line of response in the continuous object space. Thanks to the data augmentation, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Gibbs sampler) which is able to generate draws from the posterior distribution of the spatial intensity. A difference with EM is that one step of the Gibbs sampler corresponds to the generation of emission locations while only the expected number of emissions per pixel/voxel is used in EM. Another key difference is that the estimated spatial intensity is a continuous function such that there is no need to compute a projection matrix. Finally, draws from the intensity posterior distribution allow the estimation of posterior functionnals like the variance or confidence intervals. Results are presented for simulated data based on a 2D brain phantom and compared to Bayesian MAP-EM.

In the first method, the pilot symbols are distributed at certain locations in the OFDM time-frequency lattices to find appropriate initial values. In the second method, the pilot symbols are placed in the first OFDM symbol and then a sequential channel estimation is applied. These two methods are compared and the performances are studied in terns of mean square error and bit error rate. Moreover, the number of iterations used in the algorithm are given to compare the complexity of the methods.

The frequency domain Wiener Filter smoothes Maximum-Likelihood estimates of the channel frequency response obtained by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Different variants of the proposed scheme are experimentally investigated in an IEEE 802.11a-like system setup.

Many algorithms and software packages have been developed to address the problem. The Expectation Maximization (EM)-type motif algorithm such as MEME is one of the most popular de novo motif discovery methods. However, as pointed out in literature, EM algorithms largely depend on their initialization and can be easily trapped in local optima. This paper proposes and implements a Genetic-based EM Motif-Finding Algorithm (GEMFA) aiming to overcome the drawbacks inherent in EM motif discovery algorithms. It first initializes a population of multiple local alignments each of which is encoded on a chromosome that represents a potential solution. GEMFA then performs heuristic search in the whole alignment space using minimum distance length (MDL) as the fitness function which is generalized from maximum log-likelihood. The genetic algorithm gradually moves this population towards the best alignment from which the motif model is derived. Simulated and real biological sequence analysis showed that GEMFA performed better than the simple multiple-restart of EM motif-finding algorithm especially in the subtle motif sequence allgnment and other similar algorithms as well.

The key issue is the achievement of a sparse model, i.e., a model in which all irrelevant parameters are set exactly to zero. Alternatively to standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Baum Welch training), in the proposed approach the parameters estimation problem is cast into a Bayesian framework, with the introduction of a negative Dirichlet prior which strongly encourages sparseness of the model. A modified Expectation Maximization algorithm has been devised, able to determine a MAP (Maximum A Posteriori probability) estimate of HMM parameters in this Bayesian formulation. Theoretical considerations and experimental comparative evaluations on a 2D shape classification task contribute to validate the proposed technique.

Multi-Frame Assignment PMHT (MF-PMHT) is an algorithm designed to mitigate some performance problems associated with PMHT. In MF-PMHT, the PMHT algorithm is applied to multi-frame sequences in the last L frames of data and considers the set of all possible measurement sequences. While effective in improving tracking performance compared to PMHT, performance of the original MF-PMHT degrades when the target single-frame detection probability is non-unity. This is because missed detections are not considered in the multi-frame sequences. A new MF-PMHT implementation is derived in this paper which explicitly considers missed detections in the multi-frame sequences. Performance of this MF-PMHT is compared to the original MF-PMHT algorithm as well as to a Homothetic PMHT. Simulation results indicate that the new MF- PMHT algorithm performs the same as the original algorithm when there are no missed detections and also performs better than the alternative algorithms considered when there are missed detections.

However PMHT only provides a point estimate for target tracks. The "covariance" returned by the PMHT is a by-product of applying the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to maximize the PMHT likelihood function and is not intended to be the track estimate covariance. In this paper we derive a consistent covariance estimator for PMHT. By re-introducing, the constraint that the sum of the PMHT weights (posterior probabilities that a measurement is target-originated) across measurements sum to unity, a covariance based on Probabilistic Data Association (PDA) principles is derived. We show through simulations that the resulting covariance provides a consistent covariance for the PMHT track estimates. There has been some work both in the statistics and engineering literature that gives the posterior covariance for ML Gaussian-mixture estimation, and the PMHT can be viewed as a tracker whose genesis is of MAP Gaussian-mixture estimation with a Gaussian prior. The expressions and calculations are, unfortunately, complicated. Consequently we also report on a novel and intuitive way to derive these via calculus.

We propose two STS priors, both of which favor activation of a few localized areas of cortex over a limited time duration and bandwidth via appropriate basis functions. This provides a reasonable model of true brain activity which minimizes the impact of the inherently ill-conditioned, low SNR, spatial inverse problem. We use an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to solve the STS penalized least-squares cost function. The solution localizes brain activity in space and time, providing support for a refined signal estimate (e.g. minimum norm least-squares). We illustrate the approach on both simulated and real data and provide preliminary theoretical analysis of performance.

The STS approach assumes that events of interest occur on localized areas of the cortex over a limited time duration, and that only a few events of interest occur during a measurement period (or epoch). Cortical activity is reconstructed by minimizing a cost function which fits the data with a sparse set of space-time events using a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We employ spatial and temporal basis functions to reduce the dimension of the data fitting problem and combat noise. Simulations suggest that our approach could be useful for identifying sequential relationships in the brain.

The iterative approach developed is derived from the Classification Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm, in which the parametric modelling of the mixture density is replaced by a non parametric modelling using local kernels, and the posterior probabilities account for the coherence of current clusters through the measure of class-conditional entropies. Applications of this method to synthetic and real data including multispectral images are presented. The classification issues are compared with other recent unsupervised approaches, and we show that our method reaches a more reliable estimation of the number of clusters while providing slightly better rates of correct classification in average.

We analyze this problem using finite mixtures of distributions. The multinomial and the multinomial Dirichlet distributions are widely accepted to model count data. We show that these two distributions cannot be the best choice in all the applications and we propose another model based on the selection of the generalized Dirichlet as a prior to the multinomial. The estimation of the parameters and the determination of the number of components in our model are based on the expectation-maximization approach and the minimum description length criterion, respectively. We compare our method to standard approaches to show its merits. The comparison involves spatial color image databases indexing.

The main challenge to obtaining quantitative physiological information from such data is the lack of X-ray attenuation data for the small animals. In this paper we present an experimental design in which a nonspecific clinical SPECT-CT scanner is used to collect both transmission and emission scan data for small animals. Necessary hardware enhancements include construction of a new animal bed and construction of a modified emission-transmission calibration object. An emission scan of this calibration object is used to determine the study-specific geometrical parameters of the gantry. In the past, we have shown that 25 adjustable parameters are needed to describe the angle-dependent positions of the detectors and pinhole collimators in order to obtain sufficient spatial precision. A CT scan of the calibration object is used to achieve three-dimensional image registration by aligning the transmission and emission fields of view. The emission system matrix is calculated by ray tracing. The algorithm corrects for X-ray attenuation and for the system geometric response that results from the finite sizes of the pinhole aperture and the detector pixels. The system matrix was applied to the reconstruction of static and dynamic SPECT images using the ML-EM algorithm with a total-variation regularization term. In future studies, time-varying data from the first minute of acquisition will be used to extract kinetic information about how radiopharmaceuticals interact with different tissue types.

In this paper, we present a robust method for unsupervised lips segmentation. First the color of the lips area is estimated using expectation maximization and a membership map of the lips is computed from the skin color distribution. The region of interest (ROI) is then found by automatic thresholding on the membership map. Given a mask of the ROI, we initialize a snake that is fitted on the upper and lower contour of the mouth by multi level gradient flow maximization. Finally to find the mouth corners and the final contour of the mouth, we use a parametric model composed of cubic curves and Bezier curves.

Latent class methodology is one of the several conjoint segmentation procedures that overcome the limitations of aggregate analysis and a-priori segmentation. The main benefit of Latent class models is that they simultaneously estimate market segment membership and parameter estimates for each derived market segment. In this paper we present two latent class models. The first model is a latent class metric model using mixtures of multivariate conditional normal distributions to analyze rating data. The second is a latent class multinomial logit model used to analyze choice data. The EM algorithm is employed to maximize the likelihood in both models. The application focuses on tourists' preference and choice behaviour when assessing package tours. A number of demographic and product related explanatory variables are used to generate segments that are accessible and actionable. A Monte Carlo study is also presented in this paper. This study examines how the number of hypothetical subjects, number of specified segments and number of predictors affect the performance of the latent class metric conjoint model with respect to parameter recovery and segment membership recovery.

In this paper, we present two simulation studies for latent class segmentation models. The first Monte Carlo Study compares the performance of seven Information Criteria in predicting the correct number of segments. The second Study Investigates factors that have an effect on segment membership and parameter recovery and affect computational effort.

The ML solution is obtained in the frequency domain for ML estimation algorithm since the source signal is wideband signal and the corresponding ML solution can not be achieved in the time domain. The expectation mlx.mization (EM) algorithm is therefore suggested for the estimation of the location parameters since there is not closed form solutions for the corresponding maximum likelihood function. Moreover, simulation results of the suggested algorithm are illustrated to present the performance of the algorithm.

Modelling Australian Interest Rate Swap Spreads by Mixture Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic processes	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Conditional volatility; EM algorithm; MARCH model; Outliers; Regime switches	EM ALGORITHM; VOLATILITY; RISK	An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange periodically fixed rate payments for floating rate payments based on an agreed-upon notional principal and maturity. The fixed rate is known as the swap rate and a swap curve can be constructed using swap rates of different maturities. The swap curve is widely used by financial market participants as the benchmark for the pricing of investment grade corporate bonds. The floating rate is usually the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW) in the Australian market. The Australian interest rate swap market is the most important over-the-counter (OTC) derivative market in Australia. The outstanding notional amount at the end of June 2006 was US$815.8 billion, which was much greater than other derivative instruments such as the forward rate agreements and interest rate options. The swap market size is comparable to the stock market in Australia, which had a market capitalisation of US$893.3 billion at the end of June 2006. The observed difference between the swap rate and the government bond yield of corresponding maturity is known as the swap spread. The swap spread reflects the risk premium that is involved in a swap transaction instead of holding risk-free government bonds. It is primarily composed of the liquidity risk premium and the credit risk premium. In recent years there has been growing interest in modelling swap spreads because the swap spread is the key pricing variable for the swap rate. In this paper we apply the class of mixture autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (MARCH) models to three (3-year, 5-year and 10-year) swap spread series in Australia. The MARCH model is able to capture both of the stylised characteristics of the observed changes of the swap spread series: volatility persistence and the dependence of volatility on the level of the data. The proposed MARCH model also allows for regime switches in the swap spreads. A MARCH (2; 3,0; 1,0) model is consistently identified for the three observed series. The fitted MARCH models can be interpreted as AR(3)-ARCH(1) processes mixed with small portions (5% to 10%) of independent shocks/breaks. In addition, we use the ex ante conditional probabilities as a tool for detecting possible shocks in the swap spread data. Around 50 observations of the 5-year swap spread series are identified as likely to come from the shock component. These detected shocks are mainly from the fourth quarter of 2001 (after terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001) and the summer of 2003 (retreat of mortgage-backed securities convexity hedging in the United States).

Prediction of TF pairs that mostly likely contribute to the regulated transcription of differentially expressed genes are done through the computation of their expression coherence (EC). The Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering is performed additionally in order to detect patterns in specific TF binding positions. We evaluate the EC of expression profiles of genes within each cluster to discover binding trends that may play a significant role in regulation of target genes. Our method has successfully identified TF pairs that have a greater potential for regulating their target genes at specified locations rather than at arbitrary locations.

Discover the power of social and hidden curriculum to decision making: Experiments with enron email and movie newsgroups	ICMLA 2007: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2007	Cincinnati, OH	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE				The power of social values that helps to surreptitiously shape or formulate our behavior patterns is not only inevitable, but also influential as the directions of our decision making can never seem to escape the impact of this hidden agent. Therefore, the search of such power agent can be validated through a machine learning approach that enables us to discover the agent dynamics in which drives the evolution of the social groups in a community. By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilistic model for the agent dynamics: the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters. Our approach is to identify, the appropriate parameters in the model. To solve the problem, we develop heuristic expectation-maximization style algorithms for determining the micro-laws of a community based on either observed communication links between actors, or the observed evolution of social groups. We present the learning results from the synthetic data as well as the findings on real communities, e.g., Enron entail and movie newsgroups.

Compensation of patient motion in PET using a rotator and list-mode reconstruction	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE		PET; motion compensation; 3D Gaussian interpolation; list-mode EM algorithm; motion frame	ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; HEAD MOVEMENT; SPECT; TRANSFORMATION; PROJECTION; TRACKING	PET images are degraded by a number of physical factors present in the imaging process. One of these factors that can potentially have a large impact on PET image quality is patient motion. Due to the relatively large scanning time involved in a whole-body PET study, it is common for patients to move during the imaging study. Furthermore, physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion can also degrade image quality. There are two basic approaches for developing PET iterative reconstruction methods that compensate for patient motion. The first approach is to model patient motion in the reconstruction (image) space. The second approach is to model the relative patient motion by moving the detector, and correcting the measured lines of response (LORs) in event space. In this study, an image-space based, list-mode ordered-subsets, expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm is evaluated and tested. This method forms frames of list-mode data for each motion state, and uses a fast 3D Gaussian rotator to model motion in the projection and backprojection operations. In addition, a simpler method involving post-reconstruction rotation of each motion state is also evaluated. To study these approaches, a GATE Monte Carlo based computer simulation study using the NCAT anthropomorphic phantom was used to evaluate and compare the motion compensation methods. Quantitative analysis indicated that the two motion correction methods provided good fidelity to the reconstruction obtained from simulated measurements with no patient motion.

Determination of the system matrix used in list-mode EM reconstruction of PET	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE		PET; system matrix; sensitivity image; list-mode reconstruction; EM algorithm		The system matrix bridges measured lines-of-response (LORs) in PET to the object being imaged. Accurate determination of the system matrix remains challenging since every object is different and pre-computing and storing the entire matrix is not feasible due to the large number of scintillation crystals present in current PET scanners. A ray tracing algorithm in list-mode expectation-maximization (EM) reconstruction is commonly used to simplify and calculate the system matrix on-the-fly. The EM algorithm requires an estimate of the sensitivity image which is the summation of the system matrix over all possible LORs and is sometimes computed through a limited sampling of possible LORs. A problem with this approach is that the variation within the sensitivity image can contribute a large amount to the variance of reconstruction through error propagation. Furthermore, it is not feasible to accurately model the detector response for each reconstruction. In this study, we approximated the sensitivity image to be object-independent, thus making it possible to use an accurate Monte Carlo simulator such as GATE to model all interactions within the detector and to pre-compute the sensitivity image only once. Traditionally, the measured LORs contain paired detector IDs but no 3D position information due to limited spatial resolution. We propose a method to model the 3D positions of LORs including the depth of interaction (DOI) in the determination of the system matrix. We investigated the impact of using different techniques for assigning the end-point positions of the LORs in the projection and backprojection operations. Results showed that assigning the end-points to be located in the center of the crystal surface provided the worst performance. Better performance could be achieved by either randomly perturbing the end-points in 2D (across the crystal face), or 3D (including depth) in a 2D PET. The best performance was achieved by using a Monte Carlo derived position distribution. In conclusion, combining a Monte Carlo simulated sensitivity image for a given PET system with a correct LOR 3D position sampling according to a realistic photon distribution in the corresponding detector crystals can significantly improve list-mode EM reconstruction.

Nevertheless, the RPEM is unable to exclude the irrelevant variables (also called features) from the clustering process, which may degrade the algorithm's performance. In this paper, we adopt the concept of feature salience (Law et at. 2004) as the feature weight to measure the relevance of features to the cluster structure in the subspace, and integrate it into the RPEM algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies the irrelevant features and estimates the number of clusters automatically and simultaneously in a single learning paradigm. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on both synthetic and benchmark real data sets.

PET image reconstruction with a Bayesian projector for multi-electronic collimation schemes	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				We evaluated a new image reconstruction algorithm using a Bayesian projector for multi-collimation PET systems. We are developing a PET system using high spatial and energy resolution 3-D detectors made from cadmium zinc telluride with cross-strip anodes and cathodes. This PET system can collimate photon pairs by coincidence timing and can collimate single photons by the kinematics of Compton scatter within the detector (Compton collimation). Compton collimation of single photons can dramatically increase overall photon sensitivity by making use of events that are discarded by conventional PET systems. However, single photon events offer lower spatial resolution than coincidence measurements. Previously, we showed that conventional maximum likelihood reconstruction by the list-mode ordered subset expectation-maximization (OS-EM) algorithm for these "multi-collimation" data sets yields no measurable improvement over images reconstructed using high-resolution coincidence collimation alone. We also studied a Bayesian projector function with non-uniform emission probability along the line of response weighted by an image prior generated from the low-resolution (Compton collimation) channel, to reconstruct the high-resolution (coincidence) channel. In this work, we investigated a novel approach using priors generated by reconstructing images from the high-spatial resolution coincidence data followed by post-reconstruction smoothing with a new spatially varying 3-D filter function and the Perona-Malik gradient anisotropic diffusion filter.

In multicell envirnoments, the CCI is usually the OFDM signal from adjacent cells. Although the joint detection of the desired signal and CCI is desirable to effectively mitigate the CCI, it can be impractical due to prohibitively high computational complexity. Thus, a practical approach is to detect the desired signal only, while the CCI becomes a (colored) noise. This leads to an maximum likelihood (ML) based approach for the proposed iterative receiver, in which the estimation of the covariance matrix of the CCI and the MIMO channel is considered through a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm.

An example is house prices, which depend on the characteristics of the house, and on the desirability of the neighborhood, which is not directly measurable. The proposed method comprises two trainable components. The first one is a parametric model that predicts the "intrinsic" price of the house from its description. The second one is a smooth, non-parametric model of the latent "desirability" manifold. The predicted price of a house is the product of its intrinsic price and desirability. The two components are trained simultaneously using a deterministic form of the EM algorithm. The model was trained on a large dataset of houses from Los Angeles county. It produces better predictions than pure parametric and non-parametric models. It also produces useful estimates of the desirability surface at each location.

For this test, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates for propagation delay, direction of arrival, direction of departure, and Doppler shifts are required for each potential number of propagation paths. The ML-estimator is implemented via a variant of the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The proposed test is based on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for guaranteeing a false discovery rate and employs the simple bootstrap approach for approximating the required p-values for the multiple test.

In this paper, problems of feature selection and classification scheme are addressed. The feature is based on High Order Statistics (HOS) to discriminate close and far-field talk, enhanced by a feature derived from the normalized autocorrelation. Comparative effectiveness on several HOS is shown. The classification is done in real-time with a recursive, online EM algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on the CENSREC-1-C database, which is used for VAD evaluation for automatic speech recognition (ASR) [1], and the proposed method is confirmed to significantly outperform the baseline energy-based method.

Each protein's profile was extended with extra bits encoding the phylogenetic tree structure and the likelihood, in the form of weights on profile indices, of the protein's functional family membership in each of the reference genomes. The extended profiles were then integrated as part of a kernel of a support vector machine, which was trained in a transductive learning scheme using the EM algorithm to update the weights. Classification accuracy was greatly increased when tested on the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the MIPS classification as a benchmark.

The applied model is a hidden Markov model which is parameterized from an appropriate filtered Gaussian white noise signal. For the parameterization of the Markov chain the Baum-Welch expectation-maximization algorithm has been used. The resulting Markov model is applicable to generate scintillation time series for any desired duration with the time and amplitude resolution of the original training data. From the synthesized time series the statistical properties like the cumulative distribution and the dynamics of the scintillation can be also determined. To prove the accuracy of the model at first the cumulative distribution function of the original and synthesized time series are compared. A further test of the model validity is the comparison with real scintillation measurement on a land mobile satellite link. Finally, the spectral test of the filtered Gaussian model, the hidden Markov model and the satellite link measurement shows that the constant and decreasing parts in the periodograms are showing similarities what confirms the good quality of the model.

We estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood using an approximate Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm which employs a recursive point process filter, fixed-interval smoothing and state-space covariance algorithms. We assess model goodness-of-fit using the time-rescaling theorem and guide the choice of model order with Akaike's information criterion. We illustrate our approach in two applications. In the analysis of hippocampal neural activity recorded from a monkey performing a location-scene association task, we use the model to quantify the neural changes related to learning. In the analysis of primary auditory cortex responses to different levels of electrical stimulation in the rat midbrain, we use the method to analyze auditory threshold detection. Our findings have important implications for developing theoretically-sound and practical tools to characterize the dynamics of spiking activity.

The RUSK-ATM vector channel sounder operated at a center frequency of 2 GHz and a bandwidth of 120 MHz. Maximum-likelihood estimates for propagation delay, direction of arrival, direction of departure are obtained with the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is invoked using the bootstrap approximation to select the number of propagation paths for a given false discovery rate.

The Bayesian approach offers an alternative. The goal of this study was to compare, using real (calf gastroenteritis) and simulated data, the results obtained with the MCMC method used in the Bayesian approach versus two frequentist approaches: the Newton-Raphson algorithm to solve a penalized likelihood and the EM algorithm. The results obtained showed that when the number of groups in the population decreases, the Bayesian approach gives a less biased estimation of the frailty variance and of the group fixed effect than the frequentist approaches.

The CAMM is an efficient image description based on non-uniform sampling and linear interpolation. The data acquisition process, e.g. forward projection, is calculated using a ray-casting algorithm. We tested, successfully, the proposed projection operator model using a simulation and a maximum-likelihood expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm. The research described in this paper establishes a methodology for future development of 4D (deformable) CAMM reconstruction.

Modeling the differences between two images or between an image and its PC estimate (obtained as a projection onto a subspace of PCs) with a mixed distribution of random noise and outliers, the masks are produced by a simple iterative Expectation-Maximisation based procedure. Experiments with facial images (extracted from the MIT face database) demonstrate the efficiency of this approach.

Training-based classifications suffer from lack of training databases or degrade when training and test statistics mismatch due to variances in speakers, languages, talking styles, noise, transmission channels, etc. This paper proposes a novel voiced-unvoiced-silence classification based on unsupervised learning. The class-dependent statistics (feature means, covariance matrices, and occurrence frequencies of voiced, unvoiced, and silence classes) needed for the classification are estimated directly from the signal to be classified via Gaussian mixture models and the expectation maximization algorithm. The classification is evaluated using NTIMIT, and the results are encouraging: V/UV/S classification accuracy is greater than 91.15%, and voice activity detection accuracy is greater than 97.45%.

First, a single template cell is estimated using an Expectation Maximization algorithm applied to a collection of correctly segmented cells from the original image. Next, a process based on matching the template against the clumped shape and removing the matched area is applied iteratively. A chain code representation is used for establishing best correlation between these two shapes. Maximal correlation point is used as an landmark point for the registration approach, which finds the affine transformation that maximises the intersection area between both shapes. Evaluation was carried out on 18 images in which 52 clumped shapes were present. The number of found cells was compared with the number of cells counted by an expert and results show agreement on a 93% of the cases.

The first layer is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using frame-wise camera motion for intra-shot analysis and the second layer is the hidden Markov model (HMM) involving the GMM as the mid-level observation for inter-shot analysis. A recursive model estimation method is developed for statistical inference which combines two Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms. Specifically, the proposed generative model is used for American football play analysis where each play shot is classified into one of four classes, i.e., short plays, long plays, kicks and field goals. The experimental results show promising classification performance around 80%.

Therefore, data and channel estimation performance is obtained in the initial stage has a significant relationship with the performance of PIC. So obviously it is necessary to make excellent joint data and channel estimation for initialization of PIC detector. In this work, to initiate PIC module efficiently a joint MAP channel estimation and data detection technique based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) method has been proposed. Moreover, the MAP-EM approach considers the channel variations as random processes and applies the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) orthogonal series expansion. The performance of the proposed approach are studied in terms of bit-error rate (BER). Throughout the simulations, extensive comparisons with previous works in literature are performed, showing that the new scheme can offer superior performance.

The detection and estimation algorithm, implemented at the receiver, is based on a version of the expectation maximization (EM) technique which is very suitable for the multicarrier signal formats. Application of the EM-based algorithm to the problem of iterative data detection and channel estimation leads to a receiver structure that also incorporates a partial interference cancelation. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm has excellent BER end estimation performance.

Like Autocorrel I, the new model correlates intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts to automate alert and incidents management, and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. We achieve this correlation by clustering similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only consider a few clusters rather than hundreds or thousands of alerts. The first stage uses an artificial neural network (ANN)-based autoassociator (AA). The AA's objective is to attempt to reproduce each alert at its output. In the process, it uses an error metric, the reconstruction error (RE), between its input and output to cluster similar alerts. In order to improve the accuracy of the system we add another machine-learning stage which takes into account the RE as well as raw attribute information from the input alerts. This stage uses the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm. The performance of this approach is tested with intrusion alerts generated by a Snort IDS on DARPA's 1999 IDS evaluation data as well as incidents.org alerts.

It has been widely applied in diagnostic medicine and industrial non-destructive testing. Traditional CT reconstructions are limited by many kinds of artifacts, and they give dissatisfactory image. To reduce image noise and artifacts, the theory of maximum likelihood estimation is extended to V-ray scan in this paper, and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is studied and implemented for image reconstruction of X-ray CT (XCT). Then the point spread function and modulation transfer function of the EM algorithm is analyzed. Last experimental results with computer simulated data and real CT data are presented to verify our method is effective.

It is called the best means for NDT by the circle of international NDT. It has been widely applied in diagnostic medicine and industrial non-destructive testing. X-ray CT (XCT) is the most popular CT. Compared with other parts of CT system, reconstruction algorithm is an important part. In this paper, the theory of maximum likelihood estimation is applied to XCT, and ordered subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm is studied and implemented. OS-EM algorithm is a feasible iterative method. It can provide good quality reconstructions after only a few iterations. Experiments results with real X-ray CT data show this method is effective. Reconstructed slice images of OS-EM algorithm are accurate and clear.

In this study, a method for radar thresholding in range-heterogeneous Weibull radar clutter is proposed. The method employs Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in estimation of the parameters and sets the threshold according to these estimates to yield the desired false alarm rate. Due to the mathematical complexity of the shape parameter estimation, an algorithm that uses a predefined shape parameter set is proposed. Performance of the algorithm is analyzed and it is shown to perform successfully even under spiky clutter conditions.

Examples include both linear and non-linear algorithms such as singular value decomposition (SVD), regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and several machine learning algorithms based on Expectation Maximization (EM). The non-linear algorithms aggregate user data only in certain steps, such as conjugate gradient, which are linear in per-user data. We introduce a new and highly efficient VSS (Verifiable Secret-Sharing) protocol in a special but widely-applicable model that allows secret-shared arithmetic operations in such aggregation steps to be done over small fields (e.g. 32 or 64 bits), so that private arithmetic operations have the same cost as normal arithmetic. Verification of user data is required to prevent a malicious user from biasing the computation. We provide a random projection method for verification that uses a linear number of inexpensive small field operations, and only a logarithmic number of large-field (1024 bits or more) cryptographic operations. Our implementation shows that the approach can achieve orders of magnitude reduction in running time over standard techniques (from hours to seconds) for large scale problems (e.g. at the scale where the number of values per user is 10(6)).

This problem consists on the determination of the type, number of units and their capacities, chosen from a set of standard equipment sizes. The objective function is the profit expectation maximization, involving five components: i. revenue; ii. production cost; iii. equipment depreciation cost; iv. storage cost; v. cost due to non fulfillment of the demand target. The multiple dimension integral representation of the expectation is approximated through cubature formulae. With linear process models, an overall MILP problem formulation is obtained. The approach is applied to the design of the furnace section of a ceramic tile industrial plant, where different products are obtained.	[Duarte, Belmiro P.

The used method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, which applies iteratively a deconvolution and a denoising step. It exploits the Fourier transform's economical noise representation for deconvolution, and the wavelet transform's economical representation of piecewise smooth images for denoising. The proposed restoration procedure performs wavelet shrinkage in a Bayesian denoising framework by applying multicomponent probability density models for the wavelet coefficients that fully account for the intercomponent correlations. In the experimental section, we compare our multicomponent procedures to its single-component counterpart. The results show that the methods using a multicomponent model and especially the one using the Gaussian scale mixture model, perform better than the single-component procedure.

The images of interest are electron micrographs of cross sections of a titanium alloy. To improve the accuracy of the resulting segmentation images, the images are pre-filtered before being used as input to the EM/MPM algorithm. The output of the pre-filter at a particular pixel represents an estimate of the entropy at that pixel, based on the grayscale values of neighboring pixels. This filter tends to be biased towards higher entropy values if an edge is present within the window being used. This causes edges in the final segmentation to move out from higher entropy regions and into lower entropy regions. In order to preserve the locations of these edges, a multiscale technique involving the use of an adaptive filter window has been developed.

The proposed method is a combination of the Expectation Maximization (EM) and the ESPRIT methods. The EM algorithm interpolates the nonuniform array to an equivalent uniform array, and then, the application of ESPRIT is possible, in order to estimate the DOA. One of this method novelties lies in its capacity of dealing with any nonuniform array geometry. This technique manifests significant performance and computational advantages over previous algorithms such as MUSIC, specially in the preasymptotic domain, and the comparison with the theoretical Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRB) shows its efficiency.

The algorithms refine our previous ones in that they approximate the empirical distribution with a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG). The use of the DGs results in closer approximation and considerably better convergence to a local likelihood maximum compared to previously involved conventional continuous Gaussian densities.

The problem is formulated as penalized logistic regression, where the labels are only indirectly observed (via the component densities). This formulation allows deriving a generalized EM algorithm with closed-form update equations, which is in contrast with other related approaches which require expensive Gibbs Sampling or suboptimal algorithms. We show how this approach can be naturally used for image segmentation under spatial priors, avoiding the usual hard combinatorial optimization required by classical Markov random fields; this opens the door to the use of sophisticated spatial priors (such as those based on wavelet representations) in a simple and computationally very efficient way.

Computational superiority and multi video objects are the main advantages of compressed domain processing. In the paper, first, we introduce the macro-block structure of the WEG encoded video and the preprocession of video vectors, then we build a GALV of motion vectors and adopt the genetic-based expectation-maximization algorithm (GA-EM) to compute its multivariate parameters. It is able to estimate automatically the number of objects of the motion model using the minimum description length (AML) criterion. At last, we give the steps of objects extraction. It is proved that the algorithm is real-time and effective from the experiment results.

Numerically stable implementations of the structured covariance expectation-maximization	SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						structured covariance estimation; spectrum estimation; signal processing; EM algorithm; SVD	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE-DATA; MATRICES	Numerically stable methods for the computations required in the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum-likelihood structured covariance estimation are presented. It is shown that the basic computational task at each iteration is the calculation of a pseudoinverse of a certain linear system of equations. In the no-noise case this is a hard-decision, or Moore-Penrose, pseudoinverse, whereas in the additive noise case it is a soft-decision pseudoinverse. An approach to computing the soft-decision pseudoinverse, which can handle all combinations of dimension and rank in this system of equations, based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), is proposed. An alternative method based on the LQ factorization, which is applicable in certain circumstances, is also proposed. The intermediate calculations required in the EM algorithm can be used to calculate the log-likelihood and the gradient of the log-likelihood.

In IEC researches aiming at drastically enhanced neutron/proton yields, understanding the intensity distribution of fusion reactions is one of the most intensive interests. In order to make clear the spatial distribution of D-He-3 fusion reaction rate in an IEC device, we analyzed the experimentally observed proton count rates as function of collimation geometry by use of Most Likelihood-Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) method. Requirements of the measurement system were studied for reconstructing the D-He-3 reaction distribution, especially on the feedthrough surface that has been neglected so far, and an upgrade measurement system was developed and introduced in this study. From the experimental results, we found that more than 99 % of the D-He-3 fusion reactions occur on the cathode and feedthrough surfaces.

A robustified Hidden Markov Model for visual tracking with subspace representation - art. no. 65080A	Visual Communications and Image Processing 2007, Pts 1 and 2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing 2007	JAN 30-FEB 01, 2007	San Jose, CA			Hidden Markov Model; probabilistic principal component analysis; target tracking; particle filter; Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm; student-t distribution		This paper describes a new, robustified Hidden Markov Model for target tracking using a subspace representation. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) provides a powerful framework for the probabilistic modelling of observations and states. Visual tracking problems are often cast as an inference problem within the HMM framework. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), a classic subspace representation method, is a popular tool for appearance modelling because it provides a compact representation for high-dimensional data. Previous subspace based tracking algorithms assume the image observations were generated from a Gaussian distribution parameterized by principal components. One drawback of using Gaussian density model is that atypical observations cannot be modelled well. Hence, they are very sensitive to outliers. To address this problem, we propose to augment the HMM by adding a set of latent variables {w(i)}(i=1)(t) to adjust the shape of the observation distribution. By carefully choosing the distribution of {w(i)}(i=1)(t), we obtain a more robust observation distribution with heavier tails than a Gaussian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new framework in cases where the target objects are corrupted by noise or occlusion.

The extracted information has a certain level of accuracy which can be surpassed by using statistical models that are capable of contextual reasoning such as Bayesian models. Our contribution is an EM algorithm that operates on simple Bayesian models to re-annotate WAD. EM estimates the parameters, i.e., the prior and conditional probabilities by iterating Bayesian model on the given Web data. In the expectation step, Bayesian classifier is trained from current annotations and in the maximization step, the roles of all the labels are re-annotated to find the best fitting annotation with the current model then the probabilities are re-adjusted from the new annotations. Our experiments show that EM increases the Web data annotation accuracies up to 8%. We use Baum-Welch methodology in our EM approach.

The method uses uniform-integration of the likelihood; the implementation employs the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for elimination of all nuisances, viewing random effects and variance components as missing data. In a simulation of a grazing trial, the procedure was compared with four widely used estimators of fixed effects in mixed models, and found to be competitive. An analysis of body weight in freshwater crayfish was conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the methodology in a real situation. The method is a useful non-Bayesian alternative to maximum likelihood and estimated generalized least-squares, as it accounts for nuisance variances.

We propose a new maximum likelihood matching score with "soft masking" of outliers which is robust in these conditions. Differences between two images are modelled by unknown contrast and offset deviations from an unknown template and by independent pixel-wise errors. The error distribution is a mixture of a zero-centred Gaussian noise with an unknown variance and uniformly distributed outliers. The matching score combines the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and the soft masks being produced by a simple iterative Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. Experiments with facial images from the MIT Face Database show the robustness of this technique in the presence of large occlusions.

The control strategy is implemented using Internal Model Control based on a multivariable linear state-space model obtained by the Maximum Likelihood method. The linear model describes the variations of the average temperature around a nominal trajectory. This trajectory is obtained as the response to nominal inputs that have been proved to work well in real leaching applications, and is computed using a comprehensive high complexity mathematical model developed by BHP Billiton Innovation. The results show that significant increments in copper extraction can be obtained using limited control actions with the proposed feedback strategy.

Confocal microscopy images are modeled as a mixture of two Gaussians, one representing the background and another corresponding to the foreground. Images are segmented into foreground and background by applying Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to the mixture. Final intensity compensation is carried out by scaling and shifting the original intensities with help of parameters estimated for the foreground. Since foreground is separated to calculate the compensation parameters, the method is effective even when image structure changes from frame to frame. As Intensity Decay Function (IDF) is not used, complexity associated with estimation of IDF parameters is eliminated. Also, images can be compensated out of order as only information from the reference image is required for compensation of any image. These properties make our method an ideal tool for intensity compensation of confocal microscopy images which can suffer intensity loss due to absorption/scatteing of light as well as photobleaching and can change structure from optical/temporal section to section due to change in the depth of specimen or due to a living specimen. The proposed method was tested with number of image stacks and results for one of the stacks are presented here to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Unfortunately, the underlying mixtures are not uniquely identifiable and, moreover, the estimated mixture parameters are starting-point dependent. For this reason we use the latent class model only to define a set of "elementary" classes by estimating a mixture of a large number components. We propose a hierarchical "bottom up" cluster analysis based on unifying the elementary latent classes sequentially. The clustering procedure is controlled by minimum information loss criterion.

In this paper we propose diagnostic tools to check for identifiability problems based on the fact that they induce multiple (global) modes in the distribution of the parameterizations of the maximum likelihood models depending on the data generating process. The parametric bootstrap is used to approximate this distribution. In order to investigate the presence of multiple (global) modes the congruence between the results of information-based methods based on asymptotic theory and those derived using the models fitted to the bootstrap samples with initalization in the solution as well as random initialization is assessed.

The q-EM algorithm is a one-parameter generalization of normal Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm based on Tsallis entropy. By incorporating the Simulated annealing method, we propose the q-Deterministic Annealing Expectation Maximization (q-DAEM) algorithm. Given the inherent connection between a physical annealing process and statistical mechanics, we show that the proposed algorithm actually minimizes a counterpart of the free energy in statistical mechanics by controlling an effective temperature. Simulations of mixed Gaussian parameter estimation show that the proposed method is much less initialization-dependent than the standard EM algorithm and converges dramatically faster than the DAEM algorithm.

Digitized color images of the stained fabrics are obtained, and the pixel values in the color and intensity planes of these images are probabilistically modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Stain detection is posed as a decision theoretic problem, where the null hypothesis corresponds to absence of a stain. The null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis mathematically translate into a first order GMM and a second order GMM respectively. The parameters of the GMM are estimated using a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Minimum Description Length (MDL) is then used as the test statistic to decide the verity of the null hypothesis. The stain is then segmented by a decision rule based on the probability map generated by the EM algorithm. The proposed approach was tested on a dataset of 48 fabric images soiled with stains of ketchup, corn oil, mustard, ragu sauce, revlon makeup and grape juice. The decision theoretic part of the algorithm produced a correct detection rate (true positive) of 93 % and a false alarm rate of 5% on these set of images.

For practical applications the incorporation of prior knowledge and the interpretability of the local models is of great interest. Using a tree structured algorithm in combination with the distinction between the input arguments for the consequents and for the premises the nonlinear optimisation is performed in an efficient way. The axis oblique decomposition of the partition space is based on an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed concept.

Our results in a series of cognitive experiments show dramatic differences in the usability of these two information building blocks, even when they are chosen to contain the same amount of information. Specifically, PECs seem to be used intuitively and quite efficiently, while people are rarely able to gain much information from NECs (unless they are specifically directed for the best way of using them). Tests with a constrained EM clustering algorithm under similar conditions also show superior performance with PECs. We conclude with a theoretical analysis, showing (by analogy to graph cut problems) that the satisfaction of NECs is computationally intractable, whereas the satisfaction of PECs is straightforward. Furthermore, we show that PECs convey more information than NECs by relating their information content to the number of different graph colorings. These inherent differences between PECs and NECs may explain why people readily use PECs, while many of them need specific directions to be able to use NECs effectively.

This leads to learning stratifications, that is, mixture of manifolds representing different characteristics and complexities in the data set. The basic idea relies on modeling the high dimensional sample points as a process of Poisson mixtures, with regularizing restrictions and spatial continuity constraints. Theoretical asymptotic results for the model are presented as well. The presentation of the framework is complemented with artificial and real examples showing the importance of regularized stratification learning in computer vision applications.

The focus of our approach is on one hand to provide an optimization framework which extends (in the sense of a one parameter family) the Maximum Likelihood framework and on the other hand is theoretically guaranteed to provide robustness under clutter, noise and outliers in the measurement matrix under certain conditions. Specifically, the conditions under which our approach excels is when the measurement array (co-occurrences) is sparse - which happens in the application domain of "bag of visual words".

In our approach, signatures are recorded by asking the user to say what she/he is writing, leading to the so-called spoken signatures. We have built a verification system composed of two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) sub-systems that model independently the pen and voice signal. We report on results obtained with two algorithms used for training the GMMs, respectively Expectation Maximization and Maximum A Posteriori Adaptation. Different algorithms are also compared for fusing the scores of each modality. The evaluations are conducted on spoken signatures taken from the MyIDea multimodal database, accordingly to the protocols provided with the database.

A statistical approach to determine symmetrical solutions for the registration of 3D knee implant models to sagittal fluoroscopy images	2007 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision	OCT 14-21, 2007	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE				During the registration of 3D CAD models of metallic knee implant components to single-plane sagittal fluoroscopy images, the 3D pose of each implant component is estimated by maximizing the similarity between its 2D image appearance and the observed fluoroscopy image. Because knee implant components are highly symmetrical with respect to the sagittal plane, two significantly different model poses result in 2D image projections very similar to an observed sagittal fluoroscopy image. Traditional 2D/3D registration algorithms tend to converge to one of these symmetrical poses discarding the other one. This paper presents a method which simultaneously estimates both symmetrical solutions. In order not to limit the proposed method to 3D models with an exact plane of symmetry, a completely data-driven symmetry constraint is used which is imposed to the estimated pose parameters. The algorithm is embedded in a statistical framework which is optimized using a deterministic annealing Expectation-Maximization approach. The validity of the method is demonstrated by registration of the tibial knee implant component to real and simulated fluoroscopy images.

We illustrate our derivations in the case of carrier-phase estimation based on the EM algorithm. As far as our simulation setups are concerned, we show that the (mean) EM-algorithm behavior may be well predicted by means of the proposed CRB-based expression.

Although the Dempster-Shafer (DS) belief theoretic framework captures a wider class of imperfections, its utility in such graphical models is limited. This is mainly due to the requirement of having to maintain a basic probability assignment (BPA) for the whole power set of propositions of interest. In this paper, we introduce a simpler BPA that can still capture many types of imperfections that are commonly encountered in practice. This BPA is then used to develop the DS-BN a graphical dependency model that represents the joint space belief distribution. We show how this DS-BN can efficiently carry out inferences within the DS theoretic framework. Its utility is illustrated by modeling a problem involving missing values and then comparing the inferences made with those obtained via a BN that learns its parameters using the EM algorithm.

New documents or queries need to be folded into the latent topic space by a simplified version of the EM-algorithm. During PLSI-Folding-in of a new document, the topic mixtures of the known documents are ignored. This may lead to a suboptimal model of the extended collection. Our new approach incorporates the topic mixtures of the known documents in a Bayesian way during folding-in. That knowledge is modeled as prior distribution over the topic simplex using a kernel density estimate of Dirichlet kernels. We demonstrate the advantages of the new Bayesian folding-in using real text data.

This involves the integration of a method of tissue classification with one to estimate thickness in 3D. We have determined an additional boundary detection step to facilitate this. The classification stage utlizes the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm to classify voxels associated with the tissue types that interface with cortical grey matter (GM, WM and CSF). This uses a Gaussian mixture and the EM algorithm to estimate the position and and width of the Gaussians that model the intensity distributions of the GM, WM and CSF tissue classes. The boundary detection stage uses the GM, WM and CSF classifications and finds connected components, fills holes and then applies a geodesic distance transform to determine the GM/WM interface. Finally the thickness of the cortical grey matter is estimated by solving Laplace's equation and determining the streamlines that connect the inner and outer boundaries. The contribution of this work is the adaptation of the classification and thickness measurement steps, neither requiring manual initialisation, and also the validation strategy. The resultant algorithm is fully automatic and avoids the computational expense associated with preserving the cortical surface topology. We have devised a validation strategy that indicates the cortical segmentation of a gold standard brain atlas has a similarity index of 0.91, thickness estimation has subvoxel accuracy evaluated using a synthetic image and precision of the combined segmentation and thickness measurement of 1.54mm using three clinical images.

Thus, the approximation of measurement data by a PH distribution is an important task in Markovian performance modeling of practical systems. In this paper we introduce an explicit PH fitting method. This method performs the fitting in the Laplace transform domain in the sense that the Laplace transform of the pdf of the obtained PH distribution and the one of the target distribution are matched at the given points. To evaluate its performance we applied this method on real traffic traces and found that - compared to some other available fitting methods - it provides good results by capturing both the body and the tail behaviour of the approximated distributions.

In the so called SAGE receiver, hard decision code symbols are fed back from the single user decoders to the joint channel estimator and interference canceler. Using multivariate Gaussian approximations, the SAGE receiver is then modified such that soft values of code symbols are fed back from the single user decoders. We refer to this modified receiver as SAGE based receiver. Compared to the SAGE receiver, the SAGE based receiver considers the statistical properties of the code symbols, thus the channel estimation and the interference cancellation take symbol estimation errors into account A performance improvement in terms of bit error rate (BER) and system load of the SAGE based receiver compared to the SAGE receiver and other receivers is shown by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

If we can establish an effective model to predict the cost and quality of software projects based on facts such as the project character and two-side cooperating capability at the beginning of the project, the risks may be mitigated. Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is a good method for analyzing uncertain consequences, but it is difficult to produce precise network structure and conditional probability table. In this paper, we built up network structure by Delphi method for conditional probability table learning, and learn to update probability table and nodes' confidence levels continuously according to the application cases.

J	Huang, SH; Kothamasu, R; Rapur, N				Huang, Samuel H.; Kothamasu, Ranganath; Rapur, Niharika			Iterative imputation algorithms for process modeling with incomplete data	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						missing data; principal components analysis; clustering; process modeling	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MISSING-DATA; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; EM ALGORITHM	Modeling with real-world data is often plagued with the problem of missing values, limiting the applicability and validity of the developed model. Several algorithms exist in the literature to facilitate the analysis of incomplete data by imputing missing values. However, their imputation accuracy and practical applicability have not been systematically compared and studied. This makes the choice of appropriate imputation method difficult. The focus of this paper is to conduct an exploratory analysis of the popular missing data imputation algorithms. A new imputation algorithm based on clustering is also developed and demonstrated to be useful in a variety of ways to improve the efficiency of imputing missing values. These algorithms are benchmarked using datasets with significantly varying statistical properties. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis, a set of guidelines are proposed to assist in the selection of an appropriate imputation algorithm for a specific application. Finally these guidelines are used in a process modeling case study that involves the analysis of the design of an atomizer. It was observed that the imputed values are qualitatively valid thus providing evidence for the appropriateness of the proposed guidelines.

However, many real-life problems require a novel and generalized form of clustering, the evolutionary clustering. Given a dynamic set of data points that may move, disappear and emerge, the evolutionary clustering is to track the move, disappear and emerge of the corresponding clusters. In this paper, we propose converting this novel problem into an iterative form of learning a mixture model, and present a structural-EM algorithm as the solution.

SPECT with classic collimators is generally not adapted to acquire such images, unless a large open-fraction collimator is considered. In this paper we propose a novel configuration for direct 3D-reconstruction from a single 2D-planar non-parallel projection, that is a challenging and ill-posed problem. First, a coded aperture and a 2D-detector are simulated to define a model of the imaging system and to generate synthetic data. In order to address the absence of sufficient data support, 3D-objects that are synthesized stand in the near-field region, at just a few centimetres from the surface of the detector. This configuration maximises the geometrical efficiency and consequently enhances the amount of data contained in the unique observed image. Secondly, an accelerated ML-EM algorithm is used to reconstruct 3D-objects. The basis of our approach reflects the assumption that the inner-structure of the transition matrix used for modelling the system affects significantly the behaviour of ML-EM algorithm and the whole reconstructed spatial distribution. The transition matrix depends directly on the geometry of the collimator. The impact of this geometry on the structure of the transition matrix is studied. This paper shows that a small-size detector is able to perform a 3D-reconstruction of a small object standing in the near-field domain, from a single 2D-image. Reconstructed objects exhibit a good spatial resolution : two 5 mm-diameter cylinders with a centre-to-centre distance of 6 mm are clearly separated. Cylindrical shapes are well-preserved, although depth direction is deformed. Promising simulations demonstrate the extreme potentials of our approach.

But the EM algorithm is highly sensitive to initial values of model parameters and does not guarantee convergence to a global maximum resulting in non-optimized estimation for the HMM and lower recognition accuracy. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based EM learning method (GA-EHMM) for estimation of the HMM parameters. GA explores the search space more thoroughly than that of the EM algorithm and enables the EM to escape from many local maxima. A constraint-based approach of GA has been adopted in "GA-EHMM" which directs GA towards promising regions of the search space. Instead of generating the initial GA population randomly, a variable segmentation technique is used in the HMM initialization process. "GA-EHMM" has been tested on the TIMIT [10] speech corpus. Experimental results show that "GA-EHMM" obtains better values for the likelihood function as well as higher recognition accuracy than that of the HMM model trained by the standard EM algorithm.

We have been investigating imaging systems in which a detector having high spatial resolution operates in conjunction with a conventional imaging system. Based on this concept, the intra-operative PET imaging probe system consists of a segment of a conventional PET scanner and a small PET imaging probe. The coincidence events between the segment of the conventional PET scanner and the small imaging probe are collected. The high spatial resolution is obtained due mainly to the imaging probe's proximity to the lesions and the small size crystals in the PET imaging probe. The PET imaging probe is equipped with a position tracker. By employing the position tracker, surgeons or clinicians can survey suspicious regions in detail by moving the probe during the imaging process. We cautiously expect that the image degradation due to limited-angle tomography will not be severe for small lesions in the near-field when using a simple listmode ordered-subsets EM algorithm for the image reconstruction. We plan to continue characterizing the proposed imaging system in terms of adaptive imaging described by Barrett and limited angle tomography.

In our project, these two modalities are simultaneously recorded by asking the user to utter what she/he is writing. The main benefit of this multimodal approach is a better accuracy at no extra costs in terms of access time or inconvenience. More specifically, we report in this paper on significant improvements of our initial system that was based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) applied independently to the pen and voice signal. We show that the GMMs can be advantageously replaced by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provided that the number of state used for the topology is optimized and provided that the model parameters are trained with a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) adaptation procedure instead of the classically used Expectation Maximization (EM). The evaluations are conducted on spoken signatures taken from the MyIDea multimodal database. Consistently with our previous evaluation of the GMM system, we observe for the HMM system that the use of both speech and handwriting modalities outperforms significantly these modalities used alone. We also report on the evaluations of different score fusion strategies.

In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for MIMO-OFDM systems. We proposed a novel EM (Expectation Maximization)-based channel estimation method. This proposed method employs the poly- nomial channel model along with the EM-based algorithm and makes a tradeoff between the computational complexity and the performance of estimation accuracy. Computer simulations show that, compared with the traditional EM-based channel estimation, the novel method has a great advantage of estimation accuracy.

In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for MIMO-OFDM systems. We proposed an EM-based method to implement channel estimation, in which the polynomial channel model was used. The proposed EM-based method partition the problem of estimating a mufti-input channel into independent channel estimations for each transmit-receive antenna pair, thus, avoid the matrix inversion encountered in polynomial model based estimation. Therefore, compared with polynomial model based method, the proposed method has an advantage of computational complexity without loss of estimation accuracy.

Fuzzy clusterwise growth curve models via generalized estimating equations: An application to the antisocial behavior of children	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS; LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; UNBALANCED DATA; MIXTURE-MODELS; LINEAR-MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; SETS; HETEROGENEITY; SEGMENTATION	The growth curve model has been a useful tool for the analysis of repeated measures data. However, it is designed for an aggregate-sample analysis based on the assumption that the entire sample of respondents are from a single homogenous population. Thus, this method may not be suitable when heterogeneous subgroups exist in the population with qualitatively distinct patterns of trajectories. In this paper, the growth curve model is generalized to a fuzzy clustering framework, which explicitly accounts for such group-level heterogeneity in trajectories of change over time. Moreover, the proposed method estimates parameters based on generalized estimating equations thereby relaxing the assumption of correct specification of the population covariance structure among repeated responses. The performance of the proposed method in recovering parameters and the number of clusters is investigated based on two Monte Carlo analyses involving synthetic data. In addition, the empirical usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by an application concerning the antisocial behavior of a sample of children.

The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed to solve this problem, which begins a search from the primitive initial point. Then the mes-EM algorithm was proposed: a variant of the m-EM algorithm which begins the multiple-token EM search from the primitive initial point. The mes-EM could obtain excellent solutions in compensation for rather high computing cost. This paper proposes a lighter version of the mes-EM algorithm using the subsampling strategy and evaluates its performance.

Our method has the following characteristics: 1) it enables the introduction of physical observation models such as the diffuse sound field, because the likelihood is defined in the original signal domain and not in the feature domain, 2) one does not necessarily have to know in advance the power of the background noise since they are also parameters which can be estimated from the observed signal, 3) it takes short computational time, 4) a common objective function is iteratively increased in localization and separation steps, which correspond to the E-step and M-step, respectively. Although our framework is applicable to general N channel BSS, we will concentrate on the formulation of the problem in the particular case where two sensory inputs are available, and we show some numerical simulation results.

In maximum likelihood framework, the EM algorithm is used to compute the parameters of the conversion function. And the chirp z-transform is utilized to enhance the averaged spectral envelop due to the linear weighting.
