However, unusual examples of form, such as abnormalities are often encountered in biomedical sciences. Despite the long history of morphometrics, the means to identify and quantify such unusual form differences remains limited. Methods: A theoretical concept, called dysmorphometrics, is introduced augmenting current geometric morphometrics with a focus on identifying and modelling form abnormalities. Dysmorphometrics applies the paradigm of detecting form differences as outliers compared to an appropriate norm. To achieve this, the likelihood formulation of landmark superimpositions is extended with outlier processes explicitly introducing a latent variable coding for abnormalities. A tractable solution to this augmented superimposition problem is obtained using Expectation-Maximization. The topography of detected abnormalities is encoded in a dysmorphogram. Results: We demonstrate the use of dysmorphometrics to measure abrupt changes in time, asymmetry and discordancy in a set of human faces presenting with facial abnormalities. Conclusion: The results clearly illustrate the unique power to reveal unusual form differences given only normative data with clear applications in both biomedical practice & research.

Reduced-count myocardial perfusion SPECT with resolution recovery	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						iterative reconstruction; myocardial SPECT; resolution recovery	TIME	Aim The aim of this study was to determine whether resolution recovery (RR) iterative reconstruction algorithms can consistently produce diagnostic quality myocardial perfusion SPECT images for the patient population routinely scanned in this department. Reduced-count data were compared with full-count data without RR according to our established protocol. The desired outcome would be to implement the software to allow a reduction in the administered activity for routine myocardial SPECT. Methods Half-count SPECT data were derived from full-count datasets for 53 stress and rest routine myocardial SPECT scans on a GE Infinia camera. Full-count data were reconstructed using standard non-RR ordered subset expectation maximization reconstruction, whereas half-count data were reconstructed using Evolution RR software. Myocardial functional values, image quality and report outcomes of the full-count and half-count reports were compared. Sequential full-time and half-time myocardial SPECT acquisitions were performed for 15 stress and rest studies on a Siemens c.cam dedicated cardiac camera. Half-count data were reconstructed using Siemens Flash 3D RR. Results No degradation in image quality was found when comparing full-count and half-count studies from the Infinia. Ten percent of the half-count studies from the c.cam were considered slightly worse than full-count data. Statistically significant differences in some full-count versus half-count functional values were found but the actual mean differences were not considered clinically significant. No difference was found for 44 out of 53 full-count versus half-count reports, a minor difference for seven out of 53 and a significant difference in two cases. Conclusion RR was found to produce diagnostic image quality for nearly all scans, but it was felt that a reduction of 50% from our standard protocol was too great. A proposed reduction of 33% administered activity was considered acceptable to produce consistently adequate diagnostic images for both manufacturers.

Obtaining separate measures for implicit and explicit memory	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Implicit memory model; Fractional storage; Multinomial modeling; Dual-process model; Process-dissociation model	PROCESS DISSOCIATION FRAMEWORK; PROCESSING TREE MODELS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; AUTOMATIC MEMORY; EM ALGORITHM; PARAMETERS; RETENTION; AMNESIA; CONVERGENCE; SYSTEMS	In this paper a new model, the Implicit/Explicit Separation (IES) model, is developed and applied. The model is designed to obtain separate probability measures for explicit memory storage, implicit memory storage, fractional storage, and non-storage. The model is needed because memory research has shown the importance of the distinction between a conscious memory of a target event and a memory residue that is unable to support conscious recall or confident recognition, but it is still able to support guessing at rates above chance. Maximum likelihood and population-parameter mapping estimates for the parameters of the IES model are provided. The accuracy of parameter estimates is studied as a function of sample size. Three experiments are reported to demonstrate how the IES model is used to achieve a more fine grained assessment of the quality of information storage. These experiments also provide strong validation support for the IES model itself. Across the three experiments, each of the four components for representing target information (explicit, implicit, fractional, and non-storage) demonstrates a different pattern. The IES model is discussed in terms of alternative models such as the dual-process model and the process-dissociation model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Generally, unsupervised clustering algorithms, such as K-means, are employed to create such clusters from which visual dictionaries are deduced. K-means achieves a hard assignment by associating each image descriptor to the cluster with the nearest mean. By this way, the within-cluster sum of squares of distances is minimized. A limitation of this approach in the context of image classification is that it usually does not use any supervision that limits the discriminative power of the resulting visual words (typically the centroids of the clusters). More recently, some supervised dictionary creation methods based on both supervised information and data fitting were proposed leading to more discriminative visual words. But, none of them consider the uncertainty present at both image descriptor and cluster levels. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm based on a Gaussian mixture model which not only generalizes the K-means algorithm by allowing soft assignments, but also exploits supervised information to improve the discriminative power of the clusters. Technically, our algorithm aims at optimizing, using an EM-based approach, a convex combination of two criteria: the first one is unsupervised and based on the likelihood of the training data; the second is supervised and takes into account the purity of the clusters.

Discriminative Topic Modeling Based on Manifold Learning	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Topic modeling; dimensionality reduction; document clustering and classification; semisupervised learning	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK	Topic modeling has become a popular method used for data analysis in various domains including text documents. Previous topic model approaches, such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have shown impressive success in discovering low-rank hidden structures for modeling text documents. These approaches, however do not take into account the manifold structure of the data, which is generally informative for nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping. More recent topic model approaches, Laplacian PLSI (LapPLSI) and Locally-consistent Topic Model (LTM), have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown resulting benefits. But they fall short of achieving full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs. In this article, we propose a new approach, Discriminative Topic Model (DTM), which separates non-neighboring pairs from each other in addition to bringing neighboring pairs closer together, thereby preserving the global manifold structure as well as improving local consistency. We also present a novel model-fitting algorithm based on the generalized EM algorithm and the concept of Pareto improvement. We empirically demonstrate the success of DTM in terms of unsupervised clustering and semisupervised classification accuracies on text corpora and robustness to parameters compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

J	Iwata, T; Yamada, T; Sakurai, Y; Ueda, N				Iwata, Tomoharu; Yamada, Takeshi; Sakurai, Yasushi; Ueda, Naonori			Sequential Modeling of Topic Dynamics with Multiple Timescales	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Topic model; time-series analysis; online learning; multiscale	TRACKING	We propose an online topic model for sequentially analyzing the time evolution of topics in document collections. Topics naturally evolve with multiple timescales. For example, some words may be used consistently over one hundred years, while other words emerge and disappear over periods of a few days. Thus, in the proposed model, current topic-specific distributions over words are assumed to be generated based on the multiscale word distributions of the previous epoch. Considering both the long- and short-timescale dependency yields a more robust model. We derive efficient online inference procedures based on a stochastic EM algorithm, in which the model is sequentially updated using newly obtained data; this means that past data are not required to make the inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency by examining collections of real documents with timestamps.			iwata.tomoharu@lab.ntt.co.jp					AHMED A., 2008, P SIAM INT C DAT MIN; AHMED A., 2010, P 26 INT C UNC ART I; AlSumait L, 2008, IEEE DATA MINING, P3, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2008.140; Andrieu C, 2003, MACH LEARN, V50, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1020281327116; BANERJEE A., 2007, P SIAM INT C DAT MIN; BLEI D., 2010, P INT C MACH LEARN I; Blei D.

The aim of this study was to verify the suitability of a mixture of two- and three-component Weibull and gamma models for describing irregular and multimodal DBH distributions. Investigations were carried out in natural Abies alba Mill. and Fagus sylvatica L. stands, representing the growing-up stage, in the AewiA (TM) tokrzyski National Park (Central Poland) and in the Pieniny National Park (Southern Poland). Sample plots (0.25-0.5 ha in area) were selected from a database used for forest dynamics analysis. The parameters of the mixture model were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and a combination of an expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm with a Newton-type (NT) method. The multistart method (MM) of choosing initial values was used. The DBH distributions in mixed Abies-Fagus forests of complex structure were accurately approximated by two- and three-component mixture models. The root mean square error (RMSE) values varied from 3.4515 to 7.6682 for the Weibull mixture and from 3.6457 to 7.1419 for the gamma mixture. The results indicated that the mixture Weibull and gamma models were, in general, equally suitable for modelling irregular and multimodal DBH distributions. Finite mixture models may be used to characterise tree structural diversity, especially in uneven-aged stands of complex structure.

J	Jin, X; Huang, B				Jin, X.; Huang, B.			Identification of switched Markov autoregressive eXogenous systems with hidden switching state	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						Hidden Markov model; System identification; Switched process; Expectation-Maximization method		Identification of the Switched Markov Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) systems is considered in this paper. With a Markov chain model governing the evolution of the hidden switching state, a Switched Markov ARX System (SMARX) is formulated and a solution strategy is proposed. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed in the identification of the SMARX systems in which both a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the discrete-valued switching dynamics and local ARX models for continuous dynamics are estimated. Through the comparison between the proposed method and previous switched ARX system identification methods, it is shown that by modeling both the switching and continuous dynamics, the accuracy of the identification results can, to various extent, be improved.

In this research field, this paper proposes new insights for the chaos-coded modulation (CCM) schemes originally proposed by Kozic et al. (2003; IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Regul Pap 53:2048-2059, 2006). A detailed study of the distance spectrum of such schemes is proposed and an approximation of its distribution by means of Gaussian or Rayleigh mixtures is given. Furthermore, using these approximate distributions, a complete study of the performances of these CCM schemes when they are concatenated with a space-time block code is proposed. Accurate bounds are obtained even in the case of time-selective channels.

Methods A Hanning filter (HF) and a Gaussian filter (GF) were selected for filtered back-projection (FBP) and the OSEM algorithm, respectively. After evaluation of the optimal HF size, the GF size was optimized using healthy volunteers (HV). Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and oxygen consumption (k(mono)) values were calculated by combining 4S, 16S, or 28S with 21, 41, 61, or 81 of the OSEM (MBFOSEM and k(monoOSEM), respectively) in eight HV and eight coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. These MBFOSEM and k(monoOSEM) values were compared with those obtained using FBP (MBFFBP and k(monoFBP), respectively). Results Optimal HF and GF (10.0GF) sizes for the FBP and OSEM algorithms, respectively, were 10.0 mm full-width resolution at half-maximum. MBFOSEM was changed by modifying the parameters of the OSEM algorithm. The best correlations were between MBFFBP and MBFOSEM, with 28S6I and 10.0GF for HV patients and 28S8I for CAD patients. However, the MBFOSEM with 28S8I was significantly different from MBFFBP at the global myocardium in HV. The k(monoOSEM) with 28S6I was not significantly different from k(monoFBP) in HV or CAD patients. Conclusion Appropriate parameters are 28S6I with a 10.0GF on the MBFOSEM and k(monoOSEM) measurement using C-11-acetate. Diagnostic performance will improve using noiseless, artifact-reduction images, and accurate quantitative values that are provided by the OSEM algorithm with the appropriate parameters.

The scanner, which consists of six detector modules with 1-layer LGSO crystals, has a hexagonal configuration with a face-to-face distance of 86.4 mm between two opposite PET modules; such properties facilitate the imaging of small animals. A Na-22 point source was employed to estimate horizontal and vertical spatial resolutions. To assess the energy resolution, a uniform F-18 cylindrical phantom was scanned. A software-based spectrum analysis of list-mode data was used to assign a local energy window centered on the photopeak position for every single crystal. For the image reconstruction, an ML-EM algorithm was used. The spatial resolutions at the center of the scanner were 0.99 mm in the horizontal direction and 1.13 mm in the vertical direction. The energy resolution averaged over each PMT ranged from 13.3%-14.3%, which gave an average value of 13.8%. These results show that this simple system is promising for small animal imaging with excellent spatial and energy resolutions.

J	Lin, TH				Lin, Ting Hsiang			Estimating latent class model parameters for filter questions with skip patterns	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						Latent class model; Skip patterns; EM algorithm; Non-response	LIKELIHOOD; SELECTION	Filter questions with skip patterns have been widely used in survey research, and latent class models (LCM) are often used to analyze this type of categorical data. The LCM parameters are usually estimated by means of an EM (expectation maximization) algorithm. When the pattern is present, the non-response of the skip pattern cannot be treated as random missingness. We thus propose a modified algorithm to estimate the latent class parameters when non-response is present, and the approach is attractive for two reasons. First, the latent class model with the algorithm is very flexible in the sense that it can model the association of variables with the skip patterns under study. Secondly, the algorithm can be easily implemented using any computer language. An empirical example is used to demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithm. The algorithm may also be flexibly generalized to more complex surveys, for example, polytomous responses.

J	Lu, SC				Lu, Shaochuan			Markov modulated Poisson process associated with state-dependent marks and its applications to the deep earthquakes	ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						MMPP; Hidden Markov model; EM algorithm; Exponential family; New Zealand deep earthquakes; Marked point process	PHASE-TYPE DISTRIBUTIONS; EM ALGORITHM; POINT-PROCESSES; RESIDUAL ANALYSIS; IDENTIFIABILITY	In this paper, we introduce one type of Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) whose arrival times are associated with state-dependent marks. Statistical inference problems including the derivation of the likelihood, parameter estimation through EM algorithm and statistical inference on the state process and the observed point process are addressed. A goodness-of-fit test is proposed for MMPP with state-dependent marks by utilizing the theories of rescaling marked point process. We also perform some numerical simulations to indicate the effects of different marks on the efficiencies and accuracies of MLE. The effects of the attached marks on the estimation tend to be weakened for increasing data sizes. Then we apply these methods to characterize the occurrence patterns of New Zealand deep earthquakes through a second-order MMPP with state-dependent marks. In this model, the occurrence times and magnitudes of the deep earthquakes are associated with two levels of seismicity which evolves in terms of an unobservable two-state Markov chain.

Segmentation of MRI brain with a bootstrapped version of the HMRF-EM algorithm: Preliminary study on phantoms	IRBM			French	Article							IMAGES	This paper deals with global statistical unsupervised magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation based on a Markovian model combined with the family of mixture identification algorithms EM (Hidden Markov Random Field [HMRF-EM]) and using the Bootstrap sampling, which allows a greater respect to the data independence assumption and a reduction of algorithmic complexity. This leads not only to a flexibility in the control of running time but also an improvement in the classification quality relatively to the performance shown by an earlier version of the bootstrapped HMRF-EM.

J	Revuelta, J				Revuelta, Javier			Logistic response models with item interactions	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION; LATENT TRAIT MODEL; RASCH MODEL; EM ALGORITHM; PARAMETERS; THEOREM; TESTS	Items that are clustered according to shared content may violate the principle of conditional independence commonly used in item response theory. This paper investigates the capabilities of a logistic item response model in relation to locally dependent item responses. The model includes main effect and interaction parameters that are computed as linear functions of the latent trait. The paper explains the interpretation of the parameters, the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, the information matrix and some results concerning parameter identifiability. The problem of over-fitting the data is addressed in a simulation study, and two real data examples are described to illustrate the approach, one from the context of a sample survey and the other from ability testing using testlets.

J	Sanroma, G; Alquezar, R; Serratosa, F				Sanroma, Gerard; Alquezar, Rene; Serratosa, Francesc			A new graph matching method for point-set correspondence using the EM algorithm and Softassign	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						Correspondence problem; Graph matching; Affine registration; Outlier detection; Expectation maximization; Softassign	NONRIGID REGISTRATION; SHOCK GRAPHS; RECOGNITION; RELAXATION; ASSIGNMENT; VISION; SHAPES	Finding correspondences between two point-sets is a common step in many vision applications (e.g., image matching or shape retrieval). We present a graph matching method to solve the point-set correspondence problem, which is posed as one of mixture modelling. Our mixture model encompasses a model of structural coherence and a model of affine-invariant geometrical errors. Instead of absolute positions, the geometrical positions are represented as relative positions of the points with respect to each other. We derive the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for our mixture model. In this way, the graph matching problem is approximated, in a principled way, as a succession of assignment problems which are solved using Softassign. Unlike other approaches, we use a true continuous underlying correspondence variable. We develop effective mechanisms to detect outliers. This is a useful technique for improving results in the presence of clutter. We evaluate the ability of our method to locate proper matches as well as to recognize object categories in a series of registration and recognition experiments. Our method compares favourably to other graph matching methods as well as to point-set registration methods and outlier rejectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Unlike the standard GMM where pixels themselves are considered independent of each other and the spatial relationship between neighboring pixels is not taken into account, the proposed method incorporates this spatial relationship into the standard GMM. Moreover, the proposed model requires fewer parameters compared with the models based on Markov random fields. In order to estimate model parameters from observations, instead of utilizing an expectation- maximization algorithm, we employ gradient method to minimize a higher bound on the data negative log- likelihood. The performance of the proposed model is compared with methods based on both standard GMM and Markov random fields, demonstrating the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of our method.

J	Tian, GL; Tang, ML; Liu, CL				Tian, Guo-Liang; Tang, Man-Lai; Liu, Chunling			Accelerating the quadratic lower-bound algorithm via optimizing the shrinkage parameter	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Cox proportional hazards model; EM-type algorithms; Logistic regression; Newton-Raphson algorithm; Optimal QLB algorithm; QLB algorithm	VECTOR EPSILON-ALGORITHM; MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ECM ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE; REGRESSION	When the Newton-Raphson algorithm or the Fisher scoring algorithm does not work and the EM-type algorithms are not available, the quadratic lower-bound (QLB) algorithm may be a useful optimization tool. However, like all EM-type algorithms, the QLB algorithm may also suffer from slow convergence which can be viewed as the cost for having the ascent property. This paper proposes a novel 'shrinkage parameter' approach to accelerate the QLB algorithm while maintaining its simplicity and stability (i.e., monotonic increase in log-likelihood). The strategy is first to construct a class of quadratic surrogate functions Qr(theta vertical bar theta((t))) that induces a class of QLB algorithms indexed by a 'shrinkage parameter' r (r is an element of R) and then to optimize r over R under some criterion of convergence. For three commonly used criteria (i.e., the smallest eigenvalue, the trace and the determinant), we derive a uniformly optimal shrinkage parameter and find an optimal QLB algorithm. Some theoretical justifications are also presented. Next, we generalize the optimal QLB algorithm to problems with penalizing function and then investigate the associated properties of convergence. The optimal QLB algorithm is applied to fit a logistic regression model and a Cox proportional hazards model. Two real datasets are analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating survival and transition probabilities from aggregate sightings of animals	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th EURING Analytical Meeting	SEP 14-20, 2009	Pescara, ITALY	EURING	Ist Superiore Protezione Ricerca Ambientale (ISPRA)	Aggregate survival data; Batch-marking; Grouped data; Interval censoring; Macrodata	MARK-RELEASE-RECAPTURE; DISPERSAL; MODELS; INFORMATION; POPULATIONS	We compare and contrast two methods for fitting probability models to data which arise when animals are marked in batches, without individual identification, and live in several different sites or states. The methods are suitable for populations in which animals are marked at birth and then resighted over several sites/states, for small animals going through several growth stages (insects, amphibiae, etc.), as well as for the follow-up of animals released after laboratory colour-marking, for example. The methods we consider include a multi-state model for resightings of batch-marked animals, allowing us to estimate survival, transitions, and sighting probabilities. One method is based on the EM algorithm, and the second uses the Kalman filter for computing likelihoods. The methods are illustrated on real data from a cohort of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, and their performance is evaluated using simulation. We recommend identifying the batches, for instance in the case of sites, by using a different colour on each site at the time of marking, and in general the use of the Kalman filter rather than the EM-based approach.

J	Wang, Q; Yao, WX				Wang, Qin; Yao, Weixin			An adaptive estimation of MAVE	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Sufficient dimension reduction; Central mean subspace; MAVE; Adaptive estimation	PRINCIPAL HESSIAN DIRECTIONS; DIMENSION REDUCTION SPACE; SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION; KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION; EFFICIENT ESTIMATION; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; MODELS	Minimum average variance estimation (MAVE, Xia et al. (2002) [29]) is an effective dimension reduction method. It requires no strong probabilistic assumptions on the predictors, and can consistently estimate the central mean subspace. It is applicable to a wide range of models, including time series. However, the least squares criterion used in MAVE will lose its efficiency when the error is not normally distributed. In this article, we propose an adaptive MAVE which can be adaptive to different error distributions. We show that the proposed estimate has the same convergence rate as the original MAVE. An EM algorithm is proposed to implement the new adaptive MAVE. Using both simulation studies and a real data analysis, we demonstrate the superior finite sample performance of the proposed approach over the existing least squares based MAVE when the error distribution is non-normal and the comparable performance when the error is normal.

GAMs were used to fit the spatial-temporal precipitation models to individual ensemble member forecasts. The distributions of the precipitation occurrence and the cumulative precipitation amount were represented simultaneously by a single Tweedie distribution. BMA was then used as a post-processing method to combine the individual models to form a more skillful probabilistic forecasting model. The mixing weights were estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm The residual diagnostics was used to examine if the fitted BMA forecasting model had fully captured the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation. The proposed method was applied to daily observations at the Yishusi River basin for July 2007 using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction ensemble forecasts. By applying scoring rules, the BMA forecasts were verified and showed better performances compared with the empirical probabilistic ensemble forecasts, particularly for extreme precipitation. Finally, possible improvements and application of this method to the downscaling of climate change scenarios were discussed.

A nonrigid motion can be treated as a combination of a rigid rotation and a nonrigid deformation. To seek accurate recovery of deformable structures, we estimate the probability distribution function of the corresponding features through random sampling, incorporating an established probabilistic model. The fitting between the observation and the projection of the estimated 3-D structure will be evaluated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo based expectation maximization algorithm.

Investigation of dynamic SPECT measurements of the arterial input function in human subjects using simulation, phantom and human studies	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							MYOCARDIAL BLOOD-FLOW; EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CORONARY FLOW; SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPARTMENTAL-MODELS; RESERVE; PROJECTIONS; QUANTIFICATION; RECONSTRUCTION; QUANTITATION	Computer simulations, a phantom study and a human study were performed to determine whether a slowly rotating single-photon computed emission tomography (SPECT) system could provide accurate arterial input functions for quantification of myocardial perfusion imaging using kinetic models. The errors induced by data inconsistency associated with imaging with slow camera rotation during tracer injection were evaluated with an approach called SPECT/P (dynamic SPECT from positron emission tomography (PET)) and SPECT/D (dynamic SPECT from database of SPECT phantom projections). SPECT/P simulated SPECT-like dynamic projections using reprojections of reconstructed dynamic Tc-94-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-94-MIBI) PET images acquired in three human subjects (1 min infusion). This approach was used to evaluate the accuracy of estimating myocardial wash-in rate parameters K-1 for rotation speeds providing 180 degrees of projection data every 27 or 54 s. Blood input and myocardium tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were estimated using spatiotemporal splines. These were fit to a one-compartment perfusion model to obtain wash-in rate parameters K-1. For the second method (SPECT/D), an anthropomorphic cardiac torso phantom was used to create real SPECT dynamic projection data of a tracer distribution derived from Tc-94-MIBI PET scans in the blood pool, myocardium, liver and background. This method introduced attenuation, collimation and scatter into the modeling of dynamic SPECT projections. Both approaches were used to evaluate the accuracy of estimating myocardial wash-in parameters for rotation speeds providing 180 degrees of projection data every 27 and 54 s. Dynamic cardiac SPECT was also performed in a human subject at rest using a hybrid SPECT/CT scanner. Dynamic measurements of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin in the myocardium were obtained using an infusion time of 2 min. Blood input, myocardium tissue and liver TACs were estimated using the same spatiotemporal splines. The spatiotemporal maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (4D ML-EM) reconstructions gave more accurate reconstructions than did standard frame-by-frame static 3D ML-EM reconstructions. The SPECT/P results showed that 4D ML-EM reconstruction gave higher and more accurate estimates of K-1 than did 3D ML-EM, yielding anywhere from a 44% underestimation to 24% overestimation for the three patients. The SPECT/D results showed that 4D ML-EM reconstruction gave an overestimation of 28% and 3D ML-EM gave an underestimation of 1% for K-1. For the patient study the 4D ML-EM reconstruction provided continuous images as a function of time of the concentration in both ventricular cavities and myocardium during the 2 min infusion. It is demonstrated that a 2 min infusion with a two-headed SPECT system rotating 180 degrees every 54 s can produce measurements of blood pool and myocardial TACs, though the SPECT simulation studies showed that one must sample at least every 30 s to capture a 1 min infusion input function.

J	Jin, BT				Jin, Bangti			A variational Bayesian method to inverse problems with impulsive noise	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Impulsive noise; Robust Bayesian; Variational method; Inverse problems	HEAT-CONDUCTION PROBLEM; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GRAPHICAL MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; INFERENCE; REGULARIZATION; COEFFICIENT; FRAMEWORK	We propose a novel numerical method for solving inverse problems subject to impulsive noises which possibly contain a large number of outliers. The approach is of Bayesian type, and it exploits a heavy-tailed t distribution for data noise to achieve robustness with respect to outliers. A hierarchical model with all hyper-parameters automatically determined from the given data is described. An algorithm of variational type by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posteriori distribution and a separable approximation is developed. The numerical method is illustrated on several one- and two-dimensional linear and nonlinear inverse problems arising from heat conduction, including estimating boundary temperature, heat flux and heat transfer coefficient. The results show its robustness to outliers and the fast and steady convergence of the algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Discovering transcription factor regulatory targets using gene expression and binding data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							LOCUS-CONTROL REGION; GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS; BREAST-CANCER; HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; CHROMATIN OCCUPANCY; RETINOIC ACID; CHIP-SEQ; CELLS; ENHANCERS; NETWORKS	Results: We present EMBER (Expectation Maximization of Binding and Expression pRofiles), a method that integrates high-throughput binding data (e.g. ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq) with gene expression data (e.g. DNA microarray) via an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for inferring the gene targets of sets of TF binding sites. Genes selected are those that match overrepresented expression patterns, which can be used to provide information about multiple TF regulatory modes. We apply the method to genome-wide human breast cancer data and demonstrate that EMBER confirms a role for the TFs estrogen receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptors alpha and gamma in breast cancer development, whereas the conventional approach of assigning regulatory targets based on proximity does not.

J	Zhu, WJ; Zhang, LQ; Bian, QW				Zhu, Wenjun; Zhang, Liqing; Bian, Qianwei			A hierarchical latent topic model based on sparse coding	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Latent topic model; Sparse coding; Laplace distribution	SCENE	We propose a novel hierarchical latent topic model based on sparse coding in this paper. Unlike the other topic models applied in the computer vision field, the words in our model are not discrete but continuous. They are generated by sparse coding and represented with n-dimensional vectors in R-n. In sparse coding, only a small set of components of each word is active, so we assume the probability distribution over these continuous words is Laplace and the parameters of the Laplace distribution depend on topics, which are the latent variables in this model. The relationship among word, topic, document and corpus in our model is similar to latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Thereby this model is a generalization of the traditional LDA by introducing the concept-continuous words. We use an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters in our model. And the proposed method is applied to some significant computer vision problems such as natural scene categorization and object classification. The experimental results show the method is a valuable direction to generalize topic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The cross-subject classifier is trained and tested with data from a group of subjects. In our work, it was trained and tested on EEG data collected from 8 subjects as they performed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery across three levels of difficulty. The accuracy of this cross-subject classifier is stable across the three levels of workload and comparable to a benchmark subject-specific neural network classifier. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This approach is based on the chaotic Baker map. The binary data is interleaved with the proposed approach prior to the modulation step. In addition to improve the system performance in fading channel, the proposed chaotic interleaving approach adds a degree of encryption to the transmitted data. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on the conventional Fast Fourier Transform OFDM (FFT-OFDM), Discrete Wavelet Transform OFDM (DWT-OFDM), and Discrete Cosine Transform OFDM (DCT-OFDM) with and without chaotic interleaving. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is also proposed to efficiently estimate the channel impulse response (CIR) of such a system operating on a channel with multipath fading. Starting from the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle, we derive an iterative estimation algorithm based on the (EM) algorithm. This algorithm is capable of improving the channel estimate. In the initialization phase of this iterative algorithm, the initial channel estimate is based on the observation of the pilot carriers only. Then the EM algorithm updates the channel estimates until convergence is reached, the resulting bit error rate essentially coincides with the case of the perfectly known channel. By simulations, the efficiency of these algorithms can be investigated with simulation and the results of estimation will come to a comparison.

The CT images, Gaussian Scale Space (GSS) data generation using Gaussian Kernels (GKs), and desired maps of regions (lung and the other chest tissues) are described by a joint Markov-Gibbs Random Field Model (MGRF) of independent image signals and interdependent region labels. We focus on the most accurate model identification of the joint MGRF models. To better specify region borders, each empirical distribution of signals is rigorously approximated by a Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussians (LCDG) with positive and negative components. The classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been adapted for the LCDG model. The initial segmentations from the original and the generated GSS CT images are based on the LCDG-models; then they are iteratively refined using an MGRF model with analytically estimated potentials. Finally, these initial segmentations are fused together using a Bayesian fusion approach to get the final segmentation of the lung region. Experiments on eleven real data sets based on Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric confirms the high accuracy of the proposed approach.

For both problems, it is sufficient to consider the observations' profile-the multiset of activity counts, regardless of their process identities. We consider the profile maximum likelihood (PML) estimator that finds the parameter multiset maximizing the profile's likelihood, and establish some of its competitive performance guarantees. For Poisson processes, if any estimator approximates the parameter multiset to within distance epsilon with error probability delta, then PML approximates the multiset to within distance 2 delta with error probability at most delta . e(4)root(t.S), where S is the sum of the Poisson parameters, and the same result holds for Bernoulli processes. In particular, for the L-1 distance metric, we relate the problems to the long- studied distribution-estimation problem and apply recent results to show that the PML estimator has error probability e(-(t.S)0.9) for Poisson processes whenever the number of processes is k = O(tS log(tS)), and show a similar result for Bernoulli processes. We also show experimental results where the EM algorithm is used to compute the PML.

In sensor fusion, we developed a decentralized particle filtering approach to maintain target location estimates. Sample sets are converted to Gaussian Mixtures using expectation maximization, and communicated between agents using are rquest/response strategy. Upon receiving Gaussian Mixtures from other agents, each UAV fuses them into its own estimates using generalized covariance intersection. In decision making, we decoupled the problem into two abstraction levels. At the higher level, leaders are selected for each subnetwork. Each leader, then, assigns operating regions to other agents within its subnetwork. At the lower level, individual agents plan their own motions to actively track targets within their assigned regions. Our approach is evaluated in a number of simulation runs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our decentralized approach.

Associated with the ith unit is a polychotomous response vector, d(i), and a vector of auxiliary variable x(i). The values x(i)'s are known for the entire population but d(i)'s are known only for the units selected in the sample. The problem is to estimate the finite population proportion vector P. One of the fundamental questions in finite population sampling is how to make use of the complete auxiliary information effectively at the estimation stage. In this article a predictive estimator is proposed which incorporates the auxiliary information at the estimation stage by invoking a superpopulation model. However, the use of such estimators is often criticized since the working superpopulation model may not be correct. To protect the predictive estimator from the possible model failure, a nonparametric regression model is considered in the superpopulation. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived and also a bootstrap-based hybrid re-sampling method for estimating the variance of the proposed estimator is developed. Results of a simulation study are reported on the performances of the predictive estimator and its re-sampling-based variance estimator from the model-based viewpoint. Finally, a data survey related to the opinions of 686 individuals on the cause of addiction is used for an empirical study to investigate the performance of the nonparametric predictive estimator from the design-based viewpoint.

This realistic analysis can be best described by segmenting the image into its constituent parts. Unfortunately, segmentation carried out by human visual system (HVS) is always influenced by certain factors. For example, inter-observer, intra-observer variability and large medical datasets. These factors make routine clinical applicability of HVS, a non practical way of examining MRIs. Therefore, to address this problem a fully automatic method is need of the hour. This paper discusses a highly efficient method i.e. the Expectation Maximization (EM) that precisely separates various parts of brain from a brain MRI. It works on the phenomenon of pixel labeling. The results obtained through this method are quite encouraging and are likely to contribute significantly in analyzing brain MRIs.	[Ahmed, M.

We exploited an information theoretic approach such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for feature selection and ranking different texture features. We further incorporated the feature selection technique with segmentation method such as Expectation Maximization (EM) for segmentation of tumor T and non tumor (NT) tissues. In this work, we extend the two class KLD technique to multiclass for effectively selecting the best features for brain tumor (T), cyst (C) and non tumor (NT). We further obtain segmentation robustness for each tissue types by computing Bay's posterior probabilities and corresponding number of pixels for each tissue segments in MRI patient images. We evaluate improved tumor segmentation robustness using different similarity metric for 5 patients in T1, T2 and FLAIR modalities.

The proposed algorithm, named SIEMS, is based on the iterative use of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and offers a good trade-off between oversegmentation and undersegmentation. Moreover, the choice of its input parameters is not image-dependent on the contrary to existing technics and its performances are not crucially determined by these input parameters. SIEMS consists in creating a coarse segmentation of the image by applying an edge detection method (typically the Canny-Deriche algorithm) and splitting iteratively the undersegmented areas with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The method has been applied on two images and shows satisfactory results. It notably allows to distinguish segments with slight radiometric variations without leading to oversegmentation.

The interval versions of the Kalman filter and the EM algorithm	ADVANCES IN DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS			English	Article							SYSTEMS	In this paper, we study state space models represented by interval parameters and noise. We introduce an interval version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for the identification of the interval parameters of the system. We also introduce a suboptimal interval Kalman filter for the identification and estimation of the state vectors. The work requires the introduction of the concept of interval random variables which we also include in this work together with a study of their interval statistical properties such as expectation, conditional expectation and variance. Although the interval Kalman filter introduced here is suboptimal, it successfully recovers the state vectors to a high precision in the simulation examples we have run.

The parametric and nonparametric estimation methods within the framework of the EM algorithm were employed for cure rate estimation and their results compared. The Turnbull estimator was used in the nonparametric estimation while in parametric method both the exponential and Weibull distributions were considered. We show via simulation that the nonparametric method is a viable alternative to the parametric one when the censoring rate is rapidly increasing.	[Aljawadi, Bader A.

The evolution of this model is linear-bilinear in the state of the system. The classical Kalman filter and smoother are not applicable to this model, and therefore, we derive a new Kalman filter and smoother for our model. The new algorithm depends on a special linearization of the second-order term by making use of the best available information about the state of the system. We also derive the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the parameter identification of the model. A Monte Carlo simulation is included to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. An application in which we fit a bilinear model to wind speed data taken from actual measurements is included. We compare our model with a linear fit to illustrate the superiority of the bilinear model.

In this paper, we propose a feature selection framework that allows more compactness of the statistical model while holding good generalization to unseen data. Both feature selection and clustering are based on well-established statistical models that provide natural choice when the data to model are spherical. Moreover, we develop a probabilistic kernel based on Fisher score and mixture of von Mises model (moVM) to feed Support Vector Machines (SVM). The selection process evaluates the relevance of features through a principled feature saliency approach. The unsupervised learning is approached using Expectation Maximization (EM) for parameter estimation along with Minimum Message Length (MML) to determine the optimal number of mixture components. We argue that the proposed framework is well-justified and can be adjusted to different problems. Experimental results involving the challenging problem of image-based spam filtering show the merits of the proposed approach.

We demonstrate that modeling aggregate counts of visual words is surprisingly expressive enough for such a challenging recognition task. An activity is represented by a sum-product network (SPN). SPN is a mixture of bags-of-words (BoWs) with exponentially many mixture components, where subcomponents are reused by larger ones. SPN consists of terminal nodes representing BoWs, and product and sum nodes organized in a number of layers. The products are aimed at encoding particular configurations of primitive actions, and the sums serve to capture their alternative configurations. The connectivity of SPN and parameters of BoW distributions are learned under weak supervision using the EM algorithm. SPN inference amounts to parsing the SPN graph, which yields the most probable explanation (MPE) of the video in terms of activity detection and localization. SPN inference has linear complexity in the number of nodes, under fairly general conditions, enabling fast and scalable recognition. A new Volleyball dataset is compiled and annotated for evaluation. Our classification accuracy and localization precision and recall are superior to those of the state-of-the-art on the benchmark and our Volleyball datasets.

One approach to mimic large arrays and/or high microphone density is to scan the object of interest by sequentially moving a small prototype array. This typically requires a number of fixed references in order to preserve the phase relationships between consecutive snapshots, or that measurements are made in the near-field in order to allow the successive reconstruction of "patches" of the source in front of the array by deliberately neglecting waves not radiating through the array. In the present work, a solution is introduced to reconstruct the full source field of the radiating object from sequential measurements, but without the need for fixed references and without the edge effects of the patch approach. Under the stationary assumption, the problem is shown to boil down to the factorization of a structured covariance matrix. This is undertaken within a Bayesian probabilistic approach, where the source field is encoded by latent variables which are iteratively reconstructed by using an Expected-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This approach is shown to return virtually similar results as if all data were captured simultaneously instead of sequentially. Into addition, it is ultimately able to simulate statistically equivalent realizations of the source field. A solution is also provided for automatically setting the regularization parameter, an important issue of inverse acoustics.

The SVF assumes the sparseness of sources, and defines a sparse vector (SV) that consists of the locational and spectral features of each source at all the frequencies. Then, by assuming that the locational and spectral SVs are generated by frequency-independent parameters, the method executes the SVF. Our locational feature is the phase difference (PD) between two microphone observations, and we model it with a frequency-independent time-difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter. Moreover, we employ the wrapped-phase GMM in order to take the spatial aliasing problem into account. On the other hand, the spectral feature is the log spectrum, and we provide a prior for a spectral parameter. The SVF is formulated with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, where the locational and spectral parameters are inferred by the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our proposed method can separate signals successfully even for an underdetermined case.

However, the increasing amount of detail in these images also necessitates new algorithms for automatic analysis. This paper describes a new approach to discover compound structures such as different types of residential, commercial, and industrial areas that are comprised of spatial arrangements of primitive objects such as buildings, roads, and trees. The proposed approach uses a robust Gaussian mixture model (GMM) where each Gaussian component models the spectral and shape content of a group of pixels corresponding to a primitive object. The algorithm can also incorporate spatial constraints on the layout of the primitive objects in terms of their relative positions. Given example structures of interest, a new learning algorithm fits a GMM to the image data, and this model can be used to detect other similar structures by grouping pixels that have high likelihoods of belonging to the Gaussian object models while satisfying the spatial layout constraints without any requirement for region segmentation. Experiments using WorldView-2 data show that the proposed method can detect high-level structures that cannot be modeled using traditional techniques.

These measurements carry information not only about the operational states of the drilling rig but also about all higher level operations and activities performed by drilling crew. Automatic detection and classification of such drilling operations and states is considered as a big challenge in drilling industry. Furthermore, the possibility of detecting such events opens the door to detect and analyze hidden lost time of the drilling process. This paper presents a novel algorithm for drilling time series segmentation using Expectation Maximization and Piecewise Linear Approximation algorithms. The suggested algorithm shows that the incorporation of prior-knowledge about the drilling process is a key step to segment drilling time series successfully. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to segment drilling time series based on hook-load sensor measurements. In addition, Piecewise Linear Approximation is hired in our approach to slice standpipe pressure, pump flow rate and rotational speed (RPM) and torque of the top drive motor. Merging the results from both, Expectation Maximization and Piecewise Linear Approximation, gives the suggested algorithm the dynamic ability to detect all drilling events and activities.

We focus particularly on image generation chain components that are critical to quantitation such as physical system modeling, scatter correction, patient motion correction and regularized image reconstruction. Through realistic clinical datasets with inserted lesions, we demonstrate the quantitation improvements due to detector point spread function modeling, model-based single scatter estimation and the associated object-dependent multiple scatter estimation and non-rigid patient motion estimation and motion correction. We also describe a penalized-likelihood (PL) whole-body clinical PET image reconstruction approach using the relative difference penalty that achieves superior quantitation over the clinically-widespread ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm while maintaining visual image properties similar to OSEM and therefore clinical acceptability. We discuss the axial and in-plane smoothing modulation profiles that are necessary to avoid large variations in noise and resolution levels. The overall approach of accurate models for data acquisition, corrections for patient related effects and rigorous noise control greatly improve quantitation and when combined with repeatable imaging protocols, limit quantitation variability only to factors related to patient physiology and scanner performance differences.

A cooperative protocol that can be used with half-duplex terminals is the quantize and forward (QF) protocol, in which the relay quantizes the information received from the source before forwarding it to the destination. Most studies on the QF protocol are carried out under the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the destination, which is not often the case in real-life systems. Therefore, in the present contribution, the effect of incomplete CSI is analyzed for flat Rayleigh fading channels with a frequency offset. To limit the complexity of the estimation, the destination terminal assumes that the relay operates in an amplify and forward (AF) mode. By using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to refine the initial pilot-based estimates, the resulting error performance can be made very close to that of a system with perfect CSI.

Keywords are often the basis of document processing methods such as clustering and retrieval since processing all the words in the document can be slow. Common models for automating the process of keyword extraction are usually done by using several statistics-based methods such as Bayesian, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Expectation-Maximization. These models are limited by word-related features that can be used since adding more features will make the models more complex and difficult to comprehend. In this research, a Neural Network, specifically a backpropagation network, will be used in generalizing the relationship of the title and the content of articles in the archive by following word features other than TF-IDF, such as position of word in the sentence, paragraph, or in the entire document, and formats such as heading, and other attributes defined beforehand. In order to explain how the backpropagation network works, a rule extraction method will be used to extract symbolic data from the resulting backpropagation network. The rules extracted can then be transformed into decision trees performing almost as accurate as the network plus the benefit of being in an easily comprehensible format.

Both methods yield sparse spectral estimates and they do not require the choice of any hyperparameters. We numerically compare the performance of SPICE and LIKES with that of the recently introduced method of multivariate sparse Bayesian learning (MSBL).

We introduce a recently proposed inference framework that combines belief propagation (BP) and the mean field (MF) approximation and includes these algorithms as special cases. We also show that the expectation propagation and expectation maximization (EM) algorithms can be embedded in the BP-MF framework with slight modifications. By applying the considered inference algorithms to our probabilistic model, we derive four different message-passing receiver schemes. Our numerical evaluation in a wireless scenario demonstrates that the receiver based on the BP-MF framework and its variant based on BP-EM yield the best compromise between performance, computational complexity and numerical stability among all candidate algorithms.

Today, the importance of facial surgeries is clear for everyone. Thus, there is a need for the appropriate and accurate facial skin segmentation in order to extract different features. Thus far, many methods have been presented for detecting skin under different illumination conditions. In this paper, an algorithm was proposed which was capable of accurate skin segmentation by modifying varying illumination in color images. The proposed algorithm was robust to determine the accurate border of facial skin in the color images taken from front and side perspectives and its 94.34% accuracy on the tested data indicated its efficiency relative to other algorithms including standard EM algorithm.

A Mixture-Model Approach for Parallel Testing for Unequal Variances	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						empirical Bayes; EM algorithm; shrinkage estimation; false discovery rate; mixture model; simultaneous tests	GENE-EXPRESSION; MISSING HERITABILITY; EMPIRICAL BAYES; DISEASES; PROTEIN; SYSTEM; CELLS	Testing for unequal variances is usually performed in order to check the validity of the assumptions that underlie standard tests for differences between means (the t-test and anova). However, existing methods for testing for unequal variances (Levene's test and Bartlett's test) are notoriously non-robust to normality assumptions, especially for small sample sizes. Moreover, although these methods were designed to deal with one hypothesis at a time, modern applications (such as to microarrays and fMRI experiments) often involve parallel testing over a large number of levels (genes or voxels). Moreover, in these settings a shift in variance may be biologically relevant, perhaps even more so than a change in the mean. This paper proposes a parsimonious model for parallel testing of the equal variance hypothesis. It is designed to work well when the number of tests is large; typically much larger than the sample sizes. The tests are implemented using an empirical Bayes estimation procedure which 'borrows information' across levels. The method is shown to be quite robust to deviations from normality, and to substantially increase the power to detect differences in variance over the more traditional approaches even when the normality assumption is valid.

Estimation for the three-parameter inverse Gaussian distribution under progressive Type-II censoring	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						progressive Type-II censoring; EM-algorithm; maximum-likelihood estimates; asymptotic variances; Newton-Raphson algorithm; confidence intervals; coverage probabilities	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; PARAMETERS; MOMENT	Inverse Gaussian distribution has been used widely as a model in analysing lifetime data. In this regard, estimation of parameters of two-parameter (IG2) and three-parameter inverse Gaussian (IG3) distributions based on complete and censored samples has been discussed in the literature. In this paper, we develop estimation methods based on progressively Type-II censored samples from IG3 distribution. In particular, we use the EM-algorithm, as well as some other numerical methods for determining the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the parameters. The asymptotic variances and covariances of the MLEs from the EM-algorithm are derived by using the missing information principle. We also consider some simplified alternative estimators. The inferential methods developed are then illustrated with some numerical examples. We also discuss the interval estimation of the parameters based on the large-sample theory and examine the true coverage probabilities of these confidence intervals in case of small samples by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

Stochastic Analysis and Classification of 4-Area Cardiac Auscultation Signals using Empirical Mode Decomposition and Acoustic Features	2012 COMPUTING IN CARDIOLOGY (CINC), VOL 39	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Conference on Computing in Cardiology	SEP 09-12, 2012	Krakow, POLAND	European Soc Cardiol, EMB, IEEE, PhysioNet, Silvermedia, Mortara, Drager, GE, Aspel, itAm, Physiol Measurement, Zoll, IBM	AGH Univ Sci & Technol		HEART-VALVE DISEASES; HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	As cardiac murmurs do not generally appear in every area of auscultation, this paper presents an effective approach for cardiac murmur detection based on stochastic analysis of acoustic features derived from Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) of phonocardiographic (PCG) signals made up by the 4-Standard Auscultation Areas (SAA). The 4-SAA PCG database belongs to the National University of Colombia. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and statistical moments of HHT were estimated over EMD components. An ergodic HMM was applied on the feature space, randomly initialized and trained by expectation maximization with a convergence at 10e-6 and a maximum iteration number of 1000. Global classification results for 4-SAA were around 98.7% with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity results, using a 30-fold cross-validation procedure (70/30 split). The representation capability of the EMD technique applied to 4-SAA PCG signals and stochastic analysis of acoustic features offered a high performance to detect cardiac murmurs.	[Becerra, M.

An Homomorphic Filtering And Expectation Maximization Approach For The Point Spread Function Estimation In Ultrasound Imaging	IMAGE PROCESSING: ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS X AND PARALLEL PROCESSING FOR IMAGING APPLICATIONS II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Processing - Algorithms and Systems X and Parallel Processing for Imaging Applications II	JAN 23-25, 2012	Burlingame, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol (IS&T), SPIE		Restoration / deconvolution; Expectation-Maximization (EM); Point Spread Function (PSF) estimation; ultrasound images	BLIND DECONVOLUTION; MEDICAL ULTRASOUND; RESTORATION; IMAGES	In modern ultrasound imaging systems, the spatial resolution is severely limited due to the effects of both the finite aperture and overall bandwidth of ultrasound transducers and the non-negligible width of the transmitted ultrasound beams. This low spatial resolution remains the major limiting factor in the clinical usefulness of medical ultrasound images. In order to recover clinically important image details, which are often masked due to this resolution limitation, an image restoration procedure should be applied. To this end, an estimation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the ultrasound imaging system is required. This paper introduces a novel, original, reliable, and fast Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for recovering the PSF of an ultrasound imaging system. This new PSF estimation method assumes as a constraint that the PSF is of known parametric form. Under this constraint, the parameter values of its associated Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) are then efficiently estimated using a homomorphic filter, a denoising step, and an expectation-maximization (EM) based clustering algorithm. Given this PSF estimate, a deconvolution can then be efficiently used in order to improve the spatial resolution of an ultrasound image and to obtain an estimate (independent of the properties of the imaging system) of the true tissue reflectivity function. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate the efficiency and illustrate all the potential of this new estimation and blind deconvolution approach.

The reliability problem of a series system is similar to the survival problem of right-censored data, while the parallel system is related to left-censored data. We used the Weibull model for the reliability time and a gamma distribution for first level on hierarchy for both, scale and shape, parameters of the model. The estimation is done using Monte Carlo Markov Chain tools and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. To exemplify the efficiency of the model we presented an study with simulated data.	[Bhering, F.

Multivariate Latent Growth Models for Mixed Data with Covariate Effects	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						EM algorithm; Generalized linear latent variable models; Longitudinal data	VARIABLE MODELS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; TRAIT MODELS; INDETERMINACY; MANIFEST; LISREL	The paper presents an extension of a new class of multivariate latent growth models (Bianconcini and Cagnone, 2012) to allow for covariate effects on manifest, latent variables and random effects. The new class of models combines: (i) multivariate latent curves that describe the temporal behavior of the responses, and (ii) a factor model that specifies the relationship between manifest and latent variables. Based on the Generalized Linear and Latent Variable Model framework (Bartholomew and Knott, 1999), the response variables are assumed to follow different distributions of the exponential family, with item-specific linear predictors depending on both latent variables and measurement errors. A full maximum likelihood method is used to estimate all the model parameters simultaneously. Data coming from the Data WareHouse of the University of Bologna are used to illustrate the methodology.

In the proposed model, we exploit the enhanced modeling capability of RVMs due to their embedded sparsity enforcing properties. Moreover, robustness is achieved with respect to the kernel parameters, by employing a weighted multi-kernel scheme. The mixture model is trained using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied offering closed form update equations for the model parameters. An incremental learning methodology is also presented to tackle the parameter initialization problem of the EM algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed mixture model is empirically demonstrated on the time series clustering problem using various artificial and real benchmark datasets and by performing comparisons with other regression mixture models.

The undesired absorption of colorants in regions of spectral sensitivity of the noncomplementary capture channels, however, gives rise to cross-channel color interference that significantly deteriorates the performance of the color barcode system. In this paper, we propose an Expectation Maximization (EM) style algorithm to estimate and cancel this color interference and improve the overall performance of the barcode system. Our method utilizes a physical model for print-capture process where the model parameters vary depending on printer, capture device, and illumination. We estimate the model parameters using an iterative EM-style approach and obtain an estimate of CMY colorant channels from the scanned RGB barcode by using the estimated model parameters. Our experimental results show that the proposed method mitigates the effect of color interference and significantly reduces the bit error rates for the recovered data.

Multi-optima exploration with adaptive Gaussian mixture model	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING AND EPIGENETIC ROBOTICS (ICDL)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL)	NOV 07-09, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE			ALGORITHMS; ROBOTICS	In learning by exploration problems such as reinforcement learning (RL), direct policy search, stochastic optimization or evolutionary computation, the goal of an agent is to maximize some form of reward function (or minimize a cost function). Often, these algorithms are designed to find a single policy solution. We address the problem of representing the space of control policy solutions by considering exploration as a density estimation problem. Such representation provides additional information such as shape and curvature of local peaks that can be exploited to analyze the discovered solutions and guide the exploration. We show that the search process can easily be generalized to multi-peaked distributions by employing a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with an adaptive number of components. The GMM has a dual role: representing the space of possible control policies, and guiding the exploration of new policies. A variation of expectation-maximization (EM) applied to reward-weighted policy parameters is presented to model the space of possible solutions, as if this space was a probability distribution. The approach is tested in a dart game experiment formulated as a black-box optimization problem, where the agent's throwing capability increases while it chases for the best strategy to play the game. This experiment is used to study how the proposed approach can exploit new promising solution alternatives in the search process, when the optimality criterion slowly drifts over time. The results show that the proposed multi-optima search approach can anticipate such changes by exploiting promising candidates to smoothly adapt to the change of global optimum.

SEMIPARAMETRIC MIXTURE OF BINOMIAL REGRESSION WITH A DEGENERATE COMPONENT	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						Climate change; EM algorithm; weather data	NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION; CLIMATE MODELS; SELECTION	Many datasets contain a large number of zeros, and cannot be modeled directly using a single distribution. Motivated by rain data from a global climate model, we study a semiparametric mixture of binomial regressions, in which both the component proportions and the success probabilities depend on the predictors nonparametrically. An EM algorithm is proposed to estimate this semiparametric mixture model by maximizing the local likelihood function. We also consider a special case in which the component proportions are constant while the component success probabilities still depend on the predictors nonparametrically. This model is estimated by a one-step backfitting procedure, and the estimates are shown to achieve the optimal convergence rates. The asymptotic properties of the estimates for both models are established. The proposed procedures are applied to rain data from a global climate model and historical rain data from Edmonton, Canada. Simulation studies show that satisfactory estimates are obtained for the proposed models for finite samples.

We consider the case where carrier frequency offset is present. The problem of estimation is then approached by maximizing a regularized (modified) likelihood function. This regularized likelihood function includes a new term accounting for the a priori probability density function for the parameters, represented by a Gaussian mean-variance mixture. The maximization of the regularized likelihood function is carried out by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show that the E-step in the proposed algorithm has a closed-form solution, and in the M-step, the cost function is concentrated in one variable (carrier frequency offset).

This new model is applied to examine the effects of college athletic participation of females on incomes. No evidence for an "athlete" effect in the case of females has been found in the previous work by Long and Caudill [12], Henderson et al. [10], and Caudill and Long [5]. Our study is the first to find evidence of a lower wage for female athletes. This effect is present in a regime characterizing 42% of the sample. Further analysis indicates that female athletes in many otherwise low-paying jobs actually get paid less than non-athletes.

In this paper, we particularly focus on the modeling and the classification of functional data which are temporal curves presenting regime changes over time. More specifically, we propose a new mixture model-based discriminant analysis approach for functional data using a specific hidden process regression model. Our approach is particularly adapted to both handle the problem of complex-shaped classes of curves, where each class is composed of several sub-classes, and to deal with the regime changes within each homogeneous sub-class. The model explicitly integrates the heterogeneity of each class of curves via a mixture model formulation, and the regime changes within each sub-class through a hidden logistic process. The approach allows therefore for fitting flexible curve-models to each class of complex-shaped curves presenting regime changes through an unsupervised learning scheme, to automatically summarize it into a finite number of homogeneous clusters, each of them is decomposed into several regimes. The model parameters are learned by maximizing the observed-data log-likelihood for each class by using a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons on simulated data and real data with alternative approaches, including functional linear discriminant analysis and functional mixture discriminant analysis with polynomial regression mixtures and spline regression mixtures, show that the proposed approach provides better results regarding the discrimination results and significantly improves the curves approximation.

Most existing research has focused only on a single aspect i.e. recognition of actions. However, humans tend to perform different actions in their own styles. In this paper, we deal with the problem of simultaneously identifying actions and the underlying styles (actors) in videos. We propose a hierarchical approach based on conventional action recognition and asymmetric bilinear modeling. Our approach is solely based on dynamics of the underlying activity. Results on the multi-actor multi-action data set IX-MAS show a high recognition rate.

The incremental learning algorithm of GMM is the basis of a variety of complex incremental learning algorithms. It is typically applied to real-time or massive data problems where the standard Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm does not work. But the output of the incremental learning algorithm may exhibit degraded cluster quality than the standard EM algorithm. In order to achieve a high-quality and fast incremental GMM learning algorithm, we develop an algorithmic method for incremental learning of GMM in a GPU-CPU hybrid system. Our method uses model evolution history to approximate the model order and adopts both hypothesis-test and Euclidean distance to do mixture component equality test. Through experiments we show that our method achieves high performance in terms of both cluster quality and speed.

In order to compute parameters more accurately while maintain constant computing time per frame, we apply online EM algorithm to update the parameters of Gaussian mixture models. To avoid computing the inverse of covariance matrix, we use isotropic matrix and the corresponding incremental EM equations are derived. Experiments demonstrate that online EM algorithm can give more accurate segment result than previous update equations. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As the foundation of image identification, the effective image segmentation plays a significant role during the course of subsequent image processing. Many theories and methods have been presented and discussed about image segmentation, such as K-means and fuzzy C-means methods, method based on regions information, method based on image edge detection, etc. In this work, it is proposed to apply Bayesian decision-making theory based on minimum error probability to gray image segmentation. The approach to image segmentation can guarantee the segmentation error probability minimum, which is generally what we desire. On the assumption that the gray values accord with the probability distribution of Gaussian finite mixture model in image feature space, EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of mixture model. In order to improve the convergence speed of EM algorithm, a novel method called weighted equal interval sampling is presented to obtain the contracted sample set. Consequently, the computation burden of EM algorithm is greatly reduced. The final experiments demonstrate the feasibility and high effectiveness of the method.

It is essential to control resource consumption in network monitoring by traffic sampling, so most high-end routers provide sampling network traffic function. The number of original flow is an important metrics to many network applications such as congestion control and network security. In this paper, we present a EUF algorithm that can accurately infer the number of original flow from the sampled packet traffic. Using the EUF algorithm, the number of unsampled flows can be estimated by an iteration method based on random sampling, and then the number of original flows can be precisely estimated according to both the number of the sampled flows and the unsampled flow. The EUF algorithm is also compared with the EM algorithm using multiple traffic traces collected from a Tier-1 ISP backbone networks. The result shows that the EUF algorithm is superior to EM and can provide highly accurate estimation on the number of the original flow.

J	Cherchi, E; Guevara, CA				Cherchi, Elisabetta; Angelo Guevara, Cristian			Maximum Simulated Likelihood and Expectation-Maximization Methods to Estimate Random Coefficients Logit with Panel Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DISCRETE-CHOICE MODELS; MIXED LOGIT; DEMAND MODELS; IDENTIFICATION	The random coefficients logit model allows a more realistic representation of agents' behavior. However, the estimation of that model may involve simulation, which may become impractical with many random coefficients because of the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, the traditional maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) method is compared with the alternative expectation-maximization (EM) method, which does not require simulation. Previous literature had shown that for cross-sectional data, MSL outperforms the EM method in the ability to recover the true parameters and estimation time and that EM has more difficulty in recovering the true scale of the coefficients. In this paper, the analysis is extended from cross-sectional data to the less volatile case of panel data to explore the effect on the relative performance of the methods with several realizations of the random coefficients. In a series of Monte Carlo experiments, evidence suggested four main conclusions: (a) efficiency increased when the true variance-covariance matrix became diagonal, (b) EM was more robust to the curse of dimensionality in regard to efficiency and estimation time, (c) EM did not recover the true scale with cross-sectional or with panel data, and (d) EM systematically attained more efficient estimators than the MSL method. The results imply that if the purpose of the estimation is only to determine the ratios of the model parameters (e.g., the value of time), the EM method should be preferred. For all other cases, MSL should be used.

Since the estimated CSI is not perfect, the achievable rate must be degraded from that with perfect CSI. Using the rate-distortion theory, we study an upper bound on the achievable rate and investigate how the achievable rate can be maximized through an optimization problem by allocating the resources such as degrees of freedom (the transmission time in our work or transmission power) for the exploration of CSI (i.e., the channel estimation) using pilot symbols, and the exploitation of channels to transmit data symbols. Although our study is based on some ideal assumptions, the results could help develop flexible communication systems such as software defined radio (SDR) to achieve a best performance by optimizing radio resources for unknown channels.

Our method involves training a connectionist network that simultaneously learns a distributed latent representation of the words, while maximizing the tagging accuracy. To compensate for the unavailability of true labels, we resort to training the model using a Curriculum: instead of random order, the model is trained using an ordered sequence of training samples, proceeding from "easier" to "harder" samples. On a standard test corpus, we show that without using any grammatical information, our model is able to outperform the standard EM algorithm in tagging accuracy, and its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art models.

CVs play an important role in Natural Language Processing applications like Speech to Speech Translation, Machine Translation and lexical resource creation. But due to their distinct construction, detection and extraction of CVs is a challenging task. This paper presents a hybrid approach for mining CVs from parallel corpus combining rule-based and statistical approach. Though the proposed approach has been applied on Bangla-English parallel corpus to extract Bangla CVs, the methodology is equally applicable to other Indian languages of Indo-Aryan family, in presence of parts of speech tagger and sufficient amount of parallel corpus. Evaluation on Bangla-English parallel corpus of 50,000 sentences, the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 76% that can be improved by increasing the number of sentence pairs in the parallel corpus.

The search is done using the gradient ascent method. Filter bank and model parameters are optimized iteratively. Experiments are conducted on a large noisy corpus containing Antbird calls from 5 species. It is shown that features extracted using the optimized filter bank result in a lower classification error rate than those extracted using a Mel-scaled filter bank.

We perform multiple-level decomposition using Discrete Wavelet Transform to extract acoustic features at different scales and time from audio recordings. The extracted features are then translated into a compact vector representation. Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization algorithm are then used to build models for sound classes. Specifically, three types of audio classification tasks are designed to evaluate the system, including speech/music classification, male/female speech classification, and music genre (classical, pop, jazz, and electronic) classification. By evaluating the system through 5-fold cross validation, the experimental result shows the promising capability of wavelets for speech and music analyses.

J	Chydzinski, A				Chydzinski, Andrzej			A Unified Method of Analysis for Queues with Markovian Arrivals	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODULATED POISSON PROCESSES; EM-ALGORITHM; MODEL; MAP	We deal with finite-buffer queueing systems fed by a Markovian point process. This class includes the queues of type M/G/1/N, M-X/G/1/N, PH/G/1/N, MMPP/G/1/N, MAP/G/1/N, and BMAP/G/1/N and is commonly used in the performance evaluation of network traffic buffering processes. Typically, such queueing systems are studied in the stationary regime using matrix-analytic methods connected with M/G/1-type Markov processes. Herein, another method for finding transient and stationary characteristics of these queues is presented. The approach is based on finding a closed-form formula for the Laplace transform of the time-dependent performance measure of interest. The method can be used for finding all basic characteristics like queue size distribution, workload distribution, loss ratio, time to buffer overflow, and so forth. To demonstrate this, several examples for different combinations of arrival processes and characteristics are presented. In addition, the most complex results are illustrated via numerical calculations based on an IP traffic parameterization.

These techniques are very important as they can significantly support a Maintainer in his/her tasks by grouping related entities of a large system into smaller and easier to comprehend subsystems. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of combining information retrieval and machine learning techniques in order to exploit the lexical information provided by programmers for software clustering. In particular, differently from any related work, we employ indexing techniques to explore the contribution of the combined use of six different dictionaries, corresponding to the six parts of the source code where programmers introduce lexical information, namely: class, attribute, method and parameter names, comments, and source code statements. Moreover their relevance is estimated on the basis of the project characteristics, by applying a machine learning approach based on a probabilistic model and on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. To group source files accordingly, two clustering algorithms have been compared, i.e. the K-Medoids and the Group Average Agglomerative Clustering, and the investigation has been conducted on a dataset of 9 open source Java software systems.

However, the ability of ultrasound to distinct normal from cancer tissues is weak. In most treatments, the organ as a whole is thus irradiated, leading to numerous side effects such as urinary or sexual dysfunction. The quality of magnetic resonance images (MRI), on the other hand, has improved over the last few years and allows for an accurate delineation of the tumor [1]. This paper proposes a novel framework for MRI-US surface registration of the prostate and the rectum. The preoperative MRI is first segmented using a multiresolution graph-cut method. The intraoperative US image is manually segmented by the surgeon. The registration is then performed in two steps. In a first step, a bi-affine registration is performed on the surfaces of the rectum and the prostate using an expectation maximization iterative closest point method (EM-ICP). In the second step, non-rigid registration is applied to the distance maps resulting from the pre-registered surfaces. Our approach has been applied on 5 MR/US pairs and shows a relative independence between prostate and rectum motions.

A Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) is proposed as an approximation of the measured signal strengths from various sensors in space, parameterized by the positions and the transmission (Tx) powers of the sources. The iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm is invoked for the estimation of the relevant GMM parameter set. The complexity of the proposed algorithm grows only linearly with the number of sources, a major advantage in comparison with the direct Maximum Likelihood approach. When the number of sources is unknown, both the Akaike Information Criterion and the Minimum-Description-Length method are employed to estimate the proper number of sources.

A method composed of simulation step as well as stochastic approximation step is used to obtain the conditional expectation, whereas the M-step is executed via the method of conditional maximization. The most attractive point of this approach is that it is novel and non-trivial, which can be used to obtain the ML estimates and the estimation of standard errors simultaneously. Moreover, A model selection criterion is developed. Empirical results are used to illustrate the usefulness of the methodologies proposed above.

The derived learning algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model which parameterizes object shapes, object features and the background. No assumptions are made for the object orders in depth or the objects' planar positions. Parameter optimization is thus subject to the large combinatorics of depth orders and positions. Previous approaches constrained this combinatorics but were still only able to learn a very small number of objects. By applying a novel variational EM approach, we show that even without constraints on the object combinatorics, a relatively large number of objects can be learned. In different numerical experiments, our unsupervised approach extracts explicit object representations with object masks and object features closely aligned with the true objects in the scenes. We investigate the robustness of the approach and the use of the learned representations for inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate generality of the approach by applying it to grayscale images, color-vector images, and Gabor-vector images as well as to motion trajectory data for which the extracted components correspond to motion primitives.

The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized expectation maximization approach to fit an infinite mixture of linear experts to an online stream of data samples, together with an outlier probabilistic model that dynamically grows the number of linear experts allocated to the mixture, this way controlling the complexity of the resulting model. The result is an incremental, online and localized learning algorithm that performs nonlinear, multivariate regression on multivariate outputs by approximating the target function by a linear relation within each expert input domain, which can directly provide forward and inverse multi-valued estimates. The experiments presented in this paper show that it can achieve, for single-valued functions, a performance directly comparable to state-of-the-art online function approximation algorithms, while additionally providing inverse predictions and the capability to learn multi-valued functions in a natural manner. To our knowledge this is a distinctive property of the algorithm presented in this paper.

When the whole tree of the process is observed, there is a natural maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the offspring distribution. If the process is not observable in the sense of the whole tree, but only as the generation at a given moment in time, it requires an EM-type algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator. A method to achieve this in the class of branching processes with terminal types is presented.

Different prior densities and particularly, a non informative hyper prior have been employed on the parameters involved in the correlation matrix. And the estimation of related parameters is obtained by the expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared with the recent work of Li and Sudjianto (2005), the proposed approach is not only of higher prediction accuracy but also of lower computational cost, due to the utilization of the non informative prior and the absence of tuning parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance.

Different prior densities and particularly, a Jeffreys' noninformative density based hierarchical prior is imposed respectively on the regression coefficients in the mean model and the correlation parameters in the covariance matrix of Gaussian Kriging. And the involved parameters are estimated by the expectation maximization and Fisher's scoring algorithms.

Mixture class separation was defined in the measurement model (through factor loadings) and the structural model (through factor variances). Maximum likelihood (ML) via the EM algorithm was compared to a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator condition using weak priors and a condition using tight priors. Results indicated that the MCMC weak condition produced the highest bias, particularly with a weak Dirichlet prior for the mixture class proportions. Specifically, the weak Dirichlet prior affected parameter estimates under all mixture class separation conditions, even with moderate and large sample sizes. With little knowledge about parameters, ML/EM should be used over MCMC weak. However, MCMC tight produced the lowest bias under all mixture class separation conditions and should be used if tight and accurate priors can be placed on parameters.

Integrative labeling, however, results in heavy mixture of training samples. Thus traditional generative density estimation methods can't be used directly in that they perform poorly with heavily polluted training samples. In this paper, by utilizing the prior knowledge of high separability between positive and negative class color distributions, a discriminative learning based GMM(DiscGMM) is proposed for integrative labeling. Besides generating the polluted positive-class samples with comparatively high probability, optimal parameters found by DiscGMM also enjoy a comparatively low probability of generating negative-class samples. The parameter learning problem is solved by a modified Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm. In an integrative labeling experiment of skin detection, DiscGMM is testified to enjoy much better performance than generative density estimation methods and shows qualified results.

Bayesian Image Segmentation of Transmission Electron Tomography 3D Reconstructions	2012 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP (SSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)	AUG 05-08, 2012	Ann Arbor, MI	IEEE		tomography; SIRT; segmentation; materials science; transmission electron microscopy		The use of transmission electron tomography for three dimensional morphology analysis of nanostructured materials has grown significantly in recent years due to the improved robustness of automated image collection, alignment and reconstruction routines. Although the amount of published 3D electron tomography data has increased accordingly, in many cases the data is used purely for visualization purposes, due to the difficulty of making quantitative measurements from the as-reconstructed data. This is due to the traditionally difficult step of segmentation of the 3D image volume, which has been hindered due to noise, artifacts and lack of necessary image detail or sharpness. In this work the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) is used to reconstruct High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) tomography data. The number of SIRT iterations is varied to optimize the reconstruction for segmentation. In particular, signal to noise ratio, signal to artifact ratio, and image blur are identified as parameters which each contribute to the suitability of the reconstruction for segmentation. The Expectation Maximization/Maximization of Posterior Marginals image segmentation algorithm is applied to the SIRT reconstructions, and the resulting Average Intensity Projection (AIP) of the segmented image stack is compared to the raw tomography projection data.

Because of the monitoring discontinuity, we cannot observe any state's duration. The observation consists of the equipment's state at an inspection or right after a repair. Based on a proper construction of stochastic processes involved in the model, calculation of some probabilities and expectations becomes tractable. Using these probabilities and expectations, we can apply an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters in the model. We carry out simulation studies to test the accuracy and the efficiency of the algorithm.

Simulated data was used to perform and assess the 3D reconstruction. The images were acquired in a Monte Carlo platform and using an analytical phantom. The reconstruction step was performed, implementing Filtered Back Projection (FBP), Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM) and Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Comparable results were obtained by the three algorithms. The FBP algorithm presented more blurring images than the ML-EM and ART algorithms. However, it was the one more capable to localize the structures on the 3D space, including the smallest details. The results of the 3D reconstruction allow the discrimination even of very small structures which could not be differentiated on the simple projections that result from the simulations. This indicates that the accuracy of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis can be better than the Mammography.

Embedding the mAIC into the EM algorithm allows us to exclude sequentially, one-by-one, the least informative components from their initially excessive, or over-fitting set. Experiments on modeling empirical marginal signal distributions with mixtures of continuous or discrete Gaussians in order to describe the visual appearance of synthetic phantoms and real medical 3D images (lung CT and brain MRI) demonstrate a marked and monotone increase of the mAIC towards its maximum at the proper number that is known for the synthetic phantom or practically justified for the real image. These results confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed automated mAIC-EM based learning.

While the increasing amount of operating Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) offers diverse possibilities to receive GNSS signals worldwide and to determine position accurately, inter- and intrasystem interference has been identified as a problem of growing importance. The performance of receivers which track all in-view satellites individually degrades if mutual interference is not taken into account. Therefore, we consider the problem of joint signal parameter estimation. For scenarios where the signals of different satellites superimpose at the receiver a joint maximum likelihood estimator for all relevant signal parameters is derived. In order to keep the computation of the related likelihood function, and the determination of its maximum, feasible for a low-complexity receiver, an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied. Simulations for different scenarios show that this approach is efficient in the estimation theoretic sense, and robust against interference that is caused by signals with known structure.

The Crossmodal Matching Identity for Inferring Unfamiliar Faces from Voices	8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS (SITIS 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Based Systems (SITIS)	NOV 25-29, 2012	Sorrento, ITALY	IEEE Comp Soc, INCAR	Univ Bourgogne	Gaussian Mixture Models; EM Algorithm; Pseudo 2-D Hidden Markov Model; Audio-Visual Integration Cross-modal Matching Identity System		This paper proposes a method for matching unfamiliar person's face to unfamiliar voice. The idea behind this is crossmodal perception of human including many illusions such as the McGurk effect, ventriloquist illusion, and so on. Especially, we focus on recent psychological evidence suggesting human can do matching between unfamiliar faces and unfamiliar voices to some extent. The aim of this paper is to mimic this ability on a computer. In order to realize the matching of an unfamiliar person's face to an unfamiliar voice, a dataset of pairs of facial images and corresponding voices are used as knowledge. It means that the unfamiliar voice is matched to the closest known speaker model. Since the database contains corresponding facial image, the system can estimate a closest known face from the unfamiliar voice. Finally each unfamiliar face is matched to the estimated known face and the final recognition result is obtained. To this end, we first implement a speaker recognition system based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as the speech feature and Gaussian mixtures models as the classifier. We also use a two-dimensional HMM-based face recognizer and propose a statistical integration of audio/visual recognition results. To show the possibility of the proposed system, unfamiliar speaker recognition experiments are carried out using 60 sentences from the ATR-503 sentences uttered by 20 university students.

These models are increasingly employed to assess the potential of newly developed therapies for functional restoration of the damaged heart. Such studies are based on myocardial infarction induction followed by different therapeutic interventions and subsequent analysis of the infarct size. This analysis is used to evaluate the extent to which such interventions meet recovery of the lost myocardial tissue. Infarct size is defined as the percentage of the left ventricle affected by coronary artery occlusion. The infarct size is traditionally estimated manually delineating the infarcted and normal tissue areas in the left ventricle of the excised heart. However, this is a time-consuming, arduous and prone to bias process. Herein, we developed an anatomic model, adapted through expectation maximization, which allows for fully automatic analysis of the data. Experimental validation is performed comparing the proposed approach with manual annotation. The results obtained through anatomical model adaptation were coherent with those manually obtained and the differences where never higher than 10%.

Nevertheless, they still often suffer from the problem of converging to poor solutions if the main mode stretches and thus over-dominates weaker distributions. Based on the results of the Split and Merge EM algorithm, in this paper we propose a solution to this problem. Therefore, we define an appropriate splitting operation and the corresponding criterion for the selection of candidate modes, for the case of background subtraction. The proposed method achieves better background models than state-of-the-art approaches and is low demanding in terms of processing time and memory requirements, therefore making it especially appealing in the surveillance domain.

Distributed parameter estimation in wireless sensor networks using fused local observations	WIRELESS SENSING, LOCALIZATION, AND PROCESSING VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Wireless Sensing, Localization and Processing VII	APR 25, 2012	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Distributed parameter estimation; maximum likelihood (ML); expectation maximization (EM); analog/digital local processing; local quantization; integrated mean-squared error; flat-fading channel; fusion center; wireless sensor networks	LOCATION ESTIMATION	The goal of this paper is to reliably estimate a vector of unknown deterministic parameters associated with an underlying function at a fusion center of a wireless sensor network based on its noisy samples made at distributed local sensors. A set of noisy samples of a deterministic function characterized by a finite set of unknown parameters to be estimated is observed by distributed sensors. The parameters to be estimated can be some attributes associated with the underlying function, such as its height, its center, its variances in different directions, or even the weights of its specific components over a predefined basis set. Each local sensor processes its observation and sends its processed sample to a fusion center through parallel impaired communication channels. Two local processing schemes, namely analog and digital, are considered. In the analog local processing scheme, each sensor transmits an amplified version of its local analog noisy observation to the fusion center, acting like a relay in a wireless network. In the digital local processing scheme, each sensor quantizes its noisy observation before transmitting it to the fusion center. A flat-fading channel model is considered between the local sensors and fusion center. The fusion center combines all of the received locally-processed observations and estimates the vector of unknown parameters of the underlying function. Two different well-known estimation techniques, namely maximum-likelihood (ML), for both analog and digital local processing schemes, and expectation maximization (EM), for digital local processing scheme, are considered at the fusion center. The performance of the proposed distributed parameter estimation system is investigated through simulation of practical scenarios for a sample underlying function.

The comparison of the two procedures was done through a simulation study of the performance of these approaches on simulated data sets and real data sets. Simulation results show that the choice of the approach depends essentially on the overlap of the regression lines. In the real data case, we show that the Stochastic EM algorithm resulted in model estimates that best fit the regression model.

The images with objects are segmented into highlight, background and shadow. Since the shape features are extracted from these segmented images, correctness and precision of the segmentation are highly required. We improve the expectation-maximization (EM) methods of Sanjay-Gopal et al. by using the gamma mixture model. Moreover an intermediate step (I-step) based on Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) is introduced between the E-and M-steps of the EM to consider the pixel spatial dependency. Finally, numerical tests are carried out on both synthetic images and SAS images. The results are compared to iterative conditional mode (ICM) and diffused EM (DEM). Our approach provides segmentations with less false alarms and better shape preservation.

A key challenge in localization arises when more than one mobile device is used for collecting received signal strength (RSS) measurements due to the existence of inconsistencies in the signal measurement hardware from different devices. This paper focuses on developing a calibration method to bring RSS measurements from different source devices to comparable levels by the means of an affine transformation. This calibration method is automated based on the Expectation-Maximization ( EM) algorithm to find the effective transformation parameters in real time. The results show that the estimated locations are within 2m of the true locations for laptop and handset localization when an affine transformation is used and that measurements from only 11 locations were needed for the automated calibration algorithm to obtain the transformation parameters. The results indicate that this calibration technique yields high accuracy levels in localization and that automated RSS measurement calibration is feasible.

If not properly corrected, the registration errors can seriously degrade the global surveillance system performance. The relative sensor registration (or grid-locking) process aligns remote data to local data under the assumption that the local data are bias free and that all biases reside with the remote sensor. In this paper we consider a multi-target scenario and we address here the problem of jointly estimating all registration errors involved in the grid-locking problem. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimator of all bias errors is derived and its statistical performance compared to the hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRLB).

Since true demand forecasting is a key aspect of hotel room revenue management systems, inaccurate forecasts will significantly impact the performance of these systems. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo simulation forecasting model and an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that, unlike traditional statistical unconstraining methods, takes into account the time-series aspect of the observed demand (trend and seasonality) and handles the complex distribution of the demand and its relationship with other system variables/parameters. Our approach is presented in an efficient and simple algorithm. We considered as a case study the data for Plaza Hotel, Alexandria, Egypt. The primary results of our approach demonstrate that it can produce efficient solutions for estimating the unconstrained demand which provide revenue improvements in the industry.

For prospective studies, genetic information can be integrated into the analysis via haplotypes, with focus on their association with a censored survival outcome. We develop non-iterative, regression-based methods to estimate associations between common haplotypes and a censored survival outcome in large cohort studies. Our non-iterative methods-weighted estimation and weighted haplotype combination-are both based on the Cox regression model, but differ in how the imputed haplotypes are integrated into the model. Our approaches enable haplotype imputation to be performed once as a simple data-processing step, and thus avoid implementation based on sophisticated algorithms that iterate between haplotype imputation and risk estimation. We show that non-iterative weighted estimation and weighted haplotype combination provide valid tests for genetic associations and reliable estimates of moderate associations between common haplotypes and a censored survival outcome, and are straightforward to implement in standard statistical software. We apply the methods to an analysis of HSPB7-CLCNKA haplotypes and risk of adverse outcomes in a prospective cohort study of outpatients with chronic heart failure.

These approaches assume that the observed high dimensional data are driven by a small number of hidden binary sources combined due to Boolean superposition. The first approach is the Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) and the second one is the Boolean factor analysis (BFA). The two BMF methods are used for comparison. First is the M8 method from the BMDP statistical software package and the second one is the method suggested by Belohlavek & Vychodil. These two are compared to BFA, especially with the Expectation-maximization Boolean Factor Analysis we had developed earlier has, however, been extended with a binarization step developed here. The well-known bars problem and the mushroom dataset are used for revealing the methods' peculiarities. In particular, the reconstruction ability of the computed factors and the information gain as the measure of dimension reduction was under scrutiny. It was shown that BFA slightly loses to BMF in performance when noise-free signals are analyzed. Conversely, BMF loses considerably to BFA when input signals are noisy.

J	Fu, YZ				Fu, Ying-Zi			Model Selection of Zero-Inflated Generalized Power Series Distribution with Missing Responses	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						AIC; MCEM algorithm; Missing data; Model selection; Zero-inflation	REGRESSION-MODELS; LINEAR-MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; COVARIATE	Count data with extra zeros are common in many biomedical applications and the zero-inflated generalized power series (ZIGPS) distribution may be appropriate, in which the baseline discrete distribution is a generalized power series distribution, which is a natural extension of power series distribution. In this article, a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is proposed to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and standard errors for ZIGPS distribution with missing responses. A Monte Carlo approximation method combining the Gibbs sampler and M-H algorithm is used to implement E-step, whereas the M-step is completed via the method of conditional maximization. As classical model selection procedure such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) becomes problematic for our considered ZIGPS distribution with incomplete data, some variations on AIC are presented under two different missingness mechanisms, namely, missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR), respectively. The most attractive point is that our methods cannot only be used to select distributions and variables, but also can be used to find out whether there exists zero-inflation or not, which is conducted via score test or Bayesian test in previous literature. Finally, a simulation study and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

As classical model selection procedures such as Akaike's information criterion become invalid for our considered models with incomplete data, some new model selection criterions for GPLMs with missing covariates are proposed under two different missingness mechanism, say, missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR). The most attractive point of our method is that it is rather general and can be extended to various situations with missing observations based on EM algorithm, especially when no missing data involved, our new model selection criterions are reduced to classical AIC. Therefore, we can not only compare models with missing observations under MAR/MNAR settings, but also can compare missing data models with complete-data models simultaneously. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator, including consistency of the model selection criterions are investigated. A simulation study and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A color image could be considered as the result from Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to which several Gaussian random variables contribute. In this paper, an efficient method of image segmentation is proposed. The method uses Gaussian mixture models to model the original image, and transforms segmentation problem into the maximum likelihood parameter estimation by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. And using the method to classify their pixels of the image, the problem of color image segmentation can be resolved to some extent. The experiment results confirm this method validity.

A Gibbs sampler generates groups of users according to the posterior probability that these users could have forged the sequence extracted from the pirated content. The marginal probability that a given user pertains to the collusion is then estimated by a Monte Carlo method. The users having the biggest empirical marginal probabilities are accused. This MCMC method can decode any type of fingerprinting codes. This paper is in the spirit of the 'Learn and Match' decoding strategy: it assumes that the collusion attack belongs to a family of models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm estimates the parameters of the collusion model from the extracted sequence. This part of the algorithm is described for the binary Tardos code and with the exploitation of the soft outputs of the watermarking decoder. The experimental body considers some extreme setups where the fingerprinting code lengths are very small. It reveals that the weak link of our approach is the estimation part. This is a clear warning to the 'Learn and Match' decoding strategy.

Largely different from traditional evaluation methods that assume the exponential distribution of time between failures and use theoretical metrics such as mean time between failures (MTBF), our approach is data-driven and takes advantage of smart meters that are capable of recording various power quality indicators at selected monitoring points. The basic idea of our approach is to estimate the instantaneous network reliability, a concept describing current network reliability status, based on measurements from a limited number of smart meters in the power grid. We develop algorithms to solve the technical challenges in the accurate estimation of instantaneous network reliability, using Expectation Maximization (EM) and Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM). The effectiveness of our algorithms is validated with empirical evaluation.

When noisy repetitive signals are observed, the noise cancellation is achieved by averaging perfectly aligned signals. A time delay estimator is developed for determining time delay between signals received on different trials in the presence of uncorrelated noise. The estimator is based on a probabilistic generative model for delayed signals, and tries to find the delay and the source signal simultaneously so that maximum likelihood is achieved. An iterative method based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used for finding maximum likelihood estimate of parameters. The estimator has been tested on three types of synthetic signals. The result shows that it can tolerate 5 to 10dB more noise while achieving the same performance as cross-correlation estimator.

We propose a new method to estimate second order background statistics within a spatial detection method by Matched Filter (MF). Our approach consists in classifying the pixels of the image by gathering the pixels of similar covariance matrices and in estimating one covariance matrix for each class. We use a Classification Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm based on a zero mean Gaussian mixture model. A key issue is the robustness of the classification with regard to target presence. This problem is efficiently tackled in a very simple manner. The resulting Gaussian Mixture Matched Filter (GMMF) has the advantage to adapt itself to second order non-stationary backgrounds and requires only the tuning of the window size used to build the observation vector associated with each pixel. Efficiency of the proposed GMMF approach is demonstrated on a large variety of cloudy sky backgrounds.

The measurement of human immunodeficiency virus ribonucleic acid levels over time leads to censored longitudinal data. Suitable models for dynamic modelling of these levels need to take this data characteristic into account. If groups of patients with different developments of the levels over time are suspected the model class of finite mixtures of mixed effects models with censored data is required. We describe the model specification and derive the estimation with a suitable expectationmaximization algorithm. We propose a convenient implementation using closed form formulae for the expected mean and variance of the truncated multivariate distribution. Only efficient evaluation of the cumulative multivariate normal distribution function is required. Model selection as well as methods for inference are discussed. The application is demonstrated on the clinical trial ACTG 315 data.

One of the most widely used approaches is maximum-likelihood estimation, where parameters of class-specific distributions are estimated using Expectation Maximization algorithm(EM). Initial parameters have great influence on the convergence of EM algorithm, so how to initialize GMM parameters is a key problem. In this paper, we apply spectral clustering(SC) to initialize GMM parameters. Experimental results prove that using spectral clustering algorithm to initialize GMM parameters is superior to traditional K-Means method and identification system has a higher recognition rate.

They are widely used in data mining, signal processing and computer vision. In many applications, we need to estimate the parameters of a GMM from data before working with it. This task can be handled by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (EM-GMM), which is computationally demanding. In this paper we present our FPGA-based solution for the EM-GMM algorithm. We propose a pipeline-friendly EM-GMM algorithm, a variant of the original EM-GMM algorithm that can be converted to a fully-pipelined hardware architecture. To further improve the performance, we design a Gaussian probability density function evaluation unit that works with fixed-point arithmetic. In the experiments, our FPGA-based solution generates fairly accurate results while achieving a maximum of 517 times speedup over a CPU-based solution, and 28 times speedup over a GPU-based solution.

The method uses the measurements as the incomplete data and obtain the complete data which corresponds to the sparse solution using an iterative EM based framework. In standard greedy methods such as matching pursuit or orthogonal matching pursuit a selected atom can not be changed during the course of the algorithm even if the signal doesn't have a support on that atom. The proposed EMMP algorithm is also flexible in that sense. The results show that the proposed method has lower reconstruction errors compared to other greedy algorithms using the same conditions.

Motivated by the suggestion we studied a competing risks model where other cause of death may be misattributed as a death of interest. We first consider a naive approach using unconstrained nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE), and then present the constrained NPMLE where the survival function is forced to be monotonic. Surprising observations were made as we studied their small-sample and asymptotic properties in continuous and discrete situations. Contrary to the common belief that the non-monotonicity of a survival function NPMLE is a small-sample problem, the constrained NPMLE is asymptotically biased in the continuous setting. Other isotonic approaches, the supremum (SUP) method and the Pooled-Adjacent-Violators (PAV) algorithm, and the EM algorithm are also considered. We found that the EM algorithm is equivalent to the constrained NPMLE. Both SUP method and PAV algorithm deliver consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator. All methods behave well asymptotically in the discrete time setting. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database are used to illustrate the proposed estimators.

J	Hammarberg, P; Rusek, F; Edfors, O				Hammarberg, Peter; Rusek, Fredrik; Edfors, Ove			Iterative receivers with channel estimation for multi-user MIMO-OFDM: complexity and performance	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						MIMO; OFDM; multi-user detection; iterative receiver; complexity; channel estimation	CONCATENATED CODES; FADING CHANNELS; SYSTEMS; CONVERGENCE; CDMA	A family of iterative receivers is evaluated in terms of complexity and performance for the case of an uplink multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. The transmission over block fading channels is considered. The analyzed class of receivers is performing channel estimation inside the iterative detection loop, which has been shown to improve estimation performance. As part of our results we illustrate the ability of this type of receiver to reduce the required amount of pilot symbols. A remaining question to ask is which combinations of estimation and detection algorithms that provide the best trade-off between performance and complexity. We address this issue by considering MU detectors and channel estimators, with varying algorithm complexity. For MU detection, two algorithms based on parallel interference cancellation (PIC) are considered and compared with the optimal symbol-wise maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) detector. For channel estimation, an algorithm performing joint minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation is considered along with a low complexity replica making use of a Krylov subspace method. An estimator based on the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is also considered. Our results show that low-complexity algorithms provide the best tradeoff, even though more receiver iterations are needed to reach a desired performance.

We addressed blurred image deconvolution problem using Expectation maximization (EM) based approach in the wavelet domain. The sparsity property of wavelet coefficients is modelled using the class of Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM), which represents the heavy-tailed statistical distribution. The maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate is computed using EM, where scale factors of GSM plays the role of hidden variables. The estimated hidden scaling variables are then used to restore the original image. Although similar formulations have been proposed before but the resulting optimization problems have been computationally demanding and sometimes depends heavily on the initial values of parameters. We proposed an optimized Bayesian approach in wavelet domain to restore an image degraded by linear distortion (e. g., blur) and additive Gaussian noise. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the quality of our method, over a wide range of blur and noise level, both visually and in terms of signal to noise ratio.

The Expectation Maximization-Hierarchical Markov Random Field (EM-HMRF) algorithm is then introduced to take advantage of the equivalence relation between the EM-HMRF and the fuzzy classification method. Second, this paper focused on exploiting self-adaptivity for selecting the prior distribution model parameter beta automatically, and then two fusion schemes (centralized-based and distributed-based fusion) are introduced to achieve better classification results. A new algorithm is derived for supporting multisource remote sensing image classification by using image fusion and the EM-HMRF. The experimental results on synthetic images and real remote sensing images indicate that our proposed algorithm with two fusion schemes can not only greatly improve the accuracy of image classification but also strengthen the anti-interference of noise, thereby providing good evidence to support the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in solving multisource remote sensing image classification problems. Our proposed algorithm for image classification with a fusion scheme should have great potential value for multisource remote sensing image classification strategies.

A ROBUST EVIDENTIAL FISHER DISCRIMINANT FOR MULTI-TEMPORAL HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES CLASSIFICATION	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2012	Munich, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Geosci & Remote Sensing Soc (GRSS), DLR, ESA		Hyperspectral time series; Belief functions; Kernel Fisher Discriminator (KFD); EM Algorithm		This paper develops a noise-robust processing method which can be used to enhance the classification of remotely sensed hyperspectral images. The method first illustrates the benefit of boosting the classical classifiers by exploiting the capability of belief functions. The evidential approach is adopted to produce a map which is approximately insensitive to the noise accompanying the original hyperspectral data-set. Then, a new Evidential Kernel Fisher Discriminant is proposed by using a modified version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. An experimental comparison of the proposed approach with other classical methods is conducted using both synthetic and real hyperspectral data collected by the HYPERION sensor. Our experiments reveal that both classification and unmixing process can benefit from the proposed aggregated approach, remarkably, when the noise level present in the original hyperspectral series is propositionally high.

It introduces dependency-based feature selection which, to our knowledge, is used for the first time in conjunction with the Naive Bayes model acting as clustering technique. Construction of the dependency-based semantic space required for the proposed task is discussed. The resulting disambiguation method, representing an extension of the method introduced in [15], lies at the border between unsupervised and knowledge-based techniques. Syntactic knowledge provided by dependency relations (and exemplified in the case of adjectives) is hereby compared to semantic knowledge offered by the semantic network WordNet (and examined in [15]). Our conclusion is that the Naive Bayes model reacts well in the presence of syntactic knowledge of this type and that dependency-based feature selection is a reliable alternative to the WordNet-based semantic one.

J	Huang, CC; Wang, SJ				Huang, Ching-Chun; Wang, Sheng-Jyh			A Bayesian Hierarchical Framework for Multitarget Labeling and Correspondence With Ghost Suppression Over Multicamera Surveillance System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bayesian inference; image labeling; multicamera surveillance; object correspondence	ENERGY MINIMIZATION; MULTIPLE HUMANS; PEOPLE TRACKING; GRAPH CUTS; CAMERAS; OBJECTS; FIELDS; SCENE	In this paper, the main purpose is to locate, label, and correspond multiple targets with the capability of ghost suppression over a multicamera surveillance system. In practice, the challenges come from the unknown target number, the interocclusion among targets, and the ghost effect caused by geometric ambiguity. Instead of directly corresponding objects among different camera views, the proposed framework adopts a fusion-inference strategy. In the fusion stage, we formulate a posterior distribution to indicate the likelihood of having some moving targets at certain ground locations. Based on this distribution, a systematic approach is proposed to construct a rough scene model of the moving targets. In the inference stage, the scene model is inputted into a proposed Bayesian hierarchical detection framework, where the target labeling, target correspondence, and ghost removal are regarded as a unified optimization problem subject to 3-D scene priors, target priors, and foreground detection results. Moreover, some target priors, such as target height, target width, and the labeling results are iteratively refined based on an expectation-maximization (EM) mechanism to further boost system performance. Experiments over real videos verify that the proposed system can systematically determine the target number, efficiently label moving targets, precisely locate their 3-D locations, and effectively tackle the ghost problem. Note to Practitioners-As cooperative multicamera surveillance networks become more and more popular, the demand of multicamera information fusion and user-friendly representations becomes crucial. Motivated by the demand, this paper demonstrates a new system to efficiently integrate, summarize, and infer video messages from multiple client cameras. The ultimate goal is to provide a global view of the surveillance zone so that the managers in the control room may monitor the scene in an easier way. The main functions of the proposed system include the fusion of detection results from many client cameras, the summarization of consistent messages, and the inference of the target movement in the 3-D scene. In the near future, we will also take into consideration more information, like temporal clues, photometric clues, and object-level clues, in order to perform advanced scene analyses like abnormal behavior detection.

We both estimated marginal distribution and joint distribution with EM algorithm. The fund is presenting complex non-single peaks and different dependence on upper or lower tail, resulting in the more regimes of Gauss mixture. However, the stock index only presents its non-normal characteristics in hourly, daily and monthly data. In the bivariate case, we specifieda more complex Gauss copula with three bivariate regimes and it captures the non-normality. This paper not only substantiates the existence of fund managers' diligence and periodic behavior of investment but also gives a precedent for later similar research.	[Huang, Ke; Li, Hangbin; Cai, H.

A typical problem is to identify the network for multiple related tasks that share some similarities. In this case, a transfer learning approach that can leverage the knowledge gained during the modeling of one task to help better model another task is highly desirable. This article proposes a transfer learning approach that adopts a Bayesian hierarchical model framework to characterize the relatedness between tasks and additionally uses L-1-regularization to ensure robust learning of the networks with limited sample sizes. A method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is further developed to learn the networks from data. Simulation studies are performed that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed transfer learning approach over single-task learning that learns the network of each task in isolation. The proposed approach is also applied to identify brain connectivity networks associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from functional magnetic resonance image data. The findings are consistent with the AD literature.

Yang and Pan [25] proposed a generalized classification maximum likelihood procedure, called the fuzzy c-directions (FCD) clustering algorithm, for estimating the parameters in mixtures of von Mises distributions. Two main drawbacks of the EM algorithm are its slow convergence and the dependence of the solution on the initial value used. The choice of initial values is of great importance in the algorithm-based literature as it can heavily influence the speed of convergence of the algorithm and its ability to locate the global maximum. On the other hand, the algorithmic frameworks of EM and FCD are closely related. Therefore, the drawbacks of FCD are the same as those of the EM algorithm. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes another clustering algorithm, which can self-organize local optimal cluster numbers without using cluster validity functions. These numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior in performance of EM and FCD algorithms. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to two real data sets.

The main feature that distinguishes such proposal from the standard one is the modeling of variation among groups. We illustrate the usefulness of these hierarchical structures by discussing model specification, inferential issues, and empirical results with reference to a real data set.

Towards Speaker Identification System based on Dynamic Neural Network	ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA			English	Article						Speech processing; neural networks; speaker recognition; multilayer perceptrons	RECOGNITION	The conventional, Finite Impulse Response and Lattice-Ladder multilayer perceptron (MLP) structures with 4, 8 and 16 hidden neurons were verified for speaker identification. The experiments were performed on 10 speakers, 3 Lithuanian words, 7 sessions' database. Identification performance was compared against two baseline methods: Vector Quantization (Linde-Buzo-Gray) and Gauss Mixture Models (Expectation Maximization). Increase of neuron number in hidden layer has led to smaller mean square errors on training dataset. A Finite Impulse Response MLP showed smaller mean square errors values. The results of experimental investigation show that neural networks can be used for speaker identification system as they outperform baseline methods. The best identification rate was archived by a multilayer perceptron with 4 hidden neurons and Finite Impulse Response MLP with 8 hidden neurons.

In this paper, we extend the hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, and propose a novel model, called Class-K HMRF model, to further improve the segmentation accuracy by incorporating more contextual information during classification. This model simultaneously takes account of spatial dependencies between image pixels and bias field, and hence can overcome the difficulties caused by noise and intensity inhomogeneity. By comparing our algorithm with state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can produce more accurate and reliable segmentations.

Joint Estimation of Subject Motion and Tracer Kinetic Parameters of Dynamic PET Data in an EM Framework	MEDICAL IMAGING 2012: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 06-09, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Agilent Technol, Diamond SA, DQE Instruments Inc, eMagin, Isuzu Glass Co Ltd, Medtron Inc, Ocean Thin Films Inc		PET; head motion; image registration; expectation maximisation; tracer kinetics		Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography is a powerful tool for quantitative imaging of in vivo biological processes. The long scan durations necessitate motion correction, to maintain the validity of the dynamic measurements, which can be particularly challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution, as well as the complex tracer behaviour in the dynamic PET data. In this paper we develop a novel automated expectation-maximisation image registration framework that incorporates temporal tracer kinetic information to correct for inter-frame subject motion during dynamic PET scans. We employ the Zubal human brain phantom to simulate dynamic PET data using SORTEO (a Monte Carlo-based simulator), in order to validate the proposed method for its ability to recover imposed rigid motion. We have conducted a range of simulations using different noise levels, and corrupted the data with a range of rigid motion artefacts. The performance of our motion correction method is compared with pairwise registration using normalised mutual information as a voxel similarity measure (an approach conventionally used to correct for dynamic PET inter-frame motion based solely on intensity information). To quantify registration accuracy, we calculate the target registration error across the images. The results show that our new dynamic image registration method based on tracer kinetics yields better realignment of the simulated datasets, halving the target registration error when compared to the conventional method at small motion levels, as well as yielding smaller residuals in translation and rotation parameters. We also show that our new method is less affected by the low signal in the first few frames, which the conventional method based on normalised mutual information fails to realign.

A novel color image quantization algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model is proposed. In the approach, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to design the color palette. Each component in the GM M represents a type of color in the color palette. The task of color quantization is to group pixels into different component. Experimental results show that our quantization method can obtain better results than other methods.

In our context, the diffusion approximation(DA) to radiative transfer equation(RTE) is utilized to model the forward process of light propagation. Mathematically, the solution uniqueness does not hold for DA-based BLT which is an inverse source problem of partial differential equations and hence is highly ill-posed. In the current work, we concentrate on a general regularization framework for BLT with Bregman distance as data fidelity and total variation(TV) as regularization. Two specializations of the Bregman distance, the least squares(LS) distance and Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence, which correspond to the Gaussian and Poisson environments respectively, are demonstrated and the resulting regularization problems are denoted as LS+TV and KL+TV. Based on the constrained Landweber(CL) scheme and expectation maximization(EM) algorithm for BLT, iterative algorithms for the LS+ TV and KL+TV problems in the context of BLT are developed, which are denoted as CL-TV and EM-TV respectively. They are both essentially gradient-based algorithms alternatingly performing the standard CL or EM iteration step and the TV correction step which requires the solution of a weighted ROF model. Chambolle's duality-based approach is adapted and extended to solving the weighted ROF subproblem. Numerical experiments for a 3D heterogeneous mouse phantom are carried out and preliminary results are reported to verify and evaluate the proposed algorithms. It is found that for piecewise-constant sources both CL-TV and EM-TV outperform the conventional CL and EM algorithms for BLT.

This is largely due to the variability in individual knee joint pose relative to X-ray plates. Accurate results were reported using postoperative CT. However, its extensive usage in clinical routine is hampered by its major requirement of having CT scans of individual patients, which is not available for most ACL reconstructions. These difficulties are addressed through the proposed method, which aligns a knee model to X-ray images using our novel single-image 3D-2D registration method and then estimates the 3D tunnel position. In the proposed method, the alignment is achieved by using a novel contour-based 3D-2D registration method wherein image contours are treated as a set of oriented points. However, instead of using some form of orientation weighting function and multiplying it with a distance function, we formulate the 3D-2D registration as a probability density estimation using a mixture of von Mises-Fisher-Gaussian (vMFG) distributions and solve it through an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Compared with the ground-truth established from postoperative CT, our registration method in an experiment using a plastic phantom showed accurate results with errors of (-0.43 degrees +/- 1.19 degrees, 0.45 degrees +/- 2.17 degrees, 0.23 degrees +/- 1.05 degrees) and (0.03 degrees +/- 0.55 degrees, -0.03 +/- 0.54, -2.73 +/- 1.64) mm. As for the entry point of the ACL tunnel, one of the key measurements, it was obtained with high accuracy of 0.53 +/- 0.30 mm distance errors.	[Kang, X.; Yau, W.

In practice, this assumption may not always be valid since these images may be acquired from different sensor platforms, or at different time which may suffer small variations in platform flight paths. As a result, it is imperative to incorporate the registration error into the land cover mapping algorithm. In this paper, we propose a joint LCM and image registration algorithm under the Markov random field model. Here, the expectation-maximization algorithm is employed to search for the optimum LCM as well as the map parameters. Our result shows that the proposed MRF-Based approach can increase the accuracies of the classification maps as well as the map parameter estimation.

Statistical analysis of the expectation-maximization algorithm with loopy belief propagation in Bayesian image modeling	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; EM algorithm; maximum likelihood estimation; probabilistic image processing; Markov random fields; Bethe approximation; loopy belief propagation	CLUSTER VARIATION METHOD; ISING SPIN-GLASS; BETHE APPROXIMATION; EM ALGORITHM; RESTORATION; FIELD	New statistical approaches to hyperparameter estimation by means of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and loopy belief propagation (LBP) are given for Bayesian image modeling from the standpoint of statistical-mechanical informatics. In the present paper, we give a new scheme for computing the average of the trajectory in the EM algorithm with LBP with respect to all the possible degraded images generated by the assumed degradation process from a given original image. Moreover, we also give a new scheme for computing the average of the trajectory in the EM algorithm with LBP with respect to all the possible original images generated by the assumed prior probability distribution. Bayesian image models for binary image restorations are constructed as Ising models with random external fields and spatially uniform nearest-neighbor interactions on the square lattice. Our schemes for computing the above random averages for some statistical quantities in LBP are constructed by means of the Bethe approximation for random spin systems. They are reduced to the solution of simultaneous integral equations for distributions of messages in LBP. We show the results of some numerical experiments in LBP as well as the statistical analysis of the trajectory in the EM algorithm for binary image restoration by LBP.

We introduce a simple modification which removes the dependency of the proposed estimator on a window parameter while maintaining its asymptotic properties. A simulation study suggests that both procedures compare favorably to standard thresholding approaches, such as multiple testing or model-based clustering, in terms of the binary classification risk. An application of the method to the problem of activation detection on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is discussed.

Two kinds of features related to the text fragments from the Web documents are investigated. The first type of feature is called, a site-invariant feature. The second type of feature is called a site-dependent feature. Feature selection algorithm is used for wrapper generation from the site invariant and site-dependent information. The wrapper is generated and the new attribute is also discovered and adapted with wrapper by using the Bayesian learning method and E-M algorithm along with the lexical semantics search method. Our wrapper can be able to adapt with the new unseen sites. Our system efficiency is evaluated based on some performance measures and the effectiveness of the system is evaluated by using the performance metrics, precision, recall, f-measure, true positive and false positive in the real time web sites.

The 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) based pilot structure is used as a benchmark. The space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is used to improve the performance from that of the pilot symbol based least-squares (LS) channel estimator. The DD channel estimation improves the performance with high user velocities, where the pilot symbol density is not sufficient. It can also be used to reduce the pilot overhead without any performance degradation. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering can also be used in estimating the channel in between pilot symbols. The pilot based LS, MMSE and the SAGE channel estimators are implemented and the performance-complexity trade-offs are studied.

In this paper, network tomography is studied to analyse the network performance in a dynamic MANET. For such a purpose, a network tomography analytical model is proposed for a dynamic network environment. Expected Maximization (EM) algorithm for network tomography is able to estimate the network performance parameter in accordance to network performance observations. Our study is different than current network tomography approaches where are applied for static wired network. Over the dynamic network, we proposed a new algorithm that is called Stitching algorithm to aggregate the dynamic performance. Specifically, the stitching algorithm concatenates the performance parameter i.e. link delay, from distinguish time periods. Therefore, the network behaviour as well as the corresponding performance in a mobile ad-hoc network can be derived over a continuous period. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Khan, M. S.

This architecture is a cascaded neural network, which consists of two levels of neural networks. The first level consists of sensor networks: two independent sensor neural nets, namely, a spatial neural net and spectral neural net. The second level is a fusion neural net, which contains a single neural net that combines the information from the sensor level. The inputs to the sensor networks are obtained from unsupervised spatial and spectral segmentation algorithms that can be applied to the original imagery or imagery enhanced by a proposed super-resolution process. Spatial segmentation is obtained by a mean-shift method and spectral segmentation is obtained by a Stochastic Expectation Maximization method. The decision outputs from the sensor nets are used to train the fusion net to a specific overall decision. The overall approach is tested with an experiment involving a multi-sensor airborne collection of LIDAR and Hyperspectral data over a university campus in Gulfport MS. The success of the system in utilizing sensor synergism for an enhanced classification is clearly demonstrated.

Specific feature of moving source tracking problem is to obtain accurate estimate provided the speakers are stationary within a short time interval, thus stable estimation would be difficult. At first, basic theory for direction finding is developed for arbitrary array configuration and kernel density estimator approach is applied for tracking multiple simultaneously uttered speeches. Expectation maximization approach for the kernel density estimator and new concept of particle groups corresponding to individual sources are proposed. The method alters the number of particle groups dynamically and it can track multiple source DOAs using short period observation. Through conducted experiments, the method is proved to be effective in real environments.

TWO-MICROPHONE SOURCE SEPARATION ALGORITHM BASED ON STATISTICAL MODELING OF ANGLE DISTRIBUTIONS	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAR 25-30, 2012	Kyoto, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Signal Processing Soc, IEEE		Robust speech recognition; signal separation; interaural time difference; statistical modeling; binaural hearing; von Mises distribution		In this paper we present a novel two-microphone sound source separation algorithm, which selects speech from the target speaker while suppressing signals from interfering sources. In this algorithm, which is refered to as SMAD-CW, we first estimate the direction of sound sources for each time-frequency bin using phase differences in the spectral domain. For each frame we assume that the angle distribution is a mixture of two distributions, one from the target and the other from the dominant noise source. For each mixture component we use the von Mises distribution, which is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to obtain parameters of this mixture distribution. Using this statistical model, we perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis testing in order to obtain appropriate binary masks. We demonstrate that the algorithm described in this paper provides speech recognition accuracy that is significantly better than that obtained using conventional approaches.

From such set of mobility trail we can construct human mobility model. A mobility trail is usually classified as stay states and moving states. Stay states on a specific location can be clustered and be regarded as state of Markov chain. Of course, transition probabilities between stay states can also be calculated. We used expectation maximization clustering technique and constructed Continuous Time Markov Chains representing human mobility model. In addition, we found micro mobility also. Micro mobility is mobility in a restricted area and was represented as subclusters inside a cluster. The identification of micro cluster in small area will raise another topic in human mobility model research. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a new model-based method for peak description and thus for manifold data reduction. Depending on the number of peaks, we reduce the raw data by five orders of magnitude (about 250 000-fold). Each peak is described with seven parameters, which are estimated by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that copes well with overlapping peaks. We transform the parameters into robust and interpretable peak descriptors, which are suitable for downstream analysis steps.

Numerous challenges faced by the policy representation in robotics are identified. Two recent examples for application of reinforcement learning to robots are described: pancake flipping task and bipedal walking energy minimization task. In both examples, a state-of-the-art Expectation-Maximization-based reinforcement learning algorithm is used, but different policy representations are proposed and evaluated for each task. The two proposed policy representations offer viable solutions to four rarely-addressed challenges in policy representations: correlations, adaptability, multi-resolution, and globality. Both the successes and the practical difficulties encountered in these examples are discussed.

In this paper we present a new class of stochastic processes which has been developed for describing correlated input processes and combines acyclic Phase-type distributions to model the marginal distribution with an ARMA process to capture the autocorrelation. The processes are an extension of ARTA processes, a well established input model in stochastic simulations. For the new process type we propose a fitting algorithm that allows one to approximate arbitrary sets of joint moments and autocorrelation coefficients and investigate the effect of different sets of approximated quantities on the quality of the fitted process empirically. We furthermore present an efficient way to generate random numbers and show how the processes can be easily integrated into simulation models.

Learning in a single BSN can be formulated as an online maximum-likelihood expectation-maximisation (ML-EM) algorithm. This form of learning is quite slow. Here, an alternative to this learning algorithm, called Fast Learning (FL), is presented. The FL algorithm is shown to have acceptable convergence performance when compared to the ML-EM algorithm. Moreover, for our implementations the FL algorithm is approximately 25 times faster than the ML-EM algorithm. Although only approximate, the FL algorithm therefore makes learning in hierarchical BSN networks much more tractable.

It is important to reduce the effect of geometrical variations in image recognition, e.g., location, size, and rotation. SL-HMMs are one of the most efficient structures to accomplish invariance to size and location variations. However, since SL-HMMs only have one state sequence in each direction, they cannot deal with rotation or local deformation. The proposed models have state sequences corresponding to all rows and columns of an input image, and the complicated state alignments can represent rotation and local deformation. The effectiveness of the proposed models was demonstrated in face recognition experiments.

The approach is based on the theory of statistical learning. The root images are preprocessed with algorithms for intensity normalization, segmentation, edge detection and scale space corner detection. The features used in the experiments are the Zernike moments of the bi-level image patch centered around high curvature detections. Zernike moments are orthogonal and thus can be rightly assumed to be independent. The densities of the feature vectors for different classes are modelled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM), with a diagonal covariance matrix. The parameters for the feature's distribution densities for different classes are learnt by expectation maximization. Bayes rule and Neymann-Pearson criteria is used to design the classification method. We experiment with different orders of Zernike moments and different number of Gaussians in the GMM. The experiments are done on a real dataset with images of rice, corn, and grass roots. Pattern classification results are quantitatively analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curves. We quantitatively compare the results of the proposed method with that of support vector machine (SVM) which is another very popular statistical learning method for pattern classification.

The individual Gaussian components of a GMM are shown to represent some speaker specific spectral shapes that are effective for modeling speaker identity. Two different set of features which are complement to each, other, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Inverted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features are obtained for each speaker and are trained using Expectation Maximization algorithm. Two GMM models; one for MFCC feature sets, other one for IMFCC feature sets are created. During testing phase, the likelihood of unknown speaker's features with each of the GMM models is determined. By using a weighted sum of these likelihood values, a fused score is created for each speaker and speaker with maximum score is the identified speaker. The performance of this fusion GMM system is evaluated using a part of the TIMIT database consisting of 120 speakers and a maximum identification efficiency of 93.88% is achieved.

A non-iterative sampling Bayesian method for linear mixed models with normal independent distributions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Gibbs algorithms; inverse Bayes formulae; MCMC; linear mixed models; normal/independent distributions; sampling/importance resampling	MULTIVARIATE-T-DISTRIBUTION; INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS; IMPROPER PRIORS; LOCAL INFLUENCE; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; ALGORITHMS; POSTERIORS	In this paper, we utilize normal/independent (NI) distributions as a tool for robust modeling of linear mixed models (LMM) under a Bayesian paradigm. The purpose is to develop a non-iterative sampling method to obtain i.i.d. samples approximately from the observed posterior distribution by combining the inverse Bayes formulae, sampling/importance resampling and posterior mode estimates from the expectation maximization algorithm to LMMs with NI distributions, as suggested by Tan et al. [33]. The proposed algorithm provides a novel alternative to perfect sampling and eliminates the convergence problems of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In order to examine the robust aspects of the NI class, against outlying and influential observations, we present a Bayesian case deletion influence diagnostics based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Further, some discussions on model selection criteria are given. The new methodologies are exemplified through a real data set, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology.

USE OF DATA MINING AND SPECTRAL PROFILES TO DIFFERENTIATE CONDITION AFTER HARVEST OF COFFEE PLANTS	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA			English	Article						crop monitoring; spectral behavior; management; orbital remote sensing		This study aimed at identifying different conditions of coffee plants after harvesting period, using data mining and spectral behavior profiles from Hyperion/EO1 sensor. The Hyperion image, with spatial resolution of 30 m, was acquired in August 28th, 2008, at the end of the coffee harvest season in the studied area. For pre-processing imaging, atmospheric and signal/noise effect corrections were carried out using Flaash and MNF (Minimum Noise Fraction Transform) algorithms, respectively. Spectral behavior profiles (38) of different coffee varieties were generated from 150 Hyperion bands. The spectral behavior profiles were analyzed by Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm considering 2; 3; 4 and 5 clusters. T-test with 5% of significance was used to verify the similarity among the wavelength cluster means. The results demonstrated that it is possible to separate five different clusters, which were comprised by different coffee crop conditions making possible to improve future intervention actions.

Moreover, they are able to deal with individual data sparseness by borrowing the lack of information from the entire population. In this way, the NLMEM do not fail where instead other techniques, such as the traditional individual weighted least squares (WLS), sometimes do. The NLME approach relies on the maximization of a likelihood function that due to model parametric nonlinearity not always has an explicit solution. Various techniques have been proposed to solve this problem including the first order (FO) and the first order conditional (FOCE) estimation methods that approximate the likelihood function through a linearization; the expectation maximization algorithm (EM) that maximize the exact likelihood; the Bayesian estimation method where a third stage of variability, the distribution of the population parameters, is taken into account [1]. Recently, new estimation methods that rely on the EM algorithm have been implemented in the last release of the population software NONMEM [2]. These methods are: the iterative two stage (ITS), Monte Carlo importance sampling EM (IMP), Monte Carlo importance sampling EM assisted by Mode a Posteriori estimation (IMPMAP) and the Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM).

However, most of the work so far has focused on intensity-based refinement strategies for individual anatomical structures such as the hippocampus. In this work we extend a previously proposed framework for labeling whole brain scans by incorporating a global and stationary Markov random field that ensures the consistency of the neighbourhood relations between structures with an a-priori defined model. In particular we improve the segmentation result of a locally weighted multi-atlas fusion method for 41 different structures simultaneously by applying a subsequent EM optimization step. We evaluate the proposed approach on 30 manually annotated brain MR images and observe an improvement of label overlaps to a manual reference by up to 6%. We also achieved a considerably improved group separation when the proposed segmentation framework is applied to a volumetric analysis of 404 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

The particular generalized t distribution we adopt is a Student distribution on the absolute value of its argument. For low degrees of freedom, we show that the generalized t exhibits "sparsity-prior" properties with some attractive features over other common forms of sparse priors and includes the well known double-exponential distribution as the degrees of freedom tends to infinity. We pay particular attention to graphical representations of posterior statistics obtained from sparsity-path-analysis (SPA) where we sweep over the setting of the scale (shrinkage/precision) parameter in the prior to explore the space of posterior models obtained over a range of complexities, from very sparse models with all coefficient distributions heavily concentrated around zero, to models with diffuse priors and coefficients distributed around their maximum likelihood estimates. The SPA plots are akin to LASSO plots of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates but they characterise the complete marginal posterior distributions of the coefficients plotted as a function of the precision of the prior. Generating posterior distributions over a range of prior precisions is computationally challenging but naturally amenable to sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms indexed on the scale parameter. We show how SMC simulation on graphic-processing-units (GPUs) provides very efficient inference for SPA. We also present a scale-mixture representation of the generalized t prior that leads to an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain MAP estimates should only these be required.

However, infrared images are generally characterized by low resolution, low contrast, and an unclear texture with no color information. Moreover, various types of noises and background clutters can degrade the image quality. This paper discusses multi-level segmentation for infrared images. The expectation-maximization algorithm is adopted to cluster pixels on the basis of Gaussian mixture models. The use of the multi-level segmentation method enables the extraction of human target regions from the background of the image. Several infrared images are processed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

For effective pattern recognition, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) probability model is used. For the optimal GMM parameter extraction, we use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed classification algorithm is divided into two significant parts. The first one extracts the optimal parameters for the GMM. The second distinguishes between speech and audio signals using SF pattern recognition. The performance of the proposed classification algorithm shows better results compared to the conventionally implemented USAC scheme.

We theoretically proved that our algorithm converges to unique solutions. Because the obtained algorithm exhibits slow convergence speed, we further developed the proximity algorithm in the transformed image space, i.e. the preconditioned proximity algorithm. We used the bias-noise curve method to select optimal regularization hyperparameters for both our algorithm and expectation maximization with total variation regularization (EM-TV). We showed in the numerical experiments that our proposed algorithms, with an appropriately selected preconditioner, outperformed conventional EM-TV algorithm in many critical aspects, such as comparatively very low noise and bias for Shepp-Logan phantom. This has major ramification for nuclear medicine because clinical implementation of our preconditioned fixed-point algorithms might result in very significant radiation dose reduction in the medical applications of emission tomography.

The difference image is constructed by PCA and subtraction operation. Firstly, the Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model is applied to characterize the contexture-dependent information, and the Energy function of system is defined. Secondly, the Greedy EM algorithm is used to overcome the disadvantage of the EM algorithm that assumed the number of the mixture components is a known priori, the performance of the overall parameter estimation process depends on the given good initial settings excessively, and the estimated parameter can be resulted from some local optimum points. The distribution model structure and parameters are learned accurately to finds the best fit of the given data. Finally the changed area is obtained by using Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) to optimize the energy function. Experiments show that the proposed method has virtues of preserving structural change and filtering noises.

Although the two tasks are complementary in nature, most previous approaches focus on them individually. Here, we resolve the two problems simultaneously by building and inferring a single body model. More specifically, pedestrian segmentation is performed by optimizing body region with constraint of body pose in a Markov Random Field (MRF), and pose parameters are reasoned about through a Bayesian filtering, which takes body silhouette as an observation cue. Since the two processes are inter-related, we resort to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to refine them alternatively. Additionally, a template matching scheme is utilized for initialization. Experimental results on challenging videos verify the framework's robustness to non-rigid human segmentation, cluttered backgrounds and moving cameras.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to mitigate the multicollinearity, and an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm was applied as a missing value treatment to make the principal components readily interpretable. It was found that the MPCR can be used to model the interaction between heavy metals in the biotoxicity analysis of the oilfield soil. According to the modified PCR model, the Cu acts as a micronutrient in the soil for the activities of luminescent marine bacteria (Photobacterium phosphoreum), and the other nine metals have a toxic effect on the bacteria. Additionally, the interactions of metals between Co-Zn, Co-Cu, Co-Cd, Cu-Pb, Cd-Sb, Pb-Zn and Pb-Cd can be described as antagonistic, while the interactions between Co-Ni, Co-Cr, Co-Sb, Co-Pb, Cu-Sb, Cu-Cd, Cd-Ni, Cd-Fe, Pb-Cr and Pb-Sb can be described as synergistic.

In this paper, we present an implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to conduct the automatic unsupervised clustering of reconstructed white matter fiber tracts in DTI. The statistical model is the multivariate and multi-mode Gaussian mixture which depicts the probability distribution of white matter fiber tracts. Issues related to the parameter estimation, initialization, and convergence for applying the EM algorithm in the context of the white matter fiber tract clustering are discussed in detail. Comparisons of the EM algorithm with the K-means approach are also performed. The difference between the fixed and variant prior probabilities on the clustering result as the EM algorithm proceeds is demonstrated by experiments. Real DTI datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and may be useful in the automatic unsupervised clustering of white matter fiber tracts.

Genotype Copy Number Variations using Gaussian Mixture Models: Theory and Algorithms	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						microarray; rate of correct classification; common copy number variants; EM algorithm	ARRAY CGH DATA; SNP ARRAYS; MICROARRAYS; SEGMENTATION	Copy number variations (CNVs) are important in the disease association studies and are usually targeted by most recent microarray platforms developed for GWAS studies. However, the probes targeting the same CNV regions could vary greatly in performance, with some of the probes carrying little information more than pure noise. In this paper, we investigate how to best combine measurements of multiple probes to estimate copy numbers of individuals under the framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM). First we show that under two regularity conditions and assume all the parameters except the mixing proportions are known, optimal weights can be obtained so that the univariate GMM based on the weighted average gives the exactly the same classification as the multivariate GMM does. We then developed an algorithm that iteratively estimates the parameters and obtains the optimal weights, and uses them for classification. The algorithm performs well on simulation data and two sets of real data, which shows clear advantage over classification based on the equal weighted average.

To solve this problem, the Gaussian mixture model is used to extract the geometric features from the synthetic characteristic curves so that the retrieval process of the model wheel can be achieved by these geometric features. The search model of the running area from the synthetic characteristic curves is build based on the contour curve similarity transformation method. In the paper, the Monte Carlo method is adopted to obtain the mean values of the synthetic characteristics in the running area so that the evaluation targets can be established by combining the mean values with the hydraulic turbine design experiences. Finally the validity of running area can be evaluated by the evaluation targets. The test results show that the accuracy and efficiency of the selection design of Large-scale hydraulic turbine can be improved by the proposed method.

Only data at the receiving end are assumed available for the estimation. By employing a first-order autoregressive (AR) model for characterizing the time-varying nature of the channels to be estimated, we derive an expectation-maximization (EM) Kalman filter (KF) that utilizes the received signal at the destination to track the individual channel links. The extended KF algorithm is also derived and compared to the proposed EM-based KF. Our simulation results show that the proposed EM-based KF offers better estimation performance with less complexity when compared to the EKF algorithm.

J	Lo, YT				Lo, Yungtai			Estimating the prevalence of low-lumbar spine bone mineral density in older men with or at risk for HIV infection using normal mixture models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						bone mineral density; Box-Cox power transformation; EM algorithm; HIV infection; normal mixture; parametric bootstrap	LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS; FRACTURE PREDICTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BODY-COMPOSITION; US ADULTS; OSTEOPOROSIS; COMPONENTS; VARIANCES; DISEASE; NUMBER	Bone mineral density decreases naturally as we age because existing bone tissue is reabsorbed by the body faster than new bone tissue is synthesized. When this occurs, bones lose calcium and other minerals. What is normal bone mineral density for men 50 years and older? Suitable diagnostic cutoff values for men are less well defined than for women. In this paper, we propose using normal mixture models to estimate the prevalence of low-lumbar spine bone mineral density in men 50 years and older with or at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection when normal values of bone mineral density are not generally known. The Box-Cox power transformation is used to determine which transformation best suits normal mixture distributions. Parametric bootstrap tests are used to determine the number of mixture components and to determine whether the mixture components are homoscedastic or heteroscedastic.

Duane			Effects of extraneous noise in Cryptotomography	IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Reconstruction from Incomplete Data VII	AUG 14-15, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE		x-ray; free-electron laser; XFELs; cryptotomography; expectation maximization; diffraction; clustering; reconstruction algorithms; phase-retrieval	FREE-ELECTRON LASER; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; OPERATION; ALGORITHM; PULSES	X-ray pulses produced by free-electron lasers can be focussed to produce high-resolution diffraction signal from single nanoparticles before the onset of considerable radiation damage.(1-3) These two-dimensional (2D) diffraction patterns are inherently noisy and have no direct means of signal-averaging because the particles themselves are currently injected at random, unknown three-dimensional (3D) orientations into the particle-radiation interaction region. Simulations have successfully recovered 3D reconstructions from such remarkably noisy and fully unoriented 2D diffraction data. 4 However, actual experimental data(5) show that extraneous noise (either from background scattering or detector noise) can limit the resolution of the reconstruction or even jeopardize reconstruction attempts. This paper studies the second and more severe of these two effects through a simplified version of this reconstruction problem. A straightforward consideration of conditional probabilities(4,6) can help define when the extraneous noise overwhelms reconstruction attempts. Nevertheless, an ensemble of data with considerable numbers of bright fluctuations may still reconstruct successfully. Incidentally, we also extend a specialized reconstruction algorithm(4,6) to recover distinct species within an ensemble of illuminated samples. We expect our simplified simulations to provide insights that would have taken considerably longer to develop when restricted to the full 3D reconstruction problem.

In this work, we propose a 4D Expectation Maximization framework for measuring the atrophy rate of the hippocampus from serial magnetic resonance images. One novelty of the framework is a disease-specific prior that regularizes the segmentation near the borders of the hippocampus. Regions where the hippocampus tends to get larger in the follow-up images than in the baseline are penalized. Using the ADNI cohort, we obtained classification accuracies of 83 % for healthy control and Alzheimer's disease patient groups and 60 % for stable and progressive MCI groups using the baseline and 12-month follow-up images.

In a sensor network, there are a large number of inexpensive sensors which are densely deployed in a region of interest (ROI). This dense deployment enables accurate intensity (energy) based target localization. The maximum-likelihood is the predominant objective which leads to a variety of source localization approaches. However, the investigation on the energy-based localization for multiple sources has been very rare. The corresponding robust and efficient algorithms are still being pursuit by researchers nowadays. In this paper, we would like to combat the energy-based multiple-source localization problem. We propose two new algorithms, namely alternating projection (AP) algorithm and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which can combat the energy-based localization problem for multiple sources.

The model is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems and is built in two phases: In the first, the model uses the subtractive clustering algorithm to determine initial group structures in a reduced data set. In the second phase, the system is modified dynamically by adding and pruning operators and applying a recursive learning algorithm based on the expectation maximization optimization technique. The algorithm automatically determines the number of fuzzy rules necessary at each step, and one-step-ahead predictions are estimated and parameters updated. The model is applied to forecast financial time series volatility, considering daily values of the Sao Paulo stock exchange index, the Petrobras preferred stock prices, and the BRL/USD exchange rate. The model suggested is compared against generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. Experimental results show the adequacy of the adaptive fuzzy approach for volatility forecasting purposes.

Our algorithm aims to recover the underlying coherent spatial mapping which related to inliers. The thin-plate spline (TPS) is chosen to parameterize the coherent spatial mapping, and we formulate the solution of it as a maximum likelihood problem. The mismatches could be successfully removed after the EM algorithm, which we used for solving the problem, converges. The quantitative results on various experimental data demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed method is also able to handle the case that image pairs contain non-rigid motions.

Initially we present the procedure in case of known density of the mixture to discuss how to spend the density classification and therefore indexing. Once we cleared the problem justifies the choice of the density approximation by Gaussian mixture. Then we present the indexing algorithm based on the EM algorithm and the tangent distance. The tangent distance is a mathematical tool that compares two patterns (or images) by taking into account small transformations such as rotation and homothety, phenomena often encountered in ancient documents. The results show the robustness of the method compared to small global transformations.

More precisely, we are aiming at learning the main features of an object seen in different scenarios. We adapt the statistical framework from [1] to propose a model in which an object is described by independent classes representing its variability. Our work consists in proposing an algorithm which learns each class characteristics in a sequential way: each new observation will improve our object knowledge. This algorithm is particularly well suited to real time applications such as shape recognition or classification, but turns out to be a challenging problem. Indeed, the so-called classic machine learning algorithms in missing data problems such as the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) are not designed to learn from sequentially acquired observations. Moreover, the so-called hidden data simulation in a mixture model can not be achieved in a proper way using the classic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler. Our proposal, among other, takes advantage from the contribution of Cappe and Moulines [2] for a sequential adaptation of the EM algorithm and from the work of Carlin and Chib [3] for the hidden data posterior distribution simulation.

Only models with known number of components and observed component membership (complete models) are studied in the text. Possible estimation method of unknown parameters (parameters of components and mixing proportions) is described. Specific theoretical and numerical problems associated with this this type of the modelling are discussed with respect to the mixture models with complete data. A simulation study is presented to illustrate properties of estimates and sensitivity of results on the proportion of censored data. For the simulation 10,000 samples with 500 and 1,000 observations from the mixtures with two components of normal (symmetric distribution) and lognormal (asymmetric distribution) distributions are generated. Results are given in the tables and selected histograms of estimates of parameters are shown. All computations are made in the package R.

In such cases, ground truth is generally available for the only land-cover classes of interest, which limits (or hinders) the possibility of successfully employing standard supervised approaches that require an exhaustive ground truth for all the land-cover classes characterizing the investigated area. In this paper, we present a novel technique capable of addressing this challenging issue by exploiting the only ground truth available for the only land-cover classes of interest. In particular, the proposed method exploits the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and an iterative labeling strategy based on Markov random fields (MRF) accounting for spatial correlation. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed technique.

A preprocessing step is applied to remove the dark background and find the seed point inside the LV chamber, eliminating the specialist intervention for identifying the seed point to initialize the segmentation process. The Rayleigh-Gaussian Mixture model is used to statistically differentiate the blood from the myocardial regions in Echocardiography images. An ellipse inside the LV chamber is then automatically fitted by utilizing the active ellipse model. The resultant ellipse forms the initial contour of the modified B-Spline Snake algorithm that evolves iteratively to outline the inner boundary of the LV chamber. Finally, the Markov Random Field (MRF) algorithm is utilized to extract the LV myocardium. The boundary specified by the B-spline snake is involved in reducing the number of MRF sites. The detected myocardium accuracy for all images is calculated using the dice's coefficient. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is more reliable and overcomes the common problems in segmentation of Echocardiography images such as speckle noise and large gaps in contrast with previous works.

Person re-identification deals with this problem in order to provide more efficient security. A novel distributed appearance-based method for person re-identification is proposed. Spatio-temporal features are used to group the camera network into camera neighbourhoods. A intra-neighbourhood camera confidence hand-over measure is computed by exploiting a signatures' distance measure. The camera confidence measure is exploited to save network resources. Features that capture the chromatic appearance and the shape of an individual are used to compute a discriminative signature. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to fit Gaussian Mixture Models over the chromatic features. GMMs are exploited to compute the distance between signatures and to update the intra-neighbourhood camera confidence. The method has been validated using a benchmark dataset and a new dataset acquired from a wide camera network scenario.

Such a method with an EM algorithm has already been proposed, however, it required a time-consuming exhaust search for TDOA inference. To remove the need for such an exhaust search, we propose a new technique by focusing on a stereo case. We derive an update rule for analytical TDOA estimation. This update rule eliminates the need for the exhaustive TDOA search, and therefore reduces the computational load. We show experimental results for separation performance and calculation time in comparison with those obtained with the conventional approach. Our reported results validate our proposed method, that is, our proposed method achieves high performance without a high computational cost.

The formulation of the problem obtained from the DS-CDMA post-correlation model (PCM) leads to a non-linear likelihood function which is maximized by the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In this approach, we avoid eigen-decomposition of the autocorrelation matrix widely used for multiple parameters estimation. Instead, we transpose the problem of multidimensional maximization to simpler one-dimensional maximizations carried out in parallel, thereby reducing the computational cost considerably. We also extend the application of the proposed single-carrier (SC) algorithm to multicarrier (MC)-CDMA systems by exploiting the frequency gain over subcarriers. Simulations suggest that the proposed EM-based algorithm provides accurate estimates even in the challenging case of closely-spaced delays from one transmitted symbol.

We developed an adaptive pattern generator model that is composed of a two-factor observation model with a style parameter and phase dynamics with a phase variable. The style parameter controls the spatial patterns of the generated trajectories, and the phase variable controls its temporal profiles. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we applied it to a simulated humanoid model to perform biped walking behaviors coordinated with observed walking patterns and the environment. The robot successfully performed stable biped walking behaviors even when the style of the observed walking pattern and the period were suddenly changed.			takam-m@atr.jp; xmorimo@atr.jp					Cheng G, 2007, ADV ROBOTICS, V21, P1097, DOI 10.1163/156855307781389356; DEMPSTER AP, 1977, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V39, P1; Endo G, 2004, IEEE INT CONF ROBOT, P3036, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307523; Ghahramani Z., TECHNICAL REPORT; Hyon S., 2011, P IEEE RSJ INT C INT, P2715; Laszlo J, 2000, COMP GRAPH, P201; Matsubara T, 2006, ROBOT AUTON SYST, V54, P911, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2006.05.012; Matsubara T, 2012, NEURAL NETWORKS, V25, P191, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2011.08.008; Miller N, 2004, IEEE-RAS INT C HUMAN, P547; Morimoto J, 2008, IEEE T ROBOT, V24, P185, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2008.915457; Nakanishi J, 2004, ROBOT AUTON SYST, V47, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2004.03.003; Rasmussen CE, 2005, ADAPT COMPUT MACH LE, P1; Sato M, 2000, NEURAL COMPUT, V12, P407, DOI 10.1162/089976600300015853; Shiratori T, 2008, ACM T GRAPHIC, V27, DOI 10.1145/1409060.1409076; Shumway R.

We devise an unsupervised method that is mostly view-independent, makes no assumptions about the environment, restricts the set of hand-tuned parameters, and builds on sound probabilistic reasoning from the input data to the outcome of the algorithm. In our approach, we construct a piecewise planar model of the environment and determine curbs at plane segment boundaries. Initially, we sense the environment with a nodding laser range-finder and project the 3D measurements into an efficient Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Each cell of the DEM maintains an error model that is propagated throughout the entire algorithm. Plane segments are further estimated with a mixture of linear regression models on the DEM. Here, we propose an original formulation of the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixture models. Specifically, in the E-step, responsibilities are computed with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that introduces dependencies between the covariates of the mixture model. A graph-based segmentation of the DEM provides an estimate of the number of planes and initial parameters for the EM. We show promising results of the algorithm on simulated and real-world data.

GMMs use expectation maximization (EM) as an optimization procedure to train speaker models. This paper proposes the information theoretic expectation maximization (ITEM) with improved convergence rates to train the speaker models. The approach amounts to information theoretic (IT) since it uses the parzen density estimation and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure. EM encounters the problem of convergence thus to enhance the convergence rates of EM, an IT procedure is incorporated. The proposed ITEM algorithm adapts means, covariances, and weights, like the conventional EM algorithm; however, this process is not conducted directly on feature vectors but on a smaller set of centroids derived by the IT procedure, which simultaneously minimizes the divergence between the Parzen estimates of the feature vectors distribution within a given class and the centroids distribution within the same class. The ITEM algorithm was applied to the speaker verification problem using NIST 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006 speaker recognition evaluation corpora and MFCC with delta, energy, and zero-crossing features. The results showed an improvement of the equal error rate over the classical EM approach. The ITEM method also showed higher convergence rates compare with the EM method.

In this article, we propose to use sub-Nyquist non-uniform sampling for spectrum sensing to reduce the power consumption. Since the received signal samples are correlated in the time domain, we estimate the missing samples by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. It is shown that the combined sub-Nyquist non-uniform sampling and EM algorithm consume much less power than A/D converter at the Nyquist rate making the proposed algorithm a viable low-power solution for spectrum sensing. Moreover, it is shown by simulations that the proposed sub-Nyquist rate non-uniform sampler is accurate enough to detect the edges of the estimated power spectral density.

The proposed system consists of 12 modules arranged into a ring. Each detector module is a trapezoidal LXe time projection chamber (TPC) viewed by two arrays of large area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPD). We developed a Geant4-based Monte Carlo code to model the LXe PET system and study its imaging performance. Events depositing energy in multiple locations were reconstructed with a Compton reconstruction algorithm. The simulated data were stored in a list-mode file and reconstructed with the maximum likelihood expectation maximization iterative algorithm (MLEM).

J	Mirroshandel, SA; Ghassem-Sani, G				Mirroshandel, Seyed Abolghasem; Ghassem-Sani, Gholamreza			Towards Unsupervised Learning of Temporal Relations between Events	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								Automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an important task for several natural language processing applications such as Question Answering, Information Extraction, and Summarization. Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our effort to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithms learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of "one type of temporal relation per discourse", it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information os such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, sa bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. the second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first stem toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.

However, radar image quality can be easily deteriorated by signal strength decay with increasing distance, blurring due to side lobes, signals of behind objects and of shaded area. And it is difficult to recover the artifacts. This paper proposes a new approach to improve radar image quality by image fusion. The fusion method generating high quality radar images is based on EM algorithm. Performance was validated using radar images acquired from a single radar system at multiple locations. The experimental results showed that the proposed method constructed high quality radar images, and recovered signal decay and blurring due to side lobes.

Though many papers propose means for improving color constancy, the vast majority assume image formation via reflective light instead of light transmission as in microscopy, and thus are inappropriate for histological analysis. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian color segmentation algorithm for histological images that is highly robust to color nonstandardness; this algorithm employs a unique instantiation of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to dynamically estimate - for each individual image - the probability density functions (mixtures of gamma and von Mises distributions) that describe the colors of salient objects. To validate our segmentation scheme, we employ it as part of a computerized system to detect myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) on bone marrow specimens. Qualitative anecdotal evidence suggests that biopsies of MDS exhibit abnormalities in the arrangement of erythroid precursors (immature red blood cells). Herein, we confirm and quantify this phenomenon, using it to discriminate MDS from normal tissue: over a dataset of 53 representative regions selected from 18 patients, our classification system correctly discriminates MDS from normal tissue with an accuracy of 85% and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.8803.

We consider a network of agents whose mission is to estimate a parameter from the time series locally observed by the agents. Our estimator works online and asynchronously: it starts processing data as they arrive with no need of a reference clock, common to all the agents. Agents update some local summary statistics using recent data (E-step), then share these statistics with theirs neighbors in order to eventually reach a consensus (gossip step), and finally use them to generate individual estimates of the unknown parameter (M-step). Our algorithm is shown to converge under mild conditions on the gossip protocol, freeing the network from feedback communications; hence making this DEM algorithm particularly well suited to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).

However, change detection methods that were found accurate for coarser-resolution SAR are often ineffective with current very high resolution (VHR) satellite SAR due to the need to suitably model the contextual and geometrical information associated with VHR data. In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection technique is proposed for VHR SAR based on Markov random fields (MRFs), line processes, and a dictionary of SAR-specific probability density models. The estimation of the parameters of the proposed MRF model is carried out through the expectation-maximization algorithm and the method of log-cumulants. Graph cuts are used to minimize the energy function of the MRF model because of their capability to approach global minima or strong local minima in acceptable computation times. The proposed method is experimented with COSMO-SkyMed images acquired before and after an earthquake.

The mixture model uses Markov Random Field (MRF) to incorporate spatial relationship among neighboring pixels into the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in order to perform a segmentation that is robust against noise and other environmental factors. The bilateral filtering is used to smooth the posterior probability map as part of the MRF used. The advantage of the proposed model is its simplified structure so that the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be directly applied to the log-likelihood function to compute the optimum parameters of the mixture model. The method has been extensively tested on synthetic and natural images and compared with some of the state-of-the-arts algorithms currently available. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to the other methods in terms of accuracy and quality and simpler in terms of implementation.	[Mukherjee, Dibyendu; Wu, Q. M.

In this work, we propose a novel real-time video segmentation algorithm based on Student's t mixture model. Though, Student's t-distribution has been used for image segmentation by applying Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the same technique cannot be followed in video segmentation due to exceptional increase in computational complexity. Thus, in spite of being a more heavily-tailed distribution compared to Gaussian, Student's t mixture model remained unexplored for video segmentation. In this work, a novel and effective recursive filter based formulation has been introduced to update the mixture model with new observations. Our analysis and experimental results show that real-time, robust and improved video segmentation can be performed using Student's t mixture model compared to the conventional mixture models.

In order to make such a MAP receiver more robust against time-variant channels, this paper derives channel estimation with subcarrier removal from the perspective of a message-passing algorithm on factor graphs. The subcarrier removal estimates the channel frequency response by using the detected signals of all subcarriers other than that of a targeted subcarrier. This modification can avoid the repetitive use of incorrectly detected signals for the channel estimation. Computer simulations under fast-fading conditions demonstrate that the EM-based MAP receiver performing the subcarrier removal can improve the packet error rate (PER) drastically.

Improving Forest Growth Estimates Using a Bayesian Network Approach	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Review							LEAF-AREA INDEX; MODEL; PRODUCTIVITY; CARBON; 3-PG; ASTER	Estimating the contribution of forests to carbon sequestration is commonly done by applying forest growth models. Such models inherently use field observations, such as leaf area index (LAI), whereas relevant information is also available from remotely sensed images. The purpose of this study is to improve the LAI estimated from the Physiological Principles Predicting Growth (3-PG) model by combining its output with LAI derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery. A Bayesian network (BN) approach is proposed to take care of the different structure of the inaccuracies in the two data sources. It addresses the bias in the 3-PG model and the noise of the ASTER images. Moreover, the EM algorithm is introduced into BN to estimate missing the LAI ASTER data, since they are not available for long time series due to the atmospheric conditions. This paper shows that the outputs obtained with the BN were more accurate than the 3-PG estimate, as the root mean square error reduces to 0.46, and the relative error to 5.86 percent. We conclude that the Em-algorithm within a BN can adequately handle missing LAI ASTER values, and BNS can improve the estimation of LAI values. Ultimately, this method may be used as a predicting model of LAI values, and handling the missing data of ASTER images time series.

Estimation of Synchronization Parameters in AF Cooperative Networks	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC)	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE			FREQUENCY SYNCHRONIZATION; JOINT CHANNEL; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; TIME	In cooperative networks, multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFOs) and multiple timing offsets (MTOs) originate due to multiple distributed nodes. In this paper, algorithms for joint estimation of these parameters and channels in amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks are proposed. A new training model and transceiver structure at the relays for achieving synchronization throughout the network is devised. New exact closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation problem are derived. An estimation method is proposed for jointly estimating MCFOs, MTOs, and channel gains at the destination based on space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) and compared to a computationally-intensive least squares (LS) approach. The proposed estimator's performance is shown to be close to the CRLB at mid-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting in significant cooperative performance gains in the presence of practical impairments.

Among many factors, moisture and ageing significantly influence the dielectric properties of a transformer. Recently, several researchers have proposed new diagnostic methods that are complementary to the classical measurement systems such as insulation resistance, power frequency dissipation factor, polarization index measurements etc. Dielectric diagnosis with polarization and depolarization currents (PDC) uses the dielectric system response in time domain. In this research a laboratory-built, compact and easy to construct PDC measurement system is implemented without compromising on the reliability of the measurement system. The capability of the measuring system is ascertained by carrying out detailed studies on scaled down laboratory models and a 315 kVA, 11kV/433V, Dyn 11, ONAN distribution transformer with artificially simulated insulation flaws namely moisture content in oil, inter-disc/inter-turn shorts, winding asymmetry etc. Simulation studies on the transformer R-C equivalent representation are also carried out to validate the response of the PDC system. In addition, the Homoscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HOPNN) which utilized the Expectation Maximization (EM) with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm is implemented for obtaining a parsimonious training for subsequent identification of faults.

It is an important step because incorrectly segmented characters are unlikely to be recognized correctly. For segmenting a cursive scripts leads more challenging because of presence of more touching characters. Kannada is the one of the popular language in south India and also some of the letters in Kannada language are cursive in nature. In this paper, a new character segmentation algorithm for unconstrained handwritten Kannada scripts is presented. The proposed method is based on thinning, branch point and mixture models. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. We have used a cluster mean points to estimate the direction and branch point as reference points for segmenting characters. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed method on Kannada words and it has shown encouraging result.

The algorithm simultaneously arrives at an enhanced image as well as Fried's seeing parameter through an Expectation Maximization (EM) technique. Unlike blind deconvolution algorithms that operate only on two dimensional images, this technique accounts for both the spatial and temporal mixing that is caused by the atmosphere through which the system is imaging. Additionally, due to the over-determined nature of this problem, the point-spread function parameterized by Fried's seeing parameter can be deduced without the requirement for additional assumptions or constraints. The utility of the approach lies in its application to laser illuminated imaging where processing time is important.

We prove theoretically that k-MLE is dually equivalent to a Bregman k-means for the case of mixtures of exponential families (e. g., Gaussian mixture models). k-MLE is used to initialize appropriately the expectation-maximization algorithm.

The proposed pixel-based algorithm explores spatio-temporal contextual information and thus could effectively improve the classification accuracy while simultaneously avoids the pepper-salt results which often occurs on the SAR images. Moreover, owing to the multiscale analysis, MPAC could adaptively preserve the detailed features comparing with other non-adaptive contextual methods. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and requires less parameter to be estimated. Properties of the proposed algorithm including the MRF impact, multiscale efficiency, computational performance and the initialization influence were investigated. Six-date RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data over the Greater Toronto Area were used for validation. The results show that this algorithm could generate homogenous and detailed mapping results with fair accuracy for complex urban land cover classification.

Creation of an ensemble of simulated cardiac cases and a human observer study: tools for the development of numerical model observers for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging.	MEDICAL IMAGING 2012: IMAGE PERCEPTION, OBSERVER PERFORMANCE, AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Perception, Observer Performance, and Technology Assessment	FEB 08-09, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Agilent Technol, Diamond SA, DQE Instruments, Inc, eMagin, Isuzu Glass Co Ltd, Medtron, Inc, Ocean Thin Films, Inc			DEFECT DETECTION; RECONSTRUCTION; OPTIMIZATION; ATTENUATION	Our previous Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) research explored the utility of numerical observers. We recently created two hundred and eighty simulated SPECT cardiac cases using Dynamic MCAT (DMCAT) and SIMIND Monte Carlo tools. All simulated cases were then processed with two reconstruction methods: iterative ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and filtered back-projection (FBP). Observer study sets were assembled for both OSEM and FBP methods. Five physicians performed an observer study on one hundred and seventy-nine images from the simulated cases. The observer task was to indicate detection of any myocardial perfusion defect using the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) 17-segment cardiac model and the ASNC five-scale rating guidelines. Human observer Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) studies established the guidelines for the subsequent evaluation of numerical model observer (NO) performance. Several NOs were formulated and their performance was compared with the human observer performance. One type of NO was based on evaluation of a cardiac polar map that had been pre-processed using a gradient-magnitude watershed segmentation algorithm. The second type of NO was also based on analysis of a cardiac polar map but with use of a priori calculated average image derived from an ensemble of normal cases.	[O'Connor, J.

Broadband Field Directionality Mapping with Spatially-Aliased Arrays	2012 IEEE 7TH SENSOR ARRAY AND MULTICHANNEL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP (SAM)	Proceedings of the IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 7th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	JUN 17-20, 2012	Hoboken, NJ	IEEE			ALGORITHM	This paper addresses the problem of broadband spatial spectrum estimation using multiple spatially-aliased arrays. Unlike previous approaches using sparse arrays, the signals here are assumed to be uncorrelated between multiple arrays which, in fact, may be receiving the same source during different time intervals. This paper presents an approach which jointly exploits spatial-orientation and broadband temporal diversity in order to estimate the spatial spectrum even when the inter-element spacing within each array is greater than a half-wavelength. A dynamical model for the spatial spectrum is employed to formulate a maximum likelihood estimate, which is computed via a recursive version of the expectation-maximization algorithm using data from different arrays. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the ability of the method to suppress spatial grating lobes and increase low SNR target detection in an interference dominated environment.

Time-varying Array Shape Estimation by Mapping Acoustic Field Directionality	2012 OCEANS			English	Proceedings Paper	MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference	OCT 14-19, 2012	Virginia Beach, VA	IEEE, Marine Technol Soc (MTS), IEEE OES (IEEE/OES)			TOWED ARRAY; UNKNOWN LOCATIONS; CALIBRATION; REVERBERATION; TRACKING	This paper introduces a towed-array shape estimation technique that exploits the directional structure of the time-varying acoustic field. Unlike conventional array shape estimation methods that use discrete sources of opportunity, the proposed approach does not assume knowledge of the number of sources in the field or their estimated directions. Instead, the entire time-varying field directionality map is used. Additionally, maneuverability of the array is exploited to improve endfire resolution and left/right discrimination for a nominally linear array. The algorithm forms an approximate joint maximum-likelihood estimate of time-varying field directionality and array shape using an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. Simulations are given to evaluate the array shape estimation error during a maneuver. In a simulated multi-source scenario, the proposed method is shown to be more robust than methods that rely on direction-of-arrival estimation when the full field around the array is considered.

This prior is computed using expectation maximization (EM). Using the computed prior the iterative method avoids track coalescence and track swap while preserving the robustness of JPDA towards clutter and missed detection. Compared to other coalescence avoidance schemes, the proposed method avoids coalescence and swap without pruning the joint association events. Monte Carlo simulations verify the advantage of the proposed method over other approaches in a cluttered multi-target environment.

We consider two such families of densities, the so-called semi-nonparametric (SNP) and smooth nonparametric (SMNP) densities. Maximum likelihood estimation, under either the SNP or the SMNP densities, is carried out using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. This algorithm uses rejection sampling and automatically increases the MC sample size as it approaches convergence. In a simulation study we investigate the performance of these two densities in capturing the true underlying shape of the random effects distribution. We also examine the implications of misspecification of the random effects distribution on the estimation of the fixed effects and their standard errors. The impact of the assumed random effects density on the estimation of the random effects themselves is investigated in a simulation study and also in an application to a real data set.

For the feasibility of our CdTe detector (PID350, AJAT, Finland) in small animal SPECT system, we compared the quality of reconstructed images from our SPECT system to those from a conventional small animal SPECT system with a NaI(Tl) detector. The CdTe detector had 0.35 mm x 0.35 mm(2) pixels, which is similar to the size of the available detector (PID350, AJAT, Finland). The CdTe detector size was 44.8 x 44.8 mm(2) and the thickness of this detector was 1 mm. The size of NaI(Tl) detector was 44 mm x 96 mm2 and the thickness of this detector was 5 mm. The intrinsic spatial resolution of CdTe detector and that of NaI(Tl) detector were 0.35 mm FWHM and 2.3 mm FWHM, respectively. The parallel hole collimator of lead was 25 mm high, and the septum was 0.2 mm high. The parallel hole collimator was hexagonal with a 0.5 mm radius. The Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess both SPECT systems. All projections were obtained using 120 projection views acquired from 0 degrees to 360 degrees with a 3 degrees step. Slices were reconstructed using an Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OS-EM) with 5 iterations and 4 subsets. We compared the quality of the images from each system in terms of spatial resolution (FWHM), and sensitivity. The spatial resolution of system using CdTe and that of system using NaI(Tl) detector were 2.32 mm FWHM and 3.31mm FWHM, respectively. The system sensitivity for our SPECT with CdTe and NaI(Tl) detector were 23.22 count/sec/MBq and 54.06 count/sec/MBq, respectively. Our simulation results indicated that our SPECT with CdTe detector showed better spatial resolution compared to SPECT with NaI(Tl) detector. These results demonstrate that SPECT imaging using a pixelated CdTe detector can improve the performance of SPECT systems for small animal imaging in term of spatial resolution.

Meanwhile, machine learning is a promising AI technology which can enhance the performance of traditional algorithm. Therefore, aiming at solving service discovery problem, this paper imports Bayesian classifier to web service discovery framework, which can improve service querying speed. In this framework, services in service library become training set of Bayesian classifier, service query becomes a testing sample. Service matchmaking process can be executed in related service class, which has fewer services, thus can save time. Due to don't know the class of service in training set, EM algorithm is used to estimate prior probability and likelihood functions. Experiment results show that the EM algorithm and Bayesian classifier supported method outperforms other methods in time complexity. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, Lie group parametric representation is combined with the Expectation Maximization (EM) method to provide a unified framework. First, having a transformation fixed, the EM algorithm is introduced to find the correspondence between two data sets through correspondence probability, which covers the relationship of all points, instead of using exact correspondence such as the classical Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. With this type of ststistical correspondence, we could deal with the presence of the degradations such as outliers and incomplete point sets. Second, having the updated correspondence fixed, and introducing Lie group parametric representation, the transformation is updated by minimizing a quadratic programming. Then, an alternative iterative strategy by the above two steps is used to approximate the desired correspondence and transformation. The comparative experiment between our Lie-EM-ICP algorithm and Lie-ICP algorithm using point cloud is presented. Our algorithm is demonstrated to be accurate and robust, especially in the presence of incomplete point sets and outliers.

Eligibility and response to treatment is assessed by using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) algorithm, which incorporates one of two inflammatory markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). Although DAS28-CRP provides a more reliable measure of disease activity, functional variants exist within the CRP gene that affect basal CRP production. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relation between functional genetic variants at the CRP gene locus and levels of serum CRP in RA patients, and whether these variants, alone or in combination, are correlated with DAS28-CRP and change in DAS28-CRP after anti-TNF treatment. Methods: DNA samples from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) were genotyped for rs1205, rs1800947, and rs3091244 by using either TaqMan or the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX system. Estimated haplotypes were constructed for each sample by using the expectation maximization algorithm implemented in the haplo. stats package within the R statistical program. CRP values were log transformed, and the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes of SNPs and baseline CRP, baseline DAS28-CRP, and change in DAS28-CRP were evaluated by using linear regression in STATA v. 10. Results: Baseline CRP measurements were available for 599 samples with 442 also having data 6 months after treatment with an anti-TNF. For these 442 samples, the study had >80% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 0.6 DAS28 Units for an allele frequency of 5%. Estimated haplotype frequencies corresponded with previous frequencies reported in the literature. Overall, no significant association was observed between any of the markers investigated and baseline CRP levels. Further, CRP haplotypes did not correlate with baseline CRP (P = 0.593), baseline DAS28-CRP (P = 0.540), or change in DAS28-CRP after treatment with an anti-TNF over a 6-month period (P = 0.302).

One could compute textural or elasticity features on each component to describe them. In this paper, we propose a fully automated segmentation method, based on statistical properties of the ultrasound backscattered envelope signals, to classify plaque pixels into a fixed number of components. The echogenicity of each plaque was modeled as a mixture of 2 Nakagami distributions leading to 2 main components. The mixture parameters were at first estimated with an Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM). Each class of the partition was then initialized using the Maximum Likelihood segmentation (ML). The optimal partition of the plaque area was then found using a level-set formulation of the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator with a spatial cohesion prior. Nakagami mixture parameters were extracted from those components. Uncompressed B-mode sequences of 8 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic subjects were analyzed for a total of 42 plaque sequences. We found that the Nakagami parameters were able to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic patients with a significant p-value. Further works including elasticity mapping on each component are in progress and might lead to new indexes of vulnerability.

Yet, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) positioning scenarios can create large biases in the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements, and must be addressed with accurate measurement models in order to avoid significant localization errors. In this work, we first develop an efficient, closed-form TDOA error model and analyze its estimation characteristics by calculating the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We subsequently detail how an online Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to find an elegant formalism for the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters. We perform real experiments on a mobile robot equipped with an UWB emitter, and show that the online estimation algorithm leads to excellent localization performance due to its ability to adapt to the varying NLOS path conditions over time.

The program yields a consequent probabilistic definition of the S-N and epsilon-N fields by fulfilling physical and statistical properties related to the extreme value analysis, to be necessarily accomplished by a valid fatigue model. In particular, the compatibility condition between the cumulative distribution functions for stress range and lifetime is ensured, providing a sound and general basis for the model to be applied with versatility to different materials and lifetime problems. An important aspect in the practical design of components, namely the size effect, can be easily handled assuming statistical independence, allowing results originated from different specimen sizes to be simultaneously evaluated. Run-outs can also be considered using the E-M algorithm. The model has been successfully applied to a broad family of materials, such as prestressing wires, reinforcing steels, steel and aluminum alloys, puddle irons, concrete, fiber reinforced polymers, etc.	[Przybilla, Constanze; Collado, Sergio G.; Lopez-Aenlle, Manuel; Fernandez-Canteli, Alfonso] Univ Oviedo, Dept Construct & Mfg Engn, Oviedo, Spain	Przybilla, C (reprint author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Construct & Mfg Engn, Oviedo, Spain.	afc@uniovi.es	AENLLE, MANUEL/K-7113-2013	AENLLE, MANUEL/0000-0002-7538-2758			Castillo E, 2008, MATER LETT, V62, P3639, DOI 10.1016/j.matlet.2008.04.015; Castillo E, 2009, UNIFIED STAT METHODO; Castillo E, 2006, INT J FATIGUE, V28, P1047, DOI 10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2005.11.006; Castillo E, 2001, INT J FRACTURE, V107, P117, DOI 10.1023/A:1007624803955; Fernandez Canteli A., 2011, INT J OF FATIGUE, DOI [10.1016/j.fatigue.2011.02.008, DOI 10.1016/J.FATIGUE.2011.02.008]; Pinto H., 2010, J OF PRESSURE VESSEL, V132	6	0	0	INEGI-INST ENGENHARIA MECANICA E GESTAO INDUSTRIAL	PORTO	CAMPUS DA FEUP, RUA DR ROBERTO FRIAS, 400, PORTO, 4200-465, PORTUGAL		978-972-8826-26-0				2012												2	Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing	Engineering; Materials Science	BFO20	WOS:000320722903109

In the algorithm, each pixel of the difference image is represented by a characteristic quantity constructed from the difference image values considering the space contextual information. EM algorithm is used to achieve the parameter estimation of each class pixels. Bayesian inference is then employed to perform the final change detection results. Experimental results obtained on multi-temporal optical images acquired by Landsat 5 TM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The "soft" labels represent partial knowledge about the possible states at each time step and the "softness" is encoded by belief functions. For the obtained model, called a Partially-Hidden Markov Model (PHMM), the training algorithm is based on the Evidential Expectation-Maximisation (E2M) algorithm. The usual HMM model is recovered when the belief functions are vacuous and the obtained model includes supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning as special cases.

This architecture consists of a set of independent sensor neural nets, one for each sensor, coupled to a fusion net. The neural net of each sensor is trained (from a representative data set of the particular sensor) to map to a hypothesis space output. The decision outputs from the sensor nets are used to train the fusion net to an overall decision. To begin the processing, the 3D point cloud LIDAR data is classified based on a multi-dimensional mean-shift segmentation and classification into clustered objects. Similarly, the multi-band HSI data is spectrally classified by the Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) into a classification map containing pixel classes. For sensor fusion, spatial detections and spectral detections complement each other. They are fused into final detections by a cascaded neural network, which consists of two levels of neural nets. The first layer is the sensor level consisting of two neural nets: spatial neural net and spectral neural net. The second level consists of a single neural net, that is the fusion neural net. The success of the system in utilizing sensor synergism for an enhanced classification is clearly demonstrated by applying this architecture for classifying on November 2010 airborne data collection of LIDAR and HSI over the Gulfport, MS, area.

This paper presents a new efficient MI-based similarity measure which applies Expectation Maximisation for Principal Component Analysis (EMPCA-MI), to afford significantly lower computational complexity, while providing analogous image registration performance with other feature-based MI solutions. Experimental analysis corroborates both the improved robustness and faster runtimes of EMPCA-MI, for different test datasets containing both INU and noise artefacts.

A categorization has been provided based on the data mining function implemented, and the preference criterion selected by the model. The usage of compressed ECG for fast and efficient Tele cardiology application is crucial, as ECG signals are enormously large in size. In this paper, we are demonstrating an innovative technique that performs real-time classification of CVD. Our proposed system initially uses data mining techniques, such as attribute selection (i.e., selects only a few features from the compressed ECG) and expectation maximization (EM) based clustering. These data mining techniques running on a hospital server generate a set of constraints for representing each of the abnormalities. Then, the patient's mobile phone receives these set of constraints and employs a rule-based system that can identify each of abnormal beats in real time.

Transducers have been used to analyze some fundamental issues in bioinformatics. Weighted finite-state transducers have been proposed to pairwise alignments of DNA and protein sequences; as well as to develop kernels for computational biology. Machine learning algorithms for conditional transducers have been implemented and used for DNA sequence analysis. Transducer learning algorithms are based on conditional probability computation. It is calculated by using techniques, such as pair-database creation, normalization (with Maximum-Likelihood normalization) and parameters optimization (with Expectation-Maximization - EM). These techniques are intrinsically costly for computation, even worse when are applied to bioinformatics, because the databases sizes are large. In this work, we describe a parallel implementation of an algorithm to learn conditional transducers using these techniques. The algorithm is oriented to bioinformatics applications, such as alignments, phylogenetic trees, and other genome evolution studies. Indeed, several experiences were developed using the parallel and sequential algorithm on Westgrid (specifically, on the Breeze cluster). As results, we obtain that our parallel algorithm is scalable, because execution times are reduced considerably when the data size parameter is increased. Another experience is developed by changing precision parameter. In this case, we obtain smaller execution times using the parallel algorithm. Finally, number of threads used to execute the parallel algorithm on the Breezy cluster is changed. In this last experience, we obtain as result that speedup is considerably increased when more threads are used; however there is a convergence for number of threads equal to or greater than 16.

An extension to the online Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed the simulated online Expectation Maximization algorithm. Both these algorithms apply to exponential family models, but the simulated version of the algorithm can make use of Monte Carlo simulation to compute the stochastic E-steps while maintaining the convergence properties of the original online EM algorithm. A class of important latent factor models are identified that can be expressed in complete data exponential family form, the algorithm is applied to one of these models Itakura-Saito Non-negative Matrix Factorisation. An additional parameter is introduced into this model and it is conjectured if this is set to a high value the posterior variance of the parameters is reduced and estimation becomes easier. Simulations are provided that support this conjecture, although online estimation for models with even a modest number of components continues to be hampered by the presence of local minima.

These representations reassure the validity of the adapted distribution functions and enable expectation-maximisation training Though gains have been shown in terms of word error rate for rapid speaker adaptation, this approach leads to an increase in decoding cost as the number of likelihood evaluations is amplified. The present paper addresses this issue by providing a coherent framework for systematic probabilistic approaches aimed at reducing the recognition cost and yet yielding equally powerful adapted models. The common denominator of such approaches is the use of probabilistic criteria, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence. However, in the general case, the resulting adapted models have full covariance matrices. In order to overcome this issue, the use of predictive semi-tied transforms to yield diagonal covariances for decoding is investigated in this paper. Experimental results are presented on a large-vocabulary conversational telephone task.

However the algorithm requires a large number of iterations to reach adequate convergence. Due to this, research has been carried out into accelerating the convergence rate of the EM algorithm. In this paper we present an analysis of an EM implementation which uses both OSEM and MGEM, comparing results on a per time basis with both acceleration techniques alone as well as a combination of the two methods. We provide an alternative stopping criterion based on the RMS error of the projections of the current reconstruction and compare the result with an existing variance based approach.

In this study, a pinhole collimator SPECT system sharing a CdTe detector with a CT was designed. Geant4 application for tomographic emission (GATE) v.6 was used for the design simulation. Sensitivity and spatial resolution were measured to evaluate the system characteristics on an ideal condition. A pinhole collimator was designed to obtain high spatial resolution and better sensitivity. The diameter of the collimator was 0.5 mm, and the distance from the center of the field of view (CFOV) was set to 25 mm. The source to detector distance was set to 69 mm. The acquisition time of each projection was 40 seconds, and 60 projections were obtained for tomographic image acquisition. The reconstruction was performed using ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithms. The total system sensitivity was measured in cps/kBq, and the spatial resolution was defined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the point spread function (PSF) of the point source image. Modulation transfer function (MTF) was also measured from the PSF. The spatial resolution of the system calculated from the FWHM of Gaussian fitted PSF curve was 0.48 mm, and the sensitivity of the system measured 0.354 cps/kBq from a Tc-99m point source. A phantom study was performed to verify the dual modality system design. The system will be built as designed, and it can be applied for the pre-clinical imaging system.

They are widely used in many disciplines such as astronomy and genetics. One reason for their popularity is their flexibility and straightforward implementation. The interest increase in multivariate mixtures and their applicability when they are combined with clustering methods motivated us to opt for these methods to analyse financial markets' dynamics. An empirical investigation of a set of interest rate time series is performed using a new methodology. The objective of these analyses is to determine the similarities and specificities among the analysed financial time series. Interest rates are subsequently classified according to their behavior. Such a study has been widely exploited for stock price changes using traditional methods, whereas interest rates have been less considered. The major advantage of cluster analysis is that it gives the study more realism, since it represents a functional relationship between independent and dependent variables. The EM algorithm improves clustering in the sense that it considers a stochastic relationship among variables taking missing data into account.

This method assumes that the observed signal is the superimposition of the multichannel source images generated from multivariate normal distributions. The covariance matrix in each time-frequency slot is estimated by an EM algorithm which treats the source images as the hidden variables. Using the estimated parameters, the source images are separated as the maximum a posteriori estimate. It is worth nothing that this method does not assume the sparseness of sources, which is usually assumed in underdetermined BSS. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of the three attributes of Duong's method, i.e., the source image model with multivariate normal distribution, the observation model without sparseness assumption, and the source separation by multichannel Wiener filter. We newly formulate three BSS methods with the similar source image model and the different observation model assuming sparseness, and we compare them with Duong's method and the conventional binary masking. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of all the three attributes of Duong's method.

We show that the problem of BER estimation is equivalent to estimating the conditional probability density functions (pdf)s of soft receiver outputs. Assuming that the receiver has no analytical model of soft observations, we propose a non parametric Kernel-based pdf estimation technique, with Maximum Likelihood based smoothing parameter computation. We then introduce an iterative Stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm for the estimation of both a priori and a posteriori probabilities of transmitted information bits, and the classification of soft observations according to transmitted bit values. These inputs serve in the iterative Kernel-based estimation procedure of conditional pdfs. We analyze the performance of the proposed unsupervised BER estimator in the framework of a multiuser code division multiple access (CDMA) system with single user detection, and show that attractive performance are achieved compared with conventional Monte Carlo-aided techniques.

User model is useful tools for providing information or services which are suit each user. The authors focused on user-model base on action log and amount of activity. The propose a method scores the action data based on life rhythm or amount of exercise, and weighs the scored data using the weights which is calculated by neural network. The method, finally, clusters the scored data and exercise intensity (METs) using EM algorithm. This paper shows 2 applications. First application uses collected action log and amount of activity from action records which is recorded by participants. The action records include user's action, amount of exercise (METs), location, and transportation. These data are scored base on life rhythm. Second application uses 3D accelerometer with motion recognition system, and pedometer which can be measure METs every 1 min. These data are scored exercise intensity or duration of the exercise. As shown in results of 2 applications, the system finds 3 or more clusters from these data. Each cluster reflects users' exercise data.

This measure can be computed for all parameters in the model, and it communicates the relative loss of efficiency in the estimation of a particular parameter due to missing data. It has been recommended that researchers working with incomplete data sets routinely report this measure, as it is more informative than percent missing data (Bodner, 2008; Schafer, 1997). However, traditional estimates of lambda(j) require the implementation of multiple imputation (MI). Many researchers prefer to fit structural equation models using full information maximum likelihood rather than MI. This article demonstrates how to obtain an estimate of lambda(j) using maximum likelihood estimation routines only and argues that this estimate is superior to the estimate obtained via MI when the number of imputations is small. Interpretation of lambda(j) is also addressed.

We formulate an overlap-save observation model for the multichannel blind problem in the DFT-domain. The modeling of acoustic channel impulse responses as random variables with a first-order Markov property facilitates the ensuing algorithm to cope with time-varying conditions. We then show that the ML-EM learning rules for the multichannel state-space model at hand take the form of a recursive posterior estimator for the channels, followed by an equalization stage for recovering the speech signal subject to an expectation with respect to the estimated channel posterior. Our derivation thus results in an iterative ML algorithm for blind equalization and channel identification (ML-BENCH) which comprises two distinct and coupled subsystems. The dereverberation performance of the proposed system is evaluated by considering spectrograms and instrumental quality measures.

Sensor observations are distorted by additive white Gaussian noise. Prior to data transmission, each sensor quantizes its observation to M levels. The quantized data are then communicated over parallel additive white Gaussian channels to a fusion center for a joint estimation. An iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the unknown parameter is formulated, and its linearized version is adopted for numerical analysis. The numerical examples are provided for the case of the field modeled as a Gaussian bell. The dependence of the integrated mean-square error on the number of quantization levels, the number of sensors in the network and the SNR in observation and transmission channels is analyzed.

In this framework, measurements are usually received in time-bearing space. Prior work on ML-PDA implemented the algorithm in Cartesian measurement space - this involved converting the measurements and their associated covariances to (x, y) coordinates. The assumption was made that Gaussian measurement error distributions in time-bearing space could be reasonably approximated by transformed Gaussian error distributions in Cartesian space. However, for data with large measurement azimuthal uncertainties, this becomes a poor assumption. This work compares results from a previous study that applied ML-PDA in a Cartesian implementation to the Metron 2009 simulated dataset against ML-PDA applied to the same dataset but with the algorithm implemented in time-bearing space. In addition to the Metron dataset, a multistatic Monte Carlo simulator is used to create data with properties similar to that in the Metron dataset to statistically quantify the performance difference of ML-PDA operating in Cartesian measurement space against that of ML-PDA operating in time-bearing space.

They can be estimated using Expectation-Maximization or Kernel Density Estimation. Expectation-Maximization leads to compact models but may be expensive to compute whereas Kernel Density Estimation yields to large models which are cheap to build. In this paper we present new methods to get high-quality models that are both compact and fast to compute. This is accomplished with clustering methods and centroids computation.

Specifically, we consider a blind spectrum sensing problem when the channel gains and the noise variance are unknown for the Secondary User (SU). Under assumption that additional statistical sideinformation is available about unknown parameters, we use a novel Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test, which is optimal under finite number of samples, in order to derive our proposed detector. As it has been shown, this novel GLR test need to obtain the Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) estimation of unknown parameters which it is impossible to obtain them in closed form for our case. Thus, we calculate them based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed detector has good performance even for finite number of samples and also outperforms the classical GLR detector.

It is obtained by defining an intermediate variable to characterize the original image. Both the original image and the additive noise are modeled by multivariate Gaussian process. The blurring process is specified by its point spread function, which is unknown. The original image and the blur are estimated by alternating minimization of the KullbackLeibler divergence between a model family of probability distributions defined using a linear image model and a desired family of probability distributions constrained to be concentrated on the observed data. The intermediate variable is used to introduce regularization in the algorithm. The algorithm presents the advantage to provide closed form expressions for the parameters to be updated and to converge only after few iterations. A simulation example that illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is presented.

While there are many methods for speaker or environment adaptation, far less attention has been focused on methods that compensate for both simultaneously. We recently proposed an algorithm called factored adaptation which jointly estimates speaker and environment transforms in a manner which facilitates the reuse of transforms across sessions. For example, a speaker transform estimated in one environment can later be used even if the speaker's environment changes. In this paper, we introduce a new factored adaptation algorithm that uses a combination of feature-space and model-space transforms. We describe an iterative EM algorithm for transform estimation that also incorporates speaker and environment clustering in cases where the speaker or environment labels are unknown. On a large vocabulary voice search task, the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional adaptation.

First, the problem is formulated by a minimization problem with two sets of variables: the point-to-point correspondence, and the transformation (i.e., rotation, scaling and translation) between two data sets. The conventional way for solving this model is by iterating alternatively the following two steps: 1) having the transformation fixed, solve the correspondence, and 2) having the correspondence fixed, solve the transformation. In our approach, to enhance the robustness, the EM algorithm is introduced to find the correspondence by a probability which covers the relationship of all points, instead of one-to-one closest correspondence in ICP. Meanwhile, Lie group is used to parameterize transformation, i.e., in the iteration, the rotation, scaling and translation are all elements within respective Lie groups, and we use the element of Lie algebra to represent that of Lie group near the identity via exponential map. This forms a unified framework for registration algorithms. Then, transformation is estimated by solving a quadratic programming. The experimental result in 2D shape registration demonstrates that, compared with Lie-ICP, our algorithm is robuster and more accurate.

Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based and hidden Markov model (HMM)-based compensation approaches are combined together and conducted sequentially in the multiple-decoding recognition system. The clean speech is firstly modeled as a GMM in the initial pass, and then modeled as a HMM generated from the initial pass in the following passes, respectively. The environment parameter estimation on these two modeling strategies are formulated both under maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Experimental result shows that a significant improvement is achieved compared to European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) advanced compensation approach, GMM-based feature compensation approach, HMM-based feature compensation approach, and acoustic model compensation approach.

The correspondence and parameter estimation problem can be modeled probabilistically by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and solved by expectation-maximization iterative closest points (EM-ICP) algorithm. In this paper, we propose to exploit the linearity of the principal component analysis (PCA) based SSM, and estimate the parameters for the unseen shape surface under the EM-ICP framework. The symmetric data terms are devised to enforce the mutual consistency between the model reconstruction and the shape surface. The a priori shape information encoded in the SSM is also included as regularization. The estimation method is applied to the shape modeling of the hippocampus using a hippocampal SSM.

J	Shen, PS				Shen, Pao-Sheng			Nonparametric analysis of interval censored and doubly truncated data	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						double truncation; interval censoring; nonparametric maximum-likelihood estimation	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CONSISTENCY; COMPUTATION; NPMLE; MODEL	Doubly truncated data appear in a number of applications, including astronomy and survival analysis. For double-truncated data, the lifetime T is observable only when U <= T <= V, where U and V are the left-truncated and right-truncated time, respectively. In some situations, the lifetime T also suffers interval censoring. Using the EM algorithm of Turnbull [The empirical distribution function with arbitrarily grouped censored and truncated data, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 38 (1976), pp. 290-295] and iterative convex minorant algorithm [P. Groeneboom and J. A.

The Bayesian approach is a statistical technique for estimating reliable predictive distributions by marginalizing model parameters, and its effectiveness in HMM-based speech recognition has been reported. Although the basic idea underlying the Bayesian approach is to treat all parameters as random variables, only one model structure is still selected in the conventional method. Multiple model structures are treated as latent variables in the proposed method and integrated based on the Bayesian framework. Furthermore, we applied deterministic annealing to the training algorithm to estimate appropriate acoustic models. The proposed method effectively utilizes multiple model structures, especially in the early stage of training and this leads to better predictive distributions and improvement of recognition performance.

Therefore, accurately detecting and monitoring these lesions is of importance. Automatic methods for segmenting white matter lesions typically use multimodal MRI data. Furthermore, many methods use a training set to perform a classification task or to determine necessary parameters. In this work, we describe and evaluate an unsupervised segmentation method that is based solely on the histogram of FLAIR images. It approximates the histogram by a mixture of three Gaussians in order to find an appropriate threshold for white matter hyperintensities. We use a context-sensitive Expectation-Maximization method to determine the Gaussian mixture parameters. The segmentation is subsequently corrected for false positives using the knowledge of the location of typical FLAIR artifacts. A preliminary validation with the ground truth on 6 patients revealed a Similarity Index of 0.73 +/- 0.10, indicating that the method is comparable to others in the literature which require multimodal MRI and/or a preliminary training step.

Misbehavior may arise from Byzantine attacks, or may be caused by other factors such as node failure due to hardware or software degradation. We consider binary hypotheses testing where the honest nodes transmit their binary decisions to the fusion center (FC), while the misbehaving nodes transmit. fictitious decisions. The EC must identify the misbehaving nodes in order to remove their deleterious effect. We show that each class of nodes can be identified with its operating point on the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. Maximum likelihood estimation of the nodes' operating points is then formulated and solved as an expectation maximization (EM) problem with the nodes' identities as latent variables. The solution from the EM algorithm is then used to classify the nodes and to solve the distributed hypothesis testing problem. Numerical results compared with those from the reputation-based schemes show a significant improvement in both classification of the nodes and hypothesis testing results. We also discuss an inherent ambiguity in the node classification problem and explain how it can be resolved.

The measurements follow an underdetermined linear model where the regression-coefficient vector is the sum of an unknown approximately sparse signal and a zero-mean white Gaussian noise with an unknown variance. The signal is composed of large- and small-magnitude components identified by binary state variables whose probabilistic dependence structure is described by a hidden Markov tree (HMT). Gaussian priors are assigned to the signal coefficients given their state variables and the Jeffreys' noninformative prior is assigned to the noise variance. Our signal reconstruction scheme is based on an EM iteration that aims at maximizing the posterior distribution of the signal and its state variables given the noise variance. We employ a max-product algorithm to implement the maximization (M) step of our EM iteration. The noise variance is a regularization parameter that controls signal sparsity. We select the noise variance so that the corresponding estimated signal and state variables (obtained upon convergence of the EM iteration) have the largest marginal posterior distribution. Our numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm achieves better reconstruction performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

In this framework, we start by formulating the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) criterion to retrieve each of the desired speech signals from the observed mixtures of sounds and outline the importance of multi-speaker activity detection. The latter is modeled by introducing a latent variable whose posterior probability is computed via expectation maximization (EM) combining both the spatial and spectral cues of the multichannel speech observations. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting joint blind source separation (BSS) and noise reduction solution performs remarkably well in reverberant and noisy environments.

This approach can be viewed as an extension of expectation-maximization (EM)-based source separation to DMAs. To achieve distributed processing, we assume the conditional independence (with respect to sources' activities) of the normalized recordings of different nodes. By doing so, only the posterior probabilities of sources' activities need to be shared between nodes. Consequently, the EM algorithm is formulated such that at the expectation step, local posterior probabilities are estimated locally and shared between nodes. In the maximization step, every node fuses the received probabilities via either product or sum rules and estimates its local parameters. We show that, even if we make binary decisions (presence/absence of speech) during EM iterations instead of transmitting continuous posterior probability values, we can achieve separation without causing significant speech distortion.

In the proposed approach, the signal's pitch and spectral envelope are modeled separately. The model combines parametric filters enforcing an harmonic structure in the representation, with Gaussian modeling for representing the spectral envelope. The estimation of the signal's model is cast as an inverse problem efficiently solved via a maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm. The relation of the proposed framework with common non-negative factorization methods is also discussed. The algorithm is evaluated with both real and synthetic instruments mixtures, and comparisons with recently proposed techniques are presented.

As a consequence, the afferent genome annotation has become the bottleneck in our understanding of genes and their functions. Traditionally, data from biological domains have been analyzed using supervised learning techniques. However, given the large amounts of unlabeled genomics data available, together with small amounts of labeled data, the use of semi-supervised learning algorithms is desirable. Our purpose is to study the applicability of semi-supervised learning frameworks to DNA prediction problems, with focus on alternative splicing, a natural biological process that contributes to protein diversity. More specifically, we address the problem of predicting alternatively spliced exons. To utilize the unlabeled data, we train classifiers via the Expectation Maximization method and variants of this method. The experiments conducted show an increase in the quality of the prediction models when unlabeled data is used in the training phase, as compared to supervised prediction models which do not make use of the unlabeled data.

One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time. Recent proposals to address this issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent structure of the problem. As a principled and general temporal formulation, we propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization. Our proposal builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization, a Bayesian model with Gaussian priors. We utilize results in state tracking, i.e. the Kalman filter, to provide accurate recommendations in the presence of both process and measurement noise. We show how system parameters can be learned via expectation-maximization and provide comparisons to current published techniques.

The wavelet-domain HMT model is built and the parameters of HMT model are estimated by EM algorithm. Experimental results show that the method can effectively denoise fabric images and is a better method for fabric images than the classical image denoising methods. It also increases PNSR and perfectly preserves the shapes of fabric texture while denoising.

In our previous work, we proposed factored MLLR (FMLLR) where MLLR parameter is defined as a function of a control parameter vector. We presented a method to train the FMLLR parameters based on a general framework of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. To show the effectiveness, we applied the FMLLR to adapt the spectral envelope feature of the reading-style speech to those of the singing voice. In this paper, we apply the FMLLR to HMM-based expressive speech synthesis task and compare its performance with conventional approaches. In a series of experimental result, the FMLLR shows better performance than conventional methods.

The system helps pathologists to distinguish a tumor with cell proliferation from normal tumors. The developed CAD system implements a hybrid segmentation method to identify and extract the morphological features that are used by pathologists for determining cellularity status of tumor. Adaptive Mean Shift (AMS) clustering as a non-parametric technique is integrated with Color Template Matching (CTM) to construct segmentation approach. We used Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering as a parametric technique for the sake of comparison with our proposed approach. The output of our proposed system and EM are validated by two pathologists as ground truth. The result of our developed system is quite close to the decision of pathologists, and it significantly outperforms EM in terms of accuracy.

However, this task is very time-consuming and suffers from inter-and intraobserver variability. In the present study, a method was proposed for automated identification of the heart wall region in ultrasonic data throughout an entire cardiac cycle. The heart wall region at the optimal frame of interest in the cardiac phase was identified by applying the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to extracted features, and heart wall regions in the following frames were identified by tracking each point, which was classified in the optimal (initial) frame as the heart wall region, using the phased tracking method. The results showed that the proposed method was feasible in automated identification of the heart wall in the longitudinal axis view.

One of most popular approaches for this problem is linear regression based on the EM algorithm. When we consider to apply this approach to block-based image inpainting problems, we have additional information, that is, a target lost pixel could be included in multiple blocks, which implies that we have multiple candidates of estimates for the pixel. In such cases, we have to choose a good estimate among the multiple candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel image inpainting method incorporating optimal block selection in terms of the expected squared errors among multiple candidates of the estimate for the target pixel. Results of numerical examples are also shown to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.

Our method takes a simple form that augments the histogram of local image patch features with a set of circular means and variances. We show that such augmentation is a natural result of modeling the distribution of local image patch features by a mixture of circular normal distributions learned through the expectation maximization algorithm. We show that the histogram is a degenerate case of this modeling. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed AH-SIFT descriptor outperforms the original SIFT descriptor on the matching of real-world images that undergo various levels of geometric and photometric transformations, including blurring, zoom/rotation, lighting changes, and viewpoint changes.

However, in many applications, the distribution of the data has a non-Gaussian and non-symmetric form. This study presents a new non-symmetric mixture model for image segmentation. The advantage of our method is that it is simple, easy to implement and intuitively appealing. In this paper, each label is modeled with multiple D-dimensional Student's-t distribution, which is heavily tailed and more robust than Gaussian distribution. Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to estimate model parameters and to maximize the lower bound on the data log-likelihood from observations. Numerical experiments on various data types are conducted. The performance of the proposed model is compared to other mixture models, demonstrating the robustness, accuracy and effectiveness of our method.	[Thanh Minh Nguyen; Wu, Q. M.

Segmentation of Digital Breast Tomograms using Clustering Techniques	2012 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)	DEC 07-09, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	IEEE		Digital Breast Tomosynthesis; Microcalcification; Segmentation; Clustering techniques; Fuzzy C Means; Expectation Maximization	TOMOSYNTHESIS; MAMMOGRAPHY	In current scenario Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Recently, mammography is used as the most convenient examination technique for the detection of early signs of breast cancer. Clustered Microcalcification (MC) in mammograms plays a vital role in indication for early detection of breast cancer. The conventional 2D mammography has a severe limitation of decrease in contrast of structures due to the superimposition of overlying tissue and this leads to false positives and false negatives. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), a 3D mammographic technique, is a new modality for breast imaging that overcomes the limitation of planar mammography. As breast is composed of soft tissues, segmentation of a cancerous and a non cancerous tissue is considered as the most important and significant step in image processing of breast tomograms. In this work, we consider segmentation of tomograms obtained from Filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction of raw images. Fully automated, robust and efficient clustering methods, Fuzzy C Means and Expectation Maximization, are used in our work to segment the microcalcifications from the other non cancerous anatomical structures of the breast such as connective tissue, glandular tissue, contractile tissue, skin and chest muscle. Our work resulted in greater sensitivity value for EM than FCM. The algorithm is extended to sequence of tomograms for segmentation of the microcalcification content in each of the slices. The segmentation done will also lead to effective and accurate feature extraction and classification of malignant and benign microcalcifications.

An Expectation-Maximization Algorithm based Kalman Smoother Approach for Single-Trial Estimation of Event-related Potentials	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE		Event-related potentials; Kalman smoother; expectation-maximization algorithm	VARIABILITY	This paper applies an expectation-maximization (EM) based Kalman smoother (KS) approach for single-trial event-related potential (ERP) estimation. Existing studies assume a Markov diffusion process for the dynamics of ERP parameters which is recursively estimated by optimal filtering approaches such as Kalman filter (KF). However, these studies only consider estimation of ERP state parameters while the model parameters are pre-specified using manual tuning, which is time-consuming for practical usage besides giving suboptimal estimates. We extend the KF approach by adding EM based maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters to obtain more accurate ERP estimates automatically. We also introduce different model variants by allowing flexibility in the covariance structure of model noises. Optimal model selection is performed based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The method is applied to estimation of chirp-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) for detection of wave V critical for assessment of hearing loss. Results shows that use of more complex covariances are better estimating inter-trial variability.	[Ting, Chee-Ming; Samdin, S.

This particular study addresses this challenge by proposing a compact framework that employs an on-line clustering approach for constructing appropriate basis functions. Also, it performs a state-action trajectory analysis to gain valuable affinity information among clusters and estimate their transition dynamics. Value function approximation is used for policy evaluation in a least-squares temporal difference framework.

Interpolation has been popularly used in both domains when the channel is sampled with pilot subcarriers. The classical approach is to use the Least Square (LS) estimations to predict the channel for the pilot locations and then use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation (MMSEE) schemes to improve these initial estimations and interpolate for deriving a complete characterization of the channel. In this paper, in comb-type pilot arrangement, we propose to use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to complement the LS scheme and propose two different approaches: (i) Using a sliding window approach based on EM estimators to interpolate, (ii) Using EM estimations on pilots instead of LS to enhance the MLE and MMSEE performance. Additionally, the necessary condition for EM to work properly is shown in the paper.

In the preprocessing step, the position of the initial model is automatically estimated using representative patterns. The Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) theory are utilized in the deformation strategy to optimally fit the initial model on the prostate boundaries. For the purpose of real time therapy, we propose a less computational complex EM approach for obtaining the probability distribution parameters. We also propose a new internal force energy that uses 2D geometric transformations for preventing the model fault deformation. Successful experimental results with the average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) value 93.9% validate the algorithm.

In point of fact, the returns of financial time series are rather distributed leptokurtic than normally. Moreover, the empirical distributions are often skewed. In these cases, the assumption of normal distribution results in over- or underestimation of VaR especially when the quantiles are very high/low. Therefore it is necessary to put emphasis on respecting the leptokurtic and skewed return distribution. In this paper, we interpret the one out of the method how to estimate VaR with respect to the empirical distributions. We describe the analytical solution of VaR under mixture and Markov-Switching normal distribution condition and we compare the estimates according to both approaches. We also present the estimation method of distribution parameters. Thus, we briefly describe and derive the maximum likelihood method based on the iterative EM-algorithm. Using the four selected European market portfolios (DAX, FTSE 100, PX and ATX) we estimate the parametric and Monte-Carlo VaR and we give evidence that the estimates are very inaccurate when the normal distribution is assumed.

Such problem arises in experimental high energy physics when one is trying to discover deviations from known Standard Model physics. We solve the problem by first fitting a mixture of Gaussians to a labeled background sample. We then fit a mixture of this background model and a number of additional Gaussians to an unlabeled sample containing both background and anomalies. This way we not only detect but also perform pattern recognition of anomalies. Such mixture model allows us to perform classification of anomalies vs. background, estimate the proportion of anomalies in the sample and study the statistical significance of the anomalous contribution. We first verify the performance of the method using artificial data and then demonstrate its real-life applicability using a data set related to the search of the Higgs boson at the Tevatron collider.

Nevertheless, although it has been improved by using several algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM); it is still susceptible to sudden changes in light conditions effects. In this paper, we analyze the MOG approach in order to explore its strengths and weaknesses in order to create a new robust algorithm. Our proposal consists on a new algorithm based on a dynamic selection of convergence ratio, which use the expected proportion between movement and fixed zones of scene. This proportion is used as an extra criterion to detect the maximum direction of Entropy in EM algorithm. The algorithm suits best convergence ration due to global changes in scene. Finally, in an experimental model, our approach is tested in outdoors and indoors scenarios, where luminance conditions has changed. Results show the adaptability of our approach to several dynamic scenarios.

Clustering aims to group related records by measuring similarities among the attribute. Major phase of clustering techniques is similarity measurement and it is based on different factors and parameters. The improved Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based TCLUST (T-Clustering) algorithm is EM principle (Expectation Maximization) based algorithm, intended to search for approximate solutions. The EM algorithm is the efficient method of obtaining a solution to the mixture likelihood problem. Genes with a common function are often hypothesized to have correlated expression levels across different conditions. NMF clustering is introduced to find a small number of Meta genes, each defined as a positive linear combination of the genes in the expression data. The proposed clustering algorithm is applied to a genome scale gene expression dataset to enrichment analysis and to discover highly significant biological clusters.

We consider a Binary Offset Carrier shaping function as used in satellite positioning, which is a time-limited pulse with a large excess bandwidth, and a Data Aided synchronization scenario, where we have a constant time-delay and a Brownian phase evolution with a linear drift. The proposed study is relative to the use of an oversampled signal model after matched filtering, leading to a colored reception noise and a non-stationary power signal. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we derive the Hybrid Cramer-Rao Bound for the joint phase/Doppler estimation problem. Then, we propose a method for the joint time-delay/carrier synchronization, which couples an Extended Kalman Filter and an Expectation-Maximization type algorithm. Our numerical results show the potential gain of using the oversampled signal for carrier synchronization, obtaining better performances than using a classical synchronizer, and good time-delay estimation.

In many situations this assumption is not reasonable because individuals are naturally or artificially grouped, and within groups survival times may be associated. Frailty models are commonly employed to model dependent event times. In this article, the additive inverse Gaussian frailty model is studied. This model assumes that within each group individual frailties are correlated. Each frailty is the sum of two parts, a part shared by all group members and an individual specific part, and both parts follow the inverse Gaussian distribution. The EM algorithm is used to estimate frailty parameters and risk coefficients. Variances of these estimates are also computed. Testing procedures are discussed to discriminate between submodels.

There is no generally accepted method for parameters initialization to prevent the algorithm being trapped in one of the local maxima of the likelihood function. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we proposed a greedy EM algorithm based on a kurtosis and skewness criterion. Specifically, we start with a single component and add one component step by step under the framework of EM algorithm in order to decrease the value of the kurtosis and skewness measure which provides an efficient index to show how well the Gaussian mixture model fits the sample data. In such a way, the number of components can be selected adaptively during the EM learning and the learning parameters can possibly escape from local maxima.

However, because of iris occlusion such as eyelid and eyelashes, high accuracy of iris recognition system is challenged. In this paper, we firstly improve our previous work on eyelashes localization algorithm based on Expectation Maximization (EM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Then, we propose a novel and robust approach to search the eyelid via hybrid edge detection and Hough transform, which reduces the noise fitting points and selects the eyelid fitting area automatically. Experimental results reveal our proposal can detect eyelid and eyelashes accurately and effectively.

DCM for ERP is a recently developed advanced method for studying neuronal effective connectivity and making inference about the brain functions. DCM utilizes an iterative procedure, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, to find the optimal parameters given a set of observed events (data) and the underlying probability model, such that the likelihood function is maximized. As the EM algorithm is computationally demanding, time consuming and largely data dependent, we propose a parallel computing scheme using GPUs to achieve a fast estimation of neural effective connectivity in DCM. The computational loading of EM was partitioned and dynamically distributed to either the threads or blocks according to the DCM model complex (i.e. the number of parameters to be estimated). The performance of this dynamic loading arrangement in terms of execution time and accuracy loss were evaluated using synthetic data.

The paper proposed a method to semi-automatically segment the left ventricle (LV) boundaries from a stack of cine MRI and build a LV mesh. The different intensities in the MRI are modeled with the mixture of Gaussian method. The thresholds between them are semi-automatically determined by K-means initialization and the expectation maximization (EM) method. The spatial constrain is added into the model with active contour models, which fit explicit contours on the boundary of the area of interest. We propose a marching cube alike initialization method of the active contour models. A 3D mesh is built from a stack of contours and smoothed afterwards. Stroke volume, myocardium mass and ejection function can be estimated from the LV boundary mesh and the endocardium mesh.

Dense divisions are defined to discriminate target classes of possibly subtle distinction. The statistical similarity and uncertainty of overlapping cluster pairs are evaluated with Wishart based likelihood ratio and at a desired level of false classification the dense set of clusters is hierarchically pruned. Wishart based classification is then applied to the whole imagery, accomplishing a physical-based unsupervised classification algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated using an AIRSAR dataset of San Francisco to evaluate its capability in characterizing complex terrains. As an optional step, the K-Means or Expectation-Maximization iteration is performed to further adapt the cluster centers.

In Bayes estimation, it is well known that MCMC is one of the most useful and practical methods. The concrete MCMC algorithm for CPHs was developed by using Markov jump processes by Bladt et al. (2003). However, the existing MCMC algorithm spends much computation time in some cases. In this paper, we propose a new sampling algorithm which is based on uniformization technique and backward likelihood computation. The proposed algorithm is easier to implement and is more efficient in terms of computation time than the existing method.

However, due to representing shape variations with a single deterministic PCA (Principal Component Analysis) model, canonical CLMs may suffer inherent drawbacks when applied to faces with large non-rigid shape variations. To solve the problem, this paper presents a probabilistic constrained local model (PCLM) via introducing probabilistic concepts into the canonical CLM framework. The PCLM consists of an ensemble of patch experts estimating likelihood of multiple candidate positions for each facial landmark, and a shape prior model based on mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA). The shape and pose parameters of the model are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm within a maximum-likelihood framework. Experimental results prove that the proposed PCLM is capable of dealing with face images of large non-rigid shape variations and noises.

Compared to the adaptive RPEM algorithm in Cheung, 2004 and 2005, this batch RPEM need not assign the learning rate analogous to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), but still preserves the capability of automatic model selection. Further, the convergence speed of this batch RPEM is faster than the EM and the adaptive RPEM in general. The experiments show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm on the synthetic data and color image segmentation.

Typical algorithms for topic modeling include probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Despite their different inspirations, both approaches are instances of generative model, whereas the discriminative structure of the documents is ignored. In this paper, we propose locally discriminative topic model (LDTM), a novel topic modeling approach which considers both generative and discriminative structures of the data space. Different from PLSA and LDA in which the topic distribution of a document is dependent on all the other documents, LDTM takes a local perspective that the topic distribution of each document is strongly dependent on its neighbors. By modeling the local relationships of documents within each neighborhood via a local linear model, we learn topic distributions that vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold, and can better capture the discriminative structure in the data.

In this article, we develop new multivariate models with patterned means and covariance matrices to deal with special structures of the post-mortem brain tissue data collected in the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates via the method of scoring for these new structured models. One-iteration estimators from a consistent starting point are used to derive the asymptotic distributions. The model fitting algorithms, as well as the asymptotic distributions, are examined using simulated data, and are applied to data from post-mortem tissue studies in schizophrenia.

Blind encoder identification has drawn immense research interest lately. In this paper, we make the first-ever attempt to tackle the blind low-density parity-check (LDPC) encoder identification for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals. We propose a novel blind identification system which consists of three components, namely EM (expectation-maximization) estimator for signal amplitude and noise variance, LLR (log-likelihood ratio) estimator for syndrome a posteriori probabilities, and maximum average LLR detector. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that our proposed new blind LDPC encoder identification scheme is very promising even for harsh channel environments with low signal-to-noise ratios.

A multichannel fusion approach based on coupled hidden Markov models for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						coupled hidden Markov model; multichannel fusion; fault diagnosis; rolling element bearing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ROTATING MACHINERY; EM ALGORITHM; WAVELET; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PROGNOSTICS	This paper presents a novel multichannel fusion approach based on coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs) for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis. Different from a hidden Markov model (HMM), a CHMM contains multiple state sequences and observation sequences, and hence has powerful potential for multichannel fusion. In this study, a two-chain CHMM is employed to integrate the two-channel vibration signals collected from bearings, i.e. the horizontal and vertical vibration signals. Efficient probabilistic inference and parameter estimation algorithms are developed for the model. An experiment was carried out to validate the proposed approach. Normalized wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet energy entropy are extracted as features for classification respectively. Then, the results of the proposed approach are compared with those of the currently used approach based on HMMs and one-channel signals. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective to improve the classification rate.	[Xiao, W. B.; Chen, J.; Dong, G. M.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, Z.

We develop the learning algorithm for the parameter estimates of SIR. Furthermore, we construct an extended SIR model (SIR+) by taking the social interaction features into account to improve the performance of top-A item recommendation. The experiments on a real dataset from Sina Weibo, one of the most popular social network sites (SNS) in China, demonstrate that both SIR and SIR+ outperform the traditional collaborative filtering methods, and SIR+ achieves a better performance than SIR.

The proposed estimator is realized by taking the following procedures: first, a simplified objective function is considered to guarantee the design simplicity of the H-inf channel estimator. Second, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to make the problem less complex. Third, an equivalent signal model (ESM) is utilized to relieve the non-Gaussian noise (NGN) features of practical channels, which are due to various natural or man-made impulsive sources. According to the simulation results, it is shown that the H-inf estimator has almost the same mean square error (MSE) performance as an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. Moreover, during implementing H-inf estimator via EM process, only few iterations are needed. Compared to traditional signal models (TSM), ESM can improve the robustness of the estimator substantially, especially in case of NGN channels.

The model provides an alternative approach to deal with the non-Gaussian behavior of the latent variables, directly assuming they are based on Laplace prior. This distribution encourages the model to set many latent variables to zero. An expectation-maximization algorithm is derived to train model with a variational approximation to a range of heavy-tailed distributions whose limit is the Laplace. The variational approximation is also used to compute of likelihood ratio. This approach performed well on the tel-tel extended condition of the NIST 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation, and is competitive compared to the Gaussian Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis, in terms of normalized Decision Cost Function and Equal Error Rate.

However, the correlation property, which depends on the Doppler spread, is hard to be extracted from corrupted channel responses within a short channel estimation interval. In this work, based on an approximate channel model via the Taylor expansion, we propose a joint channel and Doppler spread estimation scheme over time-varying flat-fading channels. It employs the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively attain the maximum-likelihood (ML) channel and Doppler spread estimates. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves accurate performance of both channel estimation and Doppler spread estimation within a short estimation interval.

Considering the failure of wavelet in representing the geometry of image edges and contours, we firstly use Contourlet to provide an efficient and flexible multiscale, multidirectional and anisotropy representation of remote sensing images, and then use CHMT model to describe the statistics of Contourlet coefficients, by taking the dependencies across scales, locations and directions into account. Because CHMT can span several adjacent directional subbands in the finer scales, which has similar statistical characteristic to scale, CHMT model can give more accurate description of images and has lower computational complexity than wavelet hidden Markov Tree (WHMT). Training the Contourlet coefficients of registered multisource images using Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm, one can obtain the model parameters which is used to update the Contourlet coefficients. Low-frequency subbands are fused by the magnitude maximum rule. For the fusion of high-frequency directional subband, a PCNN is constructed based on the phenomena of synchronous pulse bursts in the animal visual cortexes, and the linking strength of each neuron in PCNN is determined by a new clarity-saliency measure of the subband images. New fire mapping images are obtained for each high-frequency subband taking part in the fusion. Some experiments are taken on some remote sensing images came from the USA Airborne Multisensor Pod System (AMPS) program, and the results show the superiorities of our proposed method to WHMT and Contourlets, both in subjective evaluation, implementation speed and some numerical guidelines.

Simultaneous Cortical Surface Labeling and Sulcal Curve Extraction	MEDICAL IMAGING 2012: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 06-09, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Agilent Technol, Diamond SA, DQE Instruments Inc, eMagin, Isuzu Glass Co Ltd, Medtron Inc, Ocean Thin Films Inc		Automatic gyral labeling; sulcal curve extraction; cortical surface; statistical shape model; point set registration	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; IMAGES; MODELS	Automatic labeling of the gyri and sulci on the cortical surface is important for studying cortical morphology and brain functions within populations. A method to simultaneously label gyral regions and extract sulcal curves is proposed. Assuming that the gyral regions parcellate the whole cortical surface into contiguous regions with certain fixed topology, the proposed method labels the subject cortical surface by deformably registering a network of curves that form the boundary of gyral regions to the subject cortical surface. In the registration process, the curves are encouraged to follow the fine details of the sulcal geometry and to observe the shape statistics learned from training data. Using the framework of probabilistic point set registration methods, the proposed algorithm finds the sulcal curve network that maximizes the posterior probability by Expectation-Maximization (EM). The automatic labeling method was evaluated on 15 cortical surfaces using a leave-one-out strategy. Quantitative error analysis is carried out on both labeled regions and major sulcal curves.

The approach is based on applying time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model. This work is virtually unexplored in offshore engineering field. In the literatures, a number of works have shown that RAO are discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Here, we outline a practical algorithm for TVAR model which uses expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based Kalman smoother to generate RAOs of surge, heave and pitch motions. The method is then applied to sampled discrete wave as excitation input and motion responses of offshore structures as outputs, generated from simulated field measurements. The proposed approach outlined here has shown tremendous potential in the application of RAO estimation. The results indicate that TVAR model bring enhanced accuracy, less noisy in obtaining RAOs estimates over other Fourier based methods. TVAR model also allows for the creation of time-varying RAOs.

It is desirable to incorporate the hierarchical structure of the predictor variables into generalized linear models for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. We propose two prior distributions: hierarchical Cauchy and double-exponential distributions, on coefficients in generalized linear models. The hierarchical priors include both variable-specific and group-specific tuning parameters, thereby not only adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients and different groups but also providing a way to pool the information within groups. We fit generalized linear models with the proposed hierarchical priors by incorporating flexible expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms into the standard iteratively weighted least squares as implemented in the general statistical package R. The methods are illustrated with data from an experiment to identify genetic polymorphisms for survival of mice following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The performance of the proposed procedures is further assessed via simulation studies. The methods are implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).

Despite the popularity of EM algorithms, it is challenging to efficiently implement these algorithms in a distributed environment. In particular, many EM algorithms that frequently update the parameters have been shown to be much more efficient than their concurrent counterparts. Accordingly, we propose two approaches to parallelize such EM algorithms in a distributed environment so as to scale to massive data sets. We prove that both approaches maintain the convergence properties of the EM algorithms. Based on the approaches, we design and implement a distributed framework, FreEM, to support the implementation of frequent updates for the EM algorithms. We show its efficiency through three well-known EM applications: k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering and parameter estimation for the Gaussian Mixture model. We evaluate our framework on both a local cluster of machines and the Amazon EC2 cloud. Our evaluation shows that the EM algorithms with frequent updates implemented on FreEM can run much faster than those implementations with traditional concurrent updates.

A Parameter Estimation Algorithm for Propagation Channels based on Two-Layer Evidence Framework	2012 IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM (APSURSI)	IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation	JUL 08-14, 2012	Chicago, IL	Inst Electr Electron Engineers, IEEE Antennas & Propaga Soc		Propagation channel; parameter estimation; stochastic channel modeling and evidence framework		In this contribution, a new algorithm derived based on a two-layer evidence framework is applied to estimating parameters in the generic stochastic channel models from measurement data. Different from conventional high-resolution parameter estimation algorithms, e. g. the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE), the method proposed is applicable to extracting both the parameters of multiple components in individual realizations of channel impulse responses and the statistical parameters of the wide-sense-stationary channel. Furthermore, the proposed two-layer evidence framework can be readily generalized to accommodate appropriate channel features of interest as certain prior information. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when being used to estimate the cumulative distribution function of delay spreads of propagation channels.

The proposed method applies in cases where directional multi-antenna arrays are used for channel measurements. In the method, the direction estimation range is determined by specifying appropriate values for the dynamic range of array gain (DRAG) of directional arrays. A simple rationale is provided for calculating the lower-bound of DRAG. Both simulation and measurement results demonstrate that when the DRAG is properly selected, the estimation errors retains at an acceptable level and the spurious paths, i.e. the estimated path without its counterpart in reality, appear with low possibilities.

Secondly, it will open the door to incorporating the well-founded F-0 contour model into various statistical speech processing problems. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of our method in terms of an Fujisaki-model parameter estimation accuracy using real speech data.

This study sought to propose a new method of predicting the growth of human neurons using 1 907 sets of data in human brain pyramidal neurons obtained from the website of NeuroMorpho.Org. First, we analyzed neurons in a morphology field and used an expectation-maximization algorithm to specify the neurons into six clusters. Second, naive Bayes classifier was used to verify the accuracy of the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiment results proved that the cluster groups here were efficient and feasible. Finally, a new method to rank the six expectation-maximization algorithm clustered classes was used in predicting the growth of human pyramidal neurons.

Term extraction influences many respects of ontology learning as it's the basis of ontology learning hierarchical structure. This paper mines topics of the corpus based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which uses Variational Inference and Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm to estimate model parameters. With the help of irrelevant vocabulary, the paper provides better experimental results which show that the distribution of topics on terms reveals latent semantic features of the corpus and relevance among words.

Intermediate synthetic images from PSF-engineered COSM in the presence of aberrations were computed and then processed using a depth-variant expectation maximization algorithm. The restored images were compared to images simulated for traditional COSM. Results show that PSF-engineered COSM achieves better image restoration than conventional COSM and has the potential to improve imaging in the presence of depth-induced aberrations.

In a previous study, an image estimation method based on a principle component analysis (PCA) model for the representation of the depth varying point spread function (DV-PSF) was presented and demonstrated with noiseless simulations(1). In this study, the performance of the PCA-based DV expectation maximization algorithm (PCA-DVEM) was further evaluated with noisy simulations. Different levels of Poisson noise were used in simulated forward images of a synthetic object computed using theoretically-determined DV-PSFs approximated by the PCA approach. The noise influence on the reconstructed images obtained with PCA-DVEM was evaluated. We found that without regularization, the algorithm performs well when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 14 dB or higher. The relationship of the number of PCA components, B, to the image reconstruction performance was also investigated on both noiseless and noisy simulated data. In both cases, we found that the number of PCA components has limited effect on the image reconstruction performance for B > 1. To reduce computational complexity while maintaining image estimation performance, B = 2 is suggested for processing experimental data.

This paper deals with estimating Value at Risk and conditional Value at Risk under the assumption of mixture normal distribution. We apply mixture normal distribution by assuming that the economy is in various phases of the business cycle. We determinate the both risk measures for market risk, daily returns of popular indices (DAX, CAC, Nikkei and FTSE) over ten years. In the first part, we describe methodology VaR and CVaR and techniques of estimating parameters of probability distributions are presented, i.e. general method of moments and maximum likelihood. Finally, we compare all estimates with each other.

Tomography reconstruction algorithm is a key component of PET, most PET use statistical iterative reconstruction algorithms from sinograms currently. However tomography reconstruction from list-mode data possesses many unique advantages, in recent years it has been paid great attention and is in the process of rapid development and improvement. In this paper, using experimental data of small animal PET scanner Eplus-166, exploiting S-LMEM algorithm and orthogonal distance-based ray-tracer, we eventually achieve list-mode tomography reconstruction. The results demonstrate that image resolution recovery achieves the inherent properties of the scanner and on-the-fly ray-tracing methods for real-time system response matrix (SRM) calculation are feasible for dynamic reconstruction. Calculating precision of SRM is a key to resolution recovery. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a latent class modeling approach for joint analysis of high-dimensional semicontinuous biomarker data and a binary disease outcome. To model the relationship between complex biomarker expression patterns and disease risk, we use latent risk classes to link the 2 modeling components. We characterize complex biomarker-specific differences through biomarker-specific random effects, so that different biomarkers can have different baseline (low-risk) values as well as different between-class differences. The proposed approach also accommodates data features that are common in environmental toxicology and other biomarker exposure data, including a large number of biomarkers, numerous zero values, and complex mean-variance relationship in the biomarkers levels. A Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. Both the MCEM algorithm and model selection procedures are shown to work well in simulations and applications. In applying the proposed approach to an epidemiological study that examined the relationship between environmental polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and the risk of endometriosis, we identified a highly significant overall effect of PCB concentrations on the risk of endometriosis.

However, the clutter background and variations, which are intrinsic in scene images, make the natural scene character recognition task rather complicated. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a novel approach for character recognition task in natural scene images. In the method, character classes are described by groups of local features using a probabilistic model. Structures of characters are represented by mutual positions of local features. For model learning, parameter estimating is done through expectation-maximization in a weak-supervised manner. Experiment results over datasets which includes both synthetic and authentic data demonstrate the validity of the approach.

This paper aims at non-data-aided (NDA) distorted constellation (DC) estimation and demodulation to deal with PA nonlinearity. An estimation algorithm of expectation-maximization (EM) is proposed and the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) are calculated, then the estimated DC is used as reference for demodulation. Simulation results indicate that the means of the estimation results are unbiased and the mean square errors (MSEs) reach the CRLBs under easy requirements on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and output power back-off (OBO). Additionally, with PA nonlinearity, the BER performance of the presented DC demodulation is close to that of the ideal PA case, and much superior to that of the traditional standard constellation (SC) demodulation.

To estimate channel coefficient, the noise covariance is required in traditional channel estimations. On the other hand, we also need channel coefficient to estimate the noise covariance. Therefore, traditional channel estimators can not be utilized when noise correlation is unknown. In this paper, we propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based iterative channel estimator to solve this problem. Moreover, we analyze the modified Cramer-Rao bound to show the performance of the proposed channel estimation. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator can work well in Amplify-and-Forward relay networks with unknown noise correlation.

However, the high-density contrast agents tend to introduce the scatter effect on neighboring soft tissues and elevate their observed CT attenuation values toward that of the tagged materials (TMs), which may result in an excessive electronic colon cleansing (ECC) where pseudo-enhanced soft tissues are incorrectly identified as TMs. To address this issue, we integrated a scale-based scatter correction as a preprocessing procedure into our previous ECC pipeline based on the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) partial volume segmentation. The newly proposed ECC scheme takes into account both scatter effect and partial volume effect that commonly appear in CTC images. We evaluated the new method with 10 patient CTC studies and found improved performance. Our results suggest that the proposed strategy is effective with potentially significant benefits for both clinical CTC examinations and automatic computer-aided detection (CAD) of colon polyps.

The proposed algorithm leverages on prior knowledge of the statistical distributions of signal clusters and rays within a cluster, and uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to resolve the high dimensional optimization problem into iteratively solving the multiple 3-dimensional optimizations. The successive interference cancellation (SIC) method is applied in the initialization stage to obtain the initial guess to the EM algorithm. Simulations are carried out in two typical indoor scenarios following the extended SV model. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform the maximum likelihood (ML) based algorithm for SIMO systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel deformable cosegmentation (D-C) algorithm to solve the brain MR image segmentation problem by cosegmenting the image and a co-registered atlas. In this manner, the prior heuristic information about brain anatomy that is embedded in the atlas can be transformed into the constraints that control the segmentation of brain MR images. Based on the multiphase Chan-Vese model, the proposed D-C algorithm is implemented using level set techniques. Then, it is compared to the protocol algorithm and the state-of-the-art GA-EM algorithm in T1-weighted brain MR images corrupted by different levels of Gaussian noise and intensity non-uniformity. Our results show that the proposed D-C algorithm can differentiate major brain structures more accuratly and produce more robust segmentation of brain MR images.

Among them, a novel immune-inspired evolutionary method, clonal selection algorithm (CSA) has proven itself in a variety of real applications with better performance than several other evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we incorporate the CSA into the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based image segmentation process, and thus propose the CSA-GMM algorithm for delineating gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in brain MR images. In this algorithm, we assume that brain voxel values to be modeled by the GMM, whose parameters are then estimated by using the CSA. Each brain voxel is then categorized by applying the voxel value and statistical parameters to the Bayes classifier. In order to improve segmentation performance by employing the spatial information, we also construct the probabilistic brain atlas for each image, and incorporate the anatomical priors embedded in the atlas into the segmentation process. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in simulated brain MR images and been compared to the GA-EM algorithm and the segmentation routines used in the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) package and FMRIB Software library (FSL) in 18 clinical T1-weighted brain MR images. Our results show that the proposed CSA-GMM algorithm can achieve better segmentation accuracy on average.

However, the efficiency of classical EM algorithm is insufficiently good and the robustness of the model is not verified. Besides, it is inconvenient for users to manually choose the parameters for the cluster analysis. In order to improve the efficiency of classical EM algorithm, the "Lazy-Psi alpha 2" EM is proposed by integrating Lazy EM algorithm and Psi alpha 2 algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to ensure the insensitivity of the clustering model to the amount of data set. The cluster analysis is implemented on an agent-based framework by which the tool can automatically choose the parameters by evaluating the clustering performance. TC tracks in western North Pacific from 1949 to 2006 are classified into 12 clusters by the probabilistic clustering model that is solved by "Lazy-Psi alpha 2" EM algorithm. The log-likelihood is taken as the performance indicator. Elaborate comparisons are made between the present cluster analysis and other cluster analyses related to TC tracks.

We propose to use sparse inverse covariance matrices to address this problem. Previous sparse inverse covariance methods never outperformed full covariance methods. We propose a method to automatically drive the structure of inverse covariance matrices to sparse during training. We use a new objective function by adding L1 regularization to the traditional objective function for maximum likelihood estimation. The graphic lasso method for the estimation of a sparse inverse covariance matrix is incorporated into the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn parameters of HMM using the new objective function. Experimental results show that we only need about 25% of the parameters of the inverse covariance matrices to be nonzero in order to achieve the same performance of a full covariance system. Our proposed system using sparse inverse covariance Gaussians also significantly outperforms a system using full covariance Gaussians trained on limited data.

Unlike continuous processes, a batch process has short operating period and each batch repeats the same procedure but with different raw materials. Therefore, states and measurements in different batches are not same and should be considered individually. However, the feed of material is often adjusted according to the performance of previous batches, thus the initial states of the next batch are related to the states of the previous batch. The proposed algorithm takes individuality and commonality across different batches into account and develops likelihood functions accordingly. By treating the unmeasured states and the parameters as missing variables, the maximum likelihood estimation is accomplished by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the expectation step, due to the complexity of posterior density function (PDF), particle filtering methods are employed for the implementation of filtering and smoothing. Through iterative optimization, the unknown parameters along with the states are estimated. Simulation example illustrates feasibility of this method and demonstrates its effectiveness.

Sequential Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks and Effects of Long-Range Dependent Data	SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS-DESIGN METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Workshop on Sequential Methodologies (IWSM)	JUN 14-16, 2011	Stanford, CA		Stanford Univ	Anomaly detection; Hidden Markov model; Long-range dependency; Wavelet decomposition	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ATTACKS	Anomaly detection is important for the correct functioning of wireless sensor networks. Recent studies have shown that node mobility along with spatial correlation of the monitored phenomenon in sensor networks can lead to observation data that have long range dependency, which could significantly increase the difficulty of anomaly detection. In this article, we develop an anomaly detection scheme based on multiscale analysis of the long-range dependent traffic to address this challenge. In this proposed detection scheme, the discrete wavelet transform is used to approximately de-correlate the traffic data and capture data characteristics in different timescales. The remaining dependencies are then captured by a multilevel hidden Markov model in the wavelet domain. To estimate the model parameters, we develop an online discounting expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which also tracks variations of the estimated models over time. Network anomalies are detected as abrupt changes in the tracked model variation scores. Statistical properties of our detection scheme are evaluated numerically using long-range dependent time series. We also evaluate our detection scheme in malicious scenarios simulated using the NS-2 network simulator.

It does not only control the traits of growth and development but also may be responsible for survival traits. Based on the accelerated failure time model, we construct a general parametric model for mapping the imprinted QTL (iQTL). Within the framework of interval mapping, maximum likelihood estimation of iQTL parameters is implemented via EM algorithm. The imprinting patterns of the detected iQTL are statistically tested according to a series of null hypotheses. BIC model selection criterion is employed to choose an optimal baseline hazard function with maximum likelihood and parsimonious parameters. Simulations are used to validate the proposed mapping procedure. A published dataset from a mouse model system was used to illustrate the proposed framework. Results show that among the five commonly used survival distributions, Log-logistic distribution is the optimal baseline hazard function for mapping QTL of hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) survival; under the log-logistic distribution, four QTLs were identified, in which only one QTL was inherited in Mendelian fashion, whereas others were imprinted in different imprinting patterns.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Wang, Y				Zhu, Zhongjie; Wang, Yuer			A hybrid algorithm for automatic segmentation of slowly moving objects	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Moving object segmentation; Spatio-temporal information; GMM; Frame difference; Fusing operation		Segmentation of moving objects in video sequences is a basic task in many applications. However, it is still challenging due to the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level human interpretation of video semantics. Compared with segmentation of fast moving objects, accurate and perceptually consistent segmentation of slowly moving objects is more difficult. In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed for segmentation of slowly moving objects in video sequence aiming to acquire perceptually consistent results. Firstly, the temporal information of the differences among multiple frames is employed to detect initial moving regions. Then, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed and an improved expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to segment a spatial image into homogeneous regions. Finally, the results of motion detection and spatial segmentation are fused to extract final moving objects. Experiments are conducted and provide convincing results. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

In our study, we use the recordings at two spatially separated Bluetooth sensors, which contain the globally unique Bluetooth device addresses of Bluetooth-enabled devices inside vehicles. These recordings are used to compute the vehicle speeds. Unfortunately, these recordings do not tell us which lanes the vehicles were traveling in and hence do not allow us to directly estimate the separate average speeds of vehicles, for example, in express lanes and local lanes or in high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and regular lanes. We propose a novel estimation scheme that can provide separate average speeds of the vehicles in different types of lanes. We demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed scheme, using real data collected by Bluetooth sensors alongside highways.

Adaptive bandwidth mode detection algorithm	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article							IMAGE SEGMENTATION; TRACKING	In this study a new algorithm 'adaptive bandwidth mode detection' (ABMD) algorithm has been developed to recover the correct density function without the need to either specify the correct number of Gaussians in the model or the correct bandwidth. The ABMD is employed in modelling visual features in applications such as image segmentation and real-time visual tracking. A simple type of model for these visual features are the Gaussian mixtures, where the number of Gaussian components is variable, thus, making it a flexible method for multimodal representation. This algorithm is used at initialisation for target modelling, where the target update will be done based on the mode propagation with adaptive bandwidth tracker method. It is based on an optimisation technique where a gradient ascent method is used and the optimal solution is selected based on a log-likelihood function. The mode detection ability of ABMD algorithm is compared with both the expectation maximisation and mean-shift algorithms. Furthermore, different video sequences have been employed to show how this approach has the ability to track an object regardless of whether the target model is corrupted with unwanted data at new frames.

The assumption of local independence for the manifest random variable is thus relaxed to arbitrary dependence. The proposed class generalizes different existing models for discrete and continuous time series, and allows for the finest trading off between bias and variance.

J	Guo, Y				Guo, Ying			A General Probabilistic Model for Group Independent Component Analysis and Its Estimation Methods	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						EM algorithm; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Group inferences; Independent component analysis; Maximum likelihood estimation; Multisubject imaging data; Variational approximation	FMRI DATA	Independent component analysis (ICA) has become an important tool for analyzing data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. ICA has been successfully applied to single-subject fMRI data. The extension of ICA to group inferences in neuroimaging studies, however, is challenging due to the unavailability of a prespecified group design matrix and the uncertainty in between-subjects variability in fMRI data. We present a general probabilistic ICA (PICA) model that can accommodate varying group structures of multisubject spatiotemporal processes. An advantage of the proposed model is that it can flexibly model various types of group structures in different underlying neural source signals and under different experimental conditions in fMRI studies. A maximum likelihood (ML) method is used for estimating this general group ICA model. We propose two expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to obtain the ML estimates. The first method is an exact EM algorithm, which provides an exact E-step and an explicit noniterative M-step. The second method is a variational approximation EM algorithm, which is computationally more efficient than the exact EM. In simulation studies, we first compare the performance of the proposed general group PICA model and the existing probabilistic group ICA approach. We then compare the two proposed EM algorithms and show the variational approximation EM achieves comparable accuracy to the exact EM with significantly less computation time. An fMRI data example is used to illustrate application of the proposed methods.

Rasch Model and Its Extensions for Analysis of Aphasic Deficits in Syntactic Comprehension	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; GLMM; IRT; Mixture models; Similar tests	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; FIT; DISTRIBUTIONS; PARAMETERS	Aphasia is the loss of the ability to produce and/or comprehend language, due to injury to brain areas responsible for these functions. Aphasic patients' performance on comprehension tests has traditionally been related both to the patient's individual ability and to the difficulty of the test questions. The natural choice for analysis of these test results is the Rasch model. It assumes that the probability of a patient responding correctly to a question is the inverse-logit function of the difference between the individual patient's ability and the difficulty of the test question. This study first modeled the way aphasic patients process different sentence types, as well as their ability to accomplish tasks using Rasch models. However, several scientifically important features of the data, such as the correlation of correct responses between two different comprehension tasks, and the association between response patterns in control sentences and response patterns in experimental sentences, were found to be inadequately captured by such models. Alternatively, we used a full Bayesian approach, exploring a mixture of generalized linear mixed models that clustered patients into similar response patterns and abilities. The mixture model was found to better describe the experimental results than any other model examined. The mixture model also expresses the hypothesis that aphasic patients can be classified into different ability and response profile groups, and that patients utilize different cognitive resources in different comprehension tasks. These results are scientifically important and could not have been discovered by using the simple Rasch model. This article has supplementary material online.

The interfacial boundary can be represented in several ways, one such method is the front point approach. Front points describe the location and the shape of the interfacial boundary separating the immiscible liquids. During the flow process, due to fluctuations the interfacial boundary and so the front points which describe the boundary changes with time. The time-varying interfacial boundary can be estimated using dynamic inverse algorithms based on Kalman filter. However, algorithms based on Kalman filter require complete knowledge of model parameters (initial states, state transition matrix, and noise covariance matrices) for implementation. In processes involving complex flow pattern such as two-phase flows, it is difficult to represent the model parameters in a prior form. This uncertainty in model parameters causes suboptimal performance of the Kalman type filters. In this paper, we employ expectation maximization algorithm (EM) to estimate model parameters along with the interfacial boundary using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The estimation of model parameters reduces the modeling uncertainty and thus results in improving the tracking of interfacial boundary. Numerical and experimental studies are performed to validate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Moattar, MH; Homayounpour, MM				Moattar, Mohammad Hossein; Homayounpour, Mohammad Mehdi			Text-Independent Speaker Verification Using Variational Gaussian Mixture Model	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						Gaussian mixture model; expectation maximization; variational approximation; speaker verification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RECOGNITION; NORMALIZATION; ADAPTATION; ANALYZERS; INFERENCE	This paper concerns robust and reliable speaker model training for text-independent speaker verification. The baseline speaker modeling approach is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In text-independent speaker verification, the amount of speech data may be different for speakers. However, we still wish the modeling approach to perform equally well for all speakers. Besides, the modeling technique must be least vulnerable against unseen data. A traditional approach for GMM training is expectation maximization (EM) method, which is known for its overfitting problem and its weakness in handling insufficient training data. To tackle these problems, variational approximation is proposed. Variational approaches are known to be robust against overtraining and data insufficiency. We evaluated the proposed approach on two different databases, namely KING and TFarsdat The experiments show that the proposed approach improves the performance on TFarsdat and KING databases by 0.56% and 4.81%, respectively. Also, the experiments show that the variationally optimized GMM is more robust against noise and the verification error rate in noisy environments for TFarsdat dataset decreases by 1.52%.

Accounting for Control Mislabeling in Case-Control Biomarker Studies	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						biomarker discovery; label uncertainty; case-control; classification; prediction; expectation-maximization algorithm (EM)	RELATIVE RISK; REGRESSION; MISCLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	In biomarker discovery studies, uncertainty associated with case and control labels is often overlooked. By omitting to take into account label uncertainty, model parameters and the predictive risk can become biased, sometimes severely. The most common situation is when the control set contains an unknown number of undiagnosed, or future, cases. This has a marked impact in situations where the model needs to be well-calibrated, e.g., when the prediction performance of a biomarker panel is evaluated. Failing to account for class label uncertainty may lead to underestimation of classification performance and bias in parameter estimates. This can further impact on meta-analysis for combining evidence from multiple studies. Using a simulation study, we outline how conventional statistical models can be modified to address class label uncertainty leading to well-calibrated prediction performance estimates and reduced bias in meta-analysis. We focus on the problem of mislabeled control subjects in case-control studies, i.e., when some of the control subjects are undiagnosed cases, although the procedures we report are generic. The uncertainty in control status is a particular situation common in biomarker discovery studies in the context of genomic and molecular epidemiology, where control subjects are commonly sampled from the general population with an established expected disease incidence rate.

Firstly, the observations may be precise or imprecise. Secondly, the error distributions may vary within the wide class of the strongly unimodal distributions, symmetrical or not. Thirdly, the variance of the errors is unknown. The algorithm starts by estimating the parameters of the ANOVA linear model. Then, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the effects is estimated. Finally, the algorithm uses this matrix estimate to test ANOVA hypotheses posed in terms of linear combinations of the effects.

A note on the binomial model with simplex constraints	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Constrained binomial model; DA algorithm; EM algorithm; Simplex constraints		Liu (2000) considered maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation in a binomial model with simplex constraints using the expectation-maximization (EM) and data augmentation (DA) algorithms. By introducing latent variables {Z(ij)} and {Y(ij)} (to be defined later), he formulated the constrained parameter problem into a missing data problem. However, the derived DA algorithm does not work because he actually assumed that the {Y(ij)} are known. Furthermore, although the final results from the derived EM algorithm are correct, his findings are based on the assumption that the {Y(ij)} are observable. This note provides a correct DA algorithm. In addition, we obtained the same E-step and M-step under the assumption that the (Y(ij)) are unobservable. A real example is used for illustration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantifying Simulator Discrepancy in Discrete-Time Dynamical Simulators	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Model error; Rainfall-runoff model; Monte Carlo EM algorithm	EM ALGORITHM; MODEL ERROR; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; INFERENCE; SYSTEMS	When making predictions with complex simulators it can be important to quantify the various sources of uncertainty. Errors in the structural specification of the simulator, for example due to missing processes or incorrect mathematical specification, can be a major source of uncertainty, but are often ignored. We introduce a methodology for inferring the discrepancy between the simulator and the system in discrete-time dynamical simulators. We assume a structural form for the discrepancy function, and show how to infer the maximum-likelihood parameter estimates using a particle filter embedded within a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. We illustrate the method on a conceptual rainfall-runoff simulator (logSPM) used to model the Abercrombie catchment in Australia. We assess the simulator and discrepancy model on the basis of their predictive performance using proper scoring rules. This article has supplementary material online.

JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS			English	Article						item response theory (IRT); psychometrics; assessment; statistics	3-PARAMETER LOGISTIC MODEL; EM ALGORITHM	It has been known for some time that item response theory (IRT) models may exhibit a likelihood function of a respondent's ability which may have multiple modes, flat modes, or both. These conditions, often associated with guessing of multiple-choice (MC) questions, can introduce uncertainty and bias to ability estimation by maximum likelihood (ML) when standard Newton solutions are used. This article evaluates the performance of several maximization methods, including initial (grid) searches probing the function slopes, simulated annealing, exhaustive likelihood evaluation, and the standard Newton algorithm. In extensive studies, involving several million records of both generated and real data, the algorithms were evaluated with respect to precision and speed. Two methods, exhaustive search and grid search, followed by Newton steps, all yielded ML estimates at the required precision. At today's computer speeds, either of these algorithms may be considered for high-volume response pattern scoring.

In order to improve the classification accuracy where the polarimetric information is similar, the method gives intensity, polarimetric and interferometric information equal weighting to more effectively use the full range of information contained in PolInSAR data. In addition, this method uses an iterative clustering scheme which combines the expectation maximization (EM) and fast primal-dual (FastPD) optimization techniques to improve the classification quality. The first step of the method is to extract the Shannon entropy characterization from the PolInSAR data. Then, the image is initially classified respectively by the spans of the intensity, polarimetric and interferometric contributions to Shannon entropy. Finally, classification results of different contributions are merged and reduced to a specified number of clusters. An iterative clustering scheme is applied to further improve the classification results. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with DLR (German Aerospace Center) E-SAR PolInSAR data and CETC (China Electronics Technology Group Corporation) 38 Institute PolInSAR data.

J	You, Y; Hu, XG; Qi, H				You, Yuan; Hu, Xiangen; Qi, Huan			Improved EM algorithm for MPT model analysis	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						MPT models; EMalgorithm; Convergence speed; Initial value; Matrix operation	PROCESSING TREE MODELS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; MEMORY	Multinomialprocessing tree (MPT) models are in wide use as measurement models for analyzing categorical data in cognitive experiments. The approach involves estimating parameters and conducting hypothesis tests involving parameters that are arrayed in a tree structure designed to represent latent cognitive processes. The standard inference algorithm for these models is based on the well-known expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm. On the basis of the original use of the EMalgorithm for MPT models, this article presents an approach that accelerates the convergence speed of the algorithm by (1) adjusting suitable initial positions for certain parameters to reduce required iterative times and (2) using a series of operations between/among a set of matrices that are specific to the original model structure and information to reduce the time required for a single iteration. As compared with traditional algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has superior efficiency in interpreted languages and also has better algorithm readability and structure flexibility.

A mixture model with random-effects components for classifying sibling pairs	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						model-based clustering; family data; random effects; healthy aging	GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; LEIDEN LONGEVITY; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; FAMILIES; CLUSTER	In healthy aging research, typically multiple health outcomes are measured, representing health status. The aim of this paper was to develop a model-based clustering approach to identify homogeneous sibling pairs according to their health status. Model-based clustering approaches will be considered on the basis of linear mixed effect model for the mixture components. Class memberships of siblings within pairs are allowed to be correlated, and within a class the correlation between siblings is modeled using random sibling pair effects. We propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. Model performance is evaluated via simulations in terms of estimating the correct parameters, degree of agreement, and the ability to detect the correct number of clusters. The performance of ourmodel is compared with the performance of standard model-based clustering approaches. The methods are used to classify sibling pairs from the Leiden Longevity Study according to their health status. Our results suggest that homogeneous healthy sibling pairs are associated with a longer life span. Software is available for fitting the new models. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Vrettas, MD; Cornford, D; Opper, M				Vrettas, Michail D.; Cornford, Dan; Opper, Manfred			Estimating parameters in stochastic systems: A variational Bayesian approach	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Variational techniques; Dynamical systems; Stochastic differential equations; Parameter estimation	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; DATA ASSIMILATION; DIFFUSION-PROCESSES; MONTE-CARLO; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; KALMAN FILTER; EM ALGORITHM; TIME-SERIES; INFERENCE; MODELS	This work is concerned with approximate inference in dynamical systems, from a variational Bayesian perspective. When modelling real world dynamical systems, stochastic differential equations appear as a natural choice, mainly because of their ability to model the noise of the system by adding a variation of some stochastic process to the deterministic dynamics. Hence, inference in such processes has drawn much attention. Here a new extended framework is derived that is based on a local polynomial approximation of a recently proposed variational Bayesian algorithm. The paper begins by showing that the new extension of this variational algorithm can be used for state estimation (smoothing) and converges to the original algorithm. However, the main focus is on estimating the (hyper-) parameters of these systems (i.e. drift parameters and diffusion coefficients). The new approach is validated on a range of different systems which vary in dimensionality and non-linearity. These are the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the exact likelihood of which can be computed analytically, the univariate and highly non-linear, stochastic double well and the multivariate chaotic stochastic Lorenz '63 (3D model). As a special case the algorithm is also applied to the 40 dimensional stochastic Lorenz '96 system. In our investigation we compare this new approach with a variety of other well known methods, such as the hybrid Monte Carlo, dual unscented Kalman filter, full weak-constraint 4D-Var algorithm and analyse empirically their asymptotic behaviour as a function of observation density or length of time window increases. In particular we show that we are able to estimate parameters in both the drift (deterministic) and the diffusion (stochastic) part of the model evolution equations using our new methods.

This procedure generally relies on the analysis of the unprocessed echo signal. Because the ultrasound echo is degraded by the non-ideal system point spread function, a deconvolution step could be employed to provide an estimate of the tissue response that could then be exploited for a more accurate characterization. In medical ultrasound, deconvolution is commonly used to increase diagnostic reliability of ultrasound images by improving their contrast and resolution. Most successful algorithms address deconvolution in a maximum a posteriori estimation framework; this typically leads to the solution of l(2)-norm or l(1)-norm constrained optimization problems, depending on the choice of the prior distribution. Although these techniques are sufficient to obtain relevant image visual quality improvements, the obtained reflectivity estimates are, however, not appropriate for classification purposes. In this context, we introduce in this paper a maximum a posteriori deconvolution framework expressly derived to improve tissue characterization. The algorithm overcomes limitations associated with standard techniques by using a nonstandard prior model for the tissue response. We present an evaluation of the algorithm performance using both computer simulations and tissue-mimicking phantoms.

One or more atypical observations in the sample data can affect the estimation of these parameters. Thus, the assessment of the combined influence of these observations by the analysis of Local Influence is essential. The purpose of this paper was to propose local influence analysis methods for the regionalized variable, given that it has n-variate Student's t-distribution, and compare it with the analysis of local influence when the same regionalized variable has n-variate normal distribution. These local influence analysis methods were applied to soil physical properties and soybean yield data of an experiment carried out in a 56.68 ha commercial field in western Parana, Brazil. Results showed that influential values are efficiently determined with n-variate Student's t-distribution.

We particularly focus on applications to three different problems related to extreme climatic events including detection of abrupt regime shifts, clustering tropical cyclone tracks, and statistical forecasting for seasonal tropical cyclone activity. For identifying potential change points in an extreme event count series, a hierarchical Bayesian framework involving three layers - data, parameter, and hypothesis - is formulated to demonstrate the posterior probability of the shifts throughout the time. For the data layer, a Poisson process with a gamma distributed rate is presumed. For the hypothesis layer, multiple candidate hypotheses with different change-points are considered. To calculate the posterior probability for each hypothesis and its associated parameters we developed an exact analytical formula, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and a more sophisticated reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. The algorithms are applied to several rare event series: the annual tropical cyclone or typhoon counts over the central, eastern, and western North Pacific; the annual extremely heavy rainfall event counts at Manoa, Hawaii; and the annual heat wave frequency in France. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a Bayesian clustering method built on a mixture Gaussian model is applied to objectively classify historical, spaghetti-like tropical cyclone tracks (1945-2007) over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea into eight distinct track types. A regression based approach to forecasting seasonal tropical cyclone frequency in a region is developed. Specifically, by adopting large-scale environmental conditions prior to the tropical cyclone season, a Poisson regression model is built for predicting seasonal tropical cyclone counts, and a probit regression model is alternatively developed toward a binary classification problem. With a non-informative prior assumption for the model parameters, a Bayesian inference for the Poisson regression model and the probit regression model are derived in parallel. A Gibbs sampler is further designed to integrate the posterior predictive distribution. The resulting Bayesian Poisson regression algorithm is applied to predicting the seasonal tropical cyclone activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the proposed algorithm, the evolution curve is constrained not only by a shape-based statistical model but also by a hidden variable model from image observation. The hidden variable model herein is defined by the local voxel labeling, which is unknown and estimated by the expected likelihood function derived from the image data and prior anatomical knowledge. In the M-step, the shapes of the structures are estimated jointly by encoding the hidden variable model and the statistical prior model obtained from the training stage. In the E-step, the expected observation likelihood and the prior distribution of the hidden variables are estimated. In experiments, the proposed automatic segmentation algorithm is applied to multiple gray nuclei structures such as caudate, putamens and thalamus of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in volunteers and patients.

In order to determine the parameters of the ER-based prediction model, some optimization models have been proposed to train the ER-based prediction model. However, these models are implemented in an offline fashion and thus it is very expensive to train and retrain them when new information is available. This correspondence paper is concerned with developing the recursive algorithms for updating the ER-based prediction model from the probability-based point of view. Using the recursive expectation maximization algorithm, two recursive algorithms are proposed for updating the parameters of the ER-based prediction model under judgmental and numerical outputs, respectively. As such, the proposed algorithms can be used to fine tune the ER-based prediction model online once new information becomes available. We verify the proposed method via a realistic example with missile reliability data.

When there are no missing values in the data, information criteria can be used to select predictors. For example, one could apply the small-sample-size corrected version of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the (AICC). In this article, we discuss how information criteria should be calculated when the dependent variable and/or the predictors contain missing values. Therewith, we extensively discuss and evaluate three models that can be employed to deal with the missing data, that is, to predict the missing values. The most complex model, that is, the model with all available predictors, outperforms the other models. These results also apply to more general hypotheses than predictor selection and also to structural equation modeling (SEM) models.

J	Oudre, L; Fevotte, C; Grenier, Y				Oudre, Laurent; Fevotte, Cedric; Grenier, Yves			Probabilistic Template-Based Chord Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Chord recognition; music information retrieval (MIR); music signal processing; music signal representation	MUSIC; AUDIO; TRANSCRIPTION; KEY	This paper describes a probabilistic approach to template-based chord recognition in music signals. The algorithm only takes chromagram data and a user-defined dictionary of chord templates as input data. No training or musical information such as key, rhythm, or chord transition models is required. The chord occurrences are treated as probabilistic events, whose probabilities are learned from the song using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The adaptative estimation of these probabilities (together with an ad-hoc postprocessing filtering) has the desirable effect of smoothing out spurious chords that would occur in our previous baseline work. Our algorithm is compared to various methods that entered the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) in 2008 and 2009, using a diverse set of evaluation metrics, some of which are new. The systems are tested on two evaluation corpuses; the first one is composed of the Beatles catalog (180 pop-rock songs) and the other one is constituted of 20 songs from various artists and music genres. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art chord recognition systems.

J	Subramanya, A; Bilmes, J				Subramanya, Amarnag; Bilmes, Jeff			Semi-Supervised Learning with Measure Propagation	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						graph-based semi-supervised learning; transductive inference; large-scale semi-supervised learning; non-parametric models	EM ALGORITHM	We describe a new objective for graph-based semi-supervised learning based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between discrete probability measures that encode class membership probabilities. We show how the proposed objective can be efficiently optimized using alternating minimization. We prove that the alternating minimization procedure converges to the correct optimum and derive a simple test for convergence. In addition, we show how this approach can be scaled to solve the semi-supervised learning problem on very large data sets, for example, in one instance we use a data set with over 10(8) samples. In this context, we propose a graph node ordering algorithm that is also applicable to other graph-based semi-supervised learning approaches. We compare the proposed approach against other standard semi-supervised learning algorithms on the semi-supervised learning benchmark data sets (Chapelle et al., 2007), and other real-world tasks such as text classification on Reuters and WebKB, speech phone classification on TIMIT and Switchboard, and linguistic dialog-act tagging on Dihana and Switchboard. In each case, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. Lastly, we show that our objective can be generalized into a form that includes the standard squared-error loss, and we prove a geometric rate of convergence in that case.

J	Wang, XJ; Yan, J				Wang, Xiaojing; Yan, Jun			Fitting semiparametric regressions for panel count survival data with an R package spef	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Estimating equations; Panel count; R package; Semiparametric regression	EM ALGORITHM; MEAN FUNCTION; LIKELIHOOD; IMPUTATION; TIMES	Observing recurrent event processes at discrete, possibly random times produces panel count data. Modeling panel count data is challenging because the event process may be associated with the observation pattern and censoring time. Various methods have been proposed to fit flexible semiparametric regression models, but no software is available to practitioners. We develop an R package spef that fits semiparametric regression models for panel count data. Existing methods in the literature are implemented as well as our recently developed estimating equations approach. Some of the implemented methods allow informative observation and censoring scheme. The package usage is illustrated with a well-known bladder tumor data set. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the statistical model and the estimated skew angle is extracted from the estimated parameters. Experiments demonstrate that our method is favorably comparable to other existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on general basis expansion model, two expectation maximization-type channel estimation methods are proposed for subband OFDMA in order to overcome channel time-frequency selectivity.

Enhancement of measurement capability for precision manufacturing processes using an attribute gauge system	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						measurement precision; zero-inflated; repeatability; reproducibility	REPRODUCIBILITY; REPEATABILITY; INSPECTION	This research discusses precision manufacturing processes that have near-zero-defect manufacturing environments with occasional non-conformities in some samples when random shocks arise. Repeatability variance and reproducibility variance are commonly used to assess measurement precision, but they may fail to estimate measurement parameters in precision manufacturing processes. This paper proposes a novel attribute gauge system that consists of five modules. The measurement parameters estimation module derives equations for the random shock probability and measurement parameters using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and zero-inflated Poisson model. The variance between measurement systems module derives the equation of variance within operators and gauges from the laboratory component of the bias. The repeatability variance module derives a repeatability measurement equation and the reproducibility variance module derives the reproducibility measurement equation using the ASTM E691 standard. Finally, the measurement system acceptability criteria module derives a measurement capability index and assesses measurement precision based on the ASTM F1469 standard. A thin-film transistor liquid crystal display manufacturing case study is used to illustrate the process and potential of the proposed system. Findings can be used as a reference for evaluating measurement systems with attribute data. Analytical results are also useful to quality practitioners attempting to improve measurement system effectiveness.

Performance of Different Population Pharmacokinetic Algorithms	THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING			English	Article						NONMEM; ADAPT 5; IT2S; ITS; MLEM; shrinkage	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MODELS; PARAMETERS; NONMEM	Background: There has been an increased focus on population pharmacokinetics (PK) to improve the drug development process since the "Critical Path paper'' by the Food and Drug Administration. This increased interest has given rise to additional algorithms. Objectives: The purpose of this exercise was to compare the new algorithms iterative-2-stage (ITS) and maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) available in ADAPT 5 with other methods. Methods: A total of 29 clinical trials with different study designs were simulated. Different algorithms were used to fit the simulated data, and the estimated parameters were compared with the true values. The algorithms ITS and MLEM were compared with the standard-2-stage, Iterative-2-Stage (IT2S) method in the IT2S package and the first-order conditional estimate (FOCE) method in NONMEM version VI. Imprecision and bias for the population PK parameters, variances, and individual PK parameters were used to compare the methods. Results: Population PK parameters were well estimated and bias low for all nonlinear mixed effect modeling approaches. These approaches were superior to the standard-2-stage analyses. The algorithm MLEM was better than IT2S and ITS in predicting the PK and variability parameters. Residual variability was better estimated using MLEM and FOCE. A difference in the estimation of the variance exists between FOCE and the other methods. Variances estimated with FOCE often had shrinkage issues, whereas MLEM in ADAPT 5 had practically no shrinkage problems. Using MLEM, a reduction from 3000 to 1000 samples in the expectation maximization step had no impact on the results. Conclusions: The new algorithm MLEM in ADAPT 5 was consistently better than IT2S and ITS in its prediction of PK parameters, variances, and the residual variability. It was comparable with the FOCE method with significantly fewer shrinkage issues in the estimation of variance. The number of samples used in the expectation maximization step with MLEM did not influence the results.

The maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator is obtained through a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization type algorithm and its asymptotic properties are described. The finite sample performance of the pseudo-likelihood approach is investigated through simulation studies, and compared to a full likelihood approach and to regression calibration under different measurement error structures, as well as continuous or discrete covariates. In contrast to the full likelihood approach, our method is computationally fast while remaining competitive from an inferential perspective. Satisfactory results are also provided over regression calibration. Pseudo-likelihood and the competing methods are finally applied to the analysis of two data sets.

J	He, YJ; Han, JQ				He, Yongjun; Han, Jiqing			Gaussian Specific Compensation for Channel Distortion in Speech Recognition	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Automatic speech recognition; channel distortion; expectation-maximization		Channel distortion is one of the major factors degrading the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Most of the current compensation methods rely on the assumption that the channel distortion remains unchanged within an utterance or globally. However, we show in this letter that the distortion varies over speech frames even if the channel response is unchanged. To address this problem, we relax the above-mentioned assumption and propose a new method to compensate the channel distortion for each Gaussian of the acoustic models. Firstly, we derive the relationship between the clean and distorted models, and then estimate the channel magnitude response with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Finally, we obtain the matched models with the estimated magnitude response and the clean models. Experiments were conducted on the TIMIT/NTIMIT databases and the results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper proposes an alternative two-stage approach to model fitting. The first stage uses the modified k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify the latent classes that best satisfy the conditional independence assumption underlying the latent variable model. The second stage then uses mixture modeling treating the class membership as known. The proposed approach is theoretically justifiable, directly checks the conditional independence assumption, and converges much faster than the full likelihood approach when analyzing high-dimensional data. This paper also develops a new classification rule based on latent variable models. The proposed classification procedure reduces the dimensionality of measured data and explicitly recognizes the heterogeneous nature of the complex disease, which makes it perfect for analyzing high-throughput genomic data. Simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

The reasons of these preferences can be traced to their training algorithms, typically versions of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. The re-estimation equations needed by this method become very complex as the mixture components depart from the simplest cases. Here we propose to use a stochastic approximation method for probabilistic mixture learning. Under this method it is straightforward to train mixtures composed by a wide range of mixture components from different families. Hence, it is a flexible alternative for mixture learning. Experimental results are presented to show the probability density and missing value estimation capabilities of our proposal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the quad-HIDAC PET scanner, which has virtually continuous spatial sampling; improvements in resolution, noise and contrast are obtained as a result of avoiding artifacts introduced by binning the data into sampled projections used during the reconstruction process. In order to reconstruct high-resolution images in 3D-PET, background correction and resolution recovery are included within the Maximum Likelihood list-mode Expectation Maximization reconstruction model. This paper, introduces the performance analysis of the Gaussian, Laplacian and Triangular kernels. The Full-Width Half-Maximum used for each kernel was varied from 0.8 to 1.6 mm. For each quality compartment within the phantom, transaxial middle slices from the 3D reconstructed images are shown. Results show that, according to the quantitative measures, the triangular kernel has the best performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The representation of those photos in appealing physical photo books is highly appreciated by many people. Today, many photos are shared via social networking sites, where people upload their photos and share their stories with their friends. The members of social networks comment on each other's photos, add tags or descriptions and upload new photos of the same events to their albums. While the media of different personal events are available on the social network, there is no easy way to collect and bundle them into a story and print this story as a photo book. We propose an approach to automatically detect media elements that match a query (where, when, what, who) in the user's social network and intelligently arrange and compose them into a printable photo book. We combine content analysis of text and images to automatically and semi-automatically select photos of a specific story. We calculate the probabilities of each two photos to belong to the same event using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that we propose in order to be able to retrieve them easily when receiving the user queries, and we address the differences between our model and other models that use similar proposed algorithms. People's tags and the interaction between the users and the photos as well as other semantic information are exploited to select important photos that are suitable to create the photo book. The selected photos and derived semantics are then employed to automatically create an appealing layout for the photo book.

Here we consider genotype uncertainty in quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses for large crosses in variance component models, where the genetic information is included in identity-by-descent (IBD) matrices. An IBD matrix is one realization from a distribution of potential IBD matrices given available marker information. In QTL analyses, its expectation is normally used resulting in potentially reduced accuracy and loss of power. Previously, IBD distributions have been included in models for small human full-sib families. We develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating a full model based on Monte Carlo imputation for applications in large animal pedigrees. Our simulations show that the bias of variance component estimates using traditional expected IBD matrix can be adjusted by accounting for the distribution and that the calculations are computationally feasible for large pedigrees.

Unlike conventional photoacoustic tomography scanning, where the scanning device rotates around the subject, the scanning aperture in IVPA imaging is enclosed within the imaged object. The display of the intravascular structure is typically obtained by converting detected photoacoustic waves into Cartesian coordinates, which can produce images with severe artifacts. Because the acquired data are highly limited, there does not exist a stable reconstruction algorithm for such imaging geometry. The purpose of this work was to apply image reconstruction concepts to explore the feasibility and efficacy of image reconstruction algorithms in IVPA imaging using traditional analytical formulas, such as a filtered back-projection (FBP) and the lambda-tomography method. Although the closed-form formulas are not exact for the IVPA system, a general picture of and interface information about objects are provided. To improve the quality of the reconstructed image, the iterative expectation maximization and penalized least-squares methods were adopted to minimize the difference between the measured signals and those generated by a reconstructed image. In this work, we considered both the ideal point detector and the acoustic transducers with finite-size aperture. The transducer effects including the spatial response of aperture and acoustoelectrical impulse responses were incorporated in the system matrix to reduce the aroused distortion in the IVPA reconstruction. Computer simulations and experiments were carried out to validate the methods. The applicability and the limitation of the reconstruction method were also discussed.

J	Soffritti, G; Galimberti, G				Soffritti, Gabriele; Galimberti, Giuliano			Multivariate linear regression with non-normal errors: a solution based on mixture models	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						EM algorithm; Mixture model; Model selection criterion; Multivariate regression; Non-normal error distribution	VARIABLE SELECTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; LOCAL INFLUENCE; INCOMPLETE DATA; IDENTIFIABILITY; CLUSTERS	In some situations, the distribution of the error terms of a multivariate linear regression model may depart from normality. This problem has been addressed, for example, by specifying a different parametric distribution family for the error terms, such as multivariate skewed and/or heavy-tailed distributions. A new solution is proposed, which is obtained by modelling the error term distribution through a finite mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian components. The multivariate linear regression model is studied under this assumption. Identifiability conditions are proved and maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters is performed using the EM algorithm. The number of mixture components is chosen through model selection criteria; when this number is equal to one, the proposal results in the classical approach. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments and compared to the ones of other approaches.

The miniature RatCAP presents a unique set of advantages as well as challenges for image processing, and a combination of conventional methods and novel ideas developed specifically for this tomograph have been implemented. The crux of our approach is a low-noise Monte Carlo-generated probability matrix with integrated corrections for all physical effects that impact PET image quality. The generation and optimization of this matrix are discussed in detail, along with the estimation of correction factors and their incorporation into the reconstruction framework. Phantom studies and Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the reconstruction as well as individual corrections for random coincidences, photon scatter, attenuation, and detector efficiency variations in terms of bias and noise. Finally, a realistic rat brain phantom study reconstructed using this methodology is shown to recover >90% of the contrast for hot as well as cold regions. The goal has been to realize the potential of quantitative neuroreceptor imaging with the RatCAP.

J	Tahernia, N; Khodabin, M; Mirzaei, N				Tahernia, Nadia; Khodabin, Morteza; Mirzaei, Noorbakhsh			Mixed model for interoccurrence times of earthquakes based on the expectation-maximization algorithm	ACTA GEOPHYSICA			English	Article						expectation-maximization algorithm; mixture model; information criteria; generalized gamma family; interoccurrence time	SOUTH CASPIAN BASIN; ACTIVE TECTONICS; ZAGROS MOUNTAINS; FOCAL MECHANISM; MIDDLE-EAST; IRAN; DEFORMATION; TURKEY; STATISTICS; PAKISTAN	In this paper, the goodness-of-fit test based on a convex combination of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria is used to explain the features of interoccurrence times of earthquakes. By analyzing the seismic catalog of Iran for different tectonic settings, we have found that the probability distributions of time intervals between successive earthquakes can be described by the generalized normal distribution. This indicates that the sequence of successive earthquakes is not a Poisson process. It is found that by decreasing the threshold magnitude, the interoccurrence time distribution changes from the generalized normal distribution to the gamma distribution in some seismotectonic regions. As a new insight, the probability distribution of time intervals between earthquakes is described as a mixture distribution via the expectation-maximization algorithm.

Association test between haplotypes and longitudinal traits in complex pedigrees	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						Bayesian; complex pedigree; haplotype; longitudinal trait; random regression	EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR LOCUS; GENETIC-PARAMETERS; RANDOM REGRESSIONS; GENOTYPE DATA; MODEL; REPRODUCTION; INFERENCE; SELECTION	Evaluating the association of candidate genes with longitudinal traits would be a useful method to study the genetic basis of complex traits. Haplotypes incorporate more information about the underlying polymorphisms than do genotypes for individual SNP, and have been considered as a more informative format of data in association analysis. In this study, we extended the random regression model to allow analysing haplotype effects in a longitudinal framework and then performed a hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate parameter values. We assessed the performance of the proposed approach and demonstrated its validity and power with simulation. The power of our method was also demonstrated by an example of Meishan pigs, in which one haplotype affecting the total number of piglets born was detected using our method, whereas it cannot be detected using the conventional single SNP-based model. Additionally, the model is flexible to be extended to model a complex network of genetic regulation that includes the interactions between different haplotypes and between haplotypes and environments.

To lessen the complexity, the Expectation maximization (EM) and Space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) algorithms are adopted respectively. To treat with the effect of Non-Gaussian noise (NGN) channels, an Equivalent signal model (ESM) is used to enhance the robust of the EM-type H-infinity estimator. Furthermore, joint estimation using Phase shifted orthogonal (PSO) pilot sequences is applied for improving the estimation and the requirement for pilot. Simulation results show that the H-infinity estimator has almost the same Mean square error (MSE) as Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. By using the ESM, the robustness of EM-type based H-infinity estimator is enhanced against NGN channels. In addition, the MSE and pilot overhead are reduced by applying the joint estimation with PSO.

We propose two efficient methods, an iterative data augmentation (DA) algorithm and a non-iterative inverse Bayes formulae (IBF) sampler, to simulate TMVND and generalize them to multivariate normal distributions with linear inequality constraints. By creating a Bayesian incomplete-data structure, the posterior step of the DA algorithm directly generates random vector draws as opposed to single element draws, resulting obvious computational advantage and easy coding with common statistical software packages such as S-PLUS, MATLAB and GAUSS. Furthermore, the DA provides a ready structure for implementing a fast EM algorithm to identify the mode of TMVND, which has many potential applications in statistical inference of constrained parameter problems. In addition, utilizing this mode as an intermediate result, the IBF sampling provides a novel alternative to Gibbs sampling and eliminates problems with convergence and possible slow convergence due to the high correlation between components of a TMVND. The DA algorithm is applied to a linear regression model with constrained parameters and is illustrated with a published data set. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed DA algorithm and IBF sampler are more efficient than the Gibbs sampler and the accept-reject algorithm.

Covariates subject to detection limits are often left censored because of a measurement device having a minimal lower limit of detection. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo version of the expectation-maximization algorithm to handle large number of covariates subject to detection limits in generalized linear models. We model the covariate distribution via a sequence of one-dimensional conditional distributions, and sample the covariate values using an adaptive rejection metropolis algorithm. Parameter estimation is obtained by maximization via the Monte Carlo M-step. This procedure is applied to a real dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which values of urinary heavy metals are subject to a limit of detection. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed approach can lead to a significant reduction in variance for parameter estimates in these models, improving the power of such studies.

EQPlanar: a maximum-likelihood method for accurate organ activity estimation from whole body planar projections	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							NON-HODGKINS-LYMPHOMA; COMPTON-SCATTER CORRECTION; TIME-ESTIMATION METHODS; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY DOSIMETRY; IDEC-Y2B8 RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; QUANTITATIVE PLANAR; PROCESSING METHODS; ANTIBODY THERAPY; CONJUGATE VIEWS	Optimizing targeted radionuclide therapy requires patient-specific estimation of organ doses. The organ doses are estimated from quantitative nuclear medicine imaging studies, many of which involve planar whole body scans. We have previously developed the quantitative planar (QPlanar) processing method and demonstrated its ability to provide more accurate activity estimates than conventional geometric-mean-based planar (CPlanar) processing methods using physical phantom and simulation studies. The QPlanar method uses the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization algorithm, 3D organ volume of interests (VOIs), and rigorous models of physical image degrading factors to estimate organ activities. However, the QPlanar method requires alignment between the 3D organ VOIs and the 2D planar projections and assumes uniform activity distribution in each VOI. This makes application to patients challenging. As a result, in this paper we propose an extended QPlanar (EQPlanar) method that provides independent-organ rigid registration and includes multiple background regions. We have validated this method using both Monte Carlo simulation and patient data. In the simulation study, we evaluated the precision and accuracy of the method in comparison to the original QPlanar method. For the patient studies, we compared organ activity estimates at 24 h after injection with those from conventional geometric mean-based planar quantification using a 24 h post-injection quantitative SPECT reconstruction as the gold standard. We also compared the goodness of fit of the measured and estimated projections obtained from the EQPlanar method to those from the original method at four other time points where gold standard data were not available. In the simulation study, more accurate activity estimates were provided by the EQPlanar method for all the organs at all the time points compared with the QPlanar method. Based on the patient data, we concluded that the EQPlanar method provided a substantial increase in accuracy of organ activity estimates from 24 h planar images compared to the CPlanar using 24 h SPECT as the golden standard. For other time points, where no golden standard is available, better agreement between estimated and measured projections was observed by using the EQPlanar method compared to the QPlanar method. This phenomenon is consistent with the improvement in goodness of fit seen in both simulation data and 24 h patient data. Therefore, this indicates the improved reliability of organ activity estimates obtained though the EQPlanar method.	[Song, N.; Frey, E.

A special class of hybrid system mathematical models is introduced to describe such multi-unit systems, and a general approach for estimation and change detection is proposed. A novel FD algorithm is developed based on estimating a common Gaussian-mixture (GM) distribution for unit parameters whereby observations are mapped into a common parameter-space and clusters are then identified corresponding to different modes of operation via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The estimated common distribution incorporates information from all units and is utilized for FD in each individual unit. The proposed algorithm takes into account unit mode switching and parameter drift and can handle sudden, incipient, and preexisting faults. It can be applied to FD in various industrial, chemical, or manufacturing processes, sensor networks, and others. The second part of the paper is focused on the application of the new technique to practical heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Reliable and timely FD is a significant and still open practical problem in the HVAC industry, and, as such, the first application of this approach is aimed at this industry. It addresses important details of the algorithm's implementation and presents results from an extensive performance study based on both Monte Carlo simulations and real data collected from three operational large HVAC systems. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the new technique in a more realistic setting and provide insights that can facilitate the design and implementation of practical FD for systems of similar type in other industrial applications.

The estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood is especially difficult when the number of cases per stratum is greater than one. In this case, the denominator of each cluster contribution to the conditional likelihood involves a complex integral in high dimension, which leads to convergence problems in the numerical maximization. In this article we show how these computational complexities can be bypassed using a global two-step analysis for nonlinear mixed effects models. The first step estimates the cluster-specific parameters and can be achieved with standard statistical methods and software based on maximum likelihood for independent data. The second step uses the EM-algorithm in conjunction with conditional restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the population parameters. We use simulations to demonstrate that the method works well when the analysis is based on a large number of strata per cluster, as in many ecological studies. We apply the proposed two-step approach to evaluate habitat selection by pairs of bison roaming freely in their natural environment. This article has supplementary material online.

A Hierarchical Rater Model for Constructed Responses, with a Signal Detection Rater Model	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article							MULTIPLE RATINGS; EM ALGORITHM; SAMPLES	The hierarchical rater model (HRM) re-cognizes the hierarchical structure of data that arises when raters score constructed response items. In this approach, raters' scores are not viewed as being direct indicators of examinee proficiency but rather as indicators of essay quality; the (latent categorical) quality of an examinee's essay in turn serves as an indicator of the examinee's proficiency, thus yielding a hierarchical structure. Here it is shown that a latent class model motivated by signal detection theory (SDT) is a natural candidate for the first level of the HRM, the rater model. The latent class SDT model provides measures of rater precision and various rater effects, above and beyond simply severity or leniency. The HRM-SDT model is applied to data from a large-scale assessment and is shown to provide a useful summary of various aspects of the raters' performance.

Although apomixis can favorably perpetuate desired genotypes through successive seed generation, it may also bring about some difficulty for linkage analysis and quantitative trait locus mapping. In this article, we explore the issue of how apomixis affects the precision and power of linkage analysis with molecular markers. We derive a statistical model for estimating the linkage between different markers when some progeny are derived from apomixis. The model was constructed within the maximum likelihood framework and implemented with the EM algorithm. A series of procedures are formulated to test the linkage of markers, the rate of apomixis, and the degree of genetic interference during meiosis. The model was examined and validated through simulation studies. The model will provide a tool for linkage mapping and evolutionary studies for plant species that undergo apomixis.

Modal simulation and visualization in finite mixture models	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE			English	Article						Confidence regions; likelihood; mixture model; visualization	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; EM ALGORITHM; DISTRIBUTIONS; IDENTIFIABILITY; COMPONENTS; NUMBER; SCORE	Kim & Lindsay (2011a) proposed a new sampling-based visualization methodology, modal simulation, designed to describe the boundaries of the confidence regions generated by an inference function such as the likelihood. Once the sample points on the boundaries of the targeted confidence sets are created in a single simulation run, one can use those samples to describe every confidence set of interest without further numerical optimization. However, this method assumes that one is simulating the samples for the parameters from the likelihood region with a single mode.

In this paper, the signal intensities that are passed through the four-level holographic channel are modeled as a four Gaussian mixture with unknown DC offsets and the threshold levels are estimated based on the maximum likelihood criterion. We compare the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed algorithm with the non-adaptive threshold detection algorithm for various levels of DC offset and misalignments. Our proposed algorithm shows consistently acceptable performance when the DC offset variance is fixed or the misalignments are lower than 20%. When the DC offset varies with each page, the BER of the proposed method is acceptable when the misalignments are lower than 10% and DC offset variance is 0.001.

Such an incomplete data structure makes it difficult to investigate the impact of treatment on the occurrence of tumors. A three-state model (no tumor-tumor-death) is used to model events that occurred sequentially and to connect them. In this paper, we also employed a frailty effect to model the dependency of death on tumor occurrence. For the inference of parameters, an EM algorithm is considered. The method is applied to a real bladder tumor data set and a simulation study is performed to show the behavior of the proposed estimators. (C) 2010 The Korean Statistical Society.

J	Kiryu, H				Kiryu, Hisanori			Sufficient statistics and expectation maximization algorithms in phylogenetic tree models	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DNA-SEQUENCES; SUBSTITUTION RATE; EM ALGORITHM; HUMAN GENOME; EVOLUTION; SITES; RATES	Motivation: Measuring evolutionary conservation is a routine step in the identification of functional elements in genome sequences. Although a number of studies have proposed methods that use the continuous time Markov models (CTMMs) to find evolutionarily constrained elements, their probabilistic structures have been less frequently investigated. Results: In this article, we investigate a sufficient statistic for CTMMs. The statistic is composed of the fractional duration of nucleotide characters over evolutionary time, F(d), and the number of substitutions occurring in phylogenetic trees, N(s). We first derive basic properties of the sufficient statistic. Then, we derive an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the parameters of a phylogenetic model, which iteratively computes the expectation values of the sufficient statistic. We show that the EM algorithm exhibits much faster convergence than other optimization methods that use numerical gradient descent algorithms. Finally, we investigate the genome-wide distribution of fractional duration time F(d) which, unlike the number of substitutions N(s), has rarely been investigated. We show that F(d) has evolutionary information that is distinct from that in N(s), which may be useful for detecting novel types of evolutionary constraints existing in the human genome.

We first develop mixed-effects models, a type of hierarchical empirical Bayes generative models, for the time series. After demonstrating their utility in likelihood ratio classifiers (and the improvement over standard regression models for such classifiers), we develop novel Fisher kernels based on mixture of mixed-effects models and use them in support vector machine classifiers. The hierarchical generative model allows us to handle variations in sequence length and sampling interval gracefully. We also give nonparametric kernels not based on generative models, but rather on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply the methods to detecting cognitive decline from longitudinal clinical data on motor and neuropsychological tests. The likelihood ratio classifiers based on the neuropsychological tests perform better than than classifiers based on the motor behavior. Discriminant classifiers performed better than likelihood ratio classifiers for the motor behavior tests.

The proposed receiver iterates between a detection module and an estimation module. The detection module operates according to the sum-product algorithm and the factor graph framework in order to perform coherent maximum a posteriori bit detection in AWGN, using a PN estimate provided by the estimation module. The latter module, which results from the expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown PN samples, is implemented as a smoothing phase-locked loop that uses soft decisions provided by the detector. The separation between the detection and the estimation modules allows the use of an off-the-shelf (coherent) bit detector. The technique is further characterized by a very low computational complexity, a small error performance degradation and a small number of overhead symbols.

A E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid population, which segregates for rust resistance, was genotyped with 19 microsatellite markers belonging to linkage group 3 of the Eucalyptus genome. To quantify the segregation distortion, maximum likelihood (ML) models, specific to outbreeding populations, were used. These models consider the observed marker genotypes and the lethal locus viability as parameters. The ML solutions were obtained using the expectation-maximization algorithm. A lethal locus in the linkage group 3 was verified and mapped, with high confidence, between the microssatellites EMBRA 189 e EMBRA 122. This lethal locus causes an intense gametic selection from the male side. Its map position is 25 cM from the locus which controls the rust resistance in this population.

Detection of cis-Acting Regulatory SNPs Using Allelic Expression Data	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						allelic expression imbalance; cis-acting regulatory SNP; linkage phase; cDNA; genomic DNA; mixture model; likelihood ratio test; parametric bootstrap	HUMAN GENE-EXPRESSION; EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; GENOTYPE DATA; ASSOCIATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; HAPLOTYPES; IMBALANCE; INFERENCE; VARIANTS	Allelic expression (AE) imbalance between the two alleles of a gene can be used to detect cis-acting regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) in individuals heterozygous for a transcribed SNP (tSNP). In this paper, we propose three tests for AE analysis focusing on phase-unknown data and any degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the rSNP and tSNP: a test based on the minimum P-value of a one-sided F test and a two-sided t test (proposed previously for phase-unknown data), a test the combines the F and t tests, and a mixture-model-based test. We compare these three tests to the F and t tests and an existing regression-based test for phase-known data. We show that the ranking of the tests based on power depends most strongly on the magnitude of the LD between the rSNP and tSNP. For phase-unknown data, we find that under a range of scenarios, our proposed tests have higher power than the F and t tests when LD between the rSNP and tSNP is moderate (similar to 0.2<D'(RT)<similar to 0.8). We further demonstrate that the presence of a second ungenotyped rSNP almost never invalidates the proposed tests nor substantially changes their power rankings. For detection of cis-acting regulatory SNPs using phase-unknown AE data, we recommend the F test when the rSNP and tSNP are in or near linkage equilibrium (D'(RT)<0.2); the t test when the two SNPs are in strong LD (D'(RT)<0.7); and the mixture-model-based test for intermediate LD levels (0.2<D'(RT)<0.7).

However, existing methods solve this problem by ad hoc data imputation, followed by aveGation coefficient type approaches, which might annihilate important patterns present in the molecular profiling data. Moreover, these approaches do not consider and exploit the underlying experimental design information that specifies the replication mechanisms. We develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) type algorithm to estimate the correlation structure using incomplete and replicated molecular profiling data with a priori known replication mechanism. The approach is sufficiently generalized to be applicable to any known replication mechanism. In case of unknown replication mechanism, it is reduced to the parsimonious model introduced previously. The efficacy of our approach was first evaluated by comprehensively comparing various bivariate and multivariate imputation approaches using simulation studies. Results from real-world data analysis further confirmed the superior performance of the proposed approach to the commonly used approaches, where we assessed the robustness of the method using data sets with up to 30 percent missing values.

Regularized versus non-regularized statistical reconstruction techniques	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						PET; SPECT; Emission tomography; Reconstruction algorithms		An important feature of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) is the stochastic property of real clinical data. Statistical algorithms such as ordered subset-expectation maximization (OSEM) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) are a direct consequence of the stochastic nature of the data. The principal difference between these two algorithms is that OSEM is a non-regularized approach, while the MAP is a regularized algorithm. From the theoretical point of view, reconstruction problems belong to the class of ill-posed problems and should be considered using regularization. Regularization introduces an additional unknown regularization parameter into the reconstruction procedure as compared with non-regularized algorithms. However, a comparison of non-regularized OSEM and regularized MAP algorithms with fixed regularization parameters has shown very minor difference between reconstructions. This problem is analyzed in the present paper. To improve the reconstruction quality, a method of local regularization is proposed based on the spatially adaptive regularization parameter. The MAP algorithm with local regularization was tested in reconstruction of the Hoffman brain phantom. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data-driven local bandwidth selection for additive models with missing data	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Missing data; Imputation; Wild Bootstrap; Smoothing parameter; Backfitting	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; INCOMPLETE DATA; ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DATA MECHANISM; EM ALGORITHM; COVARIATE; INTEGRATION; IMPUTATION	This paper deals in the nonparametric estimation of additive models in the presence of missing data in the response variable. Specifically in the case of additive models estimated by the Backfitting algorithm with local polynomial smoothers [1]. Three estimators are presented, one based on the available data and two based on a complete sample from imputation techniques. We also develop a data-driven local bandwidth selector based on a Wild Bootstrap approximation of the mean squared error of the estimators. The performance of the estimators and the local bootstrap bandwidth selection method are explored through simulation experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, CW; Tsai, YR				Chen, Chung-Wei; Tsai, Yuh-Ren			Location Privacy in Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks upon the Requirement of Data Survivability	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wireless sensor network (WSN); location privacy; data integrity; data survivability		Wireless sensor networks have been used recently to obtain forensic evidence. One of the basic principles of obtaining forensic evidence is to maintain the integrity of the evidence. To increase the probability of retaining data integrity, the data replication strategy was proposed for unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSN), wherein the data integrity was quantified by data survival rate. However, the distribution of multiple data replicas may expose the location information of some critical nodes, thereby resulting in a high possibility of being attacked by the adversary. In this paper, we study the trade-off between the data survival rate and the location privacy of a critical node in an UWSN. Obviously, the increase in the number of data replicas can improve the data survival rate, but could severely degrade the location privacy of a critical node. Based on the captured data replicas, we propose three location estimation algorithms, the coordinate median, average of overlapping area and expectation-maximization approaches. The location estimation performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated and the trade-off between the data survival rate are investigated. According to the simulation results, the location privacy degrades severely with the increase in the number of data replicas.

More precisely, we consider a network of noisy sensors which measure a common scalar unknown parameter. We assume that a fraction of the nodes is subject to the same (but possibly unknown) offset. The goal for each node is to simultaneously estimate the common unknown parameter and to identify the class each node belongs to, only through local communication and computation. We propose a distributed estimator based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) approach and we show that, in case the offset is known, this estimator converges to the centralized ML as the number of sensor nodes goes to infinity. We also compare this strategy with a distributed implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; we show tradeoffs via numerical simulations in terms of robustness, speed of convergence and implementation simplicity.

Results show that growth patterns were segmented in two worldwide regimes, the one characterized by convergence in per capita income, and the other by divergence. Interestingly, when three historical epochs are distinctly analyzed, in order to investigate the empirical link between globalization and convergence, the dynamics which dominated over the whole period seem to have emerged only during the post-1950 years. In contrast, the First Global Wave was marked by persistent heterogeneities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling of extended objects using sparse multi-aspect High Range Resolution radar data set	IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION			English	Article							PARAMETRIC MODEL; IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	The two-dimensional (2D) geometry of extended objects is modelled as a discrete constellation of a small number of scattering centres. Each scattering centre is characterised by its 2D location and extension, as well as by its observability from aspect angles spanning a wide angular interval. The considered input information of the modelling consists of high range resolution (HRR) data sets, which are measured by a network of scanning surveillance radars from a limited set of aspect angles of the object. During the short time-on-target of the antennas within each radar scan, inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging is performed. The Expectation-Maximisation (ER) algorithm is applied in order to fit each ISAR image to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), pertaining to the aspect angle applicable to the respective radar. A merging algorithm for clustering all the partial GMMs into a unique 2D model of the extended object is designed. Cluster validation criteria are applied for correct alignment of the multi-radar multi-scan object model estimates. A Mixture of Gaussians classifier (MOGC), which is based on representation of each object by the estimated 2D model, is discussed. Results from application of the algorithms to two measured HRR radar data sets are presented.

We compute the maximum likelihood estimator with an EM-algorithm and a likelihood ratio statistic that takes the family structure into account. As we are interested in applying this to twin data we also allow observations on single children, so that monozygotic twins can be included. We allow non-zero recombination fraction between the loci of interest, so that linkage disequilibrium between both linked and unlinked loci can be tested. The EM-algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimator of the haplotype frequencies and the likelihood ratio test-statistic, are described in detail. It is shown that the usual estimators of haplotype frequencies based on ignoring that the sibs are related are inefficient, and the likelihood ratio test for testing that the loci are in linkage disequilibrium.

J	Kammoun, I; Siala, M				Kammoun, Ines; Siala, Mohamed			MAP channel estimation with turbo processing for orthogonal space-time block coded MISO systems	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TRANSMIT DIVERSITY; BLIND DETECTION	In this paper, we investigate fast time-varying channel estimation for two orthogonal space-time block-coded systems with either two or three transmit antennas and with one receive antenna. We propose an iterative expectation-maximisation-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) semi-blind algorithm for the estimation of the discrete propagation channels seen from the transmit antennas. This algorithm requires a convenient representation of the channel using a discrete version of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion theorem. It incorporates the coded structure of each block in a turbo-processing fashion and uses the MAP training-based channel estimation algorithm for its optimum initialisation. The transmit antennas are assumed to be spatially correlated for the system with two transmit antennas and spatially uncorrelated for the three-antenna system. The validity of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by simulation results. The performance of the proposed receivers, based on MAP channel estimation, for the two systems approaches that of the perfect channel state information receiver, even for very time selective fading channels.

A generalized Erlang (GEr) distribution can be made by convolution of the third order ME distributions similar to the formulation of an Erlang distribution with exponential distributions. We give a sufficient condition for the representation to make a probability density function and we implement a fitting algorithm into a GEr distribution set by solving a nonlinear optimization problem with the EM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed fitting algorithm is presented by applying fitting methods to sets of synthetic data and measurement data. We present comparative numerical simulation results of our approach and other methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, SH; Yang, HJ; Ng, KS				Kim, Sun Hee; Yang, Hyung Jeong; Ng, Kam Swee			Incremental expectation maximization principal component analysis for missing value imputation for coevolving EEG data	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Missing value imputation; Hidden pattern discovery; Expectation maximization; Principal component analysis	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; INCOMPLETE DATA; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM; SCHEME; MODELS	Missing values occur in bio-signal processing for various reasons, including technical problems or biological characteristics. These missing values are then either simply excluded or substituted with estimated values for further processing. When the missing signal values are estimated for electroencephalography (EEG) signals, an example where electrical signals arrive quickly and successively, rapid processing of high-speed data is required for immediate decision making. In this study, we propose an incremental expectation maximization principal component analysis (iEMPCA) method that automatically estimates missing values from multivariable EEG time series data without requiring a whole and complete data set. The proposed method solves the problem of a biased model, which inevitably results from simply removing incomplete data rather than estimating them, and thus reduces the loss of information by incorporating missing values in real time. By using an incremental approach, the proposed method also minimizes memory usage and processing time of continuously arriving data.

Although analysis of flow cytometry data has traditionally considered one or two markers at a time, there has been increasing interest in multidimensional analysis. However, flow cytometers are limited in the number of markers they can jointly observe, which is typically a fraction of the number of markers of interest. For this reason, practitioners often perform multiple assays based on different, overlapping combinations of markers. In this paper, we address the challenge of imputing the high-dimensional jointly distributed values of marker attributes based on overlapping marginal observations. We show that simple nearest neighbor based imputation can lead to spurious subpopulations in the imputed data and introduce an alternative approach based on nearest neighbor imputation restricted to a cell's subpopulation. This requires us to perform clustering with missing data, which we address with a mixture model approach and novel EM algorithm. Since mixture model fitting may be ill-posed in this context, we also develop techniques to initialize the EM algorithm using domain knowledge. We demonstrate our approach on real flow cytometry data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The validity of an unmatched pair can be provided if all eigenvalues of the multiplication of a backprojector and a projector are positive. However, the verification of this condition requires heavy computation in practice. In this paper, we show that if the backprojector represents the adjoint transform of the linear transform defined by a given projector, then the projector/backprojector pair is valid. We claim that selection of a valid unmatched backprojector can be much more easily performed by finding a problem-specific inner product than by computing the backprojector directly from the projector using positivity condition on eigenvalues. To support our claim: we show how we select problem-specific; inner products and compute corresponding unmatched backprojectors in parallel hole SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) with distance-dependent detector blurring. We provide simulation results using unmatched projector/backprojector pairs in ML-EM (maximum likelihood-expectation maximization) and ART (algebraic reconstruction technique) iterations.

J	Lukic, T; Lindblad, J; Sladoje, N				Lukic, Tibor; Lindblad, Joakim; Sladoje, Natasa			Regularized image denoising based on spectral gradient optimization	INVERSE PROBLEMS			English	Article							TOTAL VARIATION MINIMIZATION; HALF-QUADRATIC MINIMIZATION; BARZILAI-BORWEIN METHOD; UNCONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION; EM ALGORITHM; RECOVERY; RESTORATION; RECONSTRUCTION	Image restoration methods, such as denoising, deblurring, inpainting, etc, are often based on the minimization of an appropriately defined energy function. We consider energy functions for image denoising which combine a quadratic data-fidelity term and a regularization term, where the properties of the latter are determined by a used potential function. Many potential functions are suggested for different purposes in the literature. We compare the denoising performance achieved by ten different potential functions. Several methods for efficient minimization of regularized energy functions exist. Most are only applicable to particular choices of potential functions, however. To enable a comparison of all the observed potential functions, we propose to minimize the objective function using a spectral gradient approach; spectral gradient methods put very weak restrictions on the used potential function. We present and evaluate the performance of one spectral conjugate gradient and one cyclic spectral gradient algorithm, and conclude from experiments that both are well suited for the task. We compare the performance with three total variation-based state-of-the-art methods for image denoising. From the empirical evaluation, we conclude that denoising using the Huber potential (for images degraded by higher levels of noise; signal-to-noise ratio below 10 dB) and the Geman and McClure potential (for less noisy images), in combination with the spectral conjugate gradient minimization algorithm, shows the overall best performance.

J	Xu, P; Wang, JK; Qi, F				Xu, Peng; Wang, Jinkuan; Qi, Feng			Improved H-infinity channel estimator based on EM for MIMO-OFDM systems	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article						multiple input multiple output (MIMO); orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM); channel estimation; H-infinity; expectation maximization (EM); angle domain	LINEAR-ESTIMATION; WIRELESS SYSTEMS; KREIN SPACES; DESIGN	H-infinity estimator is generally implemented in time-variant state-space models, but it leads to high complexity when the model is used for multiple input multiple output with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Thus, an H-infinity estimator over time-invariant system models is proposed, which modifies the Krein space accordingly. In order to avoid the large matrix inversion and multiplication required in each OFDM symbol from different transmit antennas, expectation maximization (EM) is developed to reduce the high computational load. Joint estimation over multiple OFDM symbols is used to resist the high pilot overhead generated by the increasing number of transmit antennas. Finally, the performance of the proposed estimator is enhanced via an angle-domain process. Through performance analysis and simulation experiments, it is indicated that the proposed algorithm has a better mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance than the optimal least square (LS) estimator. Joint estimation over multiple OFDM symbols can not only reduce the pilot overhead but also promote the channel performance.

J	Zhou, Y; Ma, WJ; Sheng, XN; Wang, HK				Zhou, Ying; Ma, Weijun; Sheng, Xiaona; Wang, Huakun			A new strategy for estimating two-locus recombination fractions under some natural inequality restrictions	JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article						constrained parameter problems; linkage analysis; restricted projection algorithm; recombination fraction	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; MULTILOCUS LINKAGE ANALYSIS; EM ALGORITHM; HUMANS; MAPS	Linkage analysis is now being widely used to map markers on each chromosome in the human genome, to map genetic diseases, and to identify genetic forms of common diseases. Two-locus linkage analysis and multi-locus analysis have been investigated comprehensively, and many computer programs have been developed to perform linkage analysis. Yet there exists a shortcoming in traditional methods, i.e., the parameter space of two-locus recombination fractions has not been emphasized sufficiently in the usual analyses. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for estimating the two-locus recombination fractions based on data of backcross family in the framework of some natural and necessary parameter restrictions. The new strategy is based on a restricted projection algorithm, which can provide fast reasonable estimates of recombination fraction, and can therefore serve as a superior alternative algorithm. Results obtained from both real and simulated data indicate that the new algorithm performs well in the estimation of recombination fractions and outperforms current methods.

The analysis is carried out from the perspective of ANOVA panel data models with general errors. The classification intervals of the grouped observations may vary from one to another, thus the missing observations are in fact a particular case of grouping. The proposed Algorithm (1) estimates the parameters of the panel data models; (2) evaluates the covariance matrices of the asymptotic distribution of the time-dependent parameters assuming that the number of time periods, T, is fixed and the number of individuals, N, tends to infinity and similarly, of the individual parameters when T -> a and N is fixed; and, finally, (3) uses these asymptotic covariance matrix estimations to analyse the variance of the panel data.

Revisiting stopping rules for iterative methods used in emission tomography	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						PET; Expectation maximization; Image reconstruction; Stopping rule	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EM ALGORITHM	The expectation maximization algorithm is commonly used to reconstruct images obtained from positron emission tomography sinograms. For images with acceptable signal to noise ratios, iterations are terminated prior to convergence. A new quantitative and reproducible stopping rule is designed and validated on simulations using a Monte-Carlo generated transition matrix with a Poisson noise distribution on the sinogram data. Iterations are terminated at the solution which yields the most probable estimate of the emission densities while matching the sinogram data. It is more computationally efficient and more accurate than the standard stopping rule based on the Pearson's chi(2) test. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to develop the hypotheses testing of interest and the local influence diagnostics, closed-form expressions of the marginal likelihood, the score function and the observed information matrix are presented. Additionally, an EM-type algorithm for evaluating the unrestricted and restricted maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under equality constraints on the regression coefficients is examined. Also, we derive the appropriate matrices to assess the local influence on the parameters estimate under different perturbation schemes. The results and methods are applied to a dental clinical trial presented in Hadgu and Koch [Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistic 9 (1999) 161-178].	[Labra, F. V.; Lachos, V.

J	Shan, HH; Banerjee, A				Shan, Hanhuai; Banerjee, Arindam			Mixed-membership naive Bayes models	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Mixed-membership; Generative models; Variational inference; Logistic regression	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMAGES	In recent years, mixture models have found widespread usage in discovering latent cluster structure from data. A popular special case of finite mixture models is the family of naive Bayes (NB) models, where the probability of a feature vector factorizes over the features for any given component of the mixture. Despite their popularity, naive Bayes models do not allow data points to belong to different component clusters with varying degrees, i.e., mixed memberships, which puts a restriction on their modeling ability. In this paper, we propose mixed-membership naive Bayes (MMNB) models. On one hand, MMNB can be viewed as a generalization of NB by putting a Dirichlet prior on top to allow mixed memberships. On the other hand, MMNB can also be viewed as a generalization of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with the ability to handle heterogeneous feature vectors with different types of features, e.g., real, categorical, etc.. We propose two variational inference algorithms to learn MMNB models. The first one is based on ideas originally used in LDA, and the second one uses substantially fewer variational parameters, leading to a significantly faster algorithm. Further, we extend MMNB/LDA to discriminative mixed-membership models for classification by suitably combining MMNB/LDA with multi-class logistic regression. The efficacy of the proposed mixed-membership models is demonstrated by extensive experiments on several datasets, including UCI benchmarks, recommendation systems, and text datasets.

J	Shen, PS				Shen, Pao-Sheng			The nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for middle-censored data	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						Middle censoring; Mixed interval censoring; Self-consistent	SELF-CONSISTENT ESTIMATOR; ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES; SURVIVAL FUNCTIONS; TRUNCATED DATA; INTERVAL; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHMS	In this note, we consider data subjected to middle censoring where the variable of interest becomes unobservable when it falls within an interval of censorship. We demonstrate that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) of distribution function can be obtained by using Turnbull's (1976) EM algorithm or self-consistent estimating equation (Jammalamadaka and Mangalam, 2003) with an initial estimator which puts mass only on the innermost intervals. The consistency of the NPMLE can be established based on the asymptotic properties of self-consistent estimators (SCE) with mixed interval-censored data (Yu et al., 2000, 2001).

Simulated rat phantoms with partial volume effect and different noise levels were generated to evaluate the performance of the method. The partial volume correction was performed using an EM deblurring method before the segmentation. The EM-MOP outperforms the EM-MOP in terms of the estimated spatial accuracy, quantitative accuracy, robustness and computing efficiency. To conclude, the proposed EM-MOP method is a reliable and accurate approach for estimating uptake levels and spatial distributions across target tissues in microPET C-11-raclopride imaging studies.

J	Wang, WF; Xiong, R; Chu, J				Wang, Wen-fei; Xiong, Rong; Chu, Jian			Mapbuilding for dynamic environments using grid vectors	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Grid vector; Line; Segments; Dynamic; Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); Expectation maximization (EM)	MOBILE ROBOTS; LOCALIZATION; FILTERS; SLAM	This paper addresses the problem of creating a geometric map with a mobile robot in a dynamic indoor environment. To form an accurate model of the environment, we present a novel map representation called the 'grid vector', which combines each vector that represents a directed line segment with a slender occupancy grid map. A modified expectation maximization (EM) based approach is proposed to evaluate the dynamic objects and simultaneously estimate the robot path and the map of the environment. The probability of each grid vector is evaluated in the expectation step and then used to distinguish the vector into static and dynamic ones. The robot path and map are estimated in the maximization step with a graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method. The representation we introduce provides advantages on making the SLAM method strictly statistic, reducing memory cost, identifying the dynamic objects, and improving the accuracy of the data associations. The SLAM algorithm we present is efficient in computation and convergence. Experiments on three different kinds of data sets show that our representation and algorithm can generate an accurate static map in a dynamic indoor environment.

To address this issue, cognitive radio (CR) has been proposed as a promising new technology. In particular, it can be utilized to enable secondary users (SUs) to share the licensed spectrum if they do not cause harmful interference to primary users. As such, the transmission power of an SU should be limited, even when it accesses spectrum holes. Therefore, multihop transmission is a potential method to deliver the data of SUs over long distances. However, due to unstable spectrum opportunity, heterogeneous spectrum environment, and limited signaling overhead, how to achieve reliable and efficient transmission is a challenging issue. In this paper, we first propose an agile rateless coded relaying (ARCOR) scheme for CRs, where discontinuous spectrum holes in three dimensions can be aggregated by employing rateless codes under a heterogeneous spectrum environment. An additional degree of freedom is also provided by utilizing rateless codes to set the number of decoding relays, which can be used to balance the first and second hops. Without assuming perfect spectrum sensing, we analyze and optimize the end-to-end throughput with the presence of sensing errors. Furthermore, a block-search-based algorithm is proposed to find the optimal number of decoding relays with low complexity. Simulation results will show that the optimized ARCOR scheme can achieve high spectrum efficiency and combat imperfect sensing results in CRs.

An EM Algorithm for Fitting a Four-Parameter Logistic Model to Binary Dose-Response Data	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Binomial data; Hill model; Logistic regression; Quantal response	CARCINOGENICITY	This article is motivated by the need of biological and environmental scientists to fit a popular nonlinear model to binary dose-response data. The four-parameter logistic model, also known as the Hill model, generalizes the usual logistic regression model to allow the lower and upper response asymptotes to be greater than zero and less than one, respectively. This article develops an EM algorithm, which is naturally suited for maximum likelihood estimation under the Hill model after conceptualizing the problem as a mixture of subpopulations in which some subjects respond regardless of dose, some fail to respond regardless of dose, and some respond with a probability that depends on dose. The EM algorithm leads to a pair of functionally independent two-parameter optimizations and is easy to program. Not only can this approach be computationally appealing compared to simultaneous optimization with respect to all four parameters, but it also facilitates estimating covariances, incorporating predictors, and imposing constraints. This article is motivated by, and the EM algorithm is illustrated with, data from a toxicology study of the dose effects of selenium on the death rates of flies. Other biological and environmental applications, as well as medical and agricultural applications, are also described briefly. Computer code for implementing the EM algorithm is available as supplemental material online.

J	Fujimoto, Y; Hino, H; Murata, N				Fujimoto, Yu; Hino, Hideitsu; Murata, Noboru			An Estimation of Generalized Bradley-Terry Models Based on the em Algorithm	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							INFORMATION GEOMETRY; BREGMAN DIVERGENCE; MULTICLASS; ROBUST	The Bradley-Terry model is a statistical representation for one's preference or ranking data by using pairwise comparison results of items. For estimation of the model, several methods based on the sum of weighted Kullback-Leibler divergences have been proposed from various contexts. The purpose of this letter is to interpret an estimation mechanism of the Bradley-Terry model from the viewpoint of flatness, a fundamental notion used in information geometry. Based on this point of view, a new estimation method is proposed on a framework of the em algorithm. The proposed method is different in its objective function from that of conventional methods, especially in treating unobserved comparisons, and it is consistently interpreted in a probability simplex. An estimation method with weight adaptation is also proposed from a viewpoint of the sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method works appropriately, and weight adaptation improves accuracy of the estimate.

The package fits both parametric and nonparametric models using either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for likelihood models) or the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for Bayesian models). For all models, the individual-level data can be directly incorporated into the estimation whenever such data are available. Along with in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, the package also provides a functionality which allows one to quantify the effect of data aggregation on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing under the parametric likelihood models. This paper illustrates the usage of eco with several real data examples that are also part of the package.

Inferring Haplotypes of Copy Number Variations From High-Throughput Data With Uncertainty	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS			English	Article						copy number; variation; EM algorithm; haplotype inference; phasing	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; HUMAN GENOME; POPULATION; INFERENCE; ASSOCIATION; VARIANTS; ALLELE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FREQUENCIES; ALGORITHM	Accurate information on haplotypes and diplotypes (haplotype pairs) is required for population-genetic analyses; however, microarrays do not provide data on a haplotype or diplotype at a copy number variation (CNV) locus; they only provide data on the total number of copies over a diplotype or an unphased sequence genotype (e. g., AAB, unlike AB of single nucleotide polymorphism). Moreover, such copy numbers or genotypes are often incorrectly determined when microarray signal intensities derived from different copy numbers or genotypes are not clearly separated due to noise. Here we report an algorithm to infer CNV haplotypes and individuals' diplotypes at multiple loci from noisy microarray data, utilizing the probability that a signal intensity may be derived from different underlying copy numbers or genotypes. Performing simulation studies based on known diplotypes and an error model obtained from real microarray data, we demonstrate that this probabilistic approach succeeds in accurate inference (error rate: 1-2%) from noisy data, whereas previous deterministic approaches failed (error rate: 12-18%). Applying this algorithm to real microarray data, we estimated haplotype frequencies and diplotypes in 1486 CNV regions for 100 individuals. Our algorithm will facilitate accurate population-genetic analyses and powerful disease association studies of CNVs.

J	Lu, L; Wu, HC				Lu, Lu; Wu, Hsiao-Chun			Robust Expectation-Maximization Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Algorithm for Wideband Source Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Direction-of-arrival (DOA); expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; maximum likelihood	SOURCE LOCALIZATION; EM ALGORITHM; NOISE	Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for wideband source signals using far-field acoustic sensors has recently drawn much research interest. A wide variety of DOA estimation approaches are based on the maximum-likelihood objective. In this paper, we tackle the DOA estimation problem based on the realistic assumption that the sources are corrupted by spatially nonwhite noise. We explore the respective limitations of two popular DOA methods to solve this problem-the stepwise-concentrated maximum-likelihood (SC-ML) and approximately concentrated maximum-likelihood (AC-ML) algorithms-and design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, we provide the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the computational-complexity analyses for the aforementioned DOA estimation schemes. Through Monte Carlo simulations and our derived CRLB and computational-complexity analyses, it is demonstrated that our proposed EM algorithm outperforms the SC-ML and AC-ML methods in terms of the DOA estimation accuracy and computational complexity.

This technique is very useful for optimum solution, k-means is one of the simplest and the most famous methods that is based on square error criterion. This algorithm depends on initial states and converges to local optima. Some recent researches show that k-means algorithm has been successfully applied to combinatorial optimization problems for clustering. In this paper, we purpose a novel algorithm that is based on combining two algorithms of clustering; k-means and Modify Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. It is named hybrid K-MICA. In addition, we use a method called modified expectation maximization (EM) to determine number of clusters. The experimented results show that the new method carries out better results than the ACO, PSO, Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) and k-means.

J	Ruan, LY; Yuan, M; Zou, H				Ruan, Lingyan; Yuan, Ming; Zou, Hui			Regularized Parameter Estimation in High-Dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SELECTION; LASSO	Finite gaussian mixture models are widely used in statistics thanks to their great flexibility. However, parameter estimation for gaussian mixture models with high dimensionality can be challenging because of the large number of parameters that need to be estimated. In this letter, we propose a penalized likelihood estimator to address this difficulty. The l(1)-type penalty we impose on the inverse covariance matrices encourages sparsity on its entries and therefore helps to reduce the effective dimensionality of the problem. We show that the proposed estimate can be efficiently computed using an expectation-maximization algorithm. To illustrate the practical merits of the proposed method, we consider its applications in model-based clustering and mixture discriminant analysis. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data show that the new method is a valuable tool for high-dimensional data analysis.

Alan; Atabakhsh, Homa; Chen, Hsinchun			A hierarchical Naive Bayes model for approximate identity matching	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						EM algorithm; Entity matching; Identity management; Hierarchical Naive Bayes model; Semi-supervised learning		Organizations often manage identity information for their customers, vendors, and employees. Identity management is critical to various organizational practices ranging from customer relationship management to crime investigation. The task of searching for a specific identity is difficult because disparate identity information may exist due to the issues related to unintentional errors and intentional deception. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Naive Bayes model that improves existing identity matching techniques in terms of searching effectiveness. Experiments show that our proposed model performs significantly better than the exact-match based matching technique. With 50% training instances labeled, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves a performance comparable to the fully supervised record comparison algorithm. The semi-supervised learning greatly reduces the efforts of manually labeling training instances without significant performance degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wang, G.

To remedy this, a PET ring diameter has to be much larger than the required size of field of view (FOV), and therefore the cost goes up. Measurement of depth-of-interaction (DOI) information is effective to reduce the parallax error and improve the image quality. This study is aimed at developing a practical method to incorporate DOI information in PET sinogram generation and image reconstruction processes and evaluate its efficacy through Monte Carlo simulation. An animal PET system with 30-mm long LSO crystals and 2-mm DOI measurement accuracy was simulated and list-mode PET data were collected. A sinogram generation method was proposed to bin each coincidence event to the correct LOR location according to both incident crystal indices and DOT positions of the two annihilation photons. The sinograms were reconstructed with an iterative OSMAPEM (ordered subset maximum a posteriori expectation maximization) algorithm. Two phantoms (a rod source phantom and a Derenzo phantom) were simulated, and the benefits of DOT were investigated in terms of reconstructed source diameter (FWHM) and source positioning accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method works well to incorporate DOI information in data processing, which not only overcomes the image distortion problem but also significantly improves image resolution and resolution uniformity and results in satisfactory image quality.

However, the application of it to medical image segmentation faces some difficulties. First, estimation of the number of components is still an open question. Second, the speed of it for large medical image is slow. Moreover, GMMs has the problem of noise sensitivity. In this paper, the kernel density estimation method is used to estimate the number of components K, and three strategies are proposed to improve the segmentation speed of GMMs. First, a histogram stratification sampling strategy is proposed to reduce the size of the training data. Second, a binning strategy is proposed to search the neighbor points of each center data to compute the approximate density function of the samples. Third, a hill-climbing algorithm with the dynamic step size is designed to find the local maxima of the density function. The kernel density estimation method and sampling technology reduce the effect of noise. Experimental results with the simulated brain images and real CT images show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in generating explainable segmentations with faster speed than the common GMMs algorithm.

In this study, we develop a general parametric AFT model for identifying survival trait loci, in which the flexible generalized F distribution, including many commonly used distributions as special cases, is specified as the baseline survival distribution. EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters is given. Simulations are conducted to validate the flexibility and the utility of the proposed mapping procedure. In analyzing survival time following hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) of mice in an F(2) mating population, the generalized F distribution performed best among the six competing survival distributions and detected four QTLs controlling differential HALI survival.

J	Chen, BJ; Zhou, XH				Chen, Baojiang; Zhou, Xiao-Hua			Non-homogeneous Markov process models with informative observations with an application to Alzheimer's disease	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Markov; Missing data; Non-homogeneous; Transformation	MISSING-DATA; LOCAL INFLUENCE; INCOMPLETE-DATA; EM ALGORITHM; PANEL-DATA; TIME; SENSITIVITY; PROGRESSION; ASSUMPTION; LIKELIHOOD	Identifying risk factors for transition rates among normal cognition, mildly cognitive impairment, dementia and death in an Alzheimer's disease study is very important. It is known that transition rates among these states are strongly time dependent. While Markov process models are often used to describe these disease progressions, the literature mainly focuses on time homogeneous processes, and limited tools are available for dealing with non-homogeneity. Further, patients may choose when they want to visit the clinics, which creates informative observations. In this paper, we develop methods to deal with non-homogeneous Markov processes through time scale transformation when observation times are pre-planned with some observations missing. Maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm is derived for parameter estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method works well under a variety of situations. An application to the Alzheimer's disease study identifies that there is a significant increase in transition rates as a function of time. Furthermore, our models reveal that the non-ignorable missing mechanism is perhaps reasonable.

J	Hung, HL; Huang, YF				Hung, Ho-Lung; Huang, Yung-Fa			PEAK TO AVERAGE POWER RATIO REDUCTION OF MULTICARRIER TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS USING ELECTROMAGNETISM-LIKE METHOD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Multi-carrier transmission systems; Peak-to-average power ratio; Partial transmitting sequence; Electromagnetism-like method	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SCHEME; OFDM; ALGORITHM; CDMA	In this paper, a reduced-complexity partial transmit sequences (PTS) scheme is proposed to resolve the intrinsic high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem of multi-carrier transmission systems signal with low computational complexity. The conventional PTS technique is highly successful in PAPR reduction for multi-carrier transmission systems signals, but the considerable computational complexity for the required search through a high-dimensional vector space is a potential problem for practical implementation. To reduce the search complexity while still improving the PAPR statistics, stochastic optimization techniques such as the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, genetic algorithm (CA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have recently been proposed to search for a phase factor that reduces both the PAPR statistics and the computational load. In this paper, a novel stochastic optimization approach, that the electromagnetism-like (EM) algorithm is applied in reducing the PAPR of a multicarrier transmission systems signal. From the results, it can be seen that a proposed scheme based-iterative PTS can be easily implemented with low combining complexity, still maintaining a better BER performance, compared to the conventional PTS approach. Simulations have been conducted and the results show that the BER performance of the investigated EM-PTS is increased by minimizing the signal's nonlinear distortion caused by HPA.

ISWLS: Novel Algorithm for Image Reconstruction in PET	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Image reconstruction; positron emission tomography (PET); small-animal imaging	TOMOGRAPHY	The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel empirical iterative algorithm for medical image reconstruction, under the short name ISWLS (image space weighted least squares), which is expected to have image space reconstruction algorithm (ISRA) properties in noise manipulation and weighted least-squares (WLS) acceleration of the reconstruction process. We used phantom data from a prototype small-animal positron emission tomography system and the methods presented here are applied to 2-D sinograms. Further, we assess the performance of the new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), to expectation maximization maximum likelihood (EM-ML), ISRA, and WLS. All algorithms are compared in terms of cross-correlation coefficient, reconstruction time, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). As it turns out, ISWLS presents higher CNRs than EM-ML, ISRA, and SART for objects of different sizes. Also, ISWLS shows similar performance to WLS during the first iterations but it has better noise manipulation. Finally, ordered subsets ISWLS (OS-ISWLS), the OS version of ISWLS, shows its best performance between the first six-nine iterations. Its behavior seems to be a compromise between OS-ISRA and OS-WLS.

Different from traditional method, an adaptive mean shift algorithm was adopted to adaptively smooth the query image and create a pixon-based image representation. Then K-means algorithm was employed to provide an initial segmentation by classifying the pixons in image into a predefined number of tissue classes. By using this segmentation as initialization, expectation-maximization (EM) iterations composed of bias correction, a priori digital brain atlas information, and Markov random field (MRF) segmentation were processed. Pixons were assigned with final labels when the algorithm converges. The adoption of bias correction and brain atlas made the current method more suitable for brain image segmentation than the previous pixon based segmentation algorithm. The proposed method was validated on both simulated normal brain images from BrainWeb and real brain images from the IBSR public dataset. Compared with some other popular MRI segmentation methods, the proposed method exhibited a higher degree of accuracy in segmenting both simulated and real 3D MRI brain data.

Sensitivity to initial values in full non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic model	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; EM ALGORITHM; MONTE-CARLO; RECOVERY; CURVES	Parameters of the two-parameter logistic model are generally estimated via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by the maximum-likelihood (ML) method. In so doing, it is beneficial to estimate the common prior distribution of the latent ability from data. Full non-parametric ML (FNPML) estimation allows estimation of the latent distribution with maximum flexibility, as the distribution is modelled non-parametrically on a number of (freely moving) support points. It is generally assumed that EM estimation of the two-parameter logistic model is not influenced by initial values, but studies on this topic are unavailable. Therefore, the present study investigates the sensitivity to initial values in FNPML estimation. In contrast to the common assumption, initial values are found to have notable influence: for a standard convergence criterion, item discrimination and difficulty parameter estimates as well as item characteristic curve (ICC) recovery were influenced by initial values. For more stringent criteria, item parameter estimates were mainly influenced by the initial latent distribution, whilst ICC recovery was unaffected. The reason for this might be a flat surface of the log-likelihood function, which would necessitate setting a sufficiently tight convergence criterion for accurate recovery of item parameters.

MixtureTree: a program for constructing phylogeny	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							TREES; INFERENCE	Background: MixtureTree v1.0 is a Linux based program (written in C++) which implements an algorithm based on mixture models for reconstructing phylogeny from binary sequence data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition to the mixture algorithm with three different optimization options, the program also implements a bootstrap procedure with majority-rule consensus. Results: The MixtureTree program written in C++ is a Linux based package. The User's Guide and source codes will be available at http://math.asu.edu/similar to scchen/MixtureTree.html Conclusions: The efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than some classical methods, such as Neighbor-Joining method, Maximum Parsimony method and Maximum Likelihood method. The shortcoming of the mixture tree algorithms, for example timing consuming, can be improved by implementing other revised Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithms instead of the traditional EM algorithm.

Background and Clutter Mixture Distributions for Active Sonar Statistics	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Clutter; expectation-maximization (EM); generalized Pareto; K-distribution; log-normal; maximum likelihood; method of moments; mixture model; non-Rayleigh; Weibull	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; K-DISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS; REVERBERATION; BACKSCATTER; PATCHES; BOTTOM; ECHOES; MODEL	False alarms in active sonar systems arising from physical objects in the ocean (e. g., rocks, fish, or seaweed) are often called clutter. A variety of statistical models have been proposed for representing the sonar probability of false alarm (P(fa)) in the presence of clutter, including the log-normal, generalized-Pareto, Weibull, and K distributions. However, owing to the potential sparseness of the clutter echoes within the analysis window, a mixture distribution comprising one of the clutter distributions and a Rayleigh-distributed envelope (i.e., an exponentially distributed intensity) to represent diffuse background scattering and noise is proposed. Parameter-estimation techniques based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are developed for mixtures containing the aforementioned clutter distributions. While the standard EM algorithm handles the mixture containing log-normal clutter, the EM-gradient algorithm, which combines the EM algorithm with a one-step Newton optimization, is necessary for the generalized-Pareto and Weibull cases. The mixture containing K-distributed clutter requires development of a variant of the EM algorithm exploiting method-of-moments parameter estimation. Evaluation of three midfrequency active-sonar data examples, spanning mildly to very heavy-tailed P(fa), illustrates that the mixture models provide a better fit than single-component models. As might be expected, inference on clutter-source scattering based on the shape parameter of the clutter distribution is shown to be less biased using the mixture model compared with a single-component distribution when the data contain both clutter echoes and diffuse background scattering or noise.

The STSS model is estimated from data using the EM algorithm within the maximum likelihood framework. The estimation is extended by including the estimation of noise and disturbance variance hyperparameters and robustifying the EM algorithm through square root filtering. The ideas are demonstrated on a simulated STSS model, simulated smart beam and real data from smart structures.

J	Bentler, PM; Liang, JJ; Tang, ML; Yuan, KH				Bentler, Peter M.; Liang, Jiajuan; Tang, Man-Lai; Yuan, Ke-Hai			Constrained Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Two-Level Mean and Covariance Structure Models	EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EM algorithm; maximum likelihood estimation; mean and covariance structure; linear and nonlinear constraints; two-level structural equation model	EM TYPE ALGORITHMS; EQUATION MODELS; PARAMETERS	Maximum likelihood is commonly used for the estimation of model parameters in the analysis of two-level structural equation models. Constraints on model parameters could be encountered in some situations such as equal factor loadings for different factors. Linear constraints are the most common ones and they are relatively easy to handle in maximum likelihood analysis. Nonlinear constraints could be encountered in complicated applications. The authors develop an EM-type algorithm for estimating model parameters with both linear and nonlinear constraints. The empirical performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo study. Application of the algorithm for linear constraints is illustrated by setting up a two-level mean and covariance structure model for a real two-level data set and running an EQS program.

J	Cheng, YZ; Jin, Q; Zhao, J; Guo, CY; Bai, J				Cheng, Yuanzhi; Jin, Quan; Zhao, Jie; Guo, Changyong; Bai, Jing			Accurate three-dimensional registration of magnetic resonance images for detecting local changes in cartilage thickness	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							INITIATIVE PROGRESSION SUBCOHORT; QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; OSTEOARTHRITIS; KNEE; VOLUME; MRI; MORPHOMETRY; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; MORPHOLOGY	The purpose of this study is to develop a three-dimensional registration method for monitoring knee joint disease from magnetic resonance (MR) image data sets. A global optimization technique was used for identifying anatomically corresponding points of knee femur surfaces (bone cartilage interfaces). In a first pre-registration step, we used the principal axes transformation to correct for different knee joint positions and orientations in the MR scanner. In a second step, we presented a global search algorithm based on Lipschitz optimization theory. This technique can simultaneously determine the translation and rotation parameters through searching a six-dimensional space of Euclidean motion metrics (translation and rotation) after calculating the point correspondences. The point correspondences were calculated by using the Hungarian algorithm. The accuracy of registration was evaluated using 20 porcine knees. There were 300 corresponding landmark points over the 20 pig knees. We evaluated the registration accuracy by measuring the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) error of corresponding landmark points between two femur surfaces (two time-points). The results show that the average RMSD was 1.22 +/- 0.10mm (SD) by the iterative closest point (ICP) method, 1.17 +/- 0.10mm the by expectation-maximization-ICP method, 1.02 +/- 0.06mm by the genetic method, and 0.93 +/- 0.04mm by the proposed method. Compared with the other three registration approaches, the proposed method achieved the highest registration accuracy. (C) 2011 SPIE and IS&T.

Our approach allows for modelling the distribution of the missing covariates either as a multivariate normal or as a multivariate t-distribution. A main advantage of this method is that it is fast and does not require the use of iterative procedures. A model selection method is derived which allows to choose among these distributions. In addition, we consider versions of Akaike's information criterion that are based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and multiple imputation methods that have a wide applicability to model selection in likelihood models in general.

Bioclimatic Modeling of Southern African Bioregions and Biomes Using Bayesian Networks	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian network; bioclimate; biome; bioregion; Southern Africa; tree-augmented naive	CLIMATE; UNCERTAINTY; CHALLENGES; VEGETATION; FUTURE; FIRE	This study uses Bayesian networks (BNs) to simulate the spatial distribution of southern African biomes and bioregions using bioclimatic variables. Two Tree-Augmented Naive (TAN) BN models were parameterized from 23 bioclimatic variables using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Using sensitivity analyses, the relative influence of each variable was determined using the mutual information from which six bioclimatic variables were selected for the final models. Precipitation of the warmest quarter and extra-terrestrial solar radiation was found to be the most influential variables on both bioregion and biome distributions. Isothermality was the least influential bioclimatic variable at both bioregion and biome levels. Overall correspondence was very high at 93.8 and 87.1% for biomes and bioregions, respectively, whereas classification errors were obtained in transition areas indicating the uncertainties associated with vegetation mapping around margins. The findings indicate that southern African bioregions and biomes can be classified and mapped according to key bioclimatic variables. Spatio-temporal, in particular, monthly and quarterly variations in both precipitation and temperature are found to be ecologically significant in determining the spatial distribution of biomes and bioregions. The findings also reflect the hierarchical relationship of biomes and bioregions as a function of local bioclimatic gradients and interactions. The results indicate the ecological significance of bioclimatic conditions in ecosystem science and offer the opportunity to utilize the models for predicting future responses and sensitivities to climatic changes.

J	Ma, WJ; Zhou, Y; Zhang, SL				Ma, Weijun; Zhou, Ying; Zhang, Shuanglin			A two-step method for estimating QTL effects and positions in multi-marker analysis	GENETICS RESEARCH			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; EM ALGORITHM; DANTZIG SELECTOR; INTERVAL; LASSO; GENOME; MLES	Quantitative trait is always controlled by multiple latent genetic loci, and genetic markers have been used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) auxiliarily. The method of multiple interval mapping (MIM) provides an appropriate way for mapping QTL using genetic makers. However, the computation in the MIM seems infeasible for a large number of marker intervals. Nowadays, the Dantzig selector (DS) method proves to be a more efficient method to estimate model effects in a linear model when the number of parameters is (much) larger than the sample size, which has not been applied to genetic mapping for QTL. In this paper, we developed a two-step method for mapping QTL based on the MIM, and we also illustrate the feasibility of adopting the DS to estimate marker or QTL effects. Simulation results showed that the proposed method performed satisfactorily well by comparisons with the existing MIM method, and the analysis to real data set also tested the practicability and efficiency of the DS method in genetic mapping.

The parameters of the Gaussian mixture model are usually estimated from given sample data by the expectation maximization algorithm. However, when the number of data attributes is large, the parameters cannot be estimated correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for estimating the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model by using sample data located on the boundary of regions defined by the component density functions. Experiments are carried out to show the characteristics of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Salomon, A; Goedicke, A; Aach, T				Salomon, Andre; Goedicke, Andreas; Aach, Til			Attenuation Corrected Cardiac SPECT Imaging Using Simultaneous Reconstruction and a Priori Information	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Anatomical model; attenuation correction; attenuation map; consistency conditions; line-source; simultaneous reconstruction; Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)	EMISSION DATA; TOMOGRAPHY; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATION; ALGORITHM; MAPS	Attenuation correction in SPECT typically performed using CT or Gadolinium-source based transmission scans, is more and more becoming established practice in many medical applications. For cases where no further anatomical information from a transmission scan is available, different approaches have been proposed in the past, attempting to recover the attenuation information directly from SPECT projection data. However, these methods often result in noticeable image artifacts caused by an inherent cross-dependency between the estimated attenuation and activity distribution. The simultaneous reconstruction method presented here aims to effectively avoid these cross-talk artifacts using a priori knowledge from anatomical atlas information. First, a three-dimensional (3D) body/organ model is coarsely registered to the SPECT data via anatomical landmark detection. Depending on known patient characteristics (age, sex, disease state, etc.), each organ structure is then identified with its typical attenuation coefficient to derive an initial estimate for the attenuation map. Using an iterative reconstruction scheme based on a modified ML-EM algorithm, both the local activity estimate and 3D shape model are simultaneously adapted in order to improve the overall consistency between measured and estimated sinogram data as well as preserving a realistic physiological topology. Several tests with simulated as well as real patient SPECT data were performed to evaluate the proposed algorithm, focusing on cardiology related applications. A comparison with ground truth data generated from transmission scan based attenuation maps showed deviations of less than 10% in diffusion polar-plots of the left ventricle.

J	Yao, C; Yang, XK; Chen, L; Xu, Y				Yao, Chen; Yang, Xiaokang; Chen, Li; Xu, Yi			Image colorization using Bayesian nonlocal inference	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article								Colorization is the process of adding colors to monochrome images. State-of-the-art colorization methods can be generally categorized into example-based colorization and scribble-based algorithms. In this paper, we present a new scribble-based colorization algorithm based on Bayesian inference and nonlocal likelihood computation. We convert the process of image colorization to a probability optimization problem in this Bayesian framework, where we use nonlocal-mean likelihood computation and Markov random field prior's. The expectation maximization method is used to solve an optimization object function. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 SPIE and IS&T.

The algorithm first employs the Expectation-maximization method (EM) to calculate the correlations between words and the latent topics for every category documents. It then selects feature words for each latent topics and merge those words to describe the corresponding category documents. At last, it merges all feature words of every category into classification feature words. An empirical comparison with other four effective feature selection methods on a benchmark data is presented in this paper. The results show that this method could get the best classification performance.

The aim of this study was to develop a miniature single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) to verify the performance of the proposed MP collimator with lead vertical septa. A detector with a 70 mm x 70 mm active area that consisted of a 6 mm-thick Nal(Tl) crystal coupled to a 127 mm-diameter position-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT) was used. A 7 x 7 pinhole collimator with a 2 mm-diameter pinhole and a focal length of 40 mm was fabricated to evaluate the performance as compared to a typical LEHR collimator. Additionally, a detector having a 50 mm x 50 mm active area with 5 x 5 pinhole and LEHR collimators was investigated to evaluate the enlarged imaging FOV. Planar spatial resolution, sensitivity, and resolution for hot- and cold-rod phantom images were acquired. Images were reconstructed using a dedicated maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm with an unmatched projector/backprojector pair. The spatial resolution and sensitivity obtained with both collimators were 4.7 mm FWHM and 0.25 cps/mu Ci at a distance of 60 mm, respectively. Although the detector size was smaller than the phantom, the MP collimator allowed for imaging of the entire phantom while the image obtained with LEHR collimator suffered from a truncation artifact. The reconstructed images, using 60 and 30 projections with both 7 x 7 pinhole and LEHR collimators, yielded an image of similar quality to that, which was constructed using 120 projections. However, the images reconstructed with 10 projections using a 7 x 7 pinhole collimator showed better quality than those that used an LEHR collimator. The reconstructed images that used the MP collimator provided high-quality images with an enlarged imaging FOV, even when insufficient angular sampling data were used, which would be of use in the development of a stationary SPECT.

First, a motivation of the utility of soft clustering approaches in IR is discussed. Then, an outline of the two main flat soft approaches, namely probabilistic clustering and fuzzy clustering, is described. Specifically, the expectation maximization and fuzzy c-means algorithms are introduced, and some of their extensions defined to overcome their main drawbacks when applied for organizing large document collections. Finally, soft hierarchical clustering algorithms designed for generating taxonomies of documents are introduced. C (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Due to a complex mathematical description of the geometry of the detector set-up, we developed a method for system matrix computation that is based on direct measurements of the detector response. In this approach, the influence of the acquisition equipment on the image formation is measured directly. The objective was to obtain the best quality of reconstructed images with respect to specified measures. This is indispensable in order to be able to perform reliable quantitative analysis of SPECT images. It is also especially important in non-hybrid gamma cameras, where not all physical processes that disturb image acquisition can be easily corrected. Two experiments with an (131)I point source placed at different distances from the detector plane were performed allowing the detector response to be acquired as a function of the point source distance. An analytical Gaussian function was fitted to the acquired data in both the one-and the two-dimensional case. A cylindrical phantom filled with a water solution of (131)I containing a region of "cold" spheres as well as a uniform solution (without any spheres) was used to perform algorithm evaluation. The reconstructed images obtained by using four different of methods system matrix computation were compared with those achieved using reconstruction software implemented in the gamma camera. The contrast of the spheres and uniformity were compared for each reconstruction result and also with the ranges of those values formulated by the AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine). The results show that the implementation of the OSEM (Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization) algorithm with a one-dimensional fit to the Gaussian CDR (Collimator-Detector Response) function provides the best results in terms of adopted measures. However, the fit of the two-dimensional function also gives satisfactory results. Furthermore, the CDR function has the potential to be applied to a fully 3D OSEM implementation. The lack of the CDR in system matrix calculation results in a very noisy image that cannot be used for diagnostic purposes.

J	Chiang, CT				Chiang, Chin-Tsang			A more flexible joint latent model for longitudinal and survival time data	METRIKA			English	Article						Basis function expansion; B-spline; Failure time; Latent variable; Longitudinal measurements; Varying-coefficient	VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS; DEPENDENT COEFFICIENTS; REGRESSION; ERROR; ESTIMATOR; COUNTS; EM	In this article, a more flexible and easily explained joint latent model with time-varying coefficients is used to characterize time-dependent responses and a failure time. The dependence within time-dependent responses and between time-dependent responses and a failure time, and the heterogeneity in both processes are established through partially non-parametric latent variables. Based on longitudinal and survival time data, an estimation procedure is proposed for the parameter functions of the joint latent model. In our estimation, the approximated likelihood is constructed via substituting the basis function expansions for parameter functions. The expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm is then implemented to obtain the maximizer of the approximated likelihood function, and, hence, the estimated parameter functions. The validity of the considered joint latent model enables us to derive the asymptotic properties of the estimated functions. Moreover, the corresponding finite sample properties and the usefulness of our methods are demonstrated through a Monte Carlo simulation and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 data. A possible extension of our joint latent model and some additional topics of interest are also discussed herein.

A data mining approach to predictive vegetation mapping using probabilistic graphical models	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bayesian network; Data mining; Expectation-maximization; Graphical model; Predictive vegetation mapping	INCORPORATING SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BELIEF NETWORKS; SOUTHERN AFRICA; RANDOM FORESTS; EM ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; ECOLOGY; UNCERTAINTY	This paper develops a novel method to model and predict the spatial distribution of vegetation types in Swaziland using physiographic and bioclimatic variables. The method uses a data mining approach implemented within a probabilistic graphical model to match two observed hierarchical levels of vegetation. The classification uses Bayesian networks (BN) and the parameterization is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The model is tested on a random sample of mapped vegetation types in Swaziland and allowed for the identification of the key environmental variables that are most important for capturing the vegetation spatial distribution. We show that while elevation and geology are the most important variables explaining the spatial distribution patterns of vegetation for both models, the influence of the climatic and other variables on the vegetation at the two levels differ. The overall distribution of the predicted vegetation classes was very similar to their distribution on the observed vegetation map. Overall the error rate was found to be 9.35% for a model of 16 vegetation classes and 4.9% for the one with 5 classes, indicating the excellent classification accuracy of the approach despite the complex landscape of the study area. Possible sources of error and some limitations are discussed and conclusions are drawn including suggestions for further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multiscale iterative voting for differential analysis of stress response for 2D and 3D cell culture models	JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY			English	Article						E-cadherin; expectation maximization; ionizing radiation; iterative voting; segmentation; gamma H2AX; 3D cell culture models	IMAGE-ANALYSIS; SEGMENTATION; LOCALIZATION; PHENOTYPE; PROTEINS; NUCLEI; CANCER; BREAKS; ASSAYS; SET	Three-dimensional (2D) cell culture models have emerged as the basis for improved cell systems biology. However, there is a gap in robust computational techniques for segmentation of these model systems that are imaged through confocal or deconvolution microscopy. The main issues are the volume of data, overlapping subcellular compartments and variation in scale or size of subcompartments of interest, which lead to ambiguities for quantitative analysis on a cell-by-cell basis. We address these ambiguities through a series of geometric operations that constrain the problem through iterative voting and decomposition strategies. The main contributions of this paper are to (i) extend the previously developed 2D radial voting to an efficient 3D implementation, (ii) demonstrate application of iterative radial voting at multiple subcellular and molecular scales, and (iii) investigate application of the proposed technology to two endpoints between 2D and 3D cell culture models. These endpoints correspond to kinetics of DNA damage repair as measured by phosphorylation of gamma H2AX, and the loss of the membrane-bound E-cadherin protein as a result of ionizing radiation. Preliminary results indicate little difference in the kinetics of the DNA damage protein between 2D and 3D cell culture models; however, differences between membrane-bound E-cadherin are more pronounced.

J	Popescu, M; Hristea, F				Popescu, Marius; Hristea, Florentina			State of the art versus classical clustering for unsupervised word sense disambiguation	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Word sense disambiguation; Unsupervised disambiguation; Bayesian classification; The EM algorithm; WordNet; Spectral clustering	CORPUS	This paper ultimately discusses the importance of the clustering method used in unsupervised word sense disambiguation. It illustrates the fact that a powerful clustering technique can make up for lack of external knowledge of all types. It argues that feature selection does not always improve disambiguation results, especially when using an advanced, state of the art method, hereby exemplified by spectral clustering. Disambiguation results obtained when using spectral clustering in the case of the main parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs) are compared to those of the classical clustering method given by the Na < ve Bayes model. In the case of unsupervised word sense disambiguation with an underlying Na < ve Bayes model feature selection performed in two completely different ways is surveyed. The type of feature selection providing the best results (WordNet-based feature selection) is equally being used in the case of spectral clustering. The conclusion is that spectral clustering without feature selection (but using its own feature weighting) produces superior disambiguation results in the case of all parts of speech.

As a consequence of the sequential data reception, the algorithm focuses on updating the current estimation and inference of the model parameters (slopes and error variance) as soon as a new data is received. The update of the current estimate is simple and needs scanty computational requirements. The same occurs with the inference processes which are based on asymptotics. The algorithm, unlike its natural competitors, has some memory; therefore, the storage of the complete up-to-date data set is not needed. This fact is essential in terms of computer complexity, so reducing both the computing time and storage requirements of our algorithm compared with other alternatives.

J	Sun, GY; Schliekelman, P				Sun, Guoying; Schliekelman, Paul			A Genetical Genomics Approach to Genome Scans Increases Power for QTL Mapping	GENETICS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; IDENTIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; PATHWAY; MOUSE	We describe a method for integrating gene expression information into genome scans and show that this can substantially increase the statistical power of QTL mapping. The method has three stages. First, standard clustering methods identify small (size 5-20) groups of genes with similar expression patterns. Second, each gene group is tested for a causative genetic locus shared with the clinical trait of interest. This is done using an EM algorithm approach that treats genotype at the putative causative locus as an unobserved variable and combines expression information from all of the genes in the group to infer genotype information at the locus. Finally, expression QTL (eQTL) are mapped for each gene group that shares a causative locus with the clinical trait. Such eQTL are candidates for the causative locus. Simulation results show that this method has far superior power to standard QTL mapping techniques in many circumstances. We applied this method to existing data on mouse obesity. Our method identified 27 putative body weight QTL, whereas standard QTL mapping produced only one. Furthermore, most gene groups with body weight QTL included cis genes, so candidate genes could be immediately identified. Eleven body weight QTL produced 16 candidate genes that have been previously associated with body weight or body weight-related traits, thus validating our method. In addition, 15 of the 16 other loci produced 32 candidate genes that have not been associated with body weight. Thus, this method shows great promise for finding new causative loci for complex traits.

To achieve this, we propose improved forward and backward algorithms on the lattices and the whole procedure is optimized recursively. The remarkable characteristics of the proposed approach are that the optimization procedure is expectation-maximization (EM) like and the formation of the updated result is similar to that obtained with the confusion network (CN) decoding method. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method leads to an error reduction for both lattice rescoring and lattice-based system combinations, compared with CN decoding, confusion network combination (CNC), and ROVER methods.

J	Yokoyama, N				Yokoyama, Nobuhiro			Parameter Estimation of Aircraft Dynamics via Unscented Smoother with Expectation-Maximization Algorithm	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							FLIGHT-TEST DATA; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MEASUREMENT NOISE	This paper proposes a new method for parameter estimation of aircraft dynamics modeled in state space. The developed method employs the smoother, which estimates the state and unknown parameters, combined with expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate unknown statistics in the problem, i.e., the mean and covariance of an initial state, and the noise covariances. To approximate the expectation values in the expectation-maximization with a reasonable computational cost, an unscented transform based on the estimates obtained by the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother is employed. Moreover, nonconvex numerical optimization algorithms are not necessary in the maximization step of the expectation-maximization, because the optimums of the unknown statistics are given in analytical forms. Thus, the developed method achieves low computational cost and high robustness. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through two problems of estimating aircraft aerodynamic parameters.

J	McEwan, C; Hart, E				McEwan, Chris; Hart, Emma			On clonal selection	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Clonal selection; Learning; Optimisation; EM Algorithm		Clonal selection has been a dominant theme in many immune-inspired algorithms applied to machine learning and optimisation. We examine existing clonal selection algorithms for learning from a theoretical and empirical perspective and assert that the widely accepted computational interpretation of clonal selection is compromised both algorithmically and biologically. We suggest a more capable abstraction of the clonal selection principle grounded in probabilistic estimation and approximation and demonstrate how it addresses some of the shortcomings in existing algorithms. We further show that by recasting black-box optimisation as a learning problem, the same abstraction may be re-employed; thereby taking steps toward unifying the clonal selection principle and distinguishing it from natural selection.

Empirical and fully Bayesian approaches for random effects models in microarray data analysis	STATISTICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Statistical Modelling	2008	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS			EM algorithm; empirical Bayes; Laplace approximation; LEMMA; linear model; MCMC	DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION	A linear model involving a mixture distribution is considered for the comparison of normalized microarray data from two treatment groups. Model fitting using an empirical Bayes approach has been shown to be both accurate and numerically stable. The posterior odds of treatment/gene interactions derived from the model involve shrinkage estimates of both the interactions and the gene-specific error variances, leading to powerful inference. We show that the same model can easily be fit under a fully Bayesian framework, allowing increased flexibility in terms of prior distributional assumptions and posterior inference.

Assessing environmental stressors via Bayesian Model Averaging in the presence of missing data	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						biological monitoring; ecological health; model selection; Bayesian methods; stressor-response; missing data; data augmentation; Bayesian Model Averaging	DATA AUGMENTATION; SELECTION	Environmental researchers often face the problem of assessing which potiential stressors in an environment actually are stressors. In making these assessments they often have data sets that have missing values for many of the stressors. Techniques such as Multiple Imputation, Data Augmentation via the EM algorithm have been proposed to deal with the missing value problem. Then standard deterministic model search methods such as forward, backward, stepwise, Mallows Cp, etc. are then applied to these imputed datasets to determine the single "best" model. Using this "best" model all inferences concerning which potential stressors actually induce stress are determined. This work proposes a probabilistic model search to determine the stressors in an environment while taking into account the problem of missing values. This method is applied to an ecological data set concerning benthic health collected by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Boone, E.

The PNN is trained on the resistivity or sensitivity to the antibiotics of each record in the Salmonella database. Estimation of the whole parameter space for the PNN was performed by the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation method. The expectation-maximization (EM) approach can help to achieve the ML estimation via iterative computation. Resistivity and sensitivity of the three antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol disks and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) were classified with high accuracies by the PNN. The obtained results demonstrated the success of the PNN to help in detection of resistivity for antibiotics.

A sparse multinomial probit model for classification	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multi-classification; Sparseness; Multinomial probit; Hierarchical Bayesian	BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; GENE SELECTION; RESPONSE DATA	A recent development in penalized probit modelling using a hierarchical Bayesian approach has led to a sparse binomial (two-class) probit classifier that can be trained via an EM algorithm. A key advantage of the formulation is that no tuning of hyperparameters relating to the penalty is needed thus simplifying the model selection process. The resulting model demonstrates excellent classification performance and a high degree of sparsity when used as a kernel machine. It is, however, restricted to the binary classification problem and can only be used in the multinomial situation via a one-against-all or one-against-many strategy. To overcome this, we apply the idea to the multinomial probit model. This leads to a direct multi-classification approach and is shown to give a sparse solution with accuracy and sparsity comparable with the current state-of-the-art. Comparative numerical benchmark examples are used to demonstrate the method.

In this paper, we explore a particular sparsity bias in dependency grammars that encourages a small number of unique dependency types. We use part-of-speech (POS) tags to group dependencies by parent-child types and investigate sparsity-inducing penalties on the posterior distributions of parent-child POS tag pairs in the posterior regularization (PR) framework of Graca et al. (2007). In experiments with 12 different languages, we achieve significant gains in directed attachment accuracy over the standard expectation maximization (EM) baseline, with an average accuracy improvement of 6.5%, outperforming EM by at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. Furthermore, the new method outperforms models based on standard Bayesian sparsity-inducing parameter priors with an average improvement of 5% and positive gains of at least 1% for 9 out of 12 languages. On English text in particular, we show that our approach improves performance over other state-of-the-art techniques.

J	Hajian, M; Honarvar, F				Hajian, Mehdi; Honarvar, Farhang			Reflectivity Estimation using an Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Ultrasonic Testing of Adhesive Bonds	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						ultrasonic testing; adhesive bonds; expectation maximization; reflectivity estimation	MODEL-BASED ESTIMATION; METAL LAP JOINTS; SPECTROSCOPY; INSPECTION; NDE; RESONANCE; SIGNALS	This paper discusses the use of the pulse-echo technique of ultrasonic testing (UT) for nondestructive testing (NDT) of adhesive bonds of thin metal sheets (less than 1 mm thick) in which the thickness of the adhesive layer and the metal sheets, as well as the acoustical properties of the adhesive, are unknown. The aim of UT of adhesive joints is to assess the integrity of the front (interface close to the interrogating transducer) and rear adherent/adhesive interfaces. To achieve this goal, accurate estimation of the reflectivity is required. In this study, a model-based approach was applied to signals obtained from adhesively bonded joints in order to estimate their reflectivity. The transducer wavelet was modeled by gaussian echoes and the reflectivity (the desired system response) was estimated by using the expectation maximization algorithm. The decay rate of reverberations in the front metal sheet calculated from the estimated amplitudes of the sequence was used as a basis for detection of disbond in the front interface. By applying the proposed technique, it was possible to detect void-disbonds and the presence of anomalies, such as grease and water in the front interface of a joint made by 0.5 mm thick aluminum plates. Disbonds in the rear interface of this joint were also detected by examining the phase inversion of the echo reflected from the rear interface.

Methods: The authors compare it to the current criteria: Mutual information (MI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and the entropy correlation coefficient (ECC). The anatomical region to be registered was the head. A rigid-body registration was used; no deformation was employed. The authors established the effectiveness of IECC by both simulated data and clinical studies using brain fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and MRI. Both a normal-activity FDG model and a FDG model with a perfusion defect were used for the PET image. Reconstruction by both filtered backprojection and by ordered subset-expectation maximization was investigated. Results: The mean errors and SDs of IECC were 1.17 +/- 0.85 mm for translation and 1.04 +/- 1.28 degrees for rotation in clinical PET. Those of MI, NMI, and ECC were 1.86 +/- 1.22, 1.86 +/- 0.96, and 1.68 +/- 1.05 mm for translations and 1.52 +/- 1.84 degrees, 1.74 +/- 1.68 degrees, and 1.70 +/- 1.90 degrees for rotations. The mean errors and SDs of IECC were 1.56 +/- 0.58 mm for translation and 1.46 +/- 1.66 degrees for rotation in clinical PET model with a 30% perfusion defect. Those of MI, NMI, and ECC were 2.81 +/- 1.41, 2.98 +/- 1.80, and 3.29 +/- 2.08 mm for translations and 3.34 +/- 3.80 degrees, 2.87 +/- 3.25 degrees, and 3.04 +/- 3.44 degrees for rotations. The mean errors and SDs of IECC were 1.79 +/- 1.04 mm for translation and 1.64 +/- 1.62 degrees for rotation in clinical PET model with a 50% perfusion defect. Those of MI, NMI, and ECC were 3.49 +/- 1.92, 3.57 +/- 2.22, and 3.49 +/- 1.89 mm for translations and 4.12 +/- 4.24 degrees, 3.62 +/- 4.87 degrees, and 3.44 +/- 3.80 degrees for rotations. The significant differences between IECC and each of the other three criteria were found for displacement misregistration in almost all parameters (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Accuracy of the IECC criterion was higher than that of the other criteria, usually in a statistically significant way. (C) 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

J	Jin, YH; Prabhakaran, B				Jin, Yohan; Prabhakaran, Balakrishnan			Knowledge Discovery from 3D Human Motion Streams through Semantic Dimensional Reduction	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Algorithms; 3D motion capture; singular value decomposition; Gaussian mixture model; EM; string matching	EM ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RETRIEVAL	3D human motion capture is a form of multimedia data that is widely used in entertainment as well as medical fields ( such as orthopedics, physical medicine, and rehabilitation where gait analysis is needed). These applications typically create large repositories of motion capture data and need efficient and accurate content-based retrieval techniques. 3D motion capture data is in the form of multidimensional time-series data. To reduce the dimensions of human motion data while maintaining semantically important features, we quantize human motion data by extracting spatio-temporal features through SVD and translate them onto a symbolic sequential representation through our proposed sGMMEM (semantic Gaussian Mixture Modeling with EM). In order to handle variations in motion capture data due to human body characteristics and speed of motion, we transform the semantically quantized values into a histogram representation. This representation is used as a signature for classification and similarity-based retrieval. We achieved good classification accuracies for "coarse" human motion categories (such as walking 92.85%, run 91.42%, and jump 94.11%) and even for subtle categories (such as dance 89.47%, laugh 83.33%, basketball signal 85.71%, golf putting 80.00%). Experiments also demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms earlier techniques such as the wMSV (weighted Motion Singular Vector) approach and LB Keogh method.

Under the premise that genes represented in different sample lists may share the common transduction order, hence, a first-order Markov model is used to represent the signaling pathway for reconstruction. A probability transition matrix is used to determine the regulation relations of genes in the pathway. To estimate model parameters, EM algorithm is employed to dealing with missing data. In addition, a Hidden Markov Model is applied to predict the regulation direction, which provides more advantages over many other reconstruction algorithms. The reconstruction will also give more biological information. The experiment shows that the proposed method is effective in reconstructing the well-known MAPK/Erk pathway.

J	Robb, ML; Bohning, D				Robb, Matthew L.; Boehning, Dankmar			Imputing unobserved values with the EM algorithm under left and right-truncation, and interval censoring for estimating the size of hidden populations	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Capture-recapture; Censoring and truncation for count data; Cholera outbreak; EM algorithm	RECAPTURE	Capture-recapture techniques have been used for considerable time to predict population size. Estimators usually rely on frequency counts for numbers of trappings; however, it may be the case that these are not available for a particular problem, for example if the original data set has been lost and only a summary table is available. Here, we investigate techniques for specific examples; the motivating example is an epidemiology study by Mosley et al., which focussed on a cholera outbreak in East Pakistan. To demonstrate the wider range of the technique, we also look at a study for predicting the long-term outlook of the AIDS epidemic using information on number of sexual partners. A new estimator is developed here which uses the EM algorithm to impute unobserved values and then uses these values in a similar way to the existing estimators. The results show that a truncated approach - mimicking the Chao lower bound approach - gives an improved estimate when population homogeneity is violated.

J	Wang, HX				Wang, Haixian			Semi-supervised classification of facial expression using a mixture of multivariate t distributions	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						mixture of multivariate t distributions; facial expression recognition; expectation maximization (EM) algorithm; semi-supervised classification	HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION; RECOGNITION; MODEL; FACE; CLASSIFIERS; INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS; EM	This paper addresses the semi-supervised classification of facial expression images using a mixture of multivariate t distributions. The facial expression features are first extracted into labelled graph vectors using the Gabor wavelet transformation. We then learn a mixture of multivariate t distributions by using the labelled graph vectors, and set correspondence between the component distributions and the basic facial emotions. According to this correspondence, the classification of a given testing image is implemented in a probabilistic way according to its fitted posterior probabilities of component memberships. Specifically, we perform hard classification of the testing image by assigning it into an emotional class that the corresponding mixture component has the highest posterior probability, or softly use the posterior probabilities as the estimates of the semantic ratings of expressions. The experimental results on the Japanese female facial expression database, Ekman's Pictures of Facial Affect database and the AR database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A Multi-Scale Non-linear Vessel Enhancement Technique	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)			English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			ENHANCING DIFFUSION; IMAGES	We present an enhancement method based on non-linear diffusion filter and statistical intensity approaches for smoothing and extracting 3-D vascular system from Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) data. Our method distinguishes and enhances the vessels from the other embedded tissues. The Expectation Maximization (EM) technique is employed with non-linear diffusion in order to find the optimal contrast for enhancing vessels; therefore, smoothing while dimming the embedded tissues around the vessels and brightening the vessels. The non-linear diffusion filter smooths the homogeneous regions while preserving edges. The EM technique finds the optimal statistical parameters based on the probability distribution of the classes to discriminate the tissues in the image. Our enhancement technique has been applied to 4 3-D MRA-TOF datasets consisting of around 300 images and has been compared to the regularized Perona and Malik filter. Our experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the image, keeping only the vessels while eliminating the signal from other tissues. In comparison, the conventional non-linear diffusion filter keeps unwanted tissues in addition to the vessels.

The invention of CT technique revolutionised the field of medical diagnostic imaging because it provides more detailed and useful information than any previous non-invasive imaging technique. The method is increasingly used in industrial fields. This paper describes the development of a gamma-ray computed tomography system for imaging and visualising of industrial multiphase reactors. The theoretical aspects of CT scanner, the system configurations and the adopted algorithm for image reconstruction are discussed. Penetrating radiation from an isotopic gamma-ray source of Cs-137 and a bank of NaI(T1) scintillation detectors in combination with a dedicated mechanical gantry set-up were used to construct the CT system. During scanning, the movement of the detector's bank and rotation table is controlled by a LabView-based software. The software is also designed to control all associated nuclear electronics equipments and finally to acquire gamma-ray transmission data. The image reconstruction is performed by using Expectation-Maximisation (EM) and Alternating-Maximisation (AM) algorithms written in Visual-Fortran programming language. Several physical phantoms to simulate industrial multiphase process columns and reactors were scanned using this CT scanner. Some of the reconstructed images are presented in this paper.

Statistical methods that address missingness have been extensively studied in recent years. One of the more popular approaches involves imputation of the missing values prior to the analysis, thereby rendering the data complete. Imputation broadly encompasses an entire scope of techniques that have been developed to make inferences about incomplete data, ranging from very simple strategies (e. g. mean imputation) to more advanced approaches that require estimation, for instance, of posterior distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additional complexity arises when the number of missingness patterns increases and/or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementation of routines, procedures, or packages capable of generating imputations for incomplete data are now widely available. We review some of these in the context of a motivating example, as well as in a simulation study, under two missingness mechanisms (missing at random and missing not at random). Thus far, evaluation of existing implementations have frequently centred on the resulting parameter estimates of the prescribed model of interest after imputing the missing data. In some situations, however, interest may very well be on the quality of the imputed values at the level of the individual - an issue that has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we focus on the latter to provide further insight about the performance of the different routines, procedures, and packages in this respect.

A particle filter is used to predict the mean flow length and complete flow distributions for subsequent timesteps. A model for the histogram of flows corresponding to any given time interval is first presented, and the particle filter is then used to estimate the parameters of the model. The proposed method was tested on a large number of commonly-available data traces, and the results were analyzed in terms of the difference between the predicted flow distributions and actual flow histograms. An important application of this work is in resource reservation for protocols that require guaranteed qualities of service.

It is based on a Markov random field (MRF) model that integrates a K-Wishart distribution for the PolSAR data statistics conditioned to each image cluster and a Potts model for the spatial context. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is constructed based upon the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. A new formulation of EM is developed to jointly address parameter estimation in the K-Wishart distribution and the spatial context model, and also minimization of the energy function. Experiments are presented with simulated and real quad-pol L-band data.	[Akbari, V.; Doulgeris, A. P.; Anfinsen, S.

The goal of this paper is to propose a model for binary vectors clustering that accommodates outliers and allows simultaneously the incorporation of a feature selection methodology into the clustering process. We derive an EM algorithm to fit the proposed model. Through simulation studies and a set of experiments involving handwritten digit recognition and visual scenes categorization, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our method.

Deconvolution techniques can be used to obtain the pure tissue response, otherwise called reflectivity function. Typically deconvolution methods are developed in the only purpose of image visual quality improvement. In this work we present an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for US images deconvolution in which local statistical description of the tissue reflectivity is restored as well, so that features extracted from the deconvolved frame can theoretically be used for classification purposes.

Usually, this is measured in the form of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the temporal response of each region. Recent trends have shown that when pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated directly from the projection data, they are less affected by noise. This work investigates an existing parametric maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm applied to [18F] DOPA data using reference-tissue input function. The study reveals how direct reconstruction of pharmacokinetic parameters from the measured data can be performed optimally. It explains how to optimize the speed of the standard iterative algorithm and it compares the results with the existing FBP method. The improvement of the quality of the parametric images preserving quantification suggests the usefulness of direct estimation of the kinetic parameters. This algorithm is freely available within the open-source library STIR 2.1.	[Angelis, G.

Skew estimation of handwritten documents is still remains challenging in the field of document image analysis due to a non-uniform text line. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel scheme for handwritten documents. The proposed method is based on mixture models. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. Subsequently the cluster means obtained from the individual words is used estimate the skew angle. Experiments on different handwritten documents and documents corrupted by noise shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Aradhya, V. N.

T-f mask based approaches have been widely studied, because they can separate signals with a low calculation cost. However, the separated signals with a t-f mask usually contain a non-linear distortion. On the other hand, a new multi-channel WF framework employing a spatial covariance matrix model has recently been proposed. With the WF method, we can obtain separated signals of better quality than with a t-f mask, however, the method is computationally expensive because it requires many iterations for the optimization. In this paper, in order to take advantages of both approaches, first we explain the hybrid algorithm by introducing the t-f mask concept to the WF approach. Then we show that the hybrid approach achieves high performance without the iterative calculation for the WF.

It leads to improve the quality and success rate of the students in educational environment. Students' intellectual performance varies in learning environment and evaluated by different criteria. This study helps to find out the intelligent quotient level of the student and their performance, which are dissimilar in a classroom. Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale and Criterion Reference Model are used to evaluate the intelligence and performance of the students. Machine learning techniques are employed to find the intelligent quotient and performance of rural and urban students using students' dataset. Model based clustering technique is used to determine the similarity in the students dataset based on the nature of the intelligent quotient and performance. Each cluster reveals the identity based on students intelligence level. The performance also categorized on descriptive modeling. Multi layer Perceptron technique classifies the intelligent level of the students and their performance. The study determines the association between intelligent level of the rural and urban students and performance through descriptive and predictive modeling. This analysis recommends the teaching community to provide right training to the rural students for their improvement of academic competence.	[Arockiam, L.; Charles, S.; Kumar, V.

Since the VB and surrounding organs have very close gray level information and there are no strong edges in some CT images, the initialization of level sets method becomes very crucial step. If the object and background regions are not initialized correctly, the results would not be acceptable. Also, the size and place of the initial seed may give non-reproducible results. To solve these problems, we use a statistical level sets method which uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the initialization and parameter estimation. Validity was analyzed using ground truths of data sets (expert segmentation) and the European Spine Phantom (ESP) as a known reference. The proposed method is compared with other known alternatives.

In our investigation, we consider two scenarios: In the first scenario, the channel and noise variance are assumed to be perfectly known by the secondary user (SU). Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) solution of the PU signal detection as an upper bound on the performance of the proposed joint estimation and detection (JED) scheme. We also provide an iterative implementation of the ML-based detector using the EM algorithm. In the second case, we extend our work to the problem of channel and noise variance estimation in cognitive radios, where we propose an iterative JED scheme based on the EM algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed JED scheme can iteratively attain a reliable performance with few iterations and modest computational complexity.

There are two main steps. Initially, primitive objects are obtained by morphological operations that generate spectrally homogenous primitives. We assume that primitives are components of semantic objects that are of interest. Next, these primitives therefore are modeled and merged based on expectation maximization. We presented the results of the experiments applied to QuickBird images of rural and urban areas taken from the city of Ankara, Turkey. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of these methods along with their limitations.

However, unlike the High Resolution (HR) methods dedicated to mixtures of exponentials, its spectral resolution is limited by that of the underlying TF representation. In this paper, we propose a unified probabilistic model called HR-NMF, that permits to overcome this limit by taking both phases and local correlations in each frequency band into account. This model is estimated with a recursive implementation of the EM algorithm, that is successfully applied to source separation and audio inpainting.

To achieve the goal, we developed a system equipped with a multi-pinhole collimator and the corresponding reconstruction method that provides transverse slices of the small field of view (SFOV). Our group has been developing a high resolution SFOV gamma camera system. Simulation studies have been conducted using a geant4 application for tomographic emission (GATE) simulation tool. We make three sphere phantoms which lay through the center of FOV with different depths. An eight-pinhole collimator with 2mm diameter aperture was configured for the simulation. For image reconstruction, system matrix for a maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) was developed based on the geometry of the collimator. The projector and back-projector were separately implemented based on the ray-driven and voxel-driven methods respectively. Simulations have been conducted with respect to 60, 90, 120 degree angle spans and 3, 6, 9 degree angle pitches. Preliminary results showed that the system distinguished the three sphere phantoms (2.5 cm depth). In addition, Contrast enhancement of phantom regions was observed as number of iteration increased. In the future, we will continue to investigate the optimum pinhole configurations pinhole size, angle span, and angle pitch, etc.	[Bae, Jaekeon; Lee, Kisung] Korea Univ, Dept Radiol Sci, Seoul 136793, South Korea	Bae, J (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Radiol Sci, Seoul 136793, South Korea.	jangna@korea.ac.kr; kisung@korea.ac.kr; jinhun.joung@nucaremed.com					Dobbins III James T., 2009, EUROPEAN J RADIOLOGY, V72; Giessen Van, 1985, IEEE T NUCL SCI, V4; Min Byung Jun, 2009, NUCL I METHODS PHYS, V606; SHEPP L.A., 1982, IEEE T NUCL SCI, VMI-1; UE Ruttimann, 1984, IEEE T NUCL SCI, V3	5	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1082-3654	978-1-4673-0120-6	IEEE NUCL SCI CONF R			2011							3296	3299				4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	Engineering; Physics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	BAM64	WOS:000304755603117

This algorithm is capable of selecting the number of components of the model using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Our approach benefits from the properties of Genetic algorithms and deterministic annealing algorithm by combination of both into a single procedure. The population-based stochastic search of the GA&DA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables escaping from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. The GA&DA-EM algorithm is elitist which maintains the monotonic convergence property of the EM algorithm. We conducted experiments on the WebKB and 20NEWSGROUPS. The results show that show that 1) the GA&DA-EM outperforms the EM method since: Our approach identifies the number of components which were used to generate the underlying data more often than the EM algorithm. 2) the algorithm alternatives to EM that overcoming the challenges of local maxima.

However, lesion delineation in PET is a challenging task, especially for small lesions, due to the low intrinsic resolution, image noise and partial volume effect. The combinations of different reconstruction methods and post-reconstruction smoothing on PET images also affect the segmentation result significantly which has always been overlooked. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different reconstruction methods on semiautomated small lesion segmentation for PET images. Four conventional segmentation methods were evaluated including region growing technique based on maximum intensity (RGmax) and mean intensity (RGmean) thresholds, Fuzzy c-mean (FCM) and watershed (WS) technique. All these methods were evaluated on a physical phantom scan which was reconstructed with Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) with Gaussian post-smoothing and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) with quadratic prior respectively. The results demonstrate that: 1) the performance of all the segmentation methods subject to the smoothness constraint applied on the reconstructed images; 2) FCM method applied on MAP reconstructed images yielded overall superior performance than other evaluated combinations.

In this presentation, we retrospectively studied the distribution of ADC values inside tumor volume during the course of tumor treatment and progression for a selective group of patients who underwent an anti-VEGF trial. Complete MRI studies were obtained for this selected group of patients including pre- and multiple follow-up, post-treatment imaging studies. In each MRI imaging study, multiple scan series were obtained as a standard protocol which includes T1, T2, T1-post contrast, FLAIR and DTI derived images (ADC, FA etc.) for each visit. All scan series (T1, T2, FLAIR, post-contrast T1) were registered to the corresponding DTI scan at patient's first visit. Conventionally, hyper-intensity regions on T1-post contrast images are believed to represent the core tumor region while regions highlighted by FLAIR may overestimate tumor size. Thus we annotated tumor regions on the T1-post contrast scans and ADC intensity values for pixels were extracted inside tumor regions as defined on T1-post scans. We fit a mixture Gaussian (MG) model for the extracted pixels using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which produced a set of parameters (mean, various and mixture coefficients) for the MG model. This procedure was performed for each visits resulting in a series of GM parameters. We studied the parameters fitted for ADC and see if they can be used as indicators for tumor progression. Additionally, we studied the ADC characteristics in the peri-tumoral region as identified by hyper-intensity on FLAIR scans. The results show that ADC histogram analysis of the tumor region supports the two compartment model that suggests the low ADC value subregion corresponding to densely packed cancer cell while the higher ADC value region corresponding to a mixture of viable and necrotic cells with superimposed edema. Careful studies of the composition and relative volume of the two compartments in tumor region may provide some insights in the early assessment of tumor response to therapy for recurrence brain cancer patients.

The objective is to identify this probability distribution - the dispersion of which is independent of the sample size since intrinsic variability is at stake - based on observation of some model outputs. Moreover, in order to limit the number of (usually burdensome) physical model runs inside the inversion algorithm to a reasonable level, a nonlinear approximation methodology making use of Kriging and a stochastic EM algorithm is presented. It is compared with iterated linear approximation on the basis of numerical experiments on simulated data sets coming from a simplified but realistic modelling of a dyke overflow. Situations where this nonlinear approach is to be preferred to linearisation are highlighted. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The analysis of ordinal time-series data via a transition (Markov) model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						E-M algorithm; ordinal; repeated measures; transition model; longitudinal; categorical	GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; EM ALGORITHM; INFORMATION; RESPONSES	While standard techniques are available for the analysis of time-series (longitudinal) data, and for ordinal (rating) data, not much is available for the combination of the two, at least in a readily-usable form. However, this data type is common place in the natural and health sciences where repeated ratings are recorded on the same subject. To analyse these data, this paper considers a transition (Markov) model where the rating of a subject at one time depends explicitly on the observed rating at the previous point of time by incorporating the previous rating as a predictor variable. Complications arise with adequate handling of data at the first observation (t = 1), as there is no prior observation to use as a predictor. To overcome this, it is postulated the existence of a rating at time t = 0; however it is treated as 'missing data' and the expectation-maximisation algorithm used to accommodate this. The particular benefits of this method are shown for shorter time series.

The focus is on latent variables investigated on the basis of questionnaires and estimated using item response theory models. Latent variable estimates are then treated as observed measures of the true variables. This leads to a two-stage estimation procedure which constitutes an alternative to a joint model for the outcome variable and the responses given to the questionnaire. Simulation studies explore the effect of ignoring the true error structure and the performance of the proposed method. Two illustrative examples concern achievement data of university students. Particular attention is given to the Rasch model.

However, many factors can affect the data distribution between two different experimental sessions including sensor displacement (e. g. due to replacement or slippage), and lead to changes in the classification performance. We propose an unsupervised adaptive classifier that calibrates itself to be robust against changes in the sensor location. It assumes that these changes are mainly reflected in shifts in the feature distributions and uses an online version of expectation-maximisation to estimate those shifts. We tested the method on a synthetic dataset in addition to two activity recognition datasets modeling sensor displacement. Results show that the proposed adaptive algorithm is robust against shift in the feature space due to sensor displacement.

Moments of Mixture Periodic Autoregressive Models	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						Expectation-Maximization algorithm; Mixture periodic autoregressive models; Periodic autoregressive models; Periodically correlated process	MOVING AVERAGE PROCESSES; EM ALGORITHM	This article deals with the study of some properties of a mixture periodically correlated autoregressive (MPAR(S)) time series model, which extends the mixture time invariant parameter autoregressive (MAR) model, that has recently received a considerable interest from many economic time series analysts, to mixture periodic parameter autoregressive model. The aim behind this extension is to make the model able to capture, in addition to all features captured by the classical MAR model, the periodicity feature exhibited by the autocovariance structure of many encountered financial and environmental time series with eventual multimodal distributions. Our main contribution here is obtaining of the second moment periodically stationary condition for a MPAR(S) (K; 2, ... , 2) model, furthermore the closed-form of the second moment is obtained.

This work combines a simple FO estimation technique with a low-complexity phase noise estimation method, inspired by the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm. Using a truncated discrete-cosine transform (DCT) expansion, the phase noise estimate is derived from the estimated DCT coefficients of the phase. A number of implementations of the proposed algorithm are discussed. Numerical results indicate that when estimating the FO from pilot symbols only, comparable performance can be reached as the computationally more complex case where the FO is updated iteratively, with small convergence time. The phase noise estimation step is well capable of compensating for the residual FO. For the considered scenario, performing FO compensation before iterative phase noise estimation yields a bit-error rate performance degradation close to the case where the FO is known.
