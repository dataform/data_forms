GAUSSIAN-MIXTURE MODELING OF LATTICE-BASED SPHERICAL VECTOR QUANTIZATION PERFORMANCE IN TRANSFORM AUDIO CODING	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	MAR 14-19, 2010	Dallas, TX	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Gaussian distributions; audio coding; rate distortion theory; and vector quantization		A block-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to model the distribution of transform audio data to be encoded using lattice-based spherical vector quantization (LSVQ). The expectation-maximization algorithm is used to design the GMM to model the marginal density of the transform coefficients and the vector energy density. A GMM-based rate-distortion function is derived and shown to closely match the observed spherical VQ performance. The LSVQ transform audio coding performance is characterized for the best lattices known in 4, 8, 16, and 32 dimensions.

The GA techniques differ in their encoding of the clustering problem using either a class id for each object (GAIE), medoids to assign objects to the class associated with the nearest medoid (GAME), or parameters for multivariate distributions that describe each cluster (GAPE). For the simple Iris dataset, all algorithms except GAIE obtained results with comparable accuracy, but k-means and EM had more runs with inferior results compared to GAME and GAPE. For the more complex Glass dataset, the results for GAME and GAPE were superior compared to k-means, EM and GAIE regarding their accuracy and variance of the results for repeated runs. None of the algorithms was superior for the most complex dataset (Vowel). We conclude that GAs in clustering are a valuable alternative to k-means and EM, but that the choice of the problem representation is crucial.

Bayesian Learning for Joint Sparse OFDM Channel Estimation and Data Detection	2010 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE GLOBECOM 2010	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010)	DEC 06-10, 2010	Miami, FL	IEEE			VECTOR	The impulse response of a typical wireless multipath channel can be modeled as a tapped delay line filter whose non-zero components are sparse relative to the channel delay spread. In this paper, a novel method of estimating such sparse multipath fading channels for OFDM systems is explored. In particular, Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) techniques are applied to jointly estimate the sparse channel and its second order statistics, and a new Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is derived for the SBL algorithm. Further, in the context of OFDM channel estimation, an enhancement to the SBL algorithm is proposed, which uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework to jointly estimate the sparse channel, unknown data symbols and the second order statistics of the channel. The EM-SBL algorithm is able to recover the support as well as the channel taps more efficiently, and/or using fewer pilot symbols, than the SBL algorithm. To further improve the performance of the EM-SBL, a threshold-based pruning of the estimated second order statistics that are input to the algorithm is proposed, and its mean square error and symbol error rate performance is illustrated through Monte-Carlo simulations. Thus, the algorithms proposed in this paper are capable of obtaining efficient sparse channel estimates even in the presence of a small number of pilots.	[Prasad, Ranjitha; Murthy, Chandra.

The magnitude of the transmittance function is constrained to be less than 1. The penalty is on the roughness of the complex transmittance function. Without the penalty, we show via simulation that the difference between the true and estimated transmittance function takes values in the null space of the DIC point-spread function, thereby characterizing the ill-posed nature of this inverse problem. The penalty effectively attenuates larger spatial frequencies that are in this null space. The algorithm is implemented on yeast cell images after proper normalization of the measured data. Preliminary results are promising.

Our scheme is based on our recently introduced machine learning algorithm called Simultaneous Temporal And Contextual Splitting (STACS) that discovers the appropriate number of states and efficiently learns accurate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters for the given data. STACS-based algorithms train HMMs up to five times faster than Baum-Welch, avoid the overfitting problem commonly encountered in learning large state-space HMMs using Expectation Maximization (EM) methods such as Baum-Welch, and achieve superior classification results on a very diverse dataset with minimal pre-processing. Furthermore, our scheme has proven to be highly effective for building real-world applications and has been integrated into a commercial surveillance system as an event detection component.

Each system matrix element corresponds to the probability of the detection of an annihilation event inside the field of view (FOV). Monte Carlo methods allow us to simulate physical process not included in the analytical model, such as non collinearity of gamma rays, positron range effect, interaction of incident gamma rays with the scintillator crystal (including attenuation and Compton scattering effect), etc. We have evaluated the elements of one of the quadrants of the transaxial central plane. The reflection and rotation symmetries have been use to reduce the system matrix calculation time. We use the 2D-Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) iterative method with Single Slice Rebinning (SSRB) technique to reconstruct a point source and Derenzo-like phantom images. To evaluate the performance of the Micro PET system, the merit curves and the MOBY mouse phantom reconstruction were obtained.

A likelihood-based estimator is developed that can be computed by an EM-type algorithm. The consistency of the estimator is shown and its limit distribution is provided. The new estimator is particularly well suited for fluorescence lifetime measurements, where only the shortest arrival time of a random number of emitted fluorescence photons can be detected and where arrival times are often modeled by a mixture of exponential distributions. The method is evaluated on real and synthetic data. Compared to currently used methods in fluorescence, the new estimator should allow a reduction of the acquisition time of an order of magnitude.

Weighted model-based clustering for remote sensing image analysis	COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Weighted likelihood; Mixture model; EM algorithm; Geologic map	LIKELIHOOD	We introduce a weighted method of clustering the individual units of a segmented image. Specifically, we analyze geologic maps generated from experts' analysis of remote sensing images and provide geologists with a powerful method to numerically test the consistency of a mapping with the entire multidimensional dataset of that region. Our weighted model-based clustering method (WMBC) employs a weighted likelihood and assigns fixed weights to each unit corresponding to the number of pixels located within the unit. WMBC characterizes each unit by the means and standard deviations of the pixels within that unit and uses the expectation-maximization algorithm with a weighted likelihood function to cluster the units. With both simulated and real data sets, we show that WMBC is more accurate than standard model-based clustering. Specifically, we analyze Magellan data from a large, geologically complex region of Venus to validate the mapping efforts of planetary geologists.

Thus in order to support the state estimator with prior information on the states and improve the quality of the state estimates, it is necessary to learn this unknown parameter first. Here we assume a parameterized Gaussian Markov random field to model the prior distribution of the states and propose an algorithm that is able to learn its parameters from given observations on these states. The effectiveness of this approach is proven experimentally by simulations.

An Online Method for Time-varying Spatial Spectrum Estimation using a Towed Acoustic Array	2010 CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE FORTY FOURTH ASILOMAR CONFERENCE ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS (ASILOMAR)	Conference Record of the Asilomar Conference on Signals Systems and Computers		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	NOV 07-10, 2010	Pacific Grove, CA	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc			LOCALIZATION	This paper addresses the problem of time-varying field directionality mapping (FDM) or spatial spectrum estimation in dynamic environments with a maneuverable towed acoustic array. Array processing algorithms for towed arrays are typically designed assuming the array is straight, and are thus degraded during tow ship maneuvers. In this paper, maneuvering the array is treated as a feature allowing for left and right disambiguation as well as improved resolution towards endfire. A new method for online spatial spectrum estimation is presented. The maximum likelihood of the time-varying field is solved for using a single expectation maximization step after each received data snapshot. A multi-source simulation is used to illustrate the proposed algorithm's ability to suppress ambiguous towed-array backlobes and resolve closely spaced interferers near endfire which pose challenges for conventional beamforming approaches, especially during array maneuvers.

SLAM with Expectation Maximization for Moveable Object Tracking	IEEE/RSJ 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	OCT 18-22, 2010	Taipei, TAIWAN					The goal of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is to compute the posterior distribution over landmark poses. Typically, this is made possible through the static world assumption - the landmarks remain in the same location throughout the mapping procedure. Some prior work has addressed this assumption by splitting maps into static and dynamic sets, or by recognizing moving landmarks and tracking them. In contrast to previous work, we apply an Expectation Maximization technique to a graph based SLAM approach and allow landmarks to be dynamic. The batch nature of this operation enables us to detect moveable landmarks and factor them out of the map. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with a series of experiments with moveable landmarks in a structured environment.			jgrogers@gatech.edu; atrevor@gatech.edu; carlos.nieto@gatech.edu; hic@cc.gatech.edu					BAILEY, 2006, ROBOTICS AUTOMATION; Bibby Charles, 2007, ROBOTICS SCI SYSTEMS; BURGARD W, 2008, SPRINGER HDB ROBOTIC, pCH36; CHATILA R, 1985, INT C ROB AUT; CROWLEY J, 1989, INT C ROB AUT; DELLAERT, 2005, ROBOTICS SCI SYSTEMS; DURRANTWHYTE, 2006, ROBOTICS AUTOMATION; FOLKESSON J, 2004, INT C ROB AUT; Hahnel D, 2003, IEEE INT CONF ROBOT, P1557, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241816; HAHNEL D, 2002, INT C INT ROB SYST, P496; HARTLEY RI, 1999, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, P298; KAESS M, 2008, IEEE T ROBO IN PRESS; Kaess M., 2007, INT JOINT C ART INT; Neira J, 2001, IEEE T ROBOTIC AUTOM, V17, P890, DOI 10.1109/70.976019; SMITH, 1987, INT J ROBOT RES, V5, P56; STACHNISS C, 2005, P NAT C ART INT, V20; Wagner D., 2007, P 12 COMP VIS WINT W; WANG C, 2002, INT C ROB AUT; Wang C., 2003, P IEEE INT C ROB AUT; WOLF, 2004, P ICRA; WOLF D, 2003, INT C ADV ROB; WOLF D, 2005, AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS	22	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2153-0858	978-1-4244-6675-7	IEEE INT C INT ROBOT			2010												6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Robotics	Computer Science; Robotics	BTO97	WOS:000287672002059

Given a large set of data points, the training process should yield factors for which the observed data has a high likelihood. We present a factor graph learning algorithm which on each iteration merges adjacent factors, performs expectation maximization on the resulting modified factor graph, and then splits the joined factors using non-negative matrix factorization. We show that this multifactor expectation maximization algorithm converges to the global maximum of the likelihood for difficult learning problems much faster and more reliably than traditional expectation maximization.

Gapfilling interrupted helioseismic data with the EM algorithm	ASTRONOMY LETTERS-A JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						helioseismology; data recovering; autoregressing		Helioseismic data are often interrupted by gaps, which diminish the quality of the data. In the frequency domain, these gaps lead to systematical effects with misleading interpretation of the power spectra. We propose a gap filling method that is based on modeling solar oscillation data with a statistical process, i.e., the stochastic nature of a single oscillation is taken into account by regarding it as realization of an autoregressive (AR) processes of second order. From the whole oscillation time series given as the superposition of the realization of many excited modes, the process parameters are estimated via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Then the estimated model is used to predict the further course of the oscillatory process during occurring gaps. We demonstrate the applicability of this procedure on the basis of both simulations and data obtained with the DIFOS satellite experiment suffering from gaps of 30 min duration occurring regularly every 90 min due to the orbit around the Earth.

We propose a total variation (TV) based regularization technique adapted to the case of Poisson data and use a forward-backward (FB) splitting strategy to create a numerical scheme that alternates a standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) reconstruction step with a TV correction step, which is realized by a modified version of the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model. We illustrate our technique at a synthetic object simulating optical nanoscopy measurements. Inspired by the high redundancy of information in a typical biological image, we give an outlook for an extension of the FB-EM-TV method to a nonlocal TV (NL-TV) regularization. NL-TV uses a nonlocal graph regularization, which allows to take advantage of the high degree of redundancy of natural images. Furthermore, we discuss the main challenges of the nonlocal regularization to create efficient numerical solvers which occurs automatically due to the high structure of complexity of the nonlocal regularization graph.

The difference of the proposed method from recently-reported investigations in the same direction! 1,21 is that the proposed method allows the noise to have a temporal structure, and thus the method can handle the background interference (brain noise) as the observational noise. The proposed method first estimates the MVAR coefficients of the brain noise from the control period, and then constructs the state-space model using these coefficients. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm estimates the MVAR coefficients of the brain signals. The estimated MVAR coefficients are then used to compute Granger-causality-based measures such as the partial directed coherence and the directed transfer function. The results of numerical experiments that validate the method's effectiveness are presented.

LSI uses linear spline regression to model the relationship between clean and noisy speech features. In the original algorithm, stereo training data was used to learn the spline parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and actual noisy speech features. The estimated splines are then used at runtime to adapt the clean HMMs to the current environment. While good results can be obtained with this approach, the performance is limited by the fact that the splines are trained independently from the speech recognizer and as such, they may actually be suboptimal for adaptation. In this work, we introduce a new Generalized EM algorithm for estimating the spline parameters using the speech recognizer itself. Experiments on the Aurora 2 task show that using LSI adaptation with splines trained in this manner results in a 20% improvement over the original LSI algorithm that used splines estimated from stereo data and a 28% improvement over VTS adaptation.

Vincent			Joint Channel Estimation and Equalization for OFDM based Broadband Communications in Rapidly Varying Mobile Channels	2010 IEEE GLOBECOM WORKSHOPS			English	Proceedings Paper	Globecom Workshops	DEC 05-10, 2010	Miami, FL				FADING CHANNELS; SYSTEMS	This paper is concerned with the challenging and timely problem of channel estimation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of frequency selective and very rapidly time varying channels. In OFDM systems operating over rapidly time-varying channels, the orthogonality between subcarriers is destroyed leading to inter-carrier interference (ICI) and resulting in an irreducible error floor. The band-limited, discrete cosine serial expansion of low-dimensionality is employed to represent the time-varying channel. In this way, the resulting reduced dimensional channel coefficients are estimated iteratively with tractable complexity and independently of the channel statistics. The algorithm is based on the expectation maximization-maximum a posteriori probability (EM-MAP) technique leading to a receiver structure that also yields the equalized output using the channel estimates. The pilot symbols are employed to estimate the initial coefficients effectively and unknown data symbols are averaged out in the algorithm in a non-data-aided fashion. It is shown that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm to estimate the channel coefficients and to generate the equalized output as a by-product is similar to O(N) per detected symbol, N being the number of OFDM subcarriers. Computational complexity as well as computer simulations carried out for the systems described in WiMAX and LTE standards indicate that it has significant performance and complexity advantages over existing suboptimal channel estimation and equalization algorithms proposed earlier in the literature.

Specifically, an existing method that utilizes mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions with modified Cholesky-decomposed covariance structure is extended to accommodate incomplete data. Parameter estimation is carried out in a fashion that is similar to an expectation-maximization algorithm. We focus on the particular application of clustering incomplete gene expression time course data. In this application, our approach gives good clustering performance when compared to the results when there is no missing data. Possible extensions of this work are also suggested.

A maximum likelihood approach based on a Von Bertalanffy's growth equation mixture model, implemented with EM algorithm, was developed to provide the estimates of QTL positions, QTL effects, and other model parameters responsible for growth trajectories. According to the results of a large number of simulations by Monta Carlo method, we can infer that the estimation precision of the QTL effects and position is dependent on dimensions of measured variable, sample size and heritability. At last we use an example to demonstrate the validation of our functional mapping method.

Channel estimation in the AF mode is unique in that both the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels are needed at the destination in order to perform optimum combining of the received signals from the direct (source-to-destination) and relay paths if a cooperative diversity transmission is employed. Until now, however, there have been only literatures to study the estimation of the composite channel of the relay path. In this work, an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm-based channel estimation is proposed for respective estimations of the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links at the destination. Computer simulations show that the iterative channel estimator performs satisfactorily and converges rapidly.

By noting the advantages of the Bayesian methods, practitioners prefer them. However, implementing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be very complicated for stable distributions, due to the non-analytic density or distribution function formulas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of mixture of heavy-tailed distributions, called mixture of skewed stable distributions. Skewed stable distributions belongs to the exponential family and they have analytic density representation. It is shown that skewed stable distributions dominate skewed stable distribution functions and they can be used to model heavy-tailed data. The class of skewed stable distributions has an analytic representation for its density function and the Bayesian inference can be done similar to the exponential family of distributions. Finally, mixture of skewed stable distributions are compared to the mixture of stable distributions through a simulations study.	[Shojaei, S. R.

The proposed algorithm models the magnitude spectrograms of clean audio signals as histograms drawn from a multinomial process. Spectrograms of reverberated signals are obtained as histograms of draws from the PDF of the sum of two random variables, one representing the spectrogram of clean speech and the second the frequency decomposition of the room response. The spectrogram of the clean signal is computed as a maximum-likelihood estimate from the spectrogram of reverberant speech using an EM algorithm. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to greatly reduce the reverberation effects in even highly reverberant signals captured in auditoria and other open spaces.

The advantages of this method over standard iterative approaches are shorter computation time and easier implementation of complex system models in emission tomography (ET) inverse problems. The approach is not based on data likelihood, as are the standard iterative methods, but uses 3N-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) of origin locations, where N is the number of detected events. In this work, the theory of OE was extended by introducing a parameter, beta, which can be viewed as an image regularization parameter. With this extension, the system is called the canonical origin ensemble (COE), because of the resemblance to the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics. The acquired dataset is considered a macroscopic state of the system, and locations of emissions (event origins) are viewed as unknown microscopic states described by the PDF. Monte Carlo simulations of the realistic geometry of 3D Positron Emission Tomography (PET) were generated using Simset. Photon attenuation was simulated, but randoms and Compton scatter were ignored. By measuring the image entropy, we found that the statistical system described by the COE undergoes a phase transition at beta=1. Notably, the bias of the reconstructed values undergoes a similar transition at beta=1. This indicates that, for realistic noise levels, COE reconstruction with beta close to, but less than, 1 should be used for optimal image quality. A remarkable similarity between COE reconstructed image for beta=1 and the image obtained using 10,000 iterations of list-mode 3D maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) was discovered. This work provides guidelines for improving the accuracy of the OE reconstruction method and demonstrates the use of attenuation correction for OE 3D list-mode PET.

As a stochastic optimization algorithm based on the noncooperative games, EGA maps the search space of channel state information (CSI) and objective function of log-likelihood function to the strategy profile space and utility function of non-cooperative game respectively, and achieves the optimization objective by exploring the equilibrium points of the corresponding games. Therefore the channel coefficients can be estimated with EGA for IDMA systems. The Turbo-like combination channel estimation is used in the proposed algorithm. At the first iteration we use the pilot sequences to estimate the initial channel information. And the soft estimates from the IDMA signal detector are combined with the pilot information to refine the channel coefficients in the following estimation iterations. The simulation results indicate that the bit-error-rate performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to that of ideal channel estimation. We also find the estimation performance of EGA is better than that of Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.

The model considers segment boundaries as hidden variables and includes probabilities for letter transitions within segments. For the Morph Challenge 2009, we demonstrate three versions of PROMODES. The first one uses a simple segmentation algorithm on a subset of the data and applies maximum likelihood estimates for model parameters when decomposing words of the original language data. The second version estimates its parameters through expectation maximization (EM). A third method is a committee of unsupervised learners where learners correspond to different EM initializations. The solution is found by majority vote which decides whether to segment at a word position or not. In this paper, we describe the probabilistic model, parameter estimation and how the most likely decomposition of an input word is found. We have tested PROMODES on non-vowelized and vowelized Arabic as well as on English, Finnish, German and Turkish. All three methods achieved competitive results.

Here, we view the deformation in time domain, model the trajectory of each 3D point as a linear combination of trajectory bases, and present a novel method to automatically find the trajectory bases based on orthographic camera assumption. In this paper, a linear relation is explicitly derived between 2D projected trajectory and 3D trajectory bases. With this formulation, an approximation is formulated for finding 3D trajectory bases which cast the trajectory bases finding into a problem of finding eigenvectors. Using the approximated trajectory bases as a start point, an EM-like algorithm is proposed which refine the trajectory bases and the corresponding coefficients.

We describe the process of transformation by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is a direct generalization of the PAM model for amino acids. We formulate the problem of finding the maximum likelihood probabilistic ancestor profile and demonstrate its practicality. The proposed method of solving this problem allows for obtaining simultaneously the ancestor profile and the posterior distribution of its HMM, which permits efficient determination of the most probable multiple alignment of all the sequences. Results obtained on the BAliBASE 3.0 protein alignment benchmark indicate that the proposed method is generally more accurate than popular methods of multiple alignment such as CLUSTALW, DIALIGN and ProbAlign.

Robust Mixture Modeling using the Pearson Type VII Distribution	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			SCALE MIXTURES	A mixture of Student t-distributions (MoT) has been widely used to model multivariate data sets with atypical observations, or outliers for robust clustering. In this paper, we developed a novel robust clustering approach by modeling the data sets using mixture of Pearson type VII distributions (MoP). An EM algorithm is developed for the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. An outlier detection criterion is derived from the EM solution. Controlled experimental results on the synthetic datasets show that the MoP is more viable than the MoT. The MoP performs comparably if not better, on average, in terms of outlier detection accuracy and out-of-sample log-likelihood with the MoT. Furthermore, we compared the performances of the Pearson type VII and the student t mixtures on the classification of several benchmark pattern recognition data sets. The comparison favours the developed Pearson type VII mixtures.

The EM algorithm is simple but sometimes overfits to specific examples and its likelihood diverges to infinite. To overcome the problem of overfitting, Shinozaki and Osterndorf have proposed the CV-EM algorithm in which the cross-validation technique is incorporated into the conventional EM algorithm, and have demonstrated validity of the algorithm with numerical experiments. In this article, we theoretically investigate properties of the CV-EM algorithm with an asymptotic analysis and reveal its mechanism of robustness.

However, most of the models proposed in relevant work neglect initial failure probability of samples before they are put into ALT. Initial failures exist in the case that old products are selected to be samples instead of new products in ALT for economical consideration, or even new products have been ceased to be produced. A model is proposed for constant stress ALT under competing failure modes by considering initial failures. To evaluating the model parameters, a maximum likelihood estimation approach by using the EM (expectation maximum) algorithm for incomplete data is provided. The incompleteness of data is mainly due to censoring and masking which might be the case that the failure time is observed, but its corresponding failure mode is not identified. Simulation studies show that the proposed method gives more accurate estimates by considering initial failures, as well as combining data from use condition and ALT. The method is also illustrated by an example.

As an initial step, all other phase volumes are registered to either the arterial or venous phase volume by a symmetric nonlinear registration method using mutual information as similarity metric. Once registered, the multiphase CT volumes are pre-filtered to prepare for subsequent steps. Under the assumption that the intensity vectors of different organs follow the Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), expectation maximization (EM) is then used to classify the multiphase voxels into different clusters. The clusters for liver parenchyma, vessels and tumors are combined together and provide the initial liver mask that is used to generate initial zeros level set. Conversely, the voxels classified as non-liver will guide the speed image of the level sets in order to reduce leakage. Geodesic active contour level set using the gradient vector flow (GVF) derived from one of the enhanced phase volumes is then performed to further evolve the liver segmentation mask. Using EM clusters as the reference, the resulting liver mask is finally morphologically post-processed to add missing clusters and reduce leakage. The proposed method has been tested on the clinical data sets of ten patients with relatively complex and/or extensive liver cancer or metastases. A 95.8% dice similarity index when compared to expert manual segmentation demonstrates the high performance and the robustness of our proposed method - even for challenging cancer data sets - and confirms the potential of a more thorough computational exploitation of currently available clinical data sets.

To obtain the exact distribution of coherent scatter a monochromatic, high flux, and highly parallel X-ray beam is required, and therefore, this technique is suited for a synchrotron radiation source. If a synchrotron radiation source is used, rotating the source around the patient or even rotating the patient is difficult. We propose a method for the estimation of coherent scatter distributions from any point, by moving only the position of the detector along the beam path. We acquired projection data at different positions along the beam path, and applied the maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Simulations and experiments were performed to confirm the effectiveness of this method. The estimated scatter profiles were in approximate agreement with that of the original data. Although improvement in accuracy of the estimation is necessary, this new method is useful if the X-ray source cannot be rotated around the patient.

In this algorithm, we first use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing method to split multiple channel impulse responses into individual segments, each containing the observations of a wide-sense stationary channel. Then, the path estimates returned by the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm are grouped into clusters by using a modified K-means iterative method based on multipath component distance (MCD). The dispersion dimensions considered for path grouping include delay, azimuth and elevation of arrival, as well as azimuth and elevation of departure. Different from the conventional clustering algorithms that rely on heuristic settings for weighting the MCD in dispersion dimensions, we cluster the paths in a specific sequence to different dimensions, which is predefined to reflect the priorities of the dimensions for the usage of the CDL models. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is compared with the conventional clustering algorithm by using measurement data in three indoor scenarios.

Random effects regression models for count data with excess zeros in caries research	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						adaptive Gaussian quadrature; dental caries scores; clustered data; factor loadings; inflated zeros; negative binomial; Poisson distribution; random effects	INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION; LATENT-VARIABLE MODELS; BIVARIATE; ALGORITHM; OUTCOMES	We extend the family of Poisson and negative binomial models to derive the joint distribution of clustered count outcomes with extra zeros. Two random effects models are formulated. The first model assumes a shared random effects term between the conditional probability of perfect zeros and the conditional mean of the imperfect state. The second formulation relaxes the shared random effects assumption by relating the conditional probability of perfect zeros and the conditional mean of the imperfect state to two different but correlated random effects variables. Under the conditional independence and the missing data at random assumption, a direct optimization of the marginal likelihood and an EM algorithm are proposed to fit the proposed models. Our proposed models are fitted to dental caries counts of children under the age of six in the city of Detroit.

ML-EM (maximum likelihood expectation-maximization) [2] algorithm is one of the most widely used statistical reconstruction methods. Although with good image quality, the ML-EM algorithm is challenged by its slow convergence speed and ill-condition problem. To solve for the problems, based on the ideas from the accelerated EM (AEM) [3] and maximum a posteriori EM (MAP-EM) [4] algorithms, we derived two approaches (MAP-AEM1 and MAP-AEM2) in this study to accelerate MAP reconstruction using a bigger step size instead of ordered subsets. The results were compared with ordered-subset methods of both BSREM and MAPCOSEM. From the preliminary results, our methods showed the speedup ability for the traditional MAP-EM.

In PET reconstruction, statistical image reconstruction methods such as ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) are widely used. However, it has been shown that iterative reconstruction methods produce bias for low count statistics data which is typical in dynamic PET studies. This bias problem has been published previously also for the ECAT high resolution research tomograph (HRRT, CTI PET Systems, Knoxville, TN, USA) PET scanner. Alternatively, dynamic PET data can be reconstructed analytically (for example by using 3D Reprojection, 3D-RP method). In this study, we compare 3D-RP and 3D-OPOSEM reconstructed dynamic HRRT PET images. For the 3D-RP reconstruction, the missing parts (caused by the octagonal detector design in the HRRT gantry) were estimated by the 3D DCT-domain gap-filling with a dedicated DCT-domain filter and the 3D transradial bicubic interpolation methods. We compared the reconstruction methods with two scans of one subject performed with the [C-11]-raclopride tracer. We assessed the methods visually by calculating the ratio images between the binding potential images obtained by different reconstruction methods. Moreover, regional time activity curves (TACs) and areas under the TACs of the employed reconstruction schemes were compared. We observed that for the cerebellum, caudate and putamen regions, 3D-RP reconstruction produced higher activity concentration than the 3D-OPOSEM reconstructions. On the other hand, the results obtained by the 3D-RP after different gap-filling methods were similar.

The method works on two levels. On the first level, it uses the expectation-maximization algorithm to build a Gaussian mixture model of the spatial density of agents' movement. On the second level, agents' trajectories as expressed as sequences of the components of the mixture model; the sequences are subsequently used to train hidden Markov models. The trained hidden Markov models are then employed to determine agent type, predict further agent movement or detect anomalous agents. The method has been evaluated in the maritime domain using ship trajectory data generated by the AGENTC maritime traffic simulation.

Especially in oligopolistic markets for durable consumer products a robust understanding of selling prices is important, as it drives pricing behavior as well as procurement, inventory and production decisions. Moreover, a supply chain perspective is indispensable for pricing forecasts since companies not only compete for product sales but also for limited resources. This paper explores the use of dynamic multivariate hedonics-based pricing models that explicitly model selling prices with the market valuation of constituting parts. The model is applied to TAC SCM, a supply-chain trading agent competition. To find unknown component prices series we apply the Kalman filter technique to smooth and forecast implicit prices using the EM algorithm.

On the other side it is sensitive to frequency offset at the local oscillator, phase noise and Doppler shift which may destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers causing Inter Carrier Interference (ICI). It is possible to represent this interference in the frequency domain by means of an ICI matrix. Since these types of errors greatly affect the performance of an OFDM system, estimation of this matrix is crucial. In this work we propose an iterative method to mitigate the interference among subcarriers exploiting the presence of pilot tones in the frequency domain. It can be explained referring to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) paradigm. The proposed technique is very effective in multipath fading channels and a simplified version is also introduced in case of AWGN channel with frequency offset at the local oscillator. Simulation results show that the presented algorithm converges very quickly and looks promising to be used in actual implementations.

The mesh-domain system matrix elements were estimated by first partitioning the object domain into strips parallel to detector face and with width not exceeding the size of a detector unit. This was followed by approximating the integration over the strip/mesh-element union. This approximation is product of: (i) strip width, (ii) intersection length of a ray central to strip with a mesh element, and (iii) the response and expansion function evaluated at midpoint of the intersection length. Reconstruction was performed using OSEM without regularization and with exact knowledge of the attenuation map. The method was evaluated using synthetic SPECT data generated using SIMIND Monte Carlo simulation software. Comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis included: bias, variance, standard deviation and line-profiles within three different regions of interest. We found that no more than two divisions per detector bin were needed for good quality reconstructed images when using a high resolution mesh.

Comparison between reconstruction-incorporated super-resolution and super-resolution as a post-processing step for motion correction in PET	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE				Super-resolution (SR) aims at generating a high resolution image or image sequence from several slightly different low-resolution images. In previous work, we have showed that a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) SR algorithm can yield significant image quality enhancement of the individual respiratory gated PET frames. However, in the past it has been also argued that image-based motion correction algorithms yield sub-optimal results, particularly when images are reconstructed using iterative methods. Here, we evaluate the results incorporating MAP SR directly as part of the One-Step-Late (OSL) reconstruction algorithm. The evaluation used GATE simulated data. The IEC phantom with lesions between 10-37mm (contrast 8/1) was used to simulate 200 noise realizations of 6 frames, each shifted by 3mm along the z-axis relative to each other. The algorithm was also tested on four realistic phantoms. Gated respiratory images were reconstructed with the OPL-EM algorithm. Super-resolution was performed through a MAP algorithm either as part of the reconstruction process or as a post-processing step applied to the individually reconstructed gated frames. A Huber prior was used as regularization term while the function yielded by the MAP method was optimized through a quasi-Newton algorithm. We compared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast, as well as the bias-variance tradeoff for each algorithm. SR incorporated reconstruction led to 9% and 14% higher SNR and contrast respectively compared to the image-based SR. The bias-variance tradeoff showed that reconstruction-incorporated SR has a bias and variance of 39% lower and 60% higher respectively compared to image-based SR.

Our goal is to develop an iterative algorithm for joint channel estimation and data detection in channels that have a long memory and are fast varying in time. At each iteration, starting with an estimate of the channel, we combine a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for data detection, and an adaptive algorithm for channel tracking, to develop a statistical search procedure that finds joint important samples of possible transmitted data and channel impulse responses. The result of this step, which may be thought as E-step of the proposed algorithm, is used in an M-step that refines the channel estimate, for the next iteration. Excellent behavior of the proposed algorithm is presented by examining it on real data from underwater acoustic communication channels.

A new iterative algorithm the EM algorithm is proposed to obtain the accurate estimation for multiple incoherently distributed sources with Gaussian angular power density function. The optimization of the likelihood function for multiple distributed sources is simplified into multiple optimizations for single source and the performance of the EM algorithm is very close to the CRLB even for low SNR. Another advantage of the EM algorithm is that it is insensitive to overestimate the number of sources compared with other methods. Computer simulations verify that the EM algorithm is more effective than most existing algorithms.

The key issue is to estimate both numbers and parameters of motions simultaneously. Different from global clustering method and random sampling scheme, in this paper, we propose a divided-and-conquer algorithm to solve the motion segmentation problem. A guided selection is used to choose the most creditable hypothetical motion as a candidate seed and then make it grow larger. Compared to previous works such as expectation maximization and factorization approaches, there is no need for any pre-knowledge of the number of motions. To global non-parametric clustering method, it is fast because each time we only do cluster process in a partitioned sub-set. Experiments have shown that the proposal method can give a satisfying result for motion segmentation.

Iodine subtraction was accomplished with a commercial three material decomposition algorithm to create a virtual non-contrast (VNC) image set. VNC images were then used to segment stone regions from tissue background. The DE ratio of each stone was calculated using the CT images acquired at two different energies with DECT using the stone map generated from the VNC images. The performance of DE ratio-based stone differentiation was evaluated at five different iodine concentrations (21, 42, 63, 84 and 105 mg/ml). The DE ratio of stones in iodine solution was found larger than those obtained in non-iodine cases. This is mainly caused by the partial volume effect around the boundary between the stone and iodine solution. The overestimation of the DE ratio leads to substantial overlap between different stone types. To address the partial volume effect, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach was implemented to estimate the contribution of iodine and stone within each image pixel in their mixture area. The DE ratio of each stone was corrected to maximally remove the influence of iodine solutions. The separation of uric-acid and non-uric-acid stone was improved in the presence of iodine solution.

As an essential tool to develop suitable algorithms for joint communications and localizations in mobile radio networks, the wireless channel model has a growing significance. For both communications and localizations, the time evolution of multipath components is essential especially for tracking applications. Moreover, the Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) error due to an undetectable line-of-sight path introduces an additional range error for TB localizations, which needs to be taken into account in the channel model. In this paper we present a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization based Kalman filter method to efficiently estimate and track the time-variant multipath components based on a channel measurement campaign. The modeling of time-variant multipath characteristics, in terms of NLoS error, variance of path number, and the life span, are presented in this paper as well.

J	Wang, YK; Cheng, KY				Wang, Yuan-Kai; Cheng, Kuang-You			A Two-Stage Bayesian Network Method for 3D Human Pose Estimation from Monocular Image Sequences	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							MODEL; MOTION; RECONSTRUCTION	This paper proposes a novel human motion capture method that locates human body joint position and reconstructs the human pose in 3D space from monocular images. We propose a two-stage framework including 2D and 3D probabilistic graphical models which can solve the occlusion problem for the estimation of human joint positions. The 2D and 3D models adopt directed acyclic structure to avoid error propagation of inference. Image observations corresponding to shape and appearance features of humans are considered as evidence for the inference of 2D joint positions in the 2D model. Both the 2D and 3D models utilize the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn prior distributions of the models. An annealed Gibbs sampling method is proposed for the two-stage method to inference the maximum posteriori distributions of joint positions. The annealing process can efficiently explore the mode of distributions and find solutions in high-dimensional space. Experiments are conducted on the HumanEva dataset with image sequences of walking motion, which has challenges of occlusion and loss of image observations. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage approach can efficiently estimate more accurate human poses.

In previous works, the authors revealed that the computational complexity of GMM-based classification can be reduced by using an interval calculation technique[1], [2]. This work applies the idea to EM algorithm for GMM parameter estimation. From experiments, it is confirmed that the computational speed of the proposal achieves more than twice that of the standard method with 'exp( )' function. The relative errors are less than 0.6% and 0.053% when the number of bits for table addressing are 4 and 8, respectively.

A Bayesian network is used to model the relationship of variables in individual vector and the learned graphical structure is decomposed into subgraphs representing subproblems. Subsequently, GMM is adopted to model the probability distribution of each subproblem and its parameters are estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. New samples are generated from the GMM of each subproblem and finally are mixed into new individuals. It is demonstrated by numerical examples that the proposed algorithm could achieve better performance than previous related algorithms.

The recursions are motivated by similar recursions developed for hidden Markov models by Lystig and Hughes who extended earlier work by LeGland and Mevel. Explicit expressions for the first derivative and Hessian of the MMPP transition density matrix are developed and coupled with the recursions. The recursions are implemented and applied to confidence interval estimation in a simulation study.	[Willy, Christopher J.] JF Taylor Inc, Lexington Pk, MD 20653 USA; [Roberts, William J.

A Phantom Study of Regularized Image Reconstruction in PET	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE			RESOLUTION; ALGORITHM	Image quality was measured for varied tuning parameters of four penalized likelihood potential functions with reconstructed PET data of multiple hot spheres in a warm background. Statistical image reconstruction with potential functions that penalize differences in neighboring image voxels can produce a smoother image, but large differences that occur at physical boundaries should not be penalized and allowed to form. Over-smoothing PET images with small lesions is especially problematic because it can completely smooth a lesion's intensities into the background. Fourteen 1.0-cm spheres with a 6: 1 radioactivity concentration relative to the warm background were positioned throughout a 40-cm long phantom with a 36x21-cm oval cross section. By varying the tuning parameters, multiple image sets were reconstructed with modified block sequential regularized expectation maximization statistical reconstruction algorithm using 4 potential functions: quadratic, generalized Gaussian, logCosh, and Huber. Regions of interest were positioned on the images, and the image quality was measured as contrast recovery, background variability, and signal-to-noise ratio across the ROIs. This phantom study was used to further narrow the choice of potential functions and parameter values to either improve the image quality of small lesions or avoid deteriorating them at the cost of optimizing reconstruction parameters for other image features. Neither the quadratic or logCosh potentials performed well for small lesion SNR because they either over-smoothed the lesions or under-smoothed the background, respectively. Varying the parameter values for the Huber potential had a proportional effect on the background variability and the sphere signal such that SNR was relatively fixed. Generalized Gaussian simultaneously decreased background variability and increased small lesion contrast recovery that produced SNRs as much as two-times higher than the other potential functions.

In this paper a flexible harmonic temporal structure for modeling musical instrument was proposed for estimating pitch in real music. Unlike the previous research, the proposed model does multipitch estimation according to the specific characteristics of specific musical instrument and uses EM algorithm to estimate the parameters in the model. Through choosing parameters suitable for its own characters for specific instrument, the proposed model preponderated over the common model.

The modified Viterbi algorithm can be used in the receiver when the MIMO channel information has been estimated. Compared with the conventional decoding algorithm, the improved algorithm can be used in the every receiver respectively. It is shown that the improved algorithm is also an optimal algorithm, however, its metric convergence speed is faster than the standard Viterbi algorithm.

But, in practically, the probability density function of data source may be inherently non-Gaussian. As the distribution family covers most of the common distribution types and the frequency curves provided by the family are as wide as in general use, this paper considers Johnson distribution family to estimate the unknown parameters and approximate the empirical distribution. The method uses the moments to initialize the parameters of the distribution family, and then calculates parameters by using EM algorithm. The experiment results show that the fitted model could depicts quite successfully the both Gaussian and non-Gaussian probability density function of image intensity, and comparatively the method has low computing complexity.

However, the vector space model based distance, such as cosine-like distance, will get a low precision and recall when the corpus contains many related topics. In this paper, we propose a new distance measure method: the Topic Model (TM) induced distance. Assuming that the distribution of word is different in each topic, the documents can be treated as a sample of the mixture of k topic models, which can be estimated using expectation maximization (EM). A biased initiation method is proposed in this paper for topic decomposition using ETA, which will generate a converged matrix for the generation of TM induced distance. The collections of web news are clustered into classes using this TM distance. A series of experiments are described on a corpus containing 5033 web news from 30 topics. K-means clustering is processed on test set with different topic numbers. A comparison of clustering result using the TM induced distance and the traditional cosine-like distance are given. The experiment results show that the proposed topic decomposition method using biased initiation is effective than the topic decomposition using random values. The TM induced distance will generate more topical groups than the VS model based cosine-like distance. In the web news collections containing related topics, the TM induced distance can achieve a better precision and recall.

Starting from an embedding space such as the visual hull, we will first conduct robust 3D depth estimation (represented as 3D points) based on image correlation. A fast implicit distance function-based region growing method is then employed to extract an initial shape estimation based on these 3D points. Next, an explicit surface evolution will be conducted to recover the finer geometry details of the recovered shape. The recovered shape will be further improved by several iterations between depth estimation and shape reconstruction, similar to the Expectation Maximization (EM) approach. The experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our algorithm can obtain high-quality reconstruction results that are comparable with the state-of-art methods, with considerable less computational time and complexity.

In the previous work, the modeling technique for the remote sensing image classification based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle with mixture model is analyzed theoretically. In this work, experimental studies are performed for investigating the modeling technique. With intensive experiments and sophisticated analysis, it is found that the developed modeling technique can build a robust classification system, which can avoid classifier over-fitting training data and make the learning process trade-off between bias and variance. Meanwhile, designed mixture model is more efficient to represent real multi-source remote sensing images compared to single model.

Parametric segmentation approaches typically assume unimodal Gaussian distributions on MRI intensities of individual tissue classes, even in applications on multi-spectral images. However, this assumption has not been rigorously verified especially in the context of MS. In this work, we evaluate the local MRI intensities of both healthy and diseased brain tissues of 21 multi-spectral MRIs (63 volumes in total) of MS patients for adherence to this assumption. We show that the tissue intensities are not uniform across the brain and vary across (anatomical) regions of the brain. Consequently, we show that Gaussian mixtures can better model the multi-spectral intensities. We utilize an Expectation Maximization (EM) based approach to learn the models along with a symmetric Jeffreys divergence criterion to study differences in intensity distributions. The effects of these findings are also empirically verified on automatic segmentation of brains with MS.	[Xiao, Yiming; Francis, Simon; Arnold, Douglas L.; Collins, D.

Since the VBEM algorithm provides the distribution estimation of all parameters, the proposed signal detection algorithm is different from the conventional ones in that the evaluation of extrinsic information is improved by considering channel estimation error in signal detection. In addition, with the aid of the soft information provided by the signal detector, the Recursive VBEM (RVBEM) algorithm is derived to track the time-varying channels. Due to the high complexity of the RVBEM algorithm, a Time-frequency combined low complexity recursive VBEM (TF-LCRVBEM) algorithm is further proposed to reduce complexity. The analysis results demonstrate that the TF-LCRVBEM algorithm totally avoids computation of matrix inversion and obtains linear complexity. Moreover, the simulation results show that the proposed receiver outperforms the conventional receiver, and suffer small performance loss at relatively high Signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), compared with the optimal receiver with perfect Channel state information (CSI).

With experimentations, the scheme can achieve good performance with simple user ends for the system. Design/methodology/approach - IDMA technique is employed as the uplink transmission and CDMA technique as the downlink transmission. The performance comparison of IDMA and IDMA/CDMA downlink is studied with Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the bit error rates. For IDMA/CDMA downlink, the signals are interleaved by random interleavers, spreaded by M-sequence and orthogonal Gold sequence, respectively, and then transmitted over an AWGN with BPSK modulation. Moreover, a channel estimation approach for IDMA based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is also presented. Findings - The multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm in uplink IDMA systems is much simpler than that used in traditional CDMA systems. It is also well known that the orthogonal spreading codes in CDMA can effectively help suppress the MM in the synchronized environments. But for the asynchronized application, the performance of CDMA systems will degrade due to the serious multiple user interference. According to traditional IDMA and orthogonal code division multiple access/IDMA signal detection algorithms, every UE has to detect all of the signals of other users for iterative detection. The advantages of IDMA and CDMA technologies can be utilized substantially. Originality/value - The proposed hybrid multiple access scheme can achieve a very simple chip-by-chip iterative MUD strategy at base station, and the simplified receiving operation at UE. On the other hand, this paper also evaluates channel estimation approach for IDMA based on EM algorithm.

By suppressing the energy leakage due to the imperfect sampling of the leading channel paths, a novel ToA estimator is proposed for the MB-OFDM UWB system. This ToA estimator is evaluated and compared with the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm in IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channels. Simulation results show that the proposed ToA estimator performs well in all channel models and outperforms SAGE by directly locating the first channel path.

However, there are issues with model selection during the learning of the HME model using Expectation-Maximization (EM) inference. In addition, the EM algorithm suffers from the well-known problem of local minima. In this paper, we present a hybrid generative-discriminative approach that inherits the flexibility of the HME while decomposing the learning process into a few simple steps. The proposed algorithm solves the model-selection problem and empirical experiments on public benchmark datasets show its advantages in classification accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a new importance estimation method using mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (PPCAs). Our method employs the framework of the Kullback-Leibler importance estimation procedure (KLIEP) using using linear or kernel models. The proposed approach entitled PPCA mixture KLIEP (PM-KLIEP) can improve importance estimation accuracy with correlated and rank-deficient data. Through experiments, we show the validity of the proposed approach.			makoto.05@engalumni.colostate.edu; sugi@cs.titech.ac.jp; Gordon.Wichern@asu.edu					Bishop C.

In particular, we develop a variational approach for approximately computing posterior distributions of parameters of MER distribution in the Bayesian context. Computation speed of the proposed method becomes up to 200 times faster than that of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The estimates of proposed method are almost same as those of MCMC method. Moreover, we discuss how to estimate shape parameters of Erlang distribution based on a certain goodness-of-fit criterion in the proposed variational Bayes method.

In the previous work, a statistical model of the virtual concept drift was constructed, and the model-selection criterion for radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) under such environments was built with the environmental model (Yamauchi 2009). However, in the previous model, no consideration was given to reducing the computational complexity and storage space for storing learned samples used in future re-learning. This study extends the previous model to a new one that uses less storage space. The extended model uses pseudo-learning samples generated by its RBFNN predecessor instead of using the real old learning samples.

This paper proposes a strategy to achieve model selection incrementally under virtual concept drifting environments, where the distribution of learning samples varies over time. To carry out incremental model selection, the system generally uses all the learning samples that have been observed until now. Under virtual concept drifting environments, however, the distribution of the observed samples is considerably different from that under real concept drifting environments so that model selection is usually unsuccessful. To overcome this problem, the author had earlier proposed the weighted objective function and model-selection criterion based on the predictive input density of the learning samples. Although the previous method described in the author's previous study shows good performances to some datasets, it occasionally fails to yield appropriate learning results because of the failure in the prediction of the actual input density. To overcome this drawback, the method proposed in this paper improves on the previously described method to yield the desired outputs using an ensemble of the constructed radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Experimental results indicate that the improved method yields a stable performance.

This new scheme is based on the signal selection (SS) and the iterative weighted-least-mean-square (IWLMS) algorithm. The incurred additional complexity by the SS scheme is linear with respect to the sample size of the received signal and the IWLMS method is also very efficient. We employ numerous Monte Carlo experiments to compare our proposed blind equalization method with the popular constant modulus algorithm (CMA).

However, the conventional FCM algorithm has a very serious shortcoming, i.e., the algorithm tends to balance the number of points in each cluster during the classification. Therefore, when this algorithm is applied to segment the MR images with quite different size of objects, it will lead to bad segmentation. To overcome this problem, a novel fuzzy expectation maximization (FEM) algorithm is presented in this paper. The algorithm is developed by extending the classical hard EM algorithm into soft EM algorithm through integrating the fuzzy and statistical techniques. Compared with the FCM algorithm, the experimental results on MR image segmentation clearly indicate that the proposed FEM algorithm has better performance for the segmentation.

The Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is applied for extracting the paths from measurement data. It is found that the channel auto-correlation function and coherence time computed based on the path parameters are biased. A simple method is proposed for correction of the biases. Experimental investigations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

However, the traditional Dynamic Factor Analysis utilizes the same time lags currently among all variables, but the computing work is complex and the auto-correlation isn't adequately exemplified. The paper proposes a new monitoring method based on modified dynamic factor analysis that determines different time lags according to different variables by correlation analysis, and constructs several statistics as the monitoring indices to monitor the operation condition of the dynamic process. The improved monitoring method is applied in the Tennessee-Eastman process and compared with DFA, the validity and superiority are proved.

FINITE NORMAL MIXTURE SEM ANALYSIS BY FITTING MULTIPLE CONVENTIONAL SEM MODELS	SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY, VOL 40	Sociological Methodology		English	Article; Book Chapter							COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS; CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; TEST STATISTICS; IMPROPER SOLUTIONS; EM ALGORITHM; FIT INDEXES; CONVERGENCE; TESTS	This paper proposes a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML) approach to normal mixture structural equation modeling (SEM) and develops a statistical inference that allows distributional misspecification. Saturated means and covariances are estimated at stage 1 together with a sandwich-type covariance matrix. These are used to evaluate structural models at stage 2. Techniques accumulated in the conventional SEM literature for model diagnosis and evaluation can be used to study the model structure for each component. Examples show that the two-stage ML approach leads to correct or nearly correct models even when the normal mixture assumptions are violated and initial models are misspecified. Compared to single-stage ML, two-stage ML avoids the confounding effect of model specification and the number of components, and it is computationally more efficient. Monte Carlo results indicate that two-stage ML loses only minimal efficiency under the condition where single-stage ML performs best. Monte Carlo results also indicate that the commonly used model selection criterion BIC is more robust to distribution violations for the saturated model than that for a structural model at moderate sample sizes. The proposed two-stage ML approach is also extremely flexible in modeling different components with different models. Potential new developments in the mixture modeling literature can be easily adapted to study issues with normal mixture SEM.

A brute-force solution to this learning problem is often impractical due to nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the resulting optimization problem. In this work we propose an approximate solution to the ESN learning by appealing to the variational Bayesian EM-type of estimation algorithm. We show that such approach allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the resulting objective functions. Furthermore, it allows to implement ESN learning and adapt filter neurons and delays jointly within the variational framework. Simulations are performed for learning randomly generated target ESNs, as well as other synthetic nonlinear dynamic systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can improve ESN learning for a wide class of problems.

Multiple users communicating over time-invariant and/or time-variant channels are considered in this paper. Channel estimation becomes quite challenging in this scenario, since an increased number of independent transmitter-receiver links having different statistical characteristics have to be simultaneously estimated for each subcarrier. The proposed EM-based joint CIR and noise-variance estimator designed for multiuser MIMO OFDM/SDMA system is shown to simultaneously estimate the time-invariant and time-variant CIRs as well as noise-variance.

We specifically design the HS aided MUD for the communications problem considered and apply it in an iterative joint Channel Estimation (CE), MUD and channel decoding framework. The simulation results demonstrate that a near-single-user performance can be achieved by the proposed algorithm while avoiding the excessive-complexity full-search-based optimum detection even in overloaded DS-CDMA systems. Moreover, the HS algorithm can be efficiently applied in the Expectation Maximisation (EM) based CE framework.

The iterative detection/decoding and channel estimation are iteratively employed based on the Variational Bayes expectation-maximization (VBEM) algorithm to improve the system performance. A modified list sphere decoder (LSD) is derived to make the data detection feasible for large systems, which takes into account the statistical information about the channel uncertainty and provides soft symbols for channel estimation. With the autoregressive process channel model and the soft symbols calculated from detector, the time-varying channel impulse responses are tracked by the Kalman smoother. The VBEM iterations are embedded in the turbo-processing of the receiver for incorporation of the coding constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has robust performance over time-varying channels.

We start with calculating the multiscale classification likelihoods of wavelet coefficients by expectation-maximization(EM) algorithm. Energy function is then generated by combining boundary term estimated by classification likelihoods with regional term obtained by both pixel information and approximation coefficients. Through energy minimization through graph cut via convex optimization, objects are segmented accurately from the images in a global optimization sense.

This severely limits the deployment and adaptation of GMM in many real-time online systems since the newly observed data samples are expected to be incorporated into the system upon available via retraining the model. This paper presents a new online incremental EM training procedure of GMM, which aims to perform the EM: training incrementally and so can adapt GMM online sample by sample. The proposed method is extended on two kinds of EM algorithms for GMM, namely, Split-and-Merge EM and the traditional EM. Experiments on both the synthetic data and a speech processing task show the advantages and efficiency of the new method.

Sanches et al. The reconstruction has a parameter. which can be adjusted so that the results can be smoother or sharper depending to the value of.. In order to make the image smoother inside the organs but sharper in their boundaries simultaneously, we introduced a improved EM algorithm: EM algorithm with a diffusion filer or is referred as EMD algorithm. There was a cubic average filter inside the loop of the iteration of the EM algorithm. This average filter is replaced by a diffusion filter in the EMD algorithm. The diffusion filter offers an additional parameter K(d) which can be used to adjust the reconstructed image with better optimization in both smoothness insider the human organ and sharpness in its boundary. Two above mentioned reconstruction algorithms for the freehand B-scan ultrasound image are compared through the simulation and the phantom measurements. In the simulation, strong noises are added to the ultrasound frame data. The parameters of two algorithms are optimized to get smallest errors. The errors are compared between two algorithms with optimized parameters. For the measurement with phantom, the Eigen's tracker system is used to continuously measure the coordinates of the ultrasound probe. The ultrasound B-scan frame is synchronously recorded with the probe coordinates. Zonare ultrasound machine is used to acquire the 2D frame images. The segmentation of the reconstruction results is done. The segmentation volumes of the prostate phantoms are compared. The results shows that EMD algorithm is better at reducing the noises and keeping the image edge comparing to EM algorithm. Eigen's tracker can acquire freehand ultrasound data for a 3D image reconstruction with high quality.

The second approach, twofold expectation maximization (TEM), estimates noise distributions by regarding them as hidden variables in a modified EM fashion. Mathematical derivations reveal the substantial connection between the two approaches. Two experiments are performed in evaluating the performance and convergence rate of the algorithms.

J	Debowski, L				Debowski, Lukasz			Valence extraction using EM selection and co-occurrence matrices	LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION			English	Article						Verb valence extraction; EM algorithm; Co-occurrence matrices; Polish language	VERB CLASSES	This paper discusses two new procedures for extracting verb valences from raw texts, with an application to the Polish language. The first novel technique, the EM selection algorithm, performs unsupervised disambiguation of valence frame forests, obtained by applying a non-probabilistic deep grammar parser and some post-processing to the text. The second new idea concerns filtering of incorrect frames detected in the parsed text and is motivated by an observation that verbs which take similar arguments tend to have similar frames. This phenomenon is described in terms of newly introduced co-occurrence matrices. Using co-occurrence matrices, we split filtering into two steps. The list of valid arguments is first determined for each verb, whereas the pattern according to which the arguments are combined into frames is computed in the following stage. Our best extracted dictionary reaches an F-score of 45%, compared to an F-score of 39% for the standard frame-based BHT filtering.

A fuzzy p-value approach to hypothesis testing has recently been proposed which is implemented by imputing the missing values in the "complete data" test statistic by values simulated from the conditional null distribution given the observed data. We argue that imputing data in this way will inevitably lead to loss in power. For the case of scalar parameter, we show that the asymptotic efficiency of the score test based on the imputed "complete data" relative to the score test based on the observed data is given by the ratio of the observed data information to the complete data information. Three examples involving probit regression, normal random effects model, and unidentified paired data are used for illustration. For testing linkage disequilibrium based on pooled genotype data, simulation results show that the imputed Neyman Pearson and Fisher exact tests are less powerful than a Wald-type test based on the observed data maximum likelihood estimator. In conclusion, we caution against the routine use of the fuzzy p-value approach in latent variable or missing data problems and suggest some viable alternatives.	[Kuk, Anthony Y.

The variables considered in the application includes some aspects related with the families that live in counties, such as occupation of its members, education, demographic aspects and others. For the analysis, we use the first six principal components taken from a previous analysis. A classification on nine groups was obtained, and the difference between these groups was influenced by the socioeconomic status, the access to some basic services and quality of life.

Assuming an accelerated failure time (AFT) model with unspecified error distribution for the time to the event of interest, we propose rank-based estimating equations for the model parameters and use a generalization of the EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Applying our proposed AFT model to the same motivating breast cancer dataset as Dahlberg and Wang (Biometrics 2007, 63, 1237-1244), our results are more intuitive for the treatment arm in which the PH assumption may be violated. We also conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

J	Fu, CY; Ng, BK; Razul, SG				Fu, Chit Yaw; Ng, Beng Koon; Razul, Sirajudeen Gulam			Fluorescence lifetime discrimination using expectation-maximization algorithm with joint deconvolution	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS			English	Article						time-correlated single-photon counting; time resolved; fluorescence lifetime; multiexponential decay function; fluorescence spectroscopy; expectation-maximization algorithm	LEAST-SQUARES; TIME-DOMAIN; SPECTROSCOPY; SELECTION; CANCER; CELLS	The fluorescence lifetime technique offers an effective way to resolve fluorescent components with overlapping emission spectra. The presence of multiple fluorescent components in biological compounds can hamper their discrimination. The conventional method based on the nonlinear least-squares technique is unable to consistently determine the correct number of fluorescent components in a fluorescence decay profile. This can limit the applications of the fluorescence lifetime technique in biological assays and diagnoses where more than one fluorescent component is typically encountered. We describe the use of an expectation-maximization (EM) method with joint deconvolution to estimate the fluorescence decay parameters, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to accurately determine the number of fluorescent components. A comprehensive simulation and experimental study is carried out to compare the performance and accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the EMBIC method is able to accurately identify the correct number of fluorescent components in samples with weakly fluorescing components.

J	Liu, W; Tao, J; Shi, NZ; Tang, ML				Liu, Wei; Tao, Jian; Shi, Ning-Zhong; Tang, Man-Lai			Model selection in toxicity studies	STATISTICA NEERLANDICA			English	Article						Bayes factor; beta-binomial model; cross validation; finite mixture model	RISK-ASSESSMENT; QUANTITATIVE RESPONSES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BAYES FACTORS; EM ALGORITHM; APPROXIMATIONS; DENSITIES	In toxicity studies, model mis-specification could lead to serious bias or faulty conclusions. As a prelude to subsequent statistical inference, model selection plays a key role in toxicological studies. It is well known that the Bayes factor and the cross-validation method are useful tools for model selection. However, exact computation of the Bayes factor is usually difficult and sometimes impossible and this may hinder its application. In this paper, we recommend to utilize the simple Schwarz criterion to approximate the Bayes factor for the sake of computational simplicity. To illustrate the importance of model selection in toxicity studies, we consider two real data sets. The first data set comes from a study of dietary fortification with carbonyl iron in which the Bayes factor and the cross-validation are used to determine the number of sub-populations in a mixture normal model. The second example involves a developmental toxicity study in which the selection of dose-response functions in a beta-binomial model is explored.

It uses a non-totally differentiable discriminational process instead of the conventional totally differential one to relate the observed rankings and the underlying subjective values. A Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to find the maximum likelihood estimates together with the standard errors of the parameters. The approach is examined numerically by means of an artificial example and a simulation study and is applied to a study of attribute assessment.

A special form of non-stationarity, where the underlying generator switches between (approximately) stationary regimes, seems particularly appropriate for financial markets. We use a dynamic switching (modelled by a hidden Markov model) combined with a linear conditionally heteroskedastic latent factor model in a hybrid conditionally heteroskedastic factor analysed hidden Markov model (CHFAHMM) and discuss the practical details of training such models with a new approximated version of the Viterbi algorithm in conjunction with the expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively estimate the model parameters in a maximum-likelihood sense. The performance of the CHFAHMM is evaluated on both simulated and financial data sets. On the basis of out-of-sample forecast encompassing tests as well as other measures for forecasting accuracy, our results indicate that the use of this new method yields overall better forecasts than those generated by competing models.

When there are repeated measures of the potential risk factor, the standard conditional logistic regression approach is no longer applicable. In this article, we propose a joint modeling approach for the survival times and the longitudinal measurements of the risk factor under the nested case-control sampling. We adopt the idea of shared latent parameters and present a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to evaluate the association between longitudinal exposure measurements and time to event. We employ the EM algorithm to carry out the maximum likelihood estimation and use an EM-aided profile likelihood approach to estimate the standard errors. Extensive simulations show the validity and efficiency of our method.

J	Walrand, S; Jamar, F; Pauwels, S				Walrand, Stephan; Jamar, Francois; Pauwels, Stanislas			Improved solution for ill-posed linear systems using a constrained optimization ruled by a penalty: evaluation in nuclear medicine tomography	INVERSE PROBLEMS			English	Article							SPACE RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM; EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EM ALGORITHM; BAYESIAN RECONSTRUCTION; DISCREPANCY PRINCIPLE; VOLUME ECT; REGULARIZATION; RESTORATION; LIKELIHOOD	Ill-posed linear systems occur in many different fields. A class of regularization methods, called constrained optimization, aims to determine the extremum of a penalty function whilst constraining an objective function to a likely value. We propose here a novel heuristic way to screen the local extrema satisfying the discrepancy principle. A modified version of the Landweber algorithm is used for the iteration process. After finding a local extremum, a bound is performed to the 'farthest' estimate in the data space still satisfying the discrepancy principle. Afterwards, the modified Landweber algorithm is again applied to find a new local extremum. This bound-iteration process is repeated until a satisfying solution is reached. For evaluation in nuclear medicine tomography, a novel penalty function that preserves the edge steps in the reconstructed solution was evaluated on Monte Carlo simulations and using real SPECT acquisitions as well. Surprisingly, the first bound always provided a significantly better solution in a wide range of statistics.

Ignoring this process may result in severely biased estimates, leading to false inferences, especially when the outcome variable is associated with design variables. We propose in this paper a class of hierarchical models to investigate the dependence between the design process and the study Outcomes of primary interest. We discuss a fully parametric and a semi-parametric formulation of the hypothesized model and propose the EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. Our numerical results show that the semi-parametric approach Outperforms the fully parametric model with respect to some key features of the model. The methodology is used to gain insight into the mechanism that generates breast cancer literacy outcomes in a Study conducted among medically underserved females in Michigan.

In order to bring the theory of the Wiener filter consistent with images that have spatially varying statistics, the proposed method adopts the locally adaptive Wiener filter (AWF) based on the universal Gaussian mixture distribution model (UNI-GMM) previously proposed for denoising. Applying the UNI-GMM-AWF for deconvolution problem, the proposed method employs the stationary Wiener filter (SWF) as a pre-filter. The SWF in the discrete cosine transform domain shrinks the blur point spread function and facilitates the modeling and filtering at the proceeding AWF. The SWF and UNI-GMM are learned using a generic training image set and the proposed method is tuned toward the image set. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Azadi, TE; Almasganj, F				Azadi, Tahereh Emami; Almasganj, Farshad			Using backward elimination with a new model order reduction algorithm to select best double mixture model for document clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Model selection; Document clustering; PLSA; Bayesian information criterion (BIC); EM algorithm		Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a double structure mixture model which has got a wide application in text and web mining. This method is capable of establishing hidden semantic relations among the observed features, using a number of latent variables. In this approach, the selection of the correct number of latent variables is critical. In the most of the previous researches, the number of latent topics was selected based on the number of invoked classes. This paper presents a method, based on backward elimination approach, which is capable of unsupervised order selection in PISA. This method starts with a model having a number of components more than the needed value, and then prunes the mixtures to reach their optimum size. During the elimination process, proper selection of some latent variables which must be deleted is the most essential problem, and its relation to the final performance of the pruned model is straightforward. To treat this problem, we introduce a new combined pruning method which selects the best options for removal, while keeping a low computational cost, at all. We conducted,some experiments on two datasets from Reuters-21578 corpus. The obtained results show that this algorithm leads to an optimized number of latent variables and in turn achieves better clustering performance compared to the conventional model selection methods. It also shows superiority over the case in which a PLSA model with a fixed number of latent variables, equal to the real number of clusters, is exploited. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, H; Schonfeld, D				Hong, Hunsop; Schonfeld, Dan			Attraction-Repulsion Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Image Reconstruction and Sensor Field Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Expectation-maximization (EM); Gaussian mixture model (GMM); Gibbs density function; image reconstruction; sensor field estimation	EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DENSITY-ESTIMATION	In this paper, we propose an attraction-repulsion expectation-maximization (AREM) algorithm for image reconstruction and sensor field estimation. We rely on a new method for density estimation to address the problems of image reconstruction from limited samples and sensor field estimation from randomly scattered sensors. Density estimation methods often suffer from undesirable phenomena such as over-fitting and over-smoothing. Specifically, various density estimation techniques based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) tend to cluster the Gaussian functions together, thus resulting in over-fitting. On the other hand, other approaches repel the Gaussian functions and yield over-smooth density estimates. We propose a method that seeks an equilibrium between over-fitting and over-smoothing in density estimation by incorporating attraction and repulsion forces among the Gaussian functions and determining the optimal balance between the competing forces experimentally.

J	Elezabi, A; Gomaa, A				Elezabi, Ayman; Gomaa, Ahmad			Diversity Combining and SNR Estimation for Turbo-Coded Frequency-Hopped Spread-Spectrum in Partial-Band Interference and Fading Channels	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Partial-band interference; Frequency hopping; Diversity combining; Turbo coding; SNR estimation; Expectation maximization; Maximum likelihood	FH-SS; NOISE	We compare different combinations of the repetition diversity order L and code rate R for turbo-coded Frequency-Hopped Spread-Spectrum (FH/SS) communication systems in the presence of fading and partial-band Gaussian interference. For a fixed overall channel code rate R/L we show that using the lowest code rate and no repetition diversity always performs better than using a higher code rate and some repetition for both coherent and non-coherent schemes. We then propose a simple maximum-likelihood-based method for signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) estimation in Non-Coherent Binary Frequency Shift Keying (NCBFSK) without training symbols. Except for impractically small hop sizes of 8 bits or less we obtain performance virtually equal to that of perfect SNR knowledge but with much less complexity than iterative schemes previously proposed. For the case of Coherent Binary Phase Shift Keying (CBPSK) we derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) estimate of the SNR without training symbols and iteratively feed the estimator with the extrinsic information from the turbo decoder. The performance for CBPSK is near that of perfect SNR knowledge for hop sizes of 64 bits or more. Unlike previously proposed methods for CBPSK the EM estimate of SNR does not require knowledge of the noise and interference variance, received bit energy, or the fading channel model.

The nonignorable missing mechanism is specified by a logistic regression model. An EM algorithm is developed to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the structural parameters and parameters in the logistic regression model. Assessment of local influence is investigated in nonlinear structural equation models with nonignorable missing outcomes from reproductive dispersion models on the basis of the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function. Some local influence diagnostics are obtained via observations of missing data and latent variables that are generated by the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm on the basis of the conformal normal curvature. A simulation study and a real example are used to illustrate the application of the proposed methodologies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We point out two problems with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) that present serious drawbacks in practical applications. One is that the parametric models obtained using a classical MLE framework are not guaranteed to be close to data points. It is typically impossible, in this classical framework, to detect whether a parametric model fits the data well or not. The second problem is related to accurately choosing the optimal number of model components. We first fit a nonparametric density to the data points and use it to define a neighborhood of the data. Observations inside this neighborhood are deemed informative; those outside the neighborhood are deemed uninformative for our purpose. This provides us with a means to recognize when models fail to properly fit the data. We then obtain maximum likelihood estimates by optimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the nonparametric data density restricted to this neighborhood and a mixture of parametric models. We prove that, under the assumption of a reasonably large sample size, the inferred model components are close to their ground-truth model component counterparts. This holds independently of the initial number of assumed model components or their associated parameters. Moreover, in the proposed approach, we are able to estimate the number of significant model components without any additional computation.

However, all large genotype data sets have errors due to the use of inexpensive genotyping machines that are fallible and shortcomings in genotyping scoring softwares, which can have an enormous impact on haplotype inference. In this article, we propose two novel strategies to reduce the impact induced by genotyping errors in haplotype inference. The first method makes use of double sampling. For each individual, the "GenoSpectrum" that consists of all possible genotypes and their corresponding likelihoods are computed. The second method is a genotype clustering algorithm based on multi-genotyping data, which also assigns a "GenoSpectrum" for each individual. We then describe two hybrid EM algorithms (called DS-EM and MG-EM) that perform haplotype inference based on "GenoSpectrum" of each individual obtained by double sampling and multi-genotyping data. Both simulated data sets and a quasi real-data set demonstrate that our proposed methods perform well in different situations and outperform the conventional EM algorithm and the HMM algorithm proposed by Sun, Greenwood, and Neal (2007, Genetic Epidemiology 31, 937-948) when the genotype data sets have errors.

Several methods have been developed for the analysis under different situations and especially, Goetghebeur and Ryan([4]) considered the situation where both the failure time and the censoring time follow the proportional hazards models marginally and developed an estimating equation approach. One limitation of their approach is that the two baseline hazard functions were assumed to be proportional to each other. We consider the same problem and present an efficient estimation procedure for regression parameters that does not require the proportionality assumption. An EM algorithm is developed and the method is evaluated by a simulation study, which indicates that the proposed methodology performs well for practical situations. An illustrative example is provided.

Storm Identification and Tracking Algorithm for Modeling of Rainfall Fields Using 1-h NEXRAD Rainfall Data in Texas	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							SPATIAL-TEMPORAL MODEL; SPACE-TIME RAINFALL; POINT PROCESS MODEL; RADAR DATA; THUNDERSTORM RAINFALL; STOCHASTIC-MODEL; DISAGGREGATION; PRECIPITATION; WSR-88D; MOTION	A method to identify and track rainfall structures using 1-h accumulated NEXt generation RADar (NEXRAD) rainfall data is presented and used to analyze the dynamics of storm features over an area in Texas. Storm features are identified from a Gaussian mixture model using the expectation maximization algorithm. The method assigns NEXRAD pixels to storm features, simultaneously producing a smooth fitted function to the rainfall intensity distribution. Once the storm features are identified, they are tracked using inverse cost functions and using the fact that continuous features overlap each other from frame to frame in the accumulated data. The inverse cost functions also account for storm feature merging, splitting, birth, and death. Application of this storm identification and tracking algorithm for Brazos County (1,500 km(2)) in southeastern Texas distinguishes several characteristics of the storm feature dynamics. From September through April, storm features are predominantly of a frontal nature, with storm features following geostrophic flow along low pressure fronts moving in from the north. In summer (May-August), storm features are convective in nature following random track directions. Both types of storm features have durations of 1-3 h in Brazos County due to the county's relatively small size compared to the measured average storm speed of 40 km/h and due to the fact that most storms only intersect the county over part of their area.

The model implies that the densities for the continuous outcomes are related by a parametric tilt but otherwise unspecified. It provides a useful alternative to the Cox (1972) proportional hazards model for the comparison of treatments based on right censored survival data. We propose an iterative algorithm for the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimates of the parametric and nonparametric components of the model. The performance of the proposed method is studied using simulation. We illustrate our method in an application to melanoma.

We produce an algorithm enumerating all minimal covers using the C-minimal elements of the interval order, as well as an independence Metropolis sampler. We characterize maximal removable sets, which are the complements of minimal covers, and produce a distinct algorithm to enumerate them. We use this last characterization to provide bounds on the maximum number of minimal covers for an interval order with a given number of maximal cliques, and present some simulation results on the number of minimal covers in different settings.

J	Howard, BE; Sick, B; Heber, S				Howard, Brian E.; Sick, Beate; Heber, Steffen			Unsupervised assessment of microarray data quality using a Gaussian mixture model	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							AFFYMETRIX-GENECHIP DATA; EXPRESSION ARRAYS; IDENTIFICATION; GENES; CELLS; ARABIDOPSIS; RNA; BIOINFORMATICS; CLASSIFICATION; PROGRESSION	Background: Quality assessment of microarray data is an important and often challenging aspect of gene expression analysis. This task frequently involves the examination of a variety of summary statistics and diagnostic plots. The interpretation of these diagnostics is often subjective, and generally requires careful expert scrutiny. Results: We show how an unsupervised classification technique based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the naive Bayes model can be used to automate microarray quality assessment. The method is flexible and can be easily adapted to accommodate alternate quality statistics and platforms. We evaluate our approach using Affymetrix 3' gene expression and exon arrays and compare the performance of this method to a similar supervised approach. Conclusion: This research illustrates the efficacy of an unsupervised classification approach for the purpose of automated microarray data quality assessment. Since our approach requires only unannotated training data, it is easy to customize and to keep up-to-date as technology evolves. In contrast to other "black box" classification systems, this method also allows for intuitive explanations.

It enables to account for a population stratified at K different levels. I then show how to approximate the partial maximum likelihood estimator using an EM algorithm. In a Monte Carlo study, the behavior of the estimator is assessed and I provide an application to the ratification of ILO conventions. Compared to other procedures, the results indicate an important decrease in computing time, as well as improved convergence and stability.

J	Hsieh, PF				Hsieh, Pi-Fuei			Impact and realization of increased class separability on the small sample size problem in hyperspectral classification	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							2 NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; EM ALGORITHM; MIXTURE	A hyperspectral image is often represented by a high-dimensional dataset for analysis. Under the condition of small sample sizes, the Hughes phenomenon often occurs in high-dimensional classification because of poorly estimated class parameters. Solutions to the Hughes phenomenon have been focused on sample sizes and dimensionality to improve parameter estimation. Considering the Hughes phenomenon as an interaction of two counter-effects between degrading parameter estimation and increasing class separability with dimensionality, this study raises class separability to compensate for the degradation of accuracy in parameter estimation. Instead of merely taking the lowpass (LP) filter as a smoothing technique in image processing, this study presents the LP filter as a means of increasing class separability from the standpoint of pattern recognition. An increase in class separability not only mitigates the Hughes phenomenon but also facilitates parameter estimation in joint supervised-unsupervised learning based on the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm. LP filtering may hurt classification performance if the filtered, high-frequency contents embed discriminant information. This study overcomes the problem by extracting frequency-based features and forming an augmented feature set. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of a spatial filter for the improvement of class separability and parameter estimation in classification.

J	Wu, Q; Sampson, AR				Wu, Qiang; Sampson, Allan R.			Mixture modeling with applications in schizophrenia research	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; REGRESSION	Finite mixture modeling, together with the EM algorithm, have been widely used in clustering analysis. Under such methods, the unknown group membership is usually treated as missing data. When the "complete data" (log-)likelihood function does not have an explicit solution, the simplicity of the EM algorithm breaks down. Authors, including Rai and Matthews [Rai, S.N., Matthews, D.E., 1993. Improving the em algorithm. Biometrics 49, 587-591], Lange [Lange, K., 1995a. A gradient algorithm locally equivalent to the em algorithm. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 57(2) 425-437], and Titterington [Titterington, D.M., 1984. Recursive parameter estimation using incomplete data. journal of the Royal Statistical Society B. 46, 257-267] developed modified algorithms therefore. As motivated by research in a large neurobiological project, we propose in this paper a new variant of such modifications and show that it is self-consistent. Moreover, simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the new variant converges faster than its predecessors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motivated by the fact that correlated discrete variables are frequently encountered in practical applications, a non-linear SEM that accommodates covariates, and mixed continuous, ordered, and unordered categorical variables is proposed. Maximum likelihood methods for estimation and model comparison are discussed. One real-life data set about cardiovascular disease is used to illustrate the methodologies.

Effect of geometric models on convergence rate in iterative PET image reconstructions	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article	4th International Conference on Imaging Technologies in Biomedical Sciences	SEP 22-28, 2007	Milos Isl, GREECE			Image reconstruction in medical imaging; Gamma camera, SPECT, PET PET/CT, coronary CT angiography (CTA)		Iterative PET image reconstructions can improve quantitation accuracy by explicitly modeling photon-limited nature and physical effects of coincident photons. Geometric model in iterative reconstructions defines the mapping between image and sinogram domains based on scanners geometry, which affects the accuracy of image results and the convergence rate of reconstruction algorithms. This paper examines the convergence rates of a reconstruction algorithm with three PET geometric models: interpolative, area-based, and solid-angle. The iterative algorithm used in this study is the maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) algorithm. Experimental data are generated by the GATE package which simulates the Inveon microPET system. The comparison of convergence rate is based on the plot of log-likelihood value versus iteration number. From the plots of log-likelihood curves, the results from solid-angle model consistently reach the highest values at early iterations. It means that the MLEM algorithm with the solid-angle model will converge faster than the other two models. The experimental results indicate that the solid-angle model is a favorable geometric model for faster iterative PET image reconstruction.

As a convenient vehicle, maximum likelihood estimation of the location vector mu and scatter matrix Sigma of an elliptically symmetric t distribution off R(d) with degrees of freedom nu > 1 extends to an M-functional defined off all probability distributions P in a weakly open, weakly dense domain U. Here U consists of P Putting not too much mass in hyperplanes of dimension < d, as shown for empirical measures by Kent and Tyler [Ann. Statist. 19 (1991) 2102-2119]. It will be seen here that (mu, Sigma) is analytic on U for the bounded Lipschitz norm, of for d = 1 for the sup norm on distribution functions. For k = 1, 2,..., and other norms, depending on k and more directly adapted to t functionals, one has continuous differentiability of order k, allowing the delta-method to be applied to (mu, Sigma) for any P in U, which can be arbitrarily heavy-tailed. These results imply asymptotic normality of the corresponding M-estimators (mu(n), Sigma(n)). In dimension d = 1 only, the t(nu) functional (mu, sigma) extends to be defined and weakly continuous at all P.	[Dudley, R.

J	Kabudian, J; Homayounpour, MM; Ahadi, SM				Kabudian, Jahanshah; Homayounpour, Mohammad Mehdi; Ahadi, Seyed Mohammad			Bernoulli versus Markov: Investigation of state transition regime in switching-state acoustic models	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-inhomogeneous hidden Bernoulli model; Hidden Markov model; Speech recognition; Acoustic modeling; Phone recognition; Phone duration modeling; Persian (Farsi) spoken language		In this paper, a new acoustic model called time-inhomogeneous hidden Bernoulli model (TI-HBM) is introduced as an alternative to hidden Markov model (HMM) in continuous speech recognition. Contrary to HMM, the state transition process in TI-HBM is not a Markov process, rather it is an independent (generalized Bernoulli) process. This difference leads to elimination of dynamic programming at state-level in TI-HBM decoding process. Thus, the computational complexity of TI-HBM for probability evaluation and state estimation is O(NL) (instead of O(N(2)L) in the HMM case, where N and L are number of states and sequence length respectively). As a new framework for phone duration modeling, TI-HBM is able to model acoustic-unit duration (e.g. phone duration) by using a built-in parameter named survival probability. Similar to the HMM case, three essential problems in TI-HBM have been solved. An EM-algorithm-based method has been proposed for training TI-HBM parameters. Experiments in phone recognition for Persian (Farsi) spoken language show that the TI-HBM has some advantages over HMM (e.g. more simplicity and increased speed in recognition phase), and also outperforms HMM in terms of phone recognition accuracy.

A good segmentation evaluation method would allow different segmentations not only to be compared, but to be combined to generate a "true" segmentation with higher consensus. Numerous multi-observer segmentation evaluation approaches have been proposed in the literature, and STAPLE in particular probabilistically estimates the true segmentation by optimal combination of observed segmentations and a prior model of the truth. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, STAPLE's convergence to the desired local minima depends on good initializations for the truth prior and the observer-performance prior. However, accurate modeling of the initial truth prior is nontrivial. Moreover, among the two priors, the truth prior always dominates so that in certain scenarios when meaningful observer-performance priors are available, STAPLE can not take advantage of that information. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian decision formulation of the problem that permits the two types of prior knowledge to be integrated in a complementary manner in four cases with differing application purposes: (1) with known truth prior; (2) with observer prior; (3) with neither truth prior nor observer prior; and (4) with both truth prior and observer prior. The third and fourth cases are not discussed (or effectively ignored) by STAPLE, and in our research we propose a new method to combine multiple-observer segmentations based on the maximum a posterior (MAP) principle, which respects the observer prior regardless of the availability of the truth prior. Based on the four scenarios, we have developed a web-based software application that implements the flexible segmentation evaluation framework for digitized uterine cervix images. Experiment results show that our framework has flexibility in effectively integrating different priors for multi-observer segmentation evaluation and it also generates results comparing favorably to those by the STAPLE algorithm and the Majority Vote Rule.

J	Cheng, LY; Tzeng, SJ				Cheng, Lung-Yu; Tzeng, Shinn-Jia			Parametric and semiparametric methods for mapping quantitative trait loci	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							FAILURE TIME MODEL; EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION; LIKELIHOOD; PHENOTYPE; MATRIX	Most statistical methods for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been extensively developed for normally distributed and completely observed phenotypes. A survival model such as Cox's proportional hazards model, or an accelerated failure time model, is the natural choice for regressing a phenotype onto a maker-type when the primary phenotype belongs to failure time. This study proposes parametric and semiparametric methods based on accelerated failure time models for interval mapping. In the parametric model, the EM algorithm (expectation maximization algorithm) is adopted to estimate regression parameters and search the entire chromosome for QTL. In the semiparametric model, the error distribution is left unspecified, and a rank-based inference is developed for the effect and location of QTL. Simulated data are used to compare the mapping performance of the semiparametric methodology with that of the parametric method, which separately selects the correct and incorrect error distribution. Analytical results reveal that the parametric estimators may be more efficient in determining the effect and location of QTL, but have obvious bias when selecting the incorrect error distribution. In contrast, the semiparametric inference is robust to the error distribution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed ML solution is based on the delayed observation signal model for the source signal at individual sensor nodes. The approach provides localization of the broadband source location parameters in time domain, The sensors are often randomly deployed in a field; consequently, each time delay measurement is different from every other, depending on the sensor network configuration. Hence, the time delays in particular should be compensated in the corresponding algorithm when processing the broadband source signal in the time domain. In this paper, the observation delays (time shifts) are considered in the ML solution derived herein and also in the corresponding covariance matrix. The Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) expressions are also derived to explore the performance of the time compensated ML (TCML), The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable for broadband source location estimation.

The results from a full-crossed simulation design suggest that traditional repeated measures have significantly higher power than do hierarchical multivariate linear models for main effects, but they have significantly lower power for interaction effects in most situations. Significant power differences are also exhibited when power is compared across different covariance structures.

In this manuscript two problems are studied and solved using a common solution. The first problem is that the lists refer to different but overlapping populations. An example is that lists refer to different but overlapping regions, different but overlapping periods in time, or different but overlapping age groups. The second problem is that each list has a set of covariates and the sets of covariates are not identical. By considering both problems as missing data problems, a solution is obtained through the EM algorithm. This approach is illustrated by two examples.	[Heijden, Peter G.

The data samples are governed by a given distribution with a priori. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to iteratively maximize the likelihood function so as to realize the SNR estimation. Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) with different a priori are compared for binary phase shift keying and orthogonal phase shift keying systems, which show the potential of the SNR estimator in turbo-like systems. In high-order modulations, simulation results show that the reduced-complexity iterative method with equal a priori has better performance in middle or high SNR region than the foregone. ones. Moreover, the new method with feedback information is the best when its iteration number is 4 and extrinsic information larger than 0.4. These methods are applied in the bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decode (BICM-ID) system to validate the effect of the proposed methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We found that the ratio of cluster and cluster's densities and the number of data both have effect on the method. But the effect of the former much bigger than that of the latter. Furthermore, we introduced the concept of weight to extend the range of the simulated data, and gave the data different weights for delineating clusters, so that the range of this algorithm can be extended.

J	Singh, GB; Song, HP				Singh, Gautam B.; Song, Haiping			Using Hidden Markov Models in Vehicular Crash Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Automotive crash detection; computer-aided engineering (CAE); continuous-value emission hidden Markov models (HMMs); crash pulse; discrete-value emission HMM; finite-element analysis (FEA)	RECOGNITION	This paper presents a system for automotive crash detection based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). The crash pulse library used for training comprises a number of head-on and oblique angular crash events involving rigid and offset deformable barriers. Stochastic distribution characteristics of crash signals are validated to ensure conformity with the modeling assumptions. This step is achieved by analyzing the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of actual pulses against the assumed bivariate Gaussian distribution. HMM parameters are next induced by utilizing the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure. The search for an optimal crash pulse model proceeds using the "leave-one-out" technique with the exploration encompassing both fully connected and left-right HMM topologies. The optimal crash pulse architecture is identified as a seven-state left-right HMM with its parameters computed using real and computer-aided engineering (CAE)-generated data. The system described in the paper has the following advantages. First, it is fast and can accurately detect crashes within 6 ms. Second, its implementation is simple and uses only two sensors, which makes it less vulnerable to failures, considering the overall simplicity of interconnects. Finally, it represents a general and modularized algorithm that can be adapted to any vehicle line and readily extended to use additional sensors.

As shown in [16], such data can be fitted with simplex models. Based on the original models of [16] which assumed a fixed effect for every subject, this paper extends the models by adding random effects and proposes simplex distribution nonlinear mixed models which are one kind of nonlinear reproductive dispersion mixed models. By treating the random effects in the models as hypothetical missing data and applying Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, this paper develops an EM algorithm with Markov chain Monte-Carlo method for maximum likelihood estimation in the models. The method is illustrated with the same data from an ophthalmology study on the use of intraocular gas in retinal surgeries in [16] for ease of comparison.

J	Murakami, J				Murakami, Junko			Bayesian posterior mean estimates for Poisson hidden Markov models	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MIXTURE-MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS	This piper focuses on the Bayesian posterior mean estimates (or Bayes' estimate) of the parameter set of Poisson hidden Markov models in which the observation sequence is generated by a Poisson distribution whose parameter depends on the underlining discrete-time time-homogeneous Markov chain. Although the most commonly used procedures for obtaining parameter estimates for hidden Markov models are versions of the expectation maximization and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, this paper exhibits an algorithm for calculating the exact posterior mean estimates which, although still cumbersome, has polynomial rather than exponential complexity, and is a feasible alternative for use with small scale models and data sets. This paper also shows simulation results, comparing the posterior mean estimates obtained by this algorithm and the maximum likelihood estimates obtained by expectation maximization approach.

Concurrent Segmentation and Estimation of Transmission Images for Attenuation Correction in Positron Emission Tomography	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm; image reconstruction; penalized maximum likelihood (PML) method; positron emission tomography (PET); segmentation	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PET; RECONSTRUCTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; THRESHOLD	When transmission images are obtained using conventional reconstruction methods in stand alone PET scanners, such as standard clinical PET, microPET, and dedicated brain scanners, the results may be noisy and/or inaccurate. For example, the popular penalized maximum-likelihood method effectively reduces noise, but it does not address the bias problem that results from the incorporation of a penalty function and contamination from emission data due to patient activity. In this paper, we present an algorithm that simultaneously reconstructs transmission images and performs a "soft' segmentation of voxels into the classes: air, patient bed, lung, soft-tissue, and bone. It is through the segmentation step that the algorithm, which we refer to as the concurrent segmentation and estimation (CSE) algorithm, provides a means for incorporating accurate attenuation coefficients. The CSE algorithm is obtained by applying an expectation-maximization like formulation to a certain maximum a posterior objective function. This formulation enables us to show that the CSE algorithm monotonically increases the objective function. In experiments using real phantom and synthetic data, the CSE images produced attenuation correction factors and emission images that were more accurate than those obtained using a popular segmentation based attenuation correction method, and the penalized maximum likelihood and filtered backprojection methods.

Doubly Iterative Receiver for Block Transmissions with EM-Based Channel Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Channel estimation; doubly iterative receiver; expectation maximization (EM) algorithm; SCCP; CP-CDMA; MC-CDMA	SYSTEMS	Cyclic-prefix code division. multiple access (CP-CDMA), multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) and single carrier cyclic-prefix (SCCP) transmission are some schemes that could support the increasing demand of future high data rate applications. The linear and nonlinear equalizers used to detect the transmitted signal are always far from the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detection bound. The block iterative generalized decision feedback equalizer (BI-GDFE) is an iterative and effective interference cancelation scheme which could provide near-ML performance yet with very low complexity. In order to deploy this scheme, the channel state information (CSI) must be available at the receiver. In practice, this information has to be estimated by using pilot and data symbols. This paper investigates the problem of channel estimation using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The BI-GDFE provides the soft information of the transmitted signals to the EM-based algorithm in the form a combination of hard decision and a coefficient so-called the input-decision correlation (IDC). The resultant receiver becomes a doubly iterative scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm, the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is also derived. Computer simulations show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed receiver for joint channel estimation and signal detection can reach the performance of the BI-GDFE with perfect CSI.

AN EM ALGORITHM FOR PATH DELAY AND COMPLEX GAIN ESTIMATION OF SLOWLY VARYING FADING CHANNEL FOR CPM SIGNALS	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 09)	NOV 30-DEC 04, 2009	Honolulu, HI	IEEE		CPM signal; EM algorithm; hybrid Cramer Rao bound; path delay estimation; maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation; Kalman smoother filter; Kalman filter; fading channels	CONTINUOUS PHASE MODULATION; TIME-DELAY; RECEIVERS; MSK	This paper addresses the joint path delay and time-varying complex gain estimation for continuous phase modulation (CPM) over a time-selective slowly varying flat Rayleigh fading channel. We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for path delay estimation in a Kalman smoother framework. The time-varying complex gain is modeled by a first order autoregressive (AR) process. Such a modeling yields to the representation of the problem by a dynamic bayesian system in a state-space form that allows the application of EM algorithm in the context of unobserved data for obtaining an estimate of the path delay. This is used with Kalman smoother for state estimation. We derive analytically a closed-form expression of the modified hybrid Cramer-Rao bound (MHCRB) for path delay and complex gain parameters. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional generalized correlation method and to the MHCRB.

The framework uses skin color information to reduce the search space for faces by localizing the probable skin regions using a mixture of multivariate Gaussians whose parameters are first estimated using the Estimation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, feature based classification differentiates face related pixels from other skin regions and objects with close intensity values. A novel approach for classifying faces using a structure of cooperating neural networks, for which learning parameters are generated using Adaboost learning method is proposed. In addition, a new approach is also proposed for training the neural network with reduced space Haar-like features instead of working with image pixels themselves. Principle component analysis was used to find the aspects of features that are crucial for detection. The features dimensionality was reduced by nearly 90 percent, hence improving radically the training time. When adequate parameters are chosen, the system yields face detection characteristics that outperform the best existing algorithms (such as the one proposed by Viola and Jones) in terms of accuracy. Finally, the parameters of the mixture of Gaussians model are updated based on the results of the classification testing results to increase its robustness against illuminations and other external environmental changes, as well as reducing even more the search space.

However, the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) approaches, do not automatically accommodate replicated measurements. Often, an ad hoc step of preprocessing e.g. averaging, either weighted, un-weighted or something in between is needed, which might wipe out important patterns of low magnitude and/or cancel out patterns of similar magnitude. We treat each replicate individually as a random variable and design a finite mixture model to estimate an optimal correlation structure from replicated molecular profiling data. Assuming that the measurements are independently, identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions, one with a constrained set of parameters and the other with an unconstrained parameter structure, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate component parameters. We carry out a comparative study, including both simulations and real-world data analysis, to assess the estimation of correlation structure using the proposed model and the constrained model given by the first component of the mixture. The two models were further tested for their performances in clustering real-world data. The mixture model approach is shown to have an overall better performance.

INTERFERENCE MITIGATION WITH PARTIALLY COHERENT DEMODULATION IN A SLOW FREQUENCY-HOPPING SPREAD-SPECTRUM SYSTEM	MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-4	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2009)	OCT 18-21, 2009	Boston, MA	IEEE			MULTIUSER DETECTION; FSK SYSTEM; SCHEME; FHMA	Iterative signal processing has gained in popularity over the last decade as a way of reducing the effects of interference in a communication system. In previous work, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the parameters and data of colliding transmissions in a slow frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) system using binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK). As in many FHSS systems, noncoherent demodulation was used. In this paper, we propose a refinement to the EM algorithm to allow the phase estimator in each iteration to be characterized as a Tikhonov random variable. We then use partially coherent detection for the desired user's signal. The parameters of the Tikhonov distribution are refined at each iteration, which results in the demodulator transitioning from fully noncoherent operation in the first iteration to nearly coherent detection in later iterations for many dwell intervals. We show that this approach significantly improves the multiple-access capability of the system.

For this purpose, a unified free energy functional is designed and an expectation-maximization procedure is developed to minimize it. Regional dimensionality estimation controls the extent of the linear manifolds. This property makes the model appropriate for representing the datasets with varying regional intrinsic dimensions, compared to the resembling techniques without dimensionality learning capability. Experimental results show the good performance of the model on synthesized and real-world applications.

LABELLING COLOR IMAGES BY MODELLING THE COLORS DENSITY USING A LINEAR COMBINATION OF GAUSSIANS AND EM ALGORITHM	2009 16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-6			English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	NOV 07-10, 2009	Cairo, EGYPT	IEEE		Image labelling; Density estimation; EM	SEGMENTATION	Parametric density estimation is widely used to solve many image processing problems. We examined the parametric estimation using linear combination of 1D Gaussians in many works [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this work, we extend our model to estimate density of the colors in color images. We approximate the marginal density of each class in the empirical probability density function by a 3D Gaussian distribution. Then, the deviation between the estimated and the empirical densities is modelled using a linear combination of 3D Gaussians with positive and negative components. We estimate the parameters of this model using our modified EM algorithm. The proposed framework demonstrates very promising experimental results of color images labelling and can be integrated with many other frameworks.

The approach uses a competition between a tracked objet and background distributions using active contours. Only the segmentation of the object in the first frame is required for initialization. We evolve the object contour by assigning pixels in a fashion that maximizes the likelihood of the object versus the background. This maximization is implemented using an EM-like algorithm, which evolves the object contour exactly to its boundaries, and adapts the parameters of the object and background distributions.

Consequently, the large number of messages manually produced or automatically generated can rapidly cause information overflow for users. Many research projects have examined this issue but surprisingly few have tackled the problem of the files attached to e-mails that, in many cases, contain a substantial part of the semantics of the message. This paper considers this specific topic and focuses on the problem of clustering and visualization of attached files. Relying on the multinomial mixture model, we used the Classification EM algorithm (CEM) to cluster the set of files, and MDSDCA to visualize the obtained classes of documents. Like the Multidimensional Scaling method, the aim of the MDSDCA algorithm based on the Difference of Convex functions is to optimize the stress criterion. As MDSDCA is iterative, we propose an initialization approach to avoid starting with random values. Experiments are investigated using simulations and textual data.

However, for proper recovery of input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. Most algorithms proposed in literature perform channel estimation in time domain which increases computational complexity in multi-access situations where the user is only interested in part of the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a frequency domain algorithm for channel estimation in OFDMA systems. The algorithm performs eigenvalue decomposition of channel autocorrelation matrix and approximates channel frequency response seen by each user using the first few dominant eigenvectors. In a time variant environment, we derive a state space model for the evolution of the eigenmodes that help us to track them. This is done using a forward backward Kalman filter. The performance of the algorithm is further improved by employing a data-aided approach (based on expectation maximization).

However, due to the geometrical complexity of the problem, image reconstruction from Compton camera data is difficult and/or ineffective when using techniques such as filtered backprojection (FBP) or maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic origin ensembles (SOE) approach based on Marko), chains (previously implemented and tested for PET) to the reconstruction of Compton camera data. The advantages of this method are that it is universal (i.e. works with any camera geometry), does not require any rebinning of acquired data, parallelizable, and does not require forward- and backprojection operations nor voxelization of the image space. During image reconstruction the origins of every measured events are the randomly assigned locations on the conical surface (which is the Compton camera analog of lines-of-response in PET). Therefore, the image is defined as an event ensemble holding the coordinates of all possible event origins. During the course of the reconstruction, origins of the events are randomly moved and the acceptance of the new event origin is determined by the acceptance probability, which is proportional to the change in event density. For example, if event density at the new location is higher than in the previous location, the new position is always accepted. As a result of many iterations, the reconstructed image converges to the quasi-stationary state which can be voxelized and displayed. Comparison to the list-mode MLEM shows that SOE algorithm has similar performance in terms of image quality while clearly outperforming it in terms of reconstruction time. Implementation of corrections for detector energy resolution can be done at almost no additional computational cost, which is a major advantage of SOE over other reconstruction methods.

Many algorithms in literature require active measurements and are based on a single-sender multiple-receivers scheme, thus relying on the cooperation of a possibly wide number of nodes, which is a quite strong assumption. Moreover, many previous works adopt Expectation-Maximization algorithms to cope with large and under-determined equation systems, thus increasing the uncertainty of the final delay estimation. This paper, instead, proposes a technique to infer the cumulants of the delay distribution over each link of a given network path, based on two points measurements only. The cumulants, in turn, can be used to approximate the distribution function through the Edgeworth series. The results of our approach are assessed through a wide series of model-based and ns2 based simulations and show fairly good performance under different network load conditions.

Motion capture and classification for real-time interaction with a bipedal robot using on-body, fully wireless, motion capture Specknets	RO-MAN 2009: THE 18TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ROBOT AND HUMAN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	SEP 27-OCT 02, 2009	Toyama, JAPAN	IEEE				This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of real-time human-robot interaction using motion capture (mocap) data obtained from fully wireless, on-body sensor networks. During the learning phase, data for motion such as waving of the hands, standing on a leg, performing sit-ups and squats is captured from a human strapped with the Orient motion capture specks. Key features are extracted from the captured motion data using unsupervised learning algorithms. During subsequent interactions with the robot, the motion of the operator, speckled with Orients, is classified and the robot selects to play the closest motion. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the robot operates a well defined vocabulary of motion, and the advantages are the real-time interaction and the rapidity (in a matter of minutes) in programming new behaviour compared to a heuristics-based approach. This paper compares the performances of three unsupervised learning algorithms: c-means, k-means and Expectation Maximisation (EM) for the four motion scenarios. Nine best candidates for the three learning algorithms for each of the four motion scenarios were selected in the Webots robot simulator and then transferred to the real robot. Metrics were defined for each motion scenario and their performances compared for the three learning algorithms. In all the cases the motions were able to be imitated; c-means was the best, followed closely by the k-means algorithms, and the reasons have been analysed.	[Arvind, D. K.; Bartosik, M.

The SPARLS algorithm is based on an Expectation-Maximization type algorithm adapted for online estimation. Simulation results for the estimation of multi-path wireless channels show that the SPARLS algorithm has significant improvement over the conventional widely-used Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, in terms of both mean squared error (MSE) and computational complexity.

The need for converting Braille documents into a computer-readable format has motivated research into the implementation of Braille recognition systems. The most fundamental steps in such recognition are estimating the scaling, spacing, and skewness properties of a given Braille document. In this paper we propose a statistical method for estimating these parameters, where we model an entire Braille image using a parameterized probability density function and find the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is robust against noise and other image artifacts, and has a modest computational complexity for straightforward execution on ordinary personal computers.

Its input consists in a small family of recorded signals, each sampling the same composite photon or positron emission scene over a non-Gaussian, noisy channel. The reconstruction is performed by combining a novel numerical implementation of an analytical inversion formula [1] and a novel signal processing technique, inspired by the work of Tao and Candes [2] on code reconstruction. Our approach is proven to be optimal under a variety of realistic assumptions. We also indicate several medical imaging applications for which the new technology achieves high fidelity, even when dealing with real data subject to substantial non-Gaussian distortions.

A special class of hybrid system model is introduced to describe such multi-unit systems, and a general approach for estimation and change detection is proposed. A novel fault detection algorithm is developed based on estimating a common Gaussian-mixture distribution for unit parameters whereby observations arc mapped into a common parameter-space and clusters are then identified corresponding to different modes of operation via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The estimated common distribution incorporates and generalizes information from all units and is utilized for fault detection in each individual unit. The proposed algorithm takes into account unit mode switching, parameter drift, and can handle sudden, incipient, and preexisting faults. It can be applied to fault detection in various industrial, chemical, or manufacturing processes, sensor networks, and others. Two illustrative examples are presented, and a discussion on the pros and cons of the proposed methodology is provided.

As initial channel estimation pilot symbols are used and sequential channel estimation is performed with few pilot symbols in order to use bandwidth efficiently. It is compared to the time domain EM based channel estimation algorithm which needs matrix inversion and seen that the proposed algoritm decreased the complexin, without any performance loss. The performance comparison of these algorithms are studied in terms of bit-error rate (BER), mininum-squared error (MSE) and the number of iterations used in the EM algorithm.

In analytical modeling Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs) are commonly used to describe correlated arrivals, whereas for simulation often ARMA/ARTA-based models are in use. Determining the parameters for the latter input models is well-known whereas good fitting methods for MAPs have been developed only in recent years. Since MAPs may as well be used in simulation models, it is natural to compare them with ARMA/ARTA models according to their expressiveness and modeling capabilities for dependent sequences. In this paper we experimentally compare MAPs and ARMA/ARTA-based models.

To reduce the amount of time needed to complete a reconstruction, a cluster was used as well as different multi-core systems. A main focus was on the multi-core processors, as these systems are increasingly common and easy to use in medical environments. The Open Source implementation 'Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction' (STIR) was used as underlying reconstruction software, as it provides a wide range of usable scanner geometries and different algorithms. In particular STIR also offers an enhanced implementation of the OSEM algorithm. To allow for the use of arbitrary parallel systems, the standard message passing interface (MPI) was used to implement the parallel OSEM algorithm. Additionally, a special work package allocation algorithm was designed, that incorporates load balancing and improves the utilization of cached data. The resulting runtimes on up to 20 nodes and up to 8 cores were compared to the sequential runtime to determine the speedup and the parallel efficiency. The results using a limited set of test data achieved speedups of up to 8x, depending on the amount of data, the algorithm and the underlying architecture. We expect the algorithms to perform better for larger and more realistic data sets since the parallel overhead for distributing raw data and collecting the sub-results decreases in opposition to the actual computing time. The different parallel architectures were compared to determine the optimal system for PET Reconstruction. The cluster system achieved the best speedups using the available test data.

[1]). it features a short radioactive half-life (2 min.) and therefore adds a smaller radiation exposure to the patient in comparison to other tracers. The disadvantages arising from the short radioactive half-life are noisy, low-resolution reconstructions. Previous algorithms first reconstruct images from each dynamic H(2)(15)O dataset independently, e.g. via the standard EM-algorithm (cf. [2]) or FBP. Hence, temporal correlation is neglected. The myocardial blood flow (MBF) and other important parameters, like tissue fraction, arterial and venous spillover effects are computed subsequently from these reconstructed images. Our new method interprets the direct computation of parameters as a nonlinear inverse problem. This implies the need for inversion of a nonlinear operator G(p) (with p denoting the parameters to compute), but allows to skip the process of generating noisy images. The process is schematically described in Figure 1. Therefore, our method takes into account the temporal correlation between the datasets, and not the correlation between noisy, low resolution images. The problem is transferred to a nonlinear parameter identification problem. Furthermore, regularization can be added to each parameter independently, assuring meaningful results.

After individual Kalman filtering of GPS and MW measurements the estimates of the orientation of the vehicle are combined in an optimal manner to improve the robustness towards drift errors. The tracking algorithm incorporates the estimation of time-variant covariance parameters by using an iterative block Expectation-Maximization algorithm to account for time-variant driving conditions and measurement quality. The proposed system is compared to an interacting multiple model approach (IMM) and achieves improved localization accuracy at lower computational complexity. Furthermore we show how the joint parameter estimation and localizaiton can be conducted with streaming input data to be able to track vehicles in a real driving environment.

We further demonstrate how the observation and state noise covariances of the employed Kalman filters can he estimated alongside the filtering by an application of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.

The algorithm can be used for a variety of well-known data mining tasks in distributed environments such as clustering, anomaly detection, target tracking, and density estimation to name a few, necessary for many emerging P2P applications in bioinformatics, webmining and sensor networks. Centralizing all or some of the data to build global models is impractical in such P2P environments because of the large number of data sources, the asynchronous nature of the P2P networks, and dynamic nature of the data/network. The proposed algorithm takes a two-step approach. In the monitoring phase, the algorithm checks if the model 'quality' is acceptable by using an efficient local algorithm. This is then used as a feedback loop to sample data from the network and rebuild the GMM when it is outdated. We present thorough experimental results to verify our theoretical claims.

It produces both a unique stopping iteration and a set of feasible iterates. The method is based on a stochastic multi-scale analysis which involves partial sums of normalized differences between the projected images and the detector data for each row of the sinogram. Previous methods involved only the single total sum of these differences for all detectors and were unable to produce feasible stopping iterations in the case of modeling errors in the system point spread function. The proposed method (SMAP) is compared with the previous statistical stopping criteria (LV) proposed by Veklerov and Llacer using ensembles of simulated data obtained from a Hoffman brain phantom and a thorax phantom. In these tests, the proposed method produced stopping iterations which were robust relative to modeling errors in the system matrix and improved the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast recovery coefficient of hot regions over the previous LV method.

The approach relies on the existence of only a small training database of annotated examples. First, a fully-supervised algorithm using annotated samples is presented. Next, we introduce a semi-supervised procedure which allows us to incorporate unannotated samples and to infer the existence of unknown structures, that is, the existence of new image classes which are not represented in the training database. Finally, we present experimental results from a database of satellite images and briefly mention the possibility of reusing the presented approach as a basis for more complex systems such as Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems.

BMCR is able to deal with frames of extremely low statistics in the case of smooth motion. This is achieved by combining image reconstruction and motion compensation into one mathematical framework which consists of a cost functional and an optimization method. The cost functional basically consists of a difference term which ensures consistency of the estimated parameters to the model and some regularization terms which render the problem mathematically well-posed. The optimization method aims at finding a pair of image and transformation/motion such that the cost functional is minimal. Up to now, for motion only translations are considered. Initial results are promising and show that the quality of images reconstructed by the BMCR algorithm for motion-contaminated data is (a) significantly superior to that of the Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm for motion-contaminated data and (b) even comparable to an ML-EM reconstruction for motion-free data.

We derive the per-antenna ML SNR estimator using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm under constant channels and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The new method is valid for any arbitrary constellation. It is NDA and, therefore, does not impinge on the hole throughput of the system. We obtain two non linear vector equations which are tackled by a less complex approach based on the EM algorithm. The noise components are assumed to be spatially uncorrelated over all the antenna elements and temporally white with equal power. Besides, in order to evaluate our EM-ML SNR estimator, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the DA case. Monte Carlo simulations show, that our new estimator offers, a substantial performance improvement over the SISO ML SNR estimator due to the optimal usage of the mutual information between the antenna branches, and that it reaches the derived DA CRLBs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive the ML per-antenna SNR estimators as well as the CRLBs in the NDA and the DA case, respectively, both over SIMO channels.

ACCELERATION OF THE EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR A TWOFOLD GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL BY USING THE HISTOGRAM OF THE OBSERVATIONS INSTEAD OF THE OBSERVATIONS Evaluation of its Accuracy by Generated Histograms	VISAPP 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications	FEB 05-08, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technologies Informat, Control & Commun, ACM SIGGRAPH		Computer-assisted image analysis; Computer-assisted image interpretation; Statistical data interpretation	SEGMENTATION	Volume representations of blood vessels acquired by 3D rotational angiography are very suitable for diagnosing a stenosis or an aneurysm. For optimal treatment, physicians need to know the shape of the diseased vessel parts. Binary segmentation by thresholding is the first step in our shape extraction procedure. Assuming a twofold Gaussian mixture model, the model parameters (and thus the threshold for binary segmentation) can be extracted from the observations (i.e. the gray values) by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Since the EM algorithm requires a number of iterations through the observations, and because of the large number of observations, the EM algorithm is very time-consuming. Therefore, we developed a method to apply the EM algorithm to the histogram of the observations, requiring a single pass through the observations and a number of iterations through the much smaller histogram. This variant gives almost the same results as the original EM algorithm, at least for our clinical volumes. We have used this variant for an evaluation of the accuracy of the EM algorithm: the maximum relative error in the mixing coefficients was less than 7%, the maximum relative error in the parameters of the two Gaussian components was less than 2.5%.

In the proposed time-sharing hopped communication method, managing mechanism determines each user channel quality knowledge by controlling the quality of the channels between users and it. In order to present a higher quality transmission for the users with low quality channels, managing mechanism gives an opportunity to them to send their message over the users with high quality channels in time sharing mode. Thus, transmission quality for the users with low quality channel is improved The performance of the proposed receiver, with/without hopping and with cooperative communication technique, is analysed for multipath flat fading channels by computer simulation, and results are presented.

Based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling mechanization, the new algorithm maintains a discrete approximation of the filtering density of the clusters' state. The filter's tracking efficiency is enhanced by incorporating two stages into the basic Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme: 1) Interaction. Improved moves are generated by exchanging genetic material between samples from different realizations of the same chain, and 2) Optimization. Optimized proposals in terms of likelihood are obtained using a Bayesian extension of the EM algorithm. In addition, a method is devised based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for eliminating fictitious clusters that may appear when tracking in a highly cluttered environment. The algorithm's performance is assessed and demonstrated in a tracking scenario consisting of several hundreds targets which form up to six distinct clusters in a highly cluttered environment.

Objective performance assessment is investigated for a clinically relevant task: the detection of tumor necrosis at a known location and in a random lumpy background. The iterative maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) algorithm is used to perform image reconstruction. We carried out human observer studies on the reconstructed images and compared the probability of correct detection when the data are generated with the adaptive system as opposed to the non-adaptive system. Task performance is also assessed by using a channelized Hotelling observer, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is the figure of merit for the detection task. Our results show a large performance improvement of adaptive systems versus non-adaptive systems and motivate further research in adaptive medical imaging.

Omitting the prior leads to standard NMF algorithms as special cases, where maximum likelihood parameter estimation is carried out via the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Starting from this view, we develop Bayesian extensions that facilitate more powerful modelling and allow more sophisticated inference, such as Bayesian model selection. Our construction retains conjugacy and enables us to develop models that fit better to real data while retaining attractive features of standard NMF such as fast convergence and easy implementation. We illustrate our approach on model order selection and image reconstruction.

This approach consists of a specific regression model incorporating a discrete hidden logistic process. The model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method performed by a dedicated Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The parameters of the hidden logistic process, in the inner loop of the EM algorithm, are estimated using a multi-class Iterative Reweighted Least-Squares (IRLS) algorithm. A piecewise regression algorithm and its iterative variant have also been considered for comparisons. An experimental study using simulated and real data reveals good performances of the proposed approach.

The noise can be suppressed by post-filtering the ML estimate or imposing a priori knowledge as a constraint within a Bayesian reconstruction framework. Most of these filters and priors are based on weighting the intensity differences between neighbouring pixels within a small local neighbourhood. Therefore, they have limited information to distinguish edges from noise. We investigated the use of a non-local means (NLM) filter for post-filtering MLEM reconstructed positron emission tomography (PET) images. We further investigated the effect of incorporating anatomical side information obtained from co-registered computed tomography (CT) images into the NLM, resulting in an adaptive non-local means (A-NLM) filter which takes into account the variance within each anatomical region on the PET image. In simulated and physical phantom experiments, the A-NLM filter demonstrated superior performance tradeoff between lesion contrast and noise than conventional Gaussian post-filtering and NLM without anatomical prior. We conclude that the A-NLM filter has potential for improved lesion detection over Gaussian post-filtered MLEM images.

The approach is based on a specular multi-path model for UWB radar scatters from walking humans. Empirical studies show that multipath time-of-arrival (TOA) can be modeled as a point process whose behavior is governed by a Gamma distribution. Based on this insight, we develop a tracking procedure that combines a Kalman Filter with a point process observation model whose measurements are processed with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure. As a byproduct, the EM procedure solves the multi-target data segmentation and data association problems. We present experimental results in which a monostatic UWB radar tracks both individual and up to two human targets.

EM-Based Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection for MIMO Optical Wireless Systems	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-8	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2009)	JUN 14-18, 2009	Dresden, GERMANY	IEEE			ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE CHANNELS; MULTIPLE-SYMBOL DETECTION; COMMUNICATION; TRANSMISSION; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; ALGORITHM; NOISE; LINKS; PPM	A major performance-limiting factor in terrestrial optical wireless (OW) systems is turbulence-induced fading. Exploiting the additional degrees of freedom in the spatial dimension, multiple laser transmitters combined with multiple receiver apertures provide an effective solution for fading mitigation. Although MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) OW systems have been extensively studied in recent years, most of these works are mainly limited to symbol-by-symbol decoding. Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detection (MLSD) exploits the temporal correlation of turbulence-induced fading and promises further performance gains. In this paper, we investigate MLSD for IM/DD (intensity-modulation/direct-detection) MIMO OW systems over log-normal atmospheric turbulence channels. Even with a low-order modulation scheme such as On-Off keying which is typically used in OW systems, the complexity of MLSD might be prohibitive. We therefore present an iterative sequence detector based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is much smaller than a direct evaluation of the log-likelihood function. The Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the EM-based algorithm outperforms the symbol-by-symbol decoder and achieves a performance which lies within 0.5 dB of that of the optimal MLSD.

Heart segmentation is a difficult task for its similarity in gray level with neighboring organs coursed by tissue conglutination and the complexity of anatomical configuration. Some earlier methods focused on the segmentation of parts of heart, e.g. ventricles, which is much easier even though they are time consuming and do not converge in some cases. In this paper, we present a fast and robust hybrid method for the segmentation of the whole heart, including ventricles and myocardium from CT and MRl images. This method consists of two major steps: The first step focuses on the segmentation of different configurations of heart based on classification method; the second step focuses on getting the boundary of the whole heart and separates it from neighboring organs. At the end of this paper, some experiments have been made to verify the efficiency and the validity of our method.

Compared with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method can adaptively determine the number of components in the mixture model without usual sub- or over-segmentation problem Moreover, to overcome the local optimization problem, a component split strategy is employed in inference process.

In particular, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed here. At each iteration of the EM, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is incorporated into the E-step to obtain the fusion results, while the registration parameters are updated in the M-step. Association of sensor measurements to the targets are also computed as the missing data in the E-step. The main advantage of the proposed method compared to the conventional approaches is that the mutual effects of registration, association and fusion are taken into the consideration when formulating the multi-sensor, multi-target tracking problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method in terms of mean square error (MSE) is close to the posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB), and is better than one of the conventional approaches that perform registration, association and fusion separately.

Infrared camera sense radiation emitted by an object at a non-zero absolute temperature in the infrared spectrum which is not available in, visual image, but lose information, such as texture, color and geometric, which is available in visual cameras. Fusion of IR. and visual images can enhance features in both kinds of images. And more impressively, it can, reveal some new features that might not be present either in IR images or in visual images. In this paper, a statistical signal processing approach based on expectation maximization (EM) is proposed for IR and visual image fusion. The sensor images are described as the true scene corrupted by additive Gaussian distortion. At each iteration of the EM, the fusion result is obtained by using covariance intersection (CI) in the E-step, while the model parameters are updated in the All-step. The simulation results using the real IR and visual images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

So it is a hot research subject how to improve the vision ability for bad weather in traffic, and there are many achievements have been made. Among these the single scale Retinex algorithm is a common used method, which was proposed by Land. According this theory, any obtained image can be divided into two images: illumination image and object reflected image. If the illumination can be estimated accurately, the high quality enhanced image (reflected image) will be obtained easily. In this paper, one efficient method (EFTI-EM) for illumination was proposed, which is used to estimate the illumination by using sky area in a foggy traffic image and to get sky area is based on EM algorithm. By setting a considerable number of tests, satisfactory results have been achieved.

On one hand, dimensionality reduction can reduce the variability of estimation and thus provide reliable predictive power. On the other hand, the selected sub-model can discover and emphasize the underlying dependencies, which is useful for objective interpretation. Many variable selection methods have been proposed in literatures. For a prominent example, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) in linear regression context has been extensively explored. This paper discusses a class of scaled mixture of Gaussian models from both a penalized likelihood and a Bayesian regression point of view. We propose an Majorize-Minimize (MM) algorithm to find the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator, where the EM algorithm can be stuck at local optimum for some members in this class. Simulation studies show the outperformance of proposed algorithm in nonstochastic design variable selection scenario. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real large-scale E. coli data set with known bona fide interactions for constructing sparse gene regulatory networks. We show that our regression networks with a properly chosen prior can perform comparably to state-of-the-art regulatory network construction algorithms.

A major effort in the gene-mapping is "quantitative trait loci (QTL)". Most of the existing statistical methods for mapping QTL assume that the phenotype follows a normal distribution and is fully observed. These assumptions are likely to be false when the phenotype pertains to the survival time or failure time. In this article, we propose an interval-mapping approach for a censored model with incomplete information (the failure of phenotype cannot be displayed with certain probability). The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through extensive simulation studies.

FATIGUE RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF TSING MA BRIDGE	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL POSTGRADUATE CONFERENCE ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Postgraduate Conference on Infrastructure and Environment	JUN 05-06, 2009	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Polytech Univ		Fatigue; reliability analysis; structural health monitoring; railway loading; highway loading; wind loading		This study is to present a framework for assessing structural reliability in association with fatigue damage at critical locations of the Tsing Ma Bridge by making use of in-situ wind and structural health monitoring systems. The bridge has been continuously monitored for the past ten years by a system known as Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS), which measures the loadings and structural responses of the bridge. Railway, highway and wind loadings are considered to be major contributors to the fatigue damage of the bridge. Random parameters in probabilistic loading models are represented by mixture distribution functions and established by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm on the basis of the monitoring data acquired by WASHMS. Daily stochastic stress processes in response to railway, highway and wind loadings at critical locations are developed by virtue of the probabilistic loading models and the finite element stress analysis. With a Monte-Carlo simulation, a location-dependent probabilistic distribution function of daily stress ranges is then derived on the basis of a large number of virtual daily stochastic stress processes. Meanwhile, structural fatigue resistance is also considered as a random variable in the Miner's rule taking account uncertainties in fatigue life assessment. Finally, a limit state function of fatigue reliability is elaborated and a fatigue reliability index is estimated, depending on combined wind, and railway and highway loadings. It is found that the fatigue reliability index decreases nonlinearly with time, and it will be less than 3.7 after 95 years for some critical elements.	[Chen, Z. W.; Xu, Y.

State-Space Multivariate Autoregressive Models for Estimation of Cortical Connectivity from EEG	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			GRANGER CAUSALITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS	We propose using a state-space model to estimate cortical connectivity from scalp-based EEG recordings. A state equation describes the dynamics of the cortical signals and an observation equation describes the manner in which the cortical signals contribute to the scalp measurements. The state equation is based on a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) process model for the cortical signals. The observation equation describes the physics relating the cortical signals to the scalp EEG measurements and spatially correlated observation noise. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the MVAR model parameters. The strength of influence between cortical regions is then derived from the MVAR model parameters. Simulation results show that this integrated approach performs significantly better than the two-step approach in which the cortical signals are first estimated from the EEG measurements by attempting to solve the EEG inverse problem and second, an MVAR model is fit to the estimated signals. The method is also applied to data from a subject watching a movie, and confirms that feedforward connections between visual and parietal cortex are generally stronger than feedback connections.

In this paper, we propose a joint channel estimation and ISI/ICI cancellation scheme in which a limited CP is used in a trade-off against high-rate performance in MIMO-OFDM systems. A channel estimation scheme based on the criterion of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be proposed through the use of a training symbol. The EM algorithm uses an iterative procedure to estimate channel parameters and can estimate channel impulse response (OR) accurately enough to mitigate ISI/ICI influences. Through the accurate CIR estimation, an efficient method has been developed to counteract ISI/ICI influences in signal detection in the case where the inserted CP length is less than the CIR length. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the overall MIMO-OFDM system performance after only a few iterations.

Even though several works have been proposed in the field of moving object detection, many of them do not consider the problem of segmenting real objects from their shadows. The shadow is considered part of the object, thus leading to possibly large errors in the subsequent steps of object localisation and tracking. In this paper we propose a shadow detection algorithm able to remove shadows from the blobs of moving objects, using division images and Expectation-Maximization histogram analysis. Experimental results prove that the use of the proposed method can significantly increase the performance of a video analysis system.

Unreachable fragments are continuously recovered, requiring multiple fragments of data (constituting a "block") to be downloaded in parallel. Recent modeling efforts have assumed the recovery process to follow an exponential distribution, an assumption made mainly in the absence of studies characterizing the "real" distribution of the recovery process. This work aims at filling this gap through a simulation study. To that end, we implement the distributed storage protocol in the NS-2 network simulator and run a total of seven experiments covering a large variety of scenarios. We show that the fragment download time follows approximately an exponential distribution. We also show that the block download time and the recovery time essentially follow a hypo-exponential distribution with many distinct phases (maximum of as many exponentials). We use expectation maximization and least square estimation algorithms to fit the empirical distributions. We also provide a good approximation of the number of phases of the hypo-exponential distribution that applies in all scenarios considered. Last, we test the goodness of our fits using statistical (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and graphical methods.

When such an important data mining task is extended to the context of data streams; it becomes more challenging since the data arrive at a mining system in one-pass manner. The problem is even more difficult when the clustering task is considered in a sliding window model which requiring the elimination of outdated data must be dealt with properly. We propose SWEM algorithm that exploits the Expectation Maximization technique to address these challenges. SWEM is not only able to process the stream in an incremental manner, but also capable to adapt to changes happened in the underlying stream distribution.

This new estimator is applicable to any linearly-modulated signal. It is a non-data-aided (NDA) method since no a priori knowledge is assumed about the transmitted data. The channel gains and phase distortions on the different subcarriers are assumed to be constant during the observation window, and the signal is assumed to be corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The performances of our estimator are empirically assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations, showing that the new algorithm reaches the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) over a wide SNR range.

Quantitative I-131 SPECT Reconstruction using CT Side Information from Hybrid Imaging	2009 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference 2009	OCT 25-31, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Nucl Plasma Sci Sect, IEEE			EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; BAYESIAN RECONSTRUCTION; IMPLEMENTATION; COMPENSATION; DOSIMETRY; PATIENT	A penalized-likelihood (PL) SPECT reconstruction method using a modified regularizer that accounts for anatomical boundary side information was implemented to achieve accurate estimates of both the total target activity and the activity distribution within targets. In both simulations and experimental I-131 phantom studies, reconstructions from 1) penalized likelihood employing CT-side information based regularization (PL-CT); 2) penalized likelihood with edge preserving regularization (no CT); 3) penalized likelihood with conventional spatially invariant quadratic regularization (no CT) were compared with 4) Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM), which is the iterative algorithm conventionally used in clinics for quantitative SPECT. Evaluations included phantom studies with perfect and imperfect (misregistered) side information and studies with uniform and non-uniform activity distributions in the target. For targets with uniform activity, the PL-CT images and profiles were closest to the 'truth', avoided the edge offshoots evident with OSEM and minimized the blurring across boundaries evident with regularization without CT information. Apart from visual comparison, reconstruction accuracy was evaluated using the bias and standard deviation (STD) of the total target activity estimate and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the activity distribution within the target. PL-CT reconstruction reduced both bias and RMSE compared with regularization without side information. When compared with unregularized OSEM, PL-CT reduced RMSE and STD while bias was comparable. For targets with non-uniform activity, these improvements with PL-CT were observed only when the change in activity was matched by a change in the anatomical image and the corresponding inner boundary was also used to control the regularization. In summary, the present work demonstrates the potential of using CT side information to obtain improved estimates of the activity distribution in targets without sacrificing the accuracy of total target activity estimation.

These methods range from supervised to unsupervised algorithms, discriminative to generative models. Unsupervised learning algorithms for tandem mass spectra are not probabilistic model based and they don't provide probabilities for spectra quality assessment. In this study, the distribution of high quality spectra and poor quality spectra are modeled by a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model. A spectrum is assigned to the high quality or poor quality cluster according to its posterior probability. Experiments are conducted on two datasets: ISB and TOV. The results show about 57.64% and 66.38% of poor quality spectra can be removed without losing more than 10% of high quality spectra for the two spectral datasets, respectively. This indicates clustering as an exploratory data analysis tool is valuable for the quality assessment of tandem mass spectra without using a pre-labeled training dataset.

Refactoring Acoustic Models using Variational Expectation-Maximization	INTERSPEECH 2009: 10TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION 2009, VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	10th INTERSPEECH 2009 Conference	SEP 06-10, 2009	Brighton, ENGLAND	Int Speech Commun Assoc		acoustic model clustering; KL divergence; variational approximation; variational expectation-maximization		In probabilistic modeling, it is often useful to change the structure, or refactor, a model, so that it has a different number of components, different parameter sharing, or other constraints. For example, we may wish to find a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with fewer components that best approximates a reference model. Maximizing the likelihood of the rcfactored model under the reference model is equivalent to minimizing their KL divergence. For GMMs, this optimization is not analytically tractable. However, a lower bound to the likelihood can be maximized using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. Automatic speech recognition provides a good framework to test the validity of such methods, because we can train reference models of any given size for comparison with refactorcd models. We show that we can efficiently reduce model size by 50%, with the same recognition performance as the corresponding model trained from data.

To reduce image noise and artifacts, we propose a statistical iterative method for image reconstruction in Cone-beam CT. First the theory of maximum likelihood estimation is extended from emission CT to X-ray scan. Then an expectation-maximization (EM) formula is deduced for direct reconstruction of Cone-beam CT. EM algorithm is an iterative method that can produce good quality reconstruction. But compared with fast and robust FDK algorithm, EM algorithm is computer intensive and convergence slow. In order to accelerate the convergence speed of EM algorithm, overrelaxation (OR) is applied in this work. OR-EM algorithm is a feasible iterative method. It can provide good quality reconstructions after only a few iterations. Experiments results with computer simulated data and real CT data show OR-EM algorithm is effective. Its reconstructed images are accurate and clear.

Modeling of Photoconductor Print Artifacts Using a Mixture of Gaussians	NIP 25: DIGITAL FABRICATION 2009, TECHNICAL PROGRAM AND PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies	SEP 20-24, 2009	Louisville, KY	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, Imaging Soc Japan				Manufacturing imperfections of photoconductor (PC) drums in electrophotographic (EP) printers cause low-frequency artifacts that could produce objectionable non-uniformities in the final printouts. In this paper, we propose a technique to detect and quantify, PC artifacts. A scanner-based system is utilized to scan printed pages of flat-field areas. A wavelet-based filtering technique is applied to the scanned images to isolate the PC-related artifacts from other printing artifacts, based on the frequency range and the direction of the PC defects. The prior knowledge of the PC circumference is utilized to determine the printed area at each revolution of the drum to be analyzed separately. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for probability density estimation is applied to the filtered images to model the PC defects as a mixture of three Gaussians. We use the estimated parameters of the Gaussians to measure the severity of the defect. The consistency of the PC artifacts, at subsequent revolutions of the drum, is studied by comparing the models from different revolutions. Results from experiments on different drums and print samples of different tone levels show a high correlation score between the proposed measure and the subjective evaluation of print quality experts.

The shape prior is built in a linear space of vectors of distances to the training boundaries from their common centroid. The appearance prior is modeled with a spatially homogeneous 2(nd)-order Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) of gray levels within each training boundary. Geometric structure of the MGRF and Gibbs potentials are analytically estimated from the training data. To accurately separate goal objects from arbitrary background, the deformable model is evolved by solving an Eikonal partial differential equation with a speed function combining the shape and appearance priors and the current appearance model. The latter represents empirical gray level marginals inside and outside an evolving boundary with adaptive linear combinations of discrete Gaussians (LCDG). The analytical shape and appearance priors and a simple Expectation-Maximization procedure for getting the object and background LCDGs, make our segmentation considerably faster than most of the known counterparts. Experiments with various images confirm robustness, accuracy, and speed of our approach.

In this paper, we describe TOF-MRA images and desired maps of regions (blood vessels and the other brain tissues) by a joint Markov-Gibbs random field model (MGRF) of independent image signals and interdependent region labels but focus on most accurate model identification. To better specify region borders, each empirical distribution of signals is precisely approximated by a Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussians (LCDG) with positive and negative components. We modify a conventional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to deal with the LCDG and develop a sequential EM-based technique to get an initial LCDG-approximation for the modified EM algorithm. The initial segmentation based on the LCDG-models is then iteratively refined using a GMRF model with analytically estimated potentials. To validate the accuracy of our algorithm, a special 3D geometrical phantom motivated by statistical analysis of the MRA-TOF data is designed. Experiments with both the phantom and 50 real data sets confirm high accuracy of the proposed approach.

There is a problem in the process of reconstructing the training set: unlabeled samples should be divided into two parts by the classifier, reliable and misclassified; the misclassified part is considered as training samples. This affects the finally classification performance and convergence efficiency. This paper presents an improved method, which reconstructs the labeled samples set and then considers it as the training set in each iterative process. The process is implemented by adding the reliable part in unlabeled samples to labeled samples and forming a new labeled samples set. Experimental results in test classification show that the proposed method improves the classification performance and convergence efficiency.

The ability to detect and quantify extent of LI could serve as an image based prognostic tool for HER2+ BC patients. Lymphocyte segmentation in H & E-stained BC histopathology images is, however, complicated due to the similarity in appearance between lymphocyte nuclei and cancer nuclei. Additional challenges include biological variability, histological artifacts, and high prevalence of overlapping objects. Although active contours are widely employed in segmentation, they are limited in their ability to segment overlapping objects. In this paper, we propose a segmentation scheme (EMaGACOR) that integrates Expectation Maximization (EM) based segmentation with a geodesic active contour (GA C). Additionally, a novel heuristic edge-path algorithm exploits the size of lymphocytes to split contours that enclose overlapping objects. For a total of 62 HER2+ breast biopsy images, EMaGACOR was found to have a detection sensitivity of over 90% and a positive predictive value of over 78%. By comparison, EMaGAC (model without overlap resolution) and GAC (Randomly initialized geodesic active contour) model yielded corresponding sensitivities of 57.4% and 26.7%, respectively. Furthermore, EMaGACOR was able to resolve over 92% of overlaps. Our scheme was found to he robust, reproducible, accurate, and could potentially be applied to other biomedical image segmentation applications.

In this paper, it is proposed to apply Bayesian decision-making theory based on minimum error probability to gray image segmentation. On the assumption that the gray values accord with the probability distribution of Gaussian finite mixture model in image feature space, EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of mixture model. In order to improve the convergence speed of EM algorithm, a novel and feasible method called weighted equal interval sampling is presented to obtain the contracted sample set. Consequently, the computation task of EM algorithm is greatly reduced and efficiency is improved. An approximate MMIC algorithm of Bayesian Information Criterion is employed to determine quickly how many regions should be segmented on a given gray image. The automatic image segmentation can be executed with the method mentioned above. We demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our method on a set of natural and synthetic images.

The Bayesian trees considered here consist of an unconstrained subtree and a set of constrained subtrees. In this tree structure, constraints are imposed on some of the parameters of the parametrized conditional distributions, such that all conditional distributions within the same subtree share the same constraint. We propose a learning method that uses the unconstrained subtree to guide the process of discovering a set of relevant constrained tree substructures. Substructure discovery and constraint enforcement are simultaneously accomplished using an E.M. algorithm. We show how our tree substructure discovery method can be applied to the problem of learning representative pose models from a set of unsegmented video sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for human motion classification.

Recently approaches based on predictive model-based compensation schemes, such as Joint Uncertainty Decoding (JUD) and Vector Taylor Series (VTS), have been proposed. This paper reviews these model-based compensation schemes and relates them to factor-analysis style systems. Forms of Maximum Likelihood (ML) adaptive training with these approaches are described, based on both second-order optimisation schemes and Expectation Maximisation (EM). However, discriminative training is used in many state-of-the-art speech recognition. Hence, this paper proposes discriminative adaptive training with predictive model-compensation approaches for noise robust speech recognition. This training approach is applied to both JUD and VTS compensation with minimum phone error training. A large scale multi-environment training configuration is used and the systems evaluated on a range of in-car collected data tasks.	[Flego, F.; Gales, M. J.

In many practical settings, however, many studies needing factor analytic modeling involve data that, not only are not multivariate Gaussian variables, but also come from a partitioned input space. This article introduces an extension of the maximum likelihood factor analysis that handles multivariate outcomes made up of attributes with different probability distributions, and originating from a partitioned input space. An EM Algorithm combined with Fisher Scoring is used to estimate the parameters of the derived model.

The duration of the signal and the number of beats to segment are often too large for a manual annotation, so that automatic segmentation is a challenging and useful tool. State-of-the-art algorithms use hidden Markov models with wavelet transform encoding and represent the ECG in multidimensional spaces using Gaussian mixtures models. The main problem of this approach is its computational cost due to the number of free parameters, the choice of the wavelet transform parameters and the high failure rate of the EM algorithm. In this work, we propose an alternative emission encoding for hidden Markov models using both the ECG signal and its derivative in order to better model the dynamics of the signal in a lower dimensional space. We show that this method achieves similar performances with much less model parameters and is less subject to failures.

EMDL makes a significant impact on the combinatorial scalability issue pertaining to the model selection for mixture models having types of components. A goal of such problems is to optimize types of components as well as the number of components. One key idea in EMDL is to iterate calculations of the posterior of latent variables and minimization of expected description length of both observed data and latent variables. This enables EMDL to compute the optimal model in linear time with respect to both the number of components and the number of available types of components despite the fact that the number of model candidates exponentially increases with the numbers. We prove that EMDL is compliant with the MDL principle and enjoys its statistical benefits.

In our visualization, items are given as points in a few dimensional preference space, and user specific preferences are given as lines in the same space. The relationship between items and user preferences are intuitively interpreted via projections from points onto lines. As a primitive implementation, we introduce a mixture of the Bradley-Terry models, and visualize the relation between items and user preferences with benchmark data sets.

It is observed that despite the fact the cost function (log-likelihood) is monotonically increasing, the image quality deteriorates after reaching a certain "optimum" point during the iterative process. The principal aim of the work is the discovery of a rule that would directly link the quality of the reconstructed images at each iteration with the log-likelihood. We assume that the true image corresponds to a log-likelihood value in correlation with the data acquired, which, when achieved, makes no sense looking for higher log-likelihood levels. We study here the hypothesis that there is a direct correlation of the log-likelihood of the true image (a quantity that is not known a priori in real PET scans) and acquired data, with certain properties of the pixel updating coefficients (PUC) in the MLEM algorithm. For the validation of this hypothesis we have employed Monte Carlo experiments using known phantoms. We show here that the minimum value of the PUC for the non-zero pixels might be one parameter that could be used to verify the above mentioned hypothesis.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology to improve current diagnosis and evaluation methods of attention disorders. We have developed and tested several data-mining methodologies suitable for the automatic analysis and visualization of eye tracking data. In particular three novel methods of classification of subjects are proposed: (i) a method that uses Expectation Maximization to classify according to statistical likelihood of fixations locations; (ii) a procedure based on the Levenshtein distance method to compare sequences of fixations; and (iii) a method based on the analysis of the transitions frequencies of fixations between regions. Results of evaluation of classification accuracy are finally presented.	[Galgani, Filippo; Lanzi, Pier Luca] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy	Galgani, F (reprint author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.

We propose to combine a simple pixel-wise model for the background with a general purpose region based model for the foreground. The background is modeled using one Gaussian per pixel, thus achieving a precise and easy to update model. The foreground is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture Model with feature vectors consisting of the spatial (x, y) and colour (r, g, b) components. The spatial components of this model are updated using the Expectation Maximization algorithm after the classification of each frame. The background model is formulated in the 5 dimensional feature space in order to be able to apply a Maximum A Posteriori framework for the classification. The classification is done using a graph cut algorithm that allows taking into account neighborhood information. The results presented in the paper show the improvement of the system in situations where the foreground objects have similar colors to those of the background.

We have extended our prior approach by introducing multidimensional probability density components to represent class density using an adaptive mixture of such components. The number of components in the adaptive mixture algorithm, as well as the values of the parameters of the density components, is estimated from the data. The network utilizes a recursive version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to minimize the Kullback-Leibler information metric by means of stochastic approximation combined with a rule for creation of new components. Learning occurs incrementally in order to allow the system to take advantage of increasing amounts of data without having to take the system offline periodically to update models. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. In addition, the adaptive mixtures neural network classifies streaming track data as normal or deviant. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives by enabling a shift of operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our overall motion pattern learning approach learns behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce massive amounts of track data to a rich set of information regarding operator field of regard that supports rapid decision-making and timely response initiation.

We model the network in an NCS as a Markov chain and the packet losses as stochastic events whose probability depends on the Markov chain state (i.e. network state). Thus, the network state estimation is a hidden Markov model (HMM) estimation problem. To derive the HMM of the NCS under study, we propose the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the HMM based on the packet dropping sequence. Finally, a simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We model the network in an NCS as a hidden Markov chain and the network delay as stochastic variable whose probability density function depends on the Markov chain state (i.e. network state). Thus, the network state estimation is a continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) estimation problem. To derive the CTHMM of the NCS under study, we propose the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the parameters of the CTHMM based on the packet delay observations. The derived CTHMM make it possible in the future for us to predict the next network state and then choose a proper one from several control laws, which have been designed in advance to guarantee the performance of the NCS.

A separate GRNN classifier is trained and tested on the dataset imputed with each imputation algorithm.

In addition to the unlabeled data, in many applications, additional sources of information such as a-priori knowledge of mixing proportions are also available. We present a weakly supervised approach, in the form of a penalized expectation maximization algorithm that uses a-priori knowledge to guide the model training process. The algorithm penalizes those models whose predicted mixing proportions have high divergence from the a-priori mixing proportions. We also present an extension to incorporate both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised setting. Systematic evaluations on several publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperforms the expectation maximization algorithm. The performance gains are particularly significant when the amount of unlabeled data is limited and in the presence of noise.

The model defines a low-dimensional manifold of local noise models induced by a smooth non-linear mapping from a low-dimensional latent space into the space of probabilistic models of the observed light; curves. The local noise models are physical models that describe how such light curves are generated. Due to the principled probabilistic nature of the model, a cost function arises naturally and the model parameters are fitted via MAP estimation using the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. Once the model has been trained, each light curve may be projected to the latent space as the the mean posterior probability over the local noise models. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset of artificially generated light curves and on a dataset comprised of light curves from real observations.

Generally reconstruction is conducted using iterative reconstruction methods such as Maximum Likelihood - Expectation Maximization (ML-EM). However, iterative reconstruction into volumetric grids is a computational burden. Analytic methods of image reconstruction have been proposed which relieve the computational expense. However, such methods usually have unrealistic sampling assumptions or are not directly extendable to situations where the scattering detector is extended when compared to the detector-source distance. Starling from a standard inversion technique, a generic method of filtering inversion co-efficients is developed. By dynamically assigning the strength of co-efficients on an event-by-event basis, artifacts arising from the difference between assumed and actual forward transform may be reduced. Dynamic assignment allows inversion of single cone-surfaces, so that the generic technique may be implemented in volumetric reconstruction. Results are compared to direct-back-projection in a limited-angle tomography context. The ability to apply event-by-event analytic image reconstruction provides many advantages when compared to standard iterative techniques.

Learning algorithms from this family are widely used because of their intuitively clear learning process and ease of implementation. In this paper we propose an extension of the LVQ algorithm to regression. Just like the LVQ algorithm, the proposed modification uses a supervised learning procedure to learn the best prototype positions, but unlike LVQ algorithm for classification, it also learns the best prototype target values. This results in the effective partition of the feature space, similar to the one the K-means algorithm would make. Experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that the proposed Regression LVQ algorithm performs better than the nearest prototype competitors that choose prototypes randomly or through K-means clustering, classification LVQ on quantized target values, and similarly to the memory-based Parzen Window and Nearest Neighbor algorithms.

However, Bayesian Network structure learning is a hard problem to solve. We propose an method, EM-MCMC algorithm for Bayesian Network structure learning in which Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm is applied to Bayesian parameter learning and Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) method is used to sample for Bayesian structure. Differ from previous ones, we integrate Accepting Rejection Sampling to MCMC acceptance function. We compare our method with EM-EM Bayesian structure learning that uses EM algorithm in parameter learning and structure learning, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our algorithm.

Detecting Load Conditions in Human Walking Using Expectation Maximization and Neural Networks	IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 14-19, 2009	Atlanta, GA	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			HUMAN LOCOMOTION; PATTERNS; MOVEMENT; MODELS	Weight carrying conditions in human subjects is classified using a mixture of Gaussian based classifier and neural networks. Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the model parameters for the mixture of Gaussian (MOG) based classifier. Since variables change in time as the human subjects walk, and likelihood score in a mixture model is usually calculated for stationary data, a scoring system is developed to calculate how likely a time sequence of variables belongs to a particular distribution. A neural network (NN) based classifier is also developed which uses the traditional back-propagation algorithm for training. The results obtained show overall 74.1% accuracy using MOG and 66.4% using NN for the test set in a binary classification task of detecting "load" or "no-load" conditions using just two variables. The lower accuracy using NN is not surprising as averaged variables are provided as inputs to the NN while MOG is able to use the dynamic information. In another classification task with four classes and using two variables, the accuracy was 37.2% using MOG and 34.2% using NN on the test set which are both better than chance. Accuracy of NN using 7 variables was 81.4% for binary classification and 41.3% for four-class classification. An interesting finding from these results is that NN (using 7 averaged variables) performed better than human perceivers who were asked to judge based on stick figure animations of subjects walking. Another interesting revelation from this study was that the covariance matrices from the MOG model revealed "anti-phase" locking of the elbow and stoop angle as the subjects walk.

Unsupervised text classification does not need training data but is often criticized to cluster blindly. Supervised text classification needs large quantities of labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. However, in practice, labeled samples are often difficult, expensive or time consuming to obtain. In the meanwhile, unlabeled documents can be collected easily owing to the rapid developing Internet. Class associated words are the words which represent the subject of classes and provide prior knowledge of classification for training a classifier. A learning algorithm, based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier, is introduced to classify documents from fully unlabeled documents using class associated words. Experimental results show that it has good classification capability with high accuracy, especially for those categories with small quantities of samples. In the algorithm, class associated words are used to set classification constraints during learning process to restrict to classify documents into corresponding class labels and improve the classification accuracy.

The problem becomes even harder if we wish to account for the spatial variation of material properties on the sulface. In this paper, we derive a novel method for estimating the spatially varying specular reflectance properties, of a sulface of known geometry, as well as the illumination distribution from a specular-only image, for instance, captured using polarization to separate reflection components. Unlike previous work, we do not assume the illumination to be a single point light source. We model specular reflection with a spherical statistical distribution and encode the spatial variation with radial basis functions of its parameters. This allows us to formulate the simultaneous estimation of spatially varying specular reflectance and illumination as a sound probabilistic inference problem, in particular, using Csiszar's I-divergence measure. To solve it, we derive an iterative algorithm similar to expectation maximization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on synthetic and real-world scenes.

We first assume Gaussian input to formulate an EM-based estimation of the signal subspace of the output covariance matrix. This Gaussian assumption allows us to utilize knowledge from EM-based probabilistic principle component analysis (P-PCA). Next, we show that the equilibrium point of the EM iteration equations is reached without the Gaussian assumption, which suggests usage of non-Gaussian communication input signals. The estimated signal subspace is then utilized to identify the channels. In principle, the proposed method yields the same channel estimates as the widely-known subspace method, but is computationally more efficient. In addition, unlike typical EM applications, the proposed scheme is free from cumbersome parameter initialization issue, which greatly increases flexibility of the proposed scheme.

After representing the DSC using Karhunen-Loeve basis expansion model (K-L BEM), the proposed algorithm is developed based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Basically, it is an iterative algorithm including two steps at each iteration. In the first step, the unknown coefficients in K-L BEM are first integrated out to obtain a function which only depends on data, and meanwhile, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel estimator is obtained. In the second step, data are directly detected by a novel approach based on the function obtained in the first step. Moreover, a Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (BCRB) which is valid for any channel estimator is also derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel estimator. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is finally corroborated by simulation results.

Unlike other more popular methods (eg., Multi-Hypothesis Tracking, MHT) the computational burden of PMHT grows linearly in the size of the batch, the number of clutter defections, and the number of targets tracked. The SEABAR [3] sea trail was conducted by the NATO Undersea Research Center in 2007 to investigate the suitability of some experimental high gain deployed active sonar receivers for tracking underwater contacts of interest. The sea trial yielded several useful multi-static active sonar data sets. The purpose of the effort reported here is to assess the target tracking performance of PMHT using structured multi-static active sonar sea trial data collected during the SEABAR experiment. This study quantifies the effects of batch size on the ability of PMHT to hold track on constant velocity and maneuvering contacts to determine the values that provide acceptable tracking performance. Situations involving contact maneuvers or temporary loss of detection (a.k.a., drop outs) are of particular interest. Specifically, the ability of PMHT to hold track as a function of batch size for two multi-static active sonar sea trial data sets containing contact maneuvers and drop outs will be assessed.

In particular, an extension of Gaussian-means (G-means) and Projected Gaussian-means (PG-means) algorithms is proposed. All these methods are based on one-dimensional statistical hypothesis test. G-means and PG-means are wrapper algorithms of the k-means and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, respectively. Although G-means is a simple and fast algorithm, it does not perform well when clusters overlap since it is based on k-means. PG-means can handle overlapped clusters but requires more computation and sometimes fails to find the right number of clusters. In this paper, we propose an extension, called Extended Projected Gaussian means (XPG-means). XPG-means is a wrapper algorithm of Possibilistic Fuzzy C-means (PFCM) algorithm. XPG-means integrates the advantages of both algorithms while resolving some of the disadvantages involving overlapped clusters, noise, and computational complexity. More specifically, XPG-means handles overlapped clusters better than G-means because of the use of fuzzy clustering, handles noise better than both algorithms because it uses possibilitistic clustering. XPG-means is less computationally expensive than PG-means because it uses local hypothesis testing scheme used by G-means that is specific to Gaussians wherease PG-means uses a more general Kolmogorov-Smirnow test on Gaussian mixtures. In addition, XPG-means demonstrates less variance in estimating the number of components than either of the other algorithms.

Ultrafast Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient MAP Reconstruction for Fully 3-D microPET	2009 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference 2009	OCT 25-31, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Nucl Plasma Sci Sect, IEEE			BAYESIAN IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; PET	Iterative 3D PET reconstruction represents a very computational challenge due to the large number of lines of response (LOR) collected for each data set. This iterative 3D reconstruction also needs a lot of iterations to achieve an acceptable PET reconstructed image. A Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method was previously shown to have faster convergence rate than expectation maximization (EM) type algorithms. For the microPET, imagea suffer from crystal penetration blurring due to small scanner radius. An exact 2D blur model is needed to achieve high resolution image. A Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is described for reconstruction of high-resolution 3D images from the microPET Inveon small-animal scanner from Siemens [1, 2, 3]. The projector pair is used as part of a factored system matrix that takes into account detector-pair response by using shift-variant sinogram blur kernels, attenuation correction, and detector efficiency corrections. The system matrix for geometric projection is based on depth dependent solid angle calculation in combination with a spatially variant detector response model. The mircoPET PCG is combined with OSEM to accelerate convergence. This reconstruction model achieves a high resolution animal image; however, it took an hour to reconstruct a frame. Therefore, we describe an ultrafast forward and back projector pair based on Symmetry and SIMD projector (SSP) [4]. The proposed method produces similar quality images when compared to those obtained with the software package from Siemens and requires order of magnitude less computation.	[Hong, I.

This paper aims to visualize them interactively using graphics like thermograph, mashuped with interactive mapping system (IMS), such as Google Map. While conventional researches employ probability density function estimation algorithms, the problems are twofold. One is that the focused data should be analyzed rapidly online during the interaction between systems and users, for the map size and location can be changed flexibly with IMS. The other is that focused data may be sparse when the map is zoomed in. In general, EM algorithm, a commonly-used probabilistic density approximator, is not robust to sparseness and it takes long time for model construction. Parzen window is also a simple, well-known technique but it requires many kernels that make calculation costs high. The proposed method is a novel, simple kernel density estimator which is fast for model construction with high robustness to sparse data. The proposed method is based on Parzen window and employs a clustering algorithm inspired by fuzzy ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) to reduce kernels. From the experimental results, estimation accuracy excels the conventional methods with various benchmarking models.

An EM (Expectation-Maximum) based method has been developed to detect individuals in a common outdoor scenario. A new cluster model is employed in the method for human detection. The method can work well even for low-resolution images. Both moving and standing people can be detected as long as they show some occasional movements, which is satisfied in most cases. Some promising results have been presented and analyzed in a scene with around 100 people.	[Hou, Ya-Li; Pang, Grantham K.

The proposed method combines graph cut method and the simplified Mumford-Shah model (C-V model), and takes the advantages of both. In this paper, the proposed GC-CV method is put to test in its three different operational modes. The first mode is the segmentation of binary images using GC-CV directly. The second mode is the segmentation of multi-region images by recursive GC-CV. The last one is segmentation of color images and gray images by combining GC-CV with EM algorithm, and using YCbCr color space for color image segmentation. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed GC-CV method is verified by a serious of experiments. Experimental results show that the speed of segmentation can be greatly improved and the number of iterations can be considerably reduced with GC-CV in comparison with C-V model. Experimental results reveal that GC-CV can be a promising approach to image segmentation.

The logic based classifiers, such as the decision tree and the rule-based classifier, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data. On the other hand, the kernel based classifiers, such as the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy than the logic based classifiers. However, the user of a kernel based classifier normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. For some applications, the overall picture of the distribution of the data set can provide valuable insights about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data and therefore is highly desirable. In this article, aiming to close the gap between the logic based classifiers and the kernel based classifiers, we propose a novel approach to carry out density estimation based on a mixture model composed of a limited number of generalized Gaussian components. One favorite feature of the classifier constructed with the proposed approach is that a user can easily obtain an overall picture of the distributions of the data set by examining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrices associated with the generalized Gaussian components. Experimental results show that the classifier constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the EM (Expectation Maximization) based classifier. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, the proposed classifier enjoys one major advantage due to providing the user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.

The proposed algorithm was an adaptive channel estimation technique based on an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO OFDM systems. Simulation results show that in slow fading environment there was no degradation in normalized mean square error (MSE) as we increased the number of users. Comparing the Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) algorithm, the proposed algorithm exploits the structure of Alamouti STBC codes to reduce computational complexity.

Therefore, the study of the initialization methods is of great importance for the success of finding a, better sub-optimal solution in practice. However, existing initialization methods for mixture model based clustering using EM-style algorithms do not account for the unique properties of spatial data, such as spatial autocorrelation. To that end: this paper incorporates spatial information into the, initialization and compares three representative initialization methods. Our experimental results oil both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the NEM algorithm usually leads to a better clustering solution if it; starts with initial states returned by the spatial augmented initialization method based oil K-Means.

This paper presents the basic idea of multiple branch delay lock loop (MBDLL) and some popular discriminator functions, such as least squares (LS) / weighted least squares (WLS) estimation, Newton-Raphson method and expectation maximization (EM) / space alternating generalized expectation (SAGE) estimation, applied now in the context of MBDLL. This paper focuses on the comparison between the above-mentioned algorithms for tracking Galileo binary offset carrier (BOC) signal, including both the tracking performance in multipath and the complexity. The tracking performance is assessed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) under the Galileo receiver analysis and design application (GRANADA) bit true software receiver simulator. The comparison results show that the MBDLL can give better tracking performance than the conventional narrow early minus late (NEML) DLL, at the cost of an increase in complexity.

Extrapolation methods can effectively accelerate EM, but to ensure stability, the learning rate of extrapolation must be compromised. This paper describes the TJ(2) aEM method, a targeted extrapolation method that can extrapolate much more aggressively than competing methods without causing instability problems. We analyze its convergence properties and report experimental results.

These three methods are used to extract low-level visual feature vectors from images in a given database separately, then these feature vectors are mapped to high-level semantic words to annotate images with labels in a given semantic label set. As it is more efficient to depict the visual features of an image by the feature distribution than to resort to image segmentation technology for semantic image blocks, this paper is going to find out which of the three feature extraction methods performs better in image annotation based on the distribution of feature vectors from the image. The performance of three different kinds of feature extraction method is fully analyzed, and it is found that discrete cosine transform method is more suitable for Gaussian mixture model in automatic image annotation.

We use this model to identify instruments by their instrumental sound signal. However, this model suffers from an indeterminacy problem. To resolve it, we employ three elements of the sound: loudness, pitch and timbre. Our assumption is that the source signal is represented by time-varying pitch and amplitude, and the synthesis filter by time-invariant line spectral frequency parameters. We construct a probabilistic model that represents our assumption with an extension of the source-filter model. For learning of model parameters, we employed an EM-like minimization algorithm of a cost function called the free energy. Reconstruction of the spectrum with the estimated source signal and synthesis filter, and instrument identification by using the model parameters of the estimated synthesis filter are performed to evaluate our approach, showing that this learning scheme could achieve simultaneous estimation of the source signal and the synthesis filter.

There are various methods for Gaussian mixture estimation such as the EM algorithm, sampling method, and the Bayes method. In this paper, we are concerned with the Gaussian mixture estimation problem using the variational Bayes (VB) which is an approximation of the Bayes method. In the VB, it is important to choose its initial values carefully since the objective function of the problem is multimodal. In this paper, we propose a method which employs primitive initial point (PIP) as an initial value of the VB and performs multi-directional search from the PIP. We present the motivation and rationale of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments using real data sets.

A resulting extremal principle is then used to update the cluster centers (as convex combinations of the data points), and the cluster sizes (if not given.) Progress is monitored by the joint distance function (JDF), a weighted harmonic mean of the above distances, that approximates the data by capturing the data points in its lowest contours. The method is described, and applied to clustering, location problems, and mixtures of distributions, where it is a viable alternative to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. The JDF also helps to determine the "right" number of clusters for a given data set.

The pose estimates can then be used as input data to motion-compensated image reconstruction methods. The proposed algorithm is in the family of so-called optimization transfer algorithms, which have been applied more frequently to tornographic image reconstruction (e.g., the ML-EM algorithm for PET). The algorithm is particularly relevant to the class of slowly-rotating, point-of-care cone beam CT systems, which have recently become prominent in otolaryngological and dental clinics for head and neck scanning. These systems are more compact and inexpensive than traditional CT systems, but because of their slower gantry rotation, are more susceptible to patient head motion over the course of the scan. A virtue of our algorithm is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the marker geometry. The relative positions of the markers are co-estimated together with their 6 degree of freedom position/orientation in each projection view. This means that the marker configuration can be deformably adjusted to fit different patients, giving considerably more flexibility in the design of the marker-to-head attachment gear than with conventional fiducial-based approaches. Our algorithm is also both fast and accurate. In a highly sub-optimal MATLAB implementation, we typically achieve motion estimates yielding sub-millimeter positioning error in 15-30 seconds. We also present motion-compensated reconstructions from real CT acquisitions as evidence of motion-estimation performance.

The paper proposes a semi-supervised classifier that integrates a Clustering based Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm into radial basis function (RBF) neural networks and can learn for classification from a very small number of labeled training samples and a large pool Of unlabeled data effectively. A generalized centroid clustering algorithm is also investigated in this work to balance predictive values between labeled and unlabeled training data and to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results with three popular text classification corpora show that the proper use of additional unlabeled data in this semi-supervised approach can reduce classification errors by up to 26%.

An automatic learning framework which composes a parametric statistic model and algorithms is introduced. The parameters of an online vehicle type classifier are trained with vehicles passing in front of detectors. The online vehicle type classifier tries to identify the vehicle type in real time. The road-side radar detector is developed based on frequency-modulation continuous-wave (FMCW) radar with the carrier frequency at X-band. Vehicles are classified into two major categories, large and small. The classification based on (i) average energy maximum and (ii) average energy variance, that are extracted from the frequency-domain signatures caused by passed vehicles. A two-dimension Gaussian Mixed Model (denoted as GMM) is employed to develop the learning model. Expectation maximization (denoted EM) algorithm is implemented to obtain the parameters of GMM. Numerical examples are demonstrated with real-world experiments. In the field tests, the automatic framework delivers an accuracy of minimum 88%, even with extremes scenarios (including (i) small samples and (ii) large sample size difference of different vehicle types). The examples show satisfying results of the proposed online vehicle type classifier.

We assume a slowly varying channel impulse response from one burst to the following one. We modify the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion by taking into account an a priori channel estimate obtained from the burst preceding the one processed. Assuming that the receiver knows the channel statistics, we propose to use the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm for a joint iterative equalization and channel estimation. During each iteration of the receiver, the EM algorithm reestimates the channel by using the a posteriori. probabilities (APP) available at the output of the equalizer. The algorithm we propose has linear-time complexity per iteration. Simulations show that our MAP receiver reaches the performance of the MAP equalizer with perfect channel knowledge after a few iterations, for high SNR and for small values of normalized Doppler spread. They show also that our receiver outperforms the MAP equalizer that uses a channel estimate obtained by using a training sequence.

Recently, many new ways of utilizing the information hidden in VCS have been discovered. Clustering layouts of software systems using VCS is one of them. It reveals groups of related artifacts of the software system, which can be visualized for easier exploration. In this paper we use an Expectation Maximization (EM) based probabilistic clustering algorithm and visualize the clustered modules using a compound node layout algorithm. Our experiments with repositories of two medium size software tools give promising results indicating improvements over many previous approaches.

Face and ear images are convolved with Gabor wavelet filters to extracts spatially enhanced Gabor facial features and Gabor ear features. Further, GMM is applied to the high-dimensional Gabor face and Gabor ear responses separately for quantitive measurements. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate density parameters in GMM. This produces two sets of feature vectors which are then fused using Dempster-Shafer theory. Experiments are conducted on multimodal database containing face and ear images of 400 individuals. It is found that use of Gabor wavelet filters along with GMM and DS theory can provide robust and efficient multimodal fusion strategy.

We propose the use of reference distributions having various kurtosis values. It is assumed that the true error distribution is one of the reference distributions, but the indicator variable for the true distribution is missing. The generalized expectation-maximization algorithm combined with a line search is developed for estimating regression coefficients. Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed approach with some existing robust regression methods including least absolute deviation, Lp, Huber M regression and an approximation using normal mixtures under various error distributions. As the error distribution is far from a normal distribution, the proposed method is observed to show better performance than other methods.

Extended Source Imaging Using a Single Rotating Modulation Collimator	2009 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference 2009	OCT 25-31, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE, Nucl Plasma Sci Sect, IEEE				Rotating modulation collimators (RMC) have traditionally been most sensitive for locating point sources, but have also been used for imaging time dependent extended sources such as solar flares. Current methods for RMC imaging of extended sources have relied upon multiple RMC systems each with their own detectors, electronics, and mask sets. The difference between systems is that each mask pair has a different set of slit spacings so that different spatial frequency components of the source field can be recorded. The data from the ensemble of RMCs is then combined to produce the final extended source image. This research considers a different approach for imaging extended sources with an RMC. This method relies on a single RMC system, and takes advantage of the fact that for terrestrial imaging the separation between masks is an easily changeable and free parameter. Changing the separation between the masks effectively represents changing the spatial frequency over which the RMC is most sensitive. By measuring multiple data sets with different values of the mask separation parameter, a more complete map of the frequency domain can be recorded. This data is then used with a maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm to generate the final image.

In this work, we develop a parametric finite mixture model for the statistics of pixel intensities in high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This method is an extension of previously existing method for lower resolution images. The method integrates the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) scheme and the method of log-cumulants (MoLC) with an automatic technique to select, for each mixture component, an optimal parametric model taken from a predefined dictionary of parametric probability density functions (pdf). The proposed dictionary consists of eight state-of-the-art SAR-specific pdfs: Nakagami, log-normal, generalized Gaussian Rayleigh, Heavy-tailed Rayleigh, Weibull, K-root, Fisher and generalized Gamma. The designed scheme is endowed with the novel initialization procedure and the algorithm to automatically estimate the optimal number of mixture components. The experimental results with a set of several high resolution COSMO-SkyMed images demonstrate the high accuracy of the designed algorithm, both from the viewpoint of a visual comparison of the histograms, and from the viewpoint of quantitive accuracy measures such as correlation coefficient (above 99,5%). The method proves to be effective on all the considered images, remaining accurate for multimodal and highly heterogeneous scenes.

In 2007, Honkela et al. introduced a recipe for a gradient-based algorithm for VB inference that does not have such a restriction. In this paper, we derive the algorithm in the case of the mixture of Gaussians model. For the first time, the algorithm is experimentally compared to VB EM and its variant with both artificial and real data. We conclude that the algorithms are approximately as fast depending on the problem.

It is a cluster validity index that rewards the average normality of the clusters, measured by means of the negentropy, and penalizes the overlap, measured by the partition entropy. The PNC is aimed at finding well separated clusters whose shape is approximately Gaussian. We use the new index to validate fuzzy partitions in a set of synthetic clustering problems, and compare the results to those obtained by the AIC, BIC and ICL criteria.. The partitions are obtained by fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data using the EM algorithm. We show that, when the real clusters are normally distributed, all the criteria are able to correctly assess the number of components, with AIC and BIC allowing a higher cluster overlap. However, when the real cluster distributions are not Gaussian (i.e. the distribution assumed by the mixture model) the PNC outperforms the other indices, being able to correctly evaluate the number of clusters while the other criteria (specially AIC and BIC) tend to overestimate it.

On this way, our work is focused on the planning and the guidance of endovascular therapies such as cardiac resynchronization or revascularization, More precisely, its objective is to find the optimal vascular path to a given target for the insertion of tools like stimulation probes, balloons or stents. The challenge is therefore to track in 3D space and time the structures of interest in order to define the instrument trajectories. This work presents a first attempt toward the temporal tracking of coronary arteries in a sequence of CT volumes. The beating heart is highly deformed over a cardiac cycle and complex movements are present (contraction, expansion, torsion) with slow, fast and inverted episodes. The coronary arteries, relying on the myocardium, are very difficult to track due to their small diameters diameters (1 to 5 mm while the CT resolution is about 0.4 mm) on one hand and, on the other hand, the CT reconstruction artifacts corresponding to fast motion phases of the heart. Many motion extraction techniques have been derived over the two last decades and widely applied in the computer vision domain, Optical flow methods [1], bayesian filtering tracking [2] and deformable models [3] are among the most well known. However, few articles have addressed the coronary vessel tracking problem in CT volume sequences. Previous studies dealt with 2D image sequences [4-9] and few of them present an automatic method [6]. To our knowledge, the work of Shechter et al. [10] based on landmarks (forking points) is the only one really applied to 3D CT sequences. The present method departs from this approach by only using tracks local intensity patterns and shape features of the vessels. The mean background and vessel intensity distribution are estimated using an EM algorithm, The shape information is recovered by locally modeling the vessel as a cylinder. Its parameters (center, radius and direction) are computed from the geometrical moments computed up to the second order in a spherical neighborhood [11] (equations 1-4). The method is divided into three main stages (figure 1): initialization, temporal tracking and position refinement. At the initialization step, the user picks up a point into one volume V(t) of the sequence. Its position is adjusted on the vessel centerline using an iterative process [11]. To get accurately the vessel local features, this process also assesses the size of the spherical neighborhood to be used in the computation of geometrical moments. The overall goal consists to find the position of this point P(t), in each volume of the sequence: (P(t), P(t+1), P(t+2)...). We propose an original exploration technique of the volume V(t+i): The temporal tracking step researches a point of the vessel into a spherical research space, centered on the position P(t). Its radius is chosen to cover the largest motion expected in the volume sequence. This space is then divided into a set of small spheres which positions and radiuses are adjusted using the same iterative process applied at the initialization step. The spheres are then located on the high intensity regions in the search space and their centers are the candidate points. A similarity criterion between each candidate point and the point P(t) is computed to select the best point, let say, (P) over cap (t+i), This measure includes the local histogram, the second order moments and the estimated radius of the vessel (equation 5). The last step is aimed at refining the position of the point inside the vessel by performing a local spatial tracking of the vessel around the position (P) over cap (t+i). The displacement is performed along the vessel estimated local direction. The iterative processes, mentioned above, are applied at each step to adjust the position of the point on the vessel centerline. The local sum of squared differences of intensity is then used to select the position of the point P(t+i) among the extracted points. Some experiments have been conducted to evaluate the method. They have been first carried out on real data sets submitted to controlled transformations. When translations of growing magnitudes (up to 12 mm for 3 different volumes) are applied, the results (using 20 points located on the main branches of the coronary arteries in each volume) led to an accuracy below 2 mm for 95% of the tests and better than 1 mm for 75% of them. To simulate more realistically the heart movements, we also considered a non rigid B-spline transformation [12]. The transformation parameters were assessed by registering 2 volumes of a sequence. For the 52 points tracked, we obtained 100% success in recovering a point located in the vessel. The mean error was 1.8 mm at the end of the temporal tracking step, and 0.8 mm after the whole process. A second experimental phase has been worked out on real data but, in that case, without knowing the ground truth. 10 points were tracked for each of the 4 available volume sequences. The points were located either on healthy or pathological vessels (figures 4-5), We compared the trajectories of several points of a branch (figure 6) and the same point in the anatomy for several patients (figure 7). The trajectories were consistent between them and also with the physiology (fast motion in systole, diastole containing 3 main motion stages). To briefly conclude, let us emphasize that the main difficulties come from both the characteristics of the images and the structural complexity of the scene. The images are spatially anisotropic (a linear interpolation between slices needs to be applied), not fully corrected during the reconstruction in term of motion artifacts (figure 5 phase 50%). The scene includes different structures such as myocardium, cavities, venous and arterial trees, which are spatially close and have similar intensities. The vessels are thin and can depict abnormal features (i.e atherosclerosis). The method overcomes most of these problems, except when the data sets are too damaged by strong motion artifacts. The choice to use only local information is well-justified by the objective to process a minimum of information. This two steps strategy was accordingly built on the idea to look for a first vessel point considering only the candidates located at high intensity regions in a limited space, and then, to achieve a local exhaustive search on the vessel centerline. The computation time of the method, around 2s for tracking a new position over the full volume sequence is still too long for a clinical use. However, a code optimization and a sound choice of the number of candidate points will contribute to significantly reduce the computation time. Furthermore, the spatial coherence of the vessel in time could be used to speed up the tracking of an ensemble of points.

The grey-level distribution of a brain image is approximated by a sum of Gaussian functions and the parameters of the Gaussian mixture are determined by a maximum likelihood criterion via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Each cluster, therefore, is represented by a multivariate Gaussian function with a definite centre coordinate and a certain shape. This approach leads to a drastic compression of the information contained in the brain image and serves as a starting point for a variety of possible feature extraction methods for the diagnosis of brain diseases.

The purpose of this paper is to propose new ways of computing such estimates, with different degrees of accuracy and complexity. We build oil the Expectation-Maximizatiou Belief-Propagation (EMPB) framework proposed by Hsu et al. to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). We propose two general approaches within the EMBP framework: we firstly derive update rules at; the constraint level while enforcing domain consistency and then derive update rules globally, at the problem level. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: first, we derive new generic update rules suited to tackle ally CSP; second, we propose all efficient EMP-inspired approach, thereby improving this method and making it competitive with the state of the art. We evaluate these approaches experimentally and demonstrate their effectiveness.

We have tested HD.PET for cardiac imaging. Materials and Methods: We filled the cardiac insert of a RSD Alderson Thorax phantom with (18)F-FDG and acquired it with and without defects. The data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), 2D and 3D Attenuation Weighted Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (AWOSEM), and HD.PET. We calculated the wall/cavity contrast and contrast-to-noise (CNR). Two patients referred for myocardial viability assessment were also acquired. Static and 8-bin ECG-gated images were generated using FBP, 2D and 3D AWOSEM, and HD.PET. Results: In the phantom, the contrast increase with HD.PET ranged from 12.0% to 47.9% as compared to FBP, 2D and 3D AWOSEM. The HD.PET CNR with a 2-mm Gauss filter (73.8) was also increased compared to conventional reconstructions (17.0 for FBP, 37.3 for 2D and 38.5 for 3D-AWOSEM). We found that because of the improved spatial resolution, the estimated defect size increase for HD.PET ranged from 10.0% to 33.7%. On the static images of patient #1's study, a myocardial ROI on HD.PET images showed a contrast increase of 3.6% with FBP, 16.3% with 2D AWOSEM and 11.8% with 3D AWOSEM. The static CNR was 27.1 for HD.PET, 6.4 for FBP, 16.2 and 17.9 for 2D and 3D AWOSEM. For patient #2, the HD.PET contrast (CNR) was 8.54 (35.0) while it was 5.59 (11.2) for FBP, 6.26 (33.2) for 2D-AWOSEM and 6.82 (30.0) for 3D-AWOSEM. For both patient #1 and #2's gated images, the myocardial ROI showed a significant contrast and CNR increase with HD.PET as compared to the 3 standard reconstruction methods (all p<0.05 except for patient #1's FBP images). Conclusion: Our preliminary work on both phantom and patient (18)F-FDG cardiac studies showed that HDYET significantly improved defect definition, image resolution, contrast and contrast-to-noise.

IEMGA are composed of initialization, local search, total force calculation, movement, and evaluation. They are hybridization of EM and GA. EM algorithm is a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm originated from the electromagnetism theory. For recurrent fuzzy neural system design, IEMGA simulates the "attraction" and "repulsion" of charged particles by considering each neural system parameters as an electrical charge. The modification from EM algorithm is the neighborhood randomly local search is replaced by GA and the competitive concept is adopted for IEMGA. For gradient information free system, IEMGA is proposed to treat the optimization problem. Besides, IEMGA consists of EM and GA to reduce the computation complexity of EM. IEMGA is used to develop the update laws of RFNN for nonlinear system control problem. Finally, several illustration examples are presented to show the performance and effectiveness of IEMGA.

Its opening was designed to align with the CZT pixel by having same pitch and shape. By the combination of wide opening holes and low septa height, the sensitivity of the collimator can increase dramatically. However, it may also lead to loss of system resolution. The goal of this study is 1) to determine the optimal parameters of the collimator which can increase sensitivity and decrease the charge sharing effect, and 2) to develop system matrix for iterative image reconstruction that can adequately model the proposed collimation scheme to achieve high resolution recovery in spite of using wider collimation holes. Thickness and height of septa in the registered collimator were analytically determined to 1 m m which blocks 97% of 140keV gamma rays and 5.48 mm which indicates 0.2% efficiency that equivalently means about 10 times higher counts than low energy high resolution(LEHR) collimator. Then 2D fan beam-based geometrical response function(GRF) was developed to model the wide opening holes in the registered collimator. The GRF was included in the system matrix of ordered subset expectation maximization(OSEM) method to compensate the loss of resolution. For performance comparison, GATE simulation was performed using a 5 mm diameter hot sphere phantom, which is located at I cm off-centered radial position, and a 40.36 by 40.36 mm CZT detector module. The preliminary results showed that the proposed collimator achieved about 13 times more counts and improved image resolution. In the future, we will keep our experiments with3D cone beam model as well as 2D fan beam model using more realistic phantoms.

Two object models are described: a Fourier-Bessel series model for a helical object and a spherical harmonics series model for a motif which is then replicated in an array to form a helical object where, in both cases, the unknown parameters are the coefficients in the series. The measured images are essentially noisy 2-D projections of the 3-D electron scattering intensity where the projection orientation is not known. A maximum likelihood estimator computed by an expectation-maximization algorithm is used in both cases to estimate the unknown parameters.

In this paper this principle is applied to develop a new method for nonparametric spectrum estimation with missing data. One major advantage of the proposed method is that it can be coupled with any complete data nonparametric spectrum estimation procedure, including kernel smoothing, wavelet and spline estimators. The practical performance of the method is illustrated by a simulation study.	[Lee, Thomas C.

The key idea of our approach is to combine global statistics extracted from the Gaussian mixture model or other proper statistical models with local statistics and geometrical information, such as local probability distribution, orientation, and anisotropy. The combined information is used to design an adaptive local classification strategy that improves the robustness of the algorithm and also keeps fine features in the image. The proposed methodology is flexible and can be easily generalized to deal with other inferred information/quantities and statistical methods/models.

In this paper, we focus on the construction of the most parsimonious phylogenetic trees given sequence data of a group of species as parsimony is probably the most widely used among all tree building algorithms [4]. The major contribution of this paper is the presentation of a novel algorithm, the random tree optimization (RTO) algorithm based on cross-entropy method [16], for the construction of the most parsimonious phylogenetic trees. We analyze the RTO algorithm in the framework of expectation maximization (EM) and point out the similarities and differences between traditional EM algorithm and the RTO algorithm.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed for automatic cortical sulcal parcellation based on the geometric characteristics of the cortical surface including its principal curvatures and principal directions. This method is composed of two major steps: 1) employing the hidden Markov random field model (HMRF) and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm on the maximum principal curvatures of the cortical surface for sulcal region segmentation, and 2) using a principal direction flow field tracking method on the cortical surface for sulcal basin segmentation. The flow field is obtained by diffusing the principal direction field on the cortical surface. The method has been successfully applied to the inner cortical surfaces of twelve healthy human brain MR images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.

It takes a pre-defined human skeleton model as the prior information and a video sequence as the data source, and estimates human pose in each frame by the following steps: Firstly, the Gaussian Mixture Background Model (GMM) is adopted to extract silhouette from an image and this silhouette will be the human body data set after treatment. Then the Distance Transform (DT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are introduced to locate the base point of the human skeleton model, with which the human skeleton model is initialized automatically. Afterwards an iterative process, based on the Expectation Maximization (EM), is constructed out to cluster the human body data set and estimate the parameters of the skeleton iteratively. Finally the pose of human body is figured out in the form of a corresponding skeleton model. Extensive experiments show that this method is robust and precise, and is feasible to apply in the real-time system.

In this paper, we adopt an MRF model for object/background segmentation. The theoretical framework is based on maximum a posterior estimation via the graph-cut energy optimization method. Parameters are estimated with a novel parameter estimation algorithm. The novel parameter estimation algorithm is a variant of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [1, 5] with prior influence factors. Characteristic features related to the information in color, texture and position are extracted for each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

We focus on a number of performance issues that are of particular interest to the mobile positioning application, such as the estimation accuracy of the Line of Sight (LOS) component within a strong multipaths; environment and their robustness to channel model errors. In addition, we also analyse the computational complexity of the algorithms with respect to the number of paths in the channel and the number of antenna elements. Through extensive simulations in MATLAB, we have shown that: 1) SAGE outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of TOA/DOA estimation variance in a strong multipaths environment, thus can give much more accurate position estimate provided the LOS component is relatively strong. 2) SAGE is more robust to channel modeling errors. 3) SAGE's computation complexity exhibits a linear relationship with the number of channel paths (while ESPRIT and JADE are independent) while being unaffected by the number of antenna elements.

This is a direct result of removing inaccurate estimate of the interfering paths, and errors occurring at the IC stage for the first few paths will be accumulated and influence the process of the paths later on. Adaptive interference cancellation suggested by Xue [I] employs a set of weights to control the the amount of interferences removed from each interferer. We extend this idea to the SAGE algorithm, where the weights are obtained by minimising the mean square error between the received signal and its estimate through a Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm. Simulation results show the proposed scheme can outperform the standard SAGE algorithm in non-LOS environments.

At the determination of wavelet coefficients likelihood model stage, Gaussian mixture model is used to characterize the wavelet coefficients statistical distribution, and the model parameters are estimated by expectation maximization algorithm. In order to capture the clustering property of wavelet coefficients, we establish the prior probability model of label field, according to maximum a posterior rule, the optimum conditional probability likelihood model of wavelet coefficients given the labels is determined. At the image segmentation stage, we establish possibilistic c-means clustering objective function based on the conditional probability likelihood model of wavelet coefficients. In order to capture the clustering property of wavelet coefficients, we incorporate the local statistical distribution of wavelet coefficients into the clustering objective function. The improved objective function with spatial constraints is optimizated, we can get a new image segmentation algorithm. The simulation on magnetic resonance image shows that the new multiresolution image segmentation technique obtains much better segmentation results, such as the accuracy of boundary localization and the correctness of distinguishing different tissues.

Conventional KFCM clustering segmentation algorithm does not incorporate the spatial context information of image, which makes it sensitive to the noise and intensity variations. In order to overcome the shortcomings, the contents of image is characterized by Gaussian mixture model, and the parameters of model are estimated by modified expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which overcomes the classical EM algorithm drawbacks that easily trap in local maxima and be susceptible to initial value. According to the maximum a posterior theorem, we can get the pixel maximum posterior pobability.

At the label establishment stage, a WD-MRF tree is employed to model the statistical properties of multiresolution wavelet coefficients. Each wavelet coefficient is characterized by a feature field and a label field model, the feature field being regarded as an observation of its label field, and the label indicating that the wavelet coefficient belongs to a region. After the model parameters are estimated by expectation maximization algorithm, all regions of image are labeled by maximum a posterior principle. At the original image segmentation stage, the contents of the image are formulated as a fuzzy objective function, where the persistence of interscale wavelet coefficients is considered, and by minimizing the objective function, the novel fuzzy segmentation algorithm is derived The experiments with synthetic images are carried out, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional FCM and fixed resolution Bayesian segmentation algorithm, such as accurately locating image edges, correctly identifying different regions.

However, in many practical applications, the number of the components is not known. This paper proposes a kind of greedy merge EM (GMEM) learning algorithm such that the number of Gaussians can be determined automatically with the minimum message length (MML) criterion. Moreover, the greedy merge learning algorithm is successfully applied to unsupervised data analysis. It is demonstrated well by the experiments that the proposed greedy merge EM (GMEM) learning algorithm can make both parameter learning and decide the number of the Gaussian mixture.

The statistical properties of the sources such as sparsity are often assumed to solve the problem. Other available information about the sources such as waveform, however, is scarcely used. Motivated by the fact that semi-blind ICA in complete case can improve the potential of ICA by incorporating source information, this paper proposes a semi-blind algorithm for overcomplete ICA by explicitly utilizing waveform information about some sources. An approximate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is explored to provide normal cost function of the semi-blind algorithm while the prior information is utilized to form an extended one. Computer simulations results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has much improved performance in SNR, convergence speed, and elimination of order ambiguity compared to the original EM algorithm.

Many differently encoded versions of a media file might exist. Our previous work applied distributed source coding not only to distinguish the legitimate diversity of encoded images from tampering but also to localize tampered regions in an image already deemed to be inauthentic. In both cases, authentication requires a Slepian-Wolf encoded image projection that is supplied to the decoder. We extend our scheme to authenticate images that have undergone contrast, brightness, and affine warping adjustment. Our approach incorporates an Expectation Maximization algorithm into the Slepian-Wolf decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can distinguish legitimate encodings, of authentic images from illegitimately modified versions. despite arbitrary contrast, brightness, and affine warping adjustment, using authentication data of less than 250 bytes per image.

We present promising results along these lines, and evaluate several algorithms and parameters that influence machine learning performance.

The traditional adaptive FDA methods extract features in fixed scales ignoring the object's scale variation, and update FDA by sequential Maximum Likelihood estimation, which lacks robustness for sparse data. In this paper, to solve the above challenges, a robust multi-scale adaptive FDA object representation method is proposed for tracking, and its robust FDA updating method is provided. This FDA achieve robustness by extracting features in the selected scale and estimating feature density using a new likelihood function defined both by feature set and the feature's effectiveness probability. In FDA updating, robustness is achieved updating FDA in a Bayesian way by MAP-EM algorithm using density prior knowledge extracted from historical density. Object complex motion (e.g. scaling and rotation) is solved by correlating object appearance with its spatial alignment. Experimental results show that this method is efficient for complex motion, and robust in adapting the object appearance variation caused by changing scale, illumination, pose and viewing angel.

Busy hub-airport plays an important role in a Flight Chain, since the Initial Delay often happens there. To research more possible impacting factors in the Flight Chain, a busy hub-airport is chosen as the object in this research. After analyzing the complex and uncertain relationship between flight delays and all possible impacting factors, Bayesian network (BN) adapt to model and estimate about flight delay in a busy hub-airport. We proposed two learning methods with three different models. Model I is an estimation model for Arrival Delay based on parameter learning of BN with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Model II is estimation model for Arrival Delay based on structure learning of BN with K2 algorithm. The model learned by K2 is proved more suitable for modeling the estimation of flight delay, with a higher estimating correct rate than Model I. Then ModelIII is estimation model for Departure Delay with the same algorithm of Model II.

In this work, we study different components of multi-atlas segmentation and propose new techniques to improve the segmentation accuracy. We found that the use of gradient information in addition to standard normalised mutual information increases the registration accuracy. We also studied different techniques to select atlases in the multi-atlas segmentation. In addition, the expectation maximisation algorithm was used to combine multi-atlas and intensity model information. The average similarity index obtained for six subcortical structures was 0.84.

Multi-tissue Classification of Diffusion-Weighted Brain Images in Multiple System Atrophy Using Expectation Maximization Algorithm Initialized by Hierarchical Clustering	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		Multiple system atrophy; diffusion-weighted imaging; hierarchical clustering; expectation maximization algorithm		Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a well-known neurodegenerative disorders that present parkinsonism syndrome and autonomic dysfunction. Patients with MSA who have the combination of parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia are referred to as MSA-C. Brain diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) offers the potential for objective criteria in the diagnosis of MSA. We aim to develop an automatic method to segment out the abnormal whole brain area in MSA-C patients based on the 13-direction DWI raw data. The whole brain DWI raw data of fifteen normal subjects and nine MSA-C patients were analyzed. In this study, we proposed a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly based on the directional information of the DWI images, rather than using the parametric images, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as in the previous literatures. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering (HC) technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the HC-EM is effective in multi-tissue classification, namely, the cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and several areas of white matters, on the DWI raw data. The segmented patterns and the corresponding intensities of thirteen directions of the cerebellum in MSA-C patients showed the decrease of the anisotropy, which were evidently different from the results in normal subjects.

Then we concatenate the topic histograms over the cells at all levels to form a "long" vector, i.e. pyramid histogram of topics. Finally AdaBoost classifiers are used to select the topics most discriminative for class recognition. Experimental results on two diverse databases show that our method performs significantly better than general topic representation.

In this algorithm, the nonlinear relationship between training and testing mean vectors is approximated by a set of piecewise linear transformations. The PLT coefficients are estimated from adaptation data by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. The proposed algorithm could overcome the limitation of linear assumption in traditional transform-based adaptation algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient and outperforms the linear model adaptation algorithm.

In order for such models to be statistically meaningful, a large number of data sets have to be included. The number of available data sets is usually limited and often the data is corrupted by imaging artifacts or missing information. We propose a method for building a statistical shape model from such "lousy" data sets. The method works by identifying the corrupted parts of a shape as statistical Outliers and excluding these parts from the model. Only the parts of a shape that were identified as Outliers are discarded, while all the intact parts are included in the model. The model building is then performed using the EM algorithm for probabilistic principal component analysis, which allows for a principled way to handle missing data. Our experiments on 2D synthetic and real 3D medical data sets confirm the feasibility of the approach. We show that it yields superior models compared to approaches using robust statistics, which only downweight the influence of outliers.

Mixture modelling of densities is an efficient statistical pattern recognition method for continuous data. We propose a classifier based on the beta mixture models for strictly bounded and asymmetrically distributed data. Due to the property of the mixture modelling, the statistical dependence in a multi-dimensional variable is captured, even with the conditional independence assumption in each mixture component. A synthetic example and the USPS handwriting digit data was used to verify the effectiveness of this approach. Compared to the conventional Gaussian mixture models (GMM), the beta mixture models has a better performance on data which has strictly bounded value and asymmetric distribution. The performance of beta mixture models is about equivalent to that of GMM applied to data transformed via a strictly increasing link function.

We show that these restrictions on the Weibull mixtures correspond to different proportional hazard restrictions across mixture components and Web page areas. A parametric cluster approach based on the EM algorithm is carried out on a multivariate data set. Our model set-up encompasses incomplete-data structures as well as censoring observations.

Liver and Lesion Segmentation Algorithm for Contrast Enhanced CT Images	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Image segmentation; multi-phase analysis; Expectation-Maximization; contrast-enhanced computed tomography		Automatic liver segmentation is a crucial step for aiding in liver surgery and in diagnosing liver pathologies. Its goal is to identify the important anatomical structures as the liver segments, the vessel tree, present lesion and tumors. Nowadays, the current clinical practice is to use volumetric dynamic contrast enhanced computer tomography images, acquired before and after contrast agent injection. However, currently, liver computer aided diagnosis systems work with a single volumetric image, i.e. the volume exhibiting the best contrast enhancement. Therefore, the motivation of our work is to explore the gray-level enhancement in the different abdominal tissues and organs present in all acquired volumes (phases). The described method first brings into alignment all volumes. The segmentation combines an initial clustering approach with the EM algorithm to optimally fit a sum of multivariate Gaussian distributions to the multidimensional joint histogram. The segmentation is performed in an hierarchical way: the whole abdominal volume is segmented in the first step, the segmentation is applied only on the detected liver region in the second step and only at the individual lesions in the third step. We give a comparison of the segmentation results to the ground truth data obtained via manual segmentation by a radiologist. Experiments were performed on twenty-four dual-phase studies. The results show substantial improvement in the liver segmentation and a minor improvement in the lesion segmentation results, compared to single-phase segmentation.

First, it discusses the relationship between deformable contours and other Pattern Recognition algorithms (e.g., Kohonen maps, mean shift, fuzzy c-means) and derives a unified framework which allows a joint formulation for a wide set of methods. Afterwords, the paper addresses the estimation of deformable curves in cluttered images, assuming that there is a large number of outlier features detected in the image. The paper presents two robust algorithms: the adaptive snake for static objects and a robust tracker (S-PDAF) for moving objects in video sequences. The advantages of both algorithms with respect to classic methods are illustrated by examples.

This investigation of robust and high capacity print codes aims to maximize information payload in a given printed page area, subject to robustness to channel errors including distortions introduced by the printing and scanning processes and also due to (he usual degradations introduced by user manipulation of printed documents. The novel approach includes statistical print-and-scan channel characterization, designing of robust segmentation using visual cues, unsupervised Bayesian color classification with expectation-maximization algorithm for parameters estimation of a mixture of Gaussians model and design of error correction codes. Results illustrate the performance evaluated tinder real channel and distortions conditions.

It is seen that the proposed detection algorithm is efficient from complexity points of view.

This paper illustrates an evolution in state-of-the-art Speaker Verification by highlighting the contribution of recently established information theoretic based vector quantization technique. We explore the novel application of three different vector quantization algorithms, namely K-means, Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) and Information Theoretic Vector Quantization (ITVQ) for efficient speaker verification. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm used by GMM requires a prohibitive amount of iterations to converge. In this paper, comparable alternatives to EM including K-means, LBG and ITVQ algorithm were tested. The GMM-ITVQ algorithm was found to be the most efficient alternative for the GMM-EM It gives correct classification rates at a similar level to that of GMM-EM Finally, representative performance benchmarks and system behaviour experiments on NIST SRE corpora are presented.

In order to enhance the robustness against illumination changes in directions and intensities of the conventional tracking approaches, this paper proposes to apply color invariance theory to maneuvering target tracking. To depress the influence of the background, at the beginning of the process, we use expectation maximization algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Model to extract the objects from the environment. Then, instead of using the gray space or RGB space, frames are transformed to color invariant space based on Kubelka-Munk model, followed by the implementation of conventional tracking approach such as mean shift or particle filtering to track the targets. Experimental results show that mean shift and improved particle filtering with color invariance can achieve 64.1 and 16.0 frames per second correspondingly, which is real-time, and the proposed approach improves the robustness of maneuvering targets tracking greatly.

In this paper, we treat tracking as a binary classification problem and employ support vector machine to suppress the background. In order to enhance the robustness against illumination changes, we propose to combine color invariance with traditional RGB values to train the SVM. First, we use expectation maximization algorithm to extract the target from the environment; then, RGB and color invariance values are used to train SVM. In the incoming frames, pixels in regions of interest are classified by SVM and the confidence map is produced, which will afterward be used by traditional tracking approach to track the target, in this paper, we employ particle filter. Experimental results on challenging sequences validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in cluttered background target tracking.

The recent introduction of quantum mechanics principles into PSO has given rise to a Quantum behaviour PSO (QPSO) algorithm. This paper investigates its application into motif discovery, a challenging task in bio-informatics and molecular biology. Given a set of input DNA sequences, the proposed framework acts as a search process where a population of particles is depicted by a quantum behavior. Each particle represents a set of regulatory patterns from which a consensus pattern or motif model is derived. The corresponding fitness function is related to the total number of pairwise matches between nucleotides in the input sequences. Experiment results on synthetic and real data are very promising and prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The mouse was injected with a Na (125)I solution with a total activity of 31.8 MBq. The planar projections for SPECT reconstruction were acquired with a 300 mu m tungsten pinhole (magnification 1.47 and a Field of View - FoV - of 9.6x9.6 mm(2)). The projections have been captured in a step-and shoot fashion by rotating the detector around the animal holder. To obtain the SPECT image all the projections are elaborated with a C++ software based on ordered subsets-expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction algorithm, developed by our group. Test images for assessing the MediSPECT scanner spatial resolution have been also acquired using phantoms and are also presented in this wok. The measured spatial resolution with a 300 mu m pinhole is, in planar imaging, about 500 mu m and, in tomographic imaging, better than 900 mu m. The modular structure of MediSPECT allows for multimodal imaging: at present, a Fluorescence Reflectance Imaging head has been installed, for planar optical imaging in addition to SPECT imaging.

The most successful models have been the mixtures of Gaussians in the states of the hidden Markov models to generate/capture observations. In this work we show how graphical models can be used to extract the joint information of more than two features. This is possible if we previously quantize the speech features to a small number of levels and model them as discrete random variables. In this paper it is shown a method to estimate a graphical model with a bounded number of dependencies, which is a subset of the directed acyclic graph based model framework, Bayesian networks. Some experimental results have been obtained with mixtures of graphical models compared to baseline systems using mixtures of Gaussians with full and diagonal covariance matrices.

The concept of reliability is frequently seen as being one of the least controlled points and for some as being the critical point. Since these systems are very complex to study, the evaluation of their reliability is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a global method to estimate the mechatronic system reliability using operating field data. Since we have a small amount of data, we use an estimation method called Bayesian Restoration Maximization (BRM) method, thus increasing the estimation accuracy. The BRM method needs to define some prior knowledge. For this purpose, we propose to define the prior distribution using a Monte-Carlo simulation based on stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) model and on the operating field data. The stochastic PN model describes the functional and dysfunctional behaviours. In this study, we deal with the case of n repairable systems until a deterministic censoring time (for example, this censoring time may be the warranty period of an ABS system). We consider repair as the replacement of the failing component by an identical one in the case of electronic and mechanical subsystem and in the case of software, the default is rectified on all the subsystems. We simulate the failures times and we compute the confidence interval. The proposed method allows reliability evaluating both for n mechatronic systems and for their different subsystems.

SEMISUPERVISED MIXTURE MODELING WITH FINE-GRAINED COMPONENT-CONDITIONAL CLASS LABELING AND TRANSDUCTIVE INFERENCE	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE		Semisupervised learning; transductive inference; mixture models; nearest neighbor classification; Expectation-Maximization	EM; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	This paper introduces a new generative semisupervised (transductive) mixture model with a more fine-grained class label generation mechanism than that of previous works. Our approach effectively combines the advantages of standard semisupervised mixtures, which achieve label extrapolation over a mixture component when there are few labeled samples, and nearest-neighbor (NN) classification, which achieves accurate classification in the local vicinity of labeled samples. Toward this end, we propose a two-stage stochastic data generation mechanism, with the unlabeled samples first produced and then the labeled samples generated conditioned on both the unlabeled data and on their components of origin. This nested data generation entails a more complicated (albeit still closed-form) E-step evaluation than that for standard mixtures. Our model is advantageous, compared with previous semisupervised mixtures, when mixture components model data from more than one class and when within-component class proportions are not constant over the feature space region "owned" by a component. Experiments demonstrate gains in classification accuracy over both the previous semisupervised mixture of experts model and over K-NN classification on data sets from the UC Irvine Repository.

One of the major drawbacks for reliable forecasts have been the use of training algorithms that are unable to account for model uncertainty and noise in data. We propose a probabilistic training algorithm based on the Expectation Maximization framework for parameterization of the model which makes use of a forward filtering and backward smoothing Expectation step, and a Maximization step in which the model uncertainty and measurement noise estimates are computed. Through numerical experimentation it is shown that the proposed model allows for reliable forecasts and also outperforms other neural time series models trained with the Extended Kalman Filter, and gradient descent learning.

When learning such models by way of Expectation-Maximisation algorithms, arbitrary choices must be made for their initial parameters. Often, solutions for the selection of the initial parameters are based on random functions. However, in this paper, we argue that deterministic alternatives are preferable, and propose various methods. Experiments on a video dataset prove that the deterministic initialization is capable of achieving an accuracy that is comparable to or above the average from random initializations and suffers from no deviation thanks to its deterministic nature. The methods proposed naturally extend to be used with other graphical models such as dynamic Bayesian networks and conditional random fields.

MediSPECT is based on a fine pitch CdTe pixel detector, operating in single photon counting, (14x14 mm(2), 256x256 square pixel of 55 mu m side) and equipped with a high resolution collimators set. The 72 planar projections of a mouse thyroid (injected activity 31.8 MBq) for SPECT reconstruction have been acquired using a 300 mu m tungsten pinhole (magnification 1.47 and a FoV of 9.6x9.6 mm(2)). A C software based on Ordered Subsets-Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm has been used for SPECT reconstructions. The spatial resolution with the 300 mu m pinhole is, in planar imaging, about 0.5 mm and, in tomographic imaging, about 1 mm. The MediSPECT scanner has a modular structure that allows for multimodal imaging: at present, a Fluorescence Reflectance Imaging head has been installed, for planar optical imaging in addition to SPECT imaging.

It is known that input and output variables do not follow the Gaussian distribution in load forecasting. In this paper, a hybrid method of Graphical Modeling (GM) and Deterministic Annealing Expectation Maximization (DAEM) clustering is presented to clarify causal relationship between the explained one-step-ahead electric load and the explanatory variables. GM is effective for estimating the relationship between variables with the Gaussian distribution. The DAEM algorithm is used to decompose non-Gaussian data into clusters of Gaussian data so that GM is applied to Gaussian data in clusters. The proposed method is successfully applied to the real data.

Here, a multiscale approach is proposed, in which observations at coarser and finer scales are jointly exploited, and a multiscale contextual unsupervised change-detection method is developed for optical images. Discrete wavelet transforms are applied to extract multiscale features that discriminate changed and unchanged areas and Markovian data fusion is used to integrate both these features and the spatial contextual information in the change-detection process. Unsupervised statistical learning methods (expectation-maximization and Besag's algorithms) are used to estimate the model parameters.

Blindly Mixing Matrix Estimation of Speech Source Signals Using Short Time-Wavelet Packet Analysis by Laplacian Model in Over-Complete Cases	2009 IEEE 9TH MALAYSIA INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (MICC)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE Malaysia International Conference on Communications	DEC 15-17, 2009	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc Malaysia Chapter, VTS, IWDTV, UPM, Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Uni Tenaga Natl		ICA; CWT; DWT; BSS; WPD; Laplacian Model; Expectation Maximization; Wavelet Packets; Short Time analysis; Over-complete; Blind Source Separation; Speech Processing	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SOURCE SEPARATION; REPRESENTATION	Wavelet packets decompose signals in to broader components using linear spectral bisecting. Mixing matrix is the key issue in the Blind Source Separation (BSS) literature especially in under-determined cases. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel method in short time wavelet packet analysis to estimate blindly the mixing matrix of speech signals from noise free linear mixtures in over-complete cases. In this paper, the Laplacian model is considered in short time-wavelet packets and is applied to each histogram of packets. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to train the model and calculate the model parameters. It is shown that complexity of computation of model is decreased and consequently the speed of convergence is increased.	[Mozaffari, B.; Tinati, M.

MEDITOMO: a high performance software package for 3D SPECT imaging	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS			English	Article						medical imaging; inverse problems; parallel algorithms; edge-preserving regularization; mathematical software	ALGORITHM	We describe a parallel software library, named MEDITOMO, designed for processing MEDIcal images obtained by SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) TOMOgraphic systems. MEDITOMO is the core library of the PSE (problem solving environment) MEDIGRID, oriented to medical imaging analysis, which the authors are currently developing. MEDIGRID is employed in a Grid-computing infrastructure involving clinical departments and research institutes. The algorithms of MEDITOMO are the standard ones that are usually applied in the SPECT analysis, i.e. the conjugate gradient and the expectation maximization. The main contribution of this work concerns the introduction of the total variation seminorm as the edge-preserving regularization in both algorithms and the development of the parallel software library. Experiments carried out on synthetic and clinical data are shown.

The proposed method consists of mainly three steps, namely skull removal, image segmentation and volume calculation. The present method uses morphological operations followed by 3D connected component labeling and image subtraction for extracting the brain mask from the original brain slices. The skull stripped images are then segmented into the three tissues namely Gray Matter, White Matter and Cerebrospinal fluid using an efficient clustering technique namely, Weighted k-means clustering algorithm followed by Expectation Maximization algorithm. Finally the volume of the segmented tissues is calculated using Cavalier's estimator of morphometric volume method and some sample results are presented. The proposed method gives reliable results for making quantitative analysis and diagnosis of tissues from Magnetic Resonance brain image slices.

Trajectories performed by natural objects (e.g., people, animals) typically depend on the position of each object in the scene and can change in an unpredictable way. Despite this diversity, there is often a small number of typical motion patterns based on which it is possible to explain all the observed trajectories. To achieve this goal, we model each of these motion patterns using a motion field and allow objects to switch between fields in a space-varying, possible probabilistic, way. Our approach provides a space-dependent motion model which can be estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments with both synthetic and real data are presented to illustrate the ability of the proposed approach in modeling different motion patterns.

This paper proposes a new approach based on modeling trajectories using a bank of vector (velocity) fields. We assume that each trajectory is generated by one of a set of fields or by the concatenation of trajectories produced by different fields. The proposed approach constitutes a space-varying framework for trajectory modeling and is able to discriminate among different types of motion regimes. Furthermore, the vector fields can be efficiently learned from observed trajectories using an expectation-maximization algorithm. An experiment with real data illustrates the promising performance of the method.	[Nascimento, Jacinto C.; Figueiredo, Mario A.

The underlying mixing model is linear, meaning that each pixel is a linear mixture of the endmembers signatures weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions. The proposed method, as DECA, is tailored to highly mixed mixtures in which the geometric based approaches fail to identify the simplex of minimum volume enclosing the observed spectral vectors. We resort then to a statitistical framework, where the abundance fractions are modeled as mixtures of Dirichlet densities, thus enforcing the constraints on abundance fractions imposed by the acquisition process, namely non-negativity and constant sum. With respect to DECA, we introduce two improvements: 1) the number of Dirichlet modes are inferred based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle; 2) The generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm we adopt to infer the model parameters is improved by using alternating minimization and augmented Lagrangian methods to compute the mixing matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with simulated and read data.	[Nascimento, Jose M.

We generalize the expectation-maximization (EM) method to create a quasi EM algorithm for localization under lognormal shadowing.

As a result, such sequences are usually written in a degenerated alphabet where some symbols may correspond to several possible letters (ex: IUPAC DNA alphabet). When counting patterns in such degenerated sequences, the question that naturally arises is: how to deal with degenerated positions ? Since most (usually 99%) of the positions are riot degenerated, it is considered harmless to discard the degenerated positions in order to get an observation, but the exact consequences of such a practice are unclear. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous method to take into account the uncertainty of sequencing for biological sequences (DNA, Proteins). We first, introduce a Forward-Backward approach to compute the marginal distribution of the constrained sequence and use it both to pet-form a Expectation-Maximization estimation of parameters, as well as deriving a heterogeneous Markov distribution for tire constrained sequence. This distribution is hence used along with known DFA-based pattern approaches to obtain the exact distribution of the pattern count under the constraints. As art illustration, we consider a EST dataset from the EMBL database. Despite the fact that only 1% of the positions in this dataset, are degenerated, we show that riot taking into account, these positions might lead to erroneous observations, further proving the interest of our approach.

The RVS model provides one of the generalized modeling frameworks to unify several of existing software reliability models described as non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NHPPs). The proposed EM algorithm gives a numerically stable procedure to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of RYS models. In particular, we focus on an RVS model based on a mixture of exponential distributions. As an illustrative example, we also derive a concrete EM algorithm for the well-known Musa-Okumoto logarithmic Poisson execution time model by applying our result.

In fact, these spaces contain much redundancy and it becomes crucial to reduce the dimensionality of the data to improve analysis, density modeling, and classification. In this paper, we present a method for dimensionality reduction in mixture models and its use in classification. For each component of the mixture, the data are projected by a linear transformation onto a lower-dimensional space. Subsequently, the projection matrices and the densities in such compressed spaces are learned by means of an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, two main issues arise as a result of implementing tins approach, namely: 1) the scale of the densities can be different across the mixture components and 2) a. singularity problem may occur. We suggest solutions to these problems and validate the proposed method on three image data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The classification performance is compared with that of a mixture of probabilistic principal component analysers (MPPCA). Across the three data sets, our accuracy always compares favourably, with improvements ranging from 2.5% to 35.4%.

The service terms, such as price and time to completion of the service, depend on the consumer's particular specifications. For instance, a printing services provider would need from its customers specifications such as the size of paper, type of ink, proofing and perforation. In a few sectors, there exist marketplace sites that provide consumers with specifications forms, which the consumer can fill out to learn the service terms of multiple service providers. Unfortunately, there are only a few such marketplace sites, and they cover a few sectors. At HP Labs, we are working towards building a universal marketplace site, i.e., a marketplace site that covers thousands of sectors and hundreds of providers per sector. One issue in this domain is the automated discovery/retrieval of the specifications for each sector. We address it through extracting and analyzing content from the websites of the service providers listed in business directories. The challenge is that each service provider is often listed under multiple service categories in a business directory, making it infeasible to utilize standard supervised learning techniques. We address this challenge through employing a multilabel statistical clustering approach within an expectation-maximization framework. We implement our solution to retrieve specifications for 3000 sectors, representing more than 300,000 service providers. We discuss our results within the context of the services needed to design a marketing campaign for a small business.

The detection and estimation algorithm is based on the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) technique which is particularly well-suited to multicarrier signal formats. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, we apply the cosine orthogonal basis functions to describe the time-varying channel. It is shown that, depending on the normalized Doppler frequency, only a small number of expansion coefficients is sufficient to approximate the channel perfectly and there is no need to know the correlation function of the input signal. The proposed SAGE joint detection algorithm updates the data sequences in serial and the channel parameters are updated in parallel, leading to a receiver structure that also incorporates a partial interference cancelation of the interchannel interference. Computer simulations show that the cosine transformation represents the time-varying channel very effectively and the proposed algorithm has excellent symbol error rate and channel estimation performance even with a very small number of channel expansion coefficients employed in the algorithm, resulting in reduction of the computational complexity substantially.

The marginal likelihood of the unknown parameters, averaged over the data sequence, as well as the expectation and maximization steps of the SAGE algorithm are derived analytically. To implement the proposed algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, called Gibbs sampling, is employed to compute the a posteriori probabilities of data symbols in a computationally efficient way.

Theoretically calculated PSFs often lack the experimental or microscope specific signatures while empirically obtained data are either over sized or (and) too noisy. The effect of noise and the influence of the microsphere size can be mitigated from the experimental data by using a Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm. The true experimental parameters can then be estimated by fitting the result to a model based on the scalar diffraction theory with lower order Spherical Aberration (SA). The algorithm was tested on some simulated data and the results obtained validate the usefulness of the approach for retrieving the PSF from measured data.

Randomized controlled experiments are often used to determine which content produces more learning in an ITS. While these experiments are powerful they are often very costly to setup and run, The majority of data collected in many ITS systems consist of answers to a finite set of questions of a given skill often presented in a random sequence. We propose a Bayesian method to detect which questions produce the most learning in this random sequence of data. We confine our analysis to random sequences with four questions. A student simulation study was run to investigate the validity of the method and boundaries on what learning probability differences could be reliably detected with various numbers of users. Finally, real tutor data from random sequence problem sets was analyzed. Results of the simulation data analysis showed that the method reported high reliability ill its choice of the best learning question in 89 of the 160 simulation experiments with seven experiments where all incorrect conclusion was reported as reliable (p < 0.05). In the analysis of real student data, the method returned statistically reliable choices of best question in three out of seven problem sets.

First, we segment given medical volume data using a fast matching and geometric deformable model and extract a surface of an object from the segmented volume data. Second, we use the hidden Markov random field model and the pseudo-likelihood method to statistically model the intensity distribution of each voxel at the surface region. We adopt the Bernoulli probability model to formulate a prior distribution of the labeling variable for the transformed voxels. The Gaussian mixture model is taken as a probability distribution function for the intensity of the transformed voxel. We use the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM algorithm to get the proper estimators for the parameters of the complete-data log likelihood function. Then, we define a new registration measure with the maximization function, called Q-function, obtained by the DAEM algorithm. We evaluate the precision of the proposed approach by comparing the registration traces of our measure with other measures such as Mutual Information or Cross Correlation for the original image and its transformed image with respect to translation and rotation. The experimental results show that our method has great potential power to segment and register various medical images given by different modalities.

Residuals with systematical errors are non-normally distributed. To improve orbit precision with systematic errors, parameterizing systematic errors and finding the corresponding parameters is feasible, but this strategy has the disadvantages of over-parameterization and ill-conditioned normal equations, and make the object of improving precision inefficient. In this paper, systematic errors are regarded as missing values with the priori knowledge of two order random walks and constructed as a complete likelihood problem together with observations. All the parameters and missing values are found from the EM algorithm. Applying this model and EM algorithm into the practical orbit determination of Xinluo satellite shows that the suggested model and algorithm is feasible and the precise of orbit is improved.

Typically, a mixture of static and Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras is used. Modern systems task PTZ cameras as a consequence of particular events needing further investigation; anyhow, the configuration of the network can be considered fixed and determined at the moment of deployment. In this work, we deal with a problem that has not yet been widely addressed: how a network can automatically change its configuration to enhance the monitoring capabilities. In particular, we propose a novel network reconfiguration algorithm that, given a map of activities, configures the Pan, Tilt and Zoom parameters of all the cameras in order to improve the detection. A spherical model to project all the activities in the monitored area with respect to the optical centre of each camera is introduced. Such a model leads to an optimization problem that can be solved by means of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and whose solutions are the new Pan, Tilt and Zoom values for each PTZ camera. Experimental results will be proposed with both synthetic and real data to show how the proposed algorithm can be applied to different cases.	[Piciarelli, C.; Micheloni, C.; Foresti, G.

Unlike many previous recommenders, our approach is content-based. We assume that for each context, a user has a different set of preference weights which are linked by a common, "generic context" set of weights. The approach uses Expectation Maximization (EM) to estimate both the generic context weights and the context specific weights. This improves upon many current recommender systems that do not incorporate context into the recommendations they provide. In this paper, we show that by considering contextual information, we can improve our recommendations, demonstrating that it is useful to consider context in giving ratings. Because the approach does not rely on connecting users via collaborative filtering, users are able to interpret contexts in different ways and invent their own contexts.

When the target maneuvers, the quality of the state estimates provided by the constant velocity filter can degrade significantly. Unknown target acceleration during the maneuver appears as excessive process noise on the target model and the noise variance changes drastically. In this paper, the authors propose a new fuzzy logic based algorithm for Bearing Only Tracking (BOT) for a maneuvering target tracking. The unknown target acceleration is regarded as additive process noise, and the time-varying variance of the overall process noise is computed using a fuzzy system as a universal approximator. The bearing error distribution is represented as a mixture of Gaussians by Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM), and the fuzzy rule base system is designed using the parameters of the mixture components. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is utilised to learn the GMM parameters. We have demonstrated a fast tracking of maneuvering target with only one filter, using this proposed method.

They constitute a versatile modelling tool in many circumstances. The size of their matrix representation has a strong influence on computational efforts needed when analyzing these distributions. This representation, however, is not unique, and two representations of the same distribution can differ drastically in size. This paper explores an effective algorithm to reduce the size of the matrix representation without altering the distribution. This proceeds via a symbolic representation of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the phase-type distribution. The algorithm is of cubic complexity in the size of the given representation. We clarify the circumstances under which the algorithm returns a minimal representation, and discuss in how far it can keep representations minimal when they are constructed via any of three operations-convolution, minimum, and maximum. A case study modelling delay propagation in railway networks demonstrates the practicality of the approach.

The channel estimation consists of two parts. Firstly, we use pilot-symbol-aided (PSA) method to interpolate the channel, and get the initial channel estimation of the systems. Then, with Turbo iterative decoding, we feedback the information bits to the channel estimator and the EM algorithm is used for iterative channel estimation. The simulation results show that the channel estimation performance of the systems is improved greatly as the number of iterations increases.

We have hypothesized that given the varied positron ranges in different mediums such as lung, blood and bone, incorporation of such differences could lead to further improved image qualities and clinical and quantitative tasks. In fact, we have quantified the relationship between the distribution of positrons annihilated in a certain medium and the amount by which 511keV photons are attenuated in that medium. Subsequently, we have shown that it is possible to utilize mu-map images generated from transmission or CT imaging to arrive at so-called C-maps and a-maps that describe how positrons are annihilated in the field-of-view. Using Monte-Carlo simulation of Rb-82 myocardial perfusion imaging, we showed that while the extension from space-invariant to space-variant modeling of Rb-82 positron range showed certain improvements in myocardial defect contrast, when taking the relation between the lung and the myocardium into account, very significant qualitative and quantitative improvements were obtained.

The denoising process is spatially adaptive and also sub-band adaptive. To render the denoising algorithm space adaptive, a Vector Quantization (VQ)-based algorithm is used. The design of the VQ is based on Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results of the algorithm is demonstrated on SAR images corrupted by speckle noise. Experimental results show that Custom thresholding function outperforms the traditional soft, hard, and Bayes threshoding functions, improving the denoised results significantly in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Once detected, a monochrome page can be processed as such, which can improve image quality, print speed, and save color-printing supplies. The presented algorithm processes the RGB color data captured with the CIS scan bar for a given scan band and keeps track of color information across all scan bands moving down the page. The colorfulness of every pixel in the scan bands is derived from the Cb and Cr channels after color conversion from the RGB to the YCbCr space. A pixel is classified as color if its colorfulness value is greater than a predetermined device and media specific threshold. This threshold is found by modeling the cumulative colorfulness histogram of a number of scanned test documents using a mixture of two Gaussian distributions and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. For every scan band, the highest concentration of color pixels is saved, and later used to classify, the page content as either color or monochrome.

Printing monochrome or black text as a color object will cause the text to appear too light, blurred, or having objectionable color hues. In this paper, we present a method to improve the appearance of black and monochrome text when copied on a color multi function printer (MFP), by detecting the presence of monochrome text characters in documents containing monochrome and color content. Initially, the scanned image is segmented into text, image, and background classes. This step is based on the analysis of edge, texture, and geometrical pixel-level features extracted at different scales. Once detected, text regions are analyzed for their chromatic content in order to discern whether the text is colored or merely a color scan of black text.

In order to overcome the drawback of subjective fixed threshold of traditional temporal segmentation, the difference image is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian distributions and a novel method to decide the model size and initial parameters of GMM is proposed. Then the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is fulfilled to obtain the Gaussian parameters and temporal moving area is detected; Considering the lack of traditional spatial segmentation algorithm of watershed, an improved watershed algorithm in accord with the human vision characteristics is proposed, it can restrain over-segmentation effectively; the temporal and spatial information fusion is fulfilled by ratio operation, and the video moving objects are obtained. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.

Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims to automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class given the observed feature values of the document, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. EM is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming, but using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in the learning and classification process.	[Roncero, V. G.; Costa, M. C.

While this is approximately true for voxels having large intensities, it is less true as the underlying intensity becomes smaller. In this paper, the Gaussian model is replaced with a Rician model, which is a better approximation to the observed signal. A new classification algorithm based on a finite mixture model of Rician signals is presented wherein the expectation maximization algorithm is used to find the joint maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown mixture parameters. Improved accuracy of tissue classification is demonstrated on several sample data sets. It is also shown that classification repeatability for the same subject under different MR acquisitions is improved using the new method.

Given a high spatial resolution & low spectral resolution PAN (Panchromatic) image and a low spatial resolution & high spectral resolution MS (Multispectral) images of the same geographical area, the objective is to enhance the spatial resolution of the MS images to that of the PAN image i.e. to obtain a high spatial and spectral resolution images. A proper regularization technique is required to address this ill posed problem and get a better solution. We first segment the PAN Image using GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) and extract AR (auto-regressive) parameters for each of the regions. We use a non-homogeneous AR model based prior for each of the fused MS images. The AR parameters, estimated from the PAN image are used in minimizing the cost function to obtain the high spatial resolution MS images. Expenmental results are illustrated for Landsat-7 data set.

This model was proposed by Aoki et al. (2003b) and analyzed under the bayesian approach. In this article, considering the classical approach, we analyze asymptotic test statistics and present a simulation study to compare the behavior of the three test statistics for different sample sizes, parameter values and nominal levels of the test. Also, closed form expressions for the score function and the Fisher information matrix are presented.

This algorithm is used for density estimation and clustering of data distributed over nodes of a network. Scalability and fault tolerance are two important advantages of this method. In the E-step of this algorithm, each node calculates local sufficient statistics using its local observations. A peer-to-peer algorithm is then used to diffuse local sufficient statistics to neighboring nodes and estimate global sufficient statistics in each node. In the M-step, each node updates parameters of the Gaussian mixture model using the estimated global sufficient statistics. The proposed method is then used for environmental monitoring and also distributed target classification. Simulation results approve promising performance of this algorithm.

However the computation time of the EM algorithm and its variants increases significantly with the sample size. For large data sets, performing clustering on grouped data constitutes an efficient alternative to speed up the algorithms execution time. A rapid and effective algorithm dedicated to grouped data clustering is then proposed in this paper. Inspired by the Classification EM algorithm (CEM), the, proposed approach estimates the missing sample at each iteration.

In this work, a novel hybridized algorithm is developed for reconstructing the extracted contour lines from color topographic map. The extraction of contour lines from a topographic map leads to broken contour lines due to inherent characteristics of the map, thus posing a challenging problem of identifying gaps and then filling them. This has been addressed by developing algorithms based on connected components, graph theory, Expectation Maximization (EM and numerical methods. Our algorithm operates by isolating the segments of those contours which have gaps and achieves in reducing the complexity of the matching of such segments by employing the EM algorithm. We also present a new scheme of filling gaps present in thick contours without the application of thinning algorithms.	[Sandhya, B.; Agarwal, Arun; Rao, C.

Multi-Slice SPECT Attenuation and Scatter Correction Using Monte Carlo Simulated System Matrices	2008 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (2008 NSS/MIC), VOLS 1-9	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 19-25, 2008	Dresden, GERMANY	IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, Natl Nucl Secur Adm, US Def Threat Reduct Agcy, ICx Radiat GmbH, ORTEC, Hamamatsu, European Phys Journal, Hilger Crystals, SAFC Hitech, ATOMTEX, Canberra, SensL, ASP, Brookhaven Natl Lab, CEA, CERN, DESY, Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab				Specifying the system matrix is one of the most important processes in computed tomography. For SPECT, the imaging physics can be very difficult to model and approximations are made which result in mismatch between the model and the data. In a move toward better modeling the physics, we developed a Monte Carlo method for specifying the system matrix for small animal imaging (but is also applicable for human imaging). A study was performed using the computer-generated MOBY rat phantom. This phantom returns a high resolution (0.90 mm) transmission map, which was used in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate attenuation and scatter. System matrices were estimated for the reconstruction of 6 heart slices from projections of 6 detector rows. SimSET was used to model 3 system matrices for each of the following: no attenuation and no scatter, attenuation only, and attenuation and scatter, For each slice, the system matrices had 4096=64x64 columns each representing a sinogram from a different source voxel in the slice. SimSET simulated 10(6) counts for each source voxel. Each simulated 140 keV photon was forced to be detected on one of the 180 parallel projections evenly spaced over 360 degrees. The system matrices also modeled spillover to account for the scatter from outside the 6 heart slices. For the reconstruction, projections were simulated using SimSET (10(12) total counts) to estimate the projection of the 6 slices including scatter from outside the 6 slices. These projections were reconstructed using the estimated system matrices and using 50 iterations of the ML-EM algorithm. There was a 20% increase of average intensity over the heart region with attenuation correction compared to without attenuation correction and a 3.5% decrease from the attenuation corrected result after scatter + attenuation correction. Attenuation correction reconstruction alone, overestimated the original by 3.3%. The results suggest that for quantitative small animal imaging it is important to correct for both attenuation and scatter when using radiolabeled tracers that emit 140 keV photons. This is even more true for radiolabeled tracers that emit 27.5 keV photons as both attenuation and scatter are more important at that lower energy.

In these cases standard reconstruction methods (OSEM, EM, filtered backprojection) deliver unsatisfactory and noisy results. Here, we propose to introduce nonlinear variational methods into the reconstruction process to make an efficient use of a-priori information and to attain improved imaging results. We illustrate our technique by evaluating cardiac H(2) (15)O measurements.

Cancer diagnosis via ESR (Electron-Spin-Resonance) spectroscopy of albumin found in human blood provides a new promising approach. The ESR frontend signal processing follows a protocol of our proprietary 'mobility of molecular structure test' (MMS-Test) and provides a real-valued 33-dimensional vector representation per sample, which combines a representative feature set of the binding ability (spin-probes) of albumin under investigation. Classical statistical pattern recognition is then applied to the feature vector, including LDA and EM mixture density estimation, leading to a classification error rate of 14% between the two patient classes 'healthy' and 'suspect'. The class 'suspect' includes cancer and other chronic condition. The investigation was performed on a proprietary database of MedInnovation with 1176 cancer and non-cancer patients.

The GSF uses vehicle relative vision-based measurements of known map features coupled with inertial navigation solutions to accomplish localization in the absence of GPS. The vision-based measurements are shown to have multi-modal measurement likelihood functions that are well represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian densities and the GSF is ideally suited to accomplish recursive Bayesian state estimation for this problem. A sequential merging technique is used for Gaussian mixture condensation in the posterior density approximation after fusing multi-modal measurements in the GSF to maintain mixture size over time. The representation of the posterior density with the GSF is compared over a common dataset against a benchmark particle filter solution. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used offline to determine the representational efficiency of the particle filter in terms of an effective number of Gaussian densities. The GSF with vision-based vehicle relative measurements is shown to remain converged using 37 minutes of recorded data from the Cornell University DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC) autonomous vehicle in an urban environment that includes a 32 minute GPS blackout.

This method allows avoiding the so-called small sample size problem in the construction of a CAD system that performs the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). First we generate an image that holds the differences between normal and AD subjects and then, we model the ROIs from this image by using GMM and the Expectation Maximization algorithm. These regions are used to select a reduced set of features from the activation map of each patient and allow us to train statistical classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have tested this approach on a SPECT images database and the accuracy rate achieved by the CAD system was 94.5%. This value significantly improves the results obtained by previously developed approaches.	[Segovia, F.; Gorriz, J. M.; Ramirez, J.; Salas-Gonzalez, D.; Illan, I.

In order to easily handle the admissibility constraints inherent to Stokes images, a proper transformation of the images is introduced. This transformation exploits the correspondence between any Stokes vector and the covariance matrix of the two components of the electric vector of the light wave. A Bayesian model based on a mixture of Gaussian kernels is used for the transformed images. Inference is achieved using the EM framework. To quantify the performances of this approach, the algorithm is tested with both synthetic and real data. We note that the pixels of the restored Stokes images issued from our approach are always physically admissible which is not the case for the naive pseudoinverse approach.

However solution of MRF-based models is heavily dependent on how successfully the MRF energy minimization is performed. In this framework, two methodologies, complementary to each other, are proposed for random field optimization. We address the special class of models comprising a random field imposed on the probabilities of the pixel labels. This class of segmentation models poses a special optimization problem, as, in this case, the variables constituting the MRF are continuous and subject to probability constraints (positivity, sum-to-unity). The proposed methods are evaluated numerically in terms of objective function value and segmentation performance, and compare favorably to existing corresponding optimization schemes.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of a damped MLEM (dMLEM) algorithm with a modified likelihood function [White R.L., J.SPIE Records, 2198, pp. 1342-1348, 1994] using simulated SPECT data. In particular, a trade-off between artifact suppression and quantitative accuracy of images is of our special interest. In our experiments, both noiseless and noisy numeric phantom data were created. Small cylindrical object with a 5cm diameter was located off-center in a large cylinder having a diameter of 16cm. Acquisition parameters were selected to model a typical SPECT clinical protocol. The images were reconstructed using both dMLEM (with two flattering parameters N=2 and N=3) and a conventional MLEM (corresponding to N=0) algorithm with up to 100 iterations. The modification of the likelihood function in dMLEM led to the suppression of both ringing and noise artifacts. This effect strongly depends on the damping parameter N. With increasing of N, the appearance of artifacts is delayed in the iteration process, but also the quantitative accuracy of images is degraded. Our simulations showed that slight damping of likelihood function in MLEM algorithm might serve as a reasonable tradeoff by allowing users for the suppression of artifacts while preserving the quantitative accuracy at an acceptable level. Especially, dMLEM method with N=2 allowed us to improve reconstruction convergence and avoid ringing artifacts in the first 20-30 iterations while quantitative accuracy of the recovered activity was degraded by only 3-4%.

As the manual inspection time of TFT-LCD manufacturing could range from 4 hours to I day, the reliability of time forecasting is thus important for production planning, scheduling and customer response. This study would like to propose a practical and easy-to-implement prediction model through the approach of Bayesian networks for time estimation of manual operated procedures in TFT-LCD manufacturing. Given the lack of prior knowledge about manual operation time, algorithms of necessary path condition and expectation-maximization are used for structural learning and estimation of conditional probability distributions respectively. This study also applied Bayesian inference to evaluate the relationships between explanatory variables and manual operation time. With the empirical applications of this proposed forecasting model, approach of Bayesian networks demonstrates its practicability and prediction accountability.

J	Shen, PS				Shen, Pao-Sheng			Semiparametric estimation of the occurrence rate for prevalent survival data in competing risk models	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						EM algorithm; maximum likelihood estimation; occurrence probabilities	NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION	In many follow-up studies, the problem of interest is the estimation of occurrence probabilities based on prevalent data in competing risks models. Let [image omitted] and [image omitted] denote the lifetimes of two competing risks that can be dependent on each other. Let V* and C* denote left truncation and right censoring variables, respectively. Assume that ([image omitted], [image omitted]) and (V*, C*) are independent of each other but V* and C* are dependent with P(C*epsilon V*) = 1. For left-truncated and right-censored data, one can observe nothing if [image omitted], and observe (X*, *), if Z*epsilon V*, where X* = min (Z*, C*) and * is equal to one if [image omitted], equal to two if [image omitted] and zero otherwise. Let 1 (x) and 2(x) denote the occurence probability of [image omitted] and [image omitted], respectively. Huang and Wang [Y. Huang and M.-C. Wang, Estimating the occurrence of rate for prevalent survival date in competing risk models, J. AM. Statist. Assoc. 90(432) (1995), pp. 1406-1415.] derive the maximum likelihood estimates of k(x) (k = 1, 2) under nonparametric and length-biased (i.e. V* is uniformly distributed and C* = ) models. In this article, we extend previous models by considering the case when the distribution of V* is parameterized as G(x; ) and the distributions of [image omitted] and C* are left unspecified. Several iterative algorithms are proposed to obtain the semiparametric estimates (denoted by k (x; n) of k (x) (k = 1, 2). The asymptotic properties of k (x; n) are discussed. The simulation results show that the semiparametric estimators k (x; n) have smaller mean-squared errors compared to the nonparametric estimators of k (k = 1, 2).

The Bayesian method is a statistical technique for estimating reliable predictive distributions by marginalizing model parameters. However, the local maxima problem in the Bayesian method is more serious than in the ML-based approach, because the Bayesian method treats not only state sequences but also model parameters as latent variables. The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm has been proposed to improve the local maxima problem in the EM algorithm, and its effectiveness has been reported in HMM-based speech recognition using ML criterion. In this paper, the DAEM algorithm is applied to Bayesian speech recognition to relax the local maxima problem. Speech recognition experiments show that the proposed method achieved a higher performance than the conventional methods.

The total-variation (TV) minimization and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are compared on synthetic data derived from a breast phantom. These algorithms are compared for 11-view data sets covering 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. For images resulting from truncating the iteration number at 10, it appears that TV-minimization for the 30 degrees scan yields the highest contrast for mu calc imaging.

We retrospectively studied SPECT/CT scans of 44 consecutive patients with clinical indications of Parkinson's disease. Images were reconstructed with use of two methods: filtered back projection and OSEM. Image quality was assessed by: striatal binding indices as a measure of contrast and coefficients of variation as a measure of noise. The quality of DaTSCAN images reconstructed with the use of OSEM (4iter/10subs) with reconstruction corrections was superior to that provided by the commonly applied FBP.

In fact, feature selection for clustering is a challenging task due to the absence of class labels for guiding the search for relevant features. The methods proposed for addressing this problem are mostly focused on numerical data. In this work, we propose an approach to selecting categorical features in clustering.

But NIDSs trigger a massive amount of alerts even for a day and overwhelmed security experts. Thus, automated and intelligent clustering is important to reveal their structural correlation by grouping alerts with common attributes. We propose a new hybrid clustering model based on Improved Unit Range (IUR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and unsupervised learning algorithm (Expectation Maximization) to aggregate similar alerts and to reduce the number of alerts. We tested against other unsupervised learning algorithms to validate the performance of the proposed model.

A popular choice is Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs). Unfortunately, NIDSs trigger a massive amount of alerts even for a day and overwhelmed security experts. Worse, a large number of these alerts are false positives, and redundant warnings for the same attack, or alert notifications from erroneous activity. Such low quality of alerts gives negative impact to the alert analysis. We propose an alert aggregation model based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) coupled with unsupervised learning clustering algorithm - Expectation Maximization for Gaussian Mixture (EM_GM) to aggregate similar alerts and to reduce the number of alerts.

Texture is modeled using a mixture of Gaussian distributions, which capture the local statistical properties of the texture. The mixture parameters are estimated using Expectation Maximization algorithm. This algorithm finds the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of an underlying distribution from a given data set when data is incomplete. The paper presents a method of identifying changes as well as new patterns in the image using the Gaussian mixture model parameters. Model parameters of the original image texture are computed. Unexpected patterns in the image are discriminated by using weighted normalized Euclidean distance measure derived from the model parameters.

In the TDR-IDMA systems, the time-reversed version of channel impulse responses (TR-CIR) is used to perfume the pre-processing for the received signal to accelerate signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). Therefore, we need the channel state information (CSI) from channel estimator at the receiver. The complex multi-path channel estimation approach based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for the TDR-IDMA system. At the first iteration we use the pilot sequences to estimate the initial channel information, and the soft estimates from the IDMA signal detector combined with the pilot information to refine the cannel coefficients in the following estimation iterations. The simulation results indicate that the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed channel estimation algorithm is very close to that of ideal channel estimation.

In this direction, clustering microarray time-series data via pairwise alignment of piece-wise linear profiles has been recently introduced. We propose a EM clustering approach based on a multiple alignment of natural cubic spline representations of gene expression profiles. The multiple alignment is achieved by minimizing the sum of integrated squared errors over a time-interval, defined on a set of profiles. Preliminary experiments on a well-known data set of 221 pre-clustered Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression profiles yield encouraging results with 83.26% accuracy.

These constraints create difficulty in estimation. In order to simply and stably estimate parameters in restricted latent class analysis, a simple computational method using only first-order differentials is proposed, where the step-halving method is adopted.

Assuming a fixed user bit rate in narrowband system with scarce capacity resources, SI based training enables utilization of lower coding rate. Moreover, only a slight difference in coding rates is shown to have a considerable effect on system performance. This paper introduces a novel channel estimation structure for the SI scheme. The structure improves the quality of initial channel estimates by exploiting the coarsely estimated information symbols, which are obtained through Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The simulations show that in the presented narrowband peer-to-peer environment, SI training based channel estimation may provide significant benefits over the conventional TDM pilot scheme.

It has been shown that SBL is easy to use and can recover sparse signals more accurately than the l(1) based optimization approaches, which require a delicate choice of user parameters. We propose herein a modified Expectation Maximization (EM) based SBL algorithm referred to as SBL-alpha and a block Gibbs sampling algorithm referred to as BGS-alpha, both of which are based on a three-stage hierarchical Bayesian model. We compare both methods to a widely used benchmark SBL algorithm, which is equivalent to SBL-alpha with alpha = 0. We show that SBL-alpha with alpha = 1 not only is more accurate than the benchmark SBL algorithm in terms of the reconstruction error, but also converges faster. BGS-alpha with alpha = 1.5 is more accurate than SBL-1, but requires more computations.

The values of the next-nearest neighbour interactions are set to positive real numbers with the expectation that this will lead to some noise reduction while preserving the edges. Values for the hyperparameters in the proposed model are determined by using the EM algorithm in order to maximize the marginal likelihood. In addition, a measure of mean squared error, which quantifies the statistical performance of our proposed model, is derived analytically as an exact explicit expression by means of the multi-dimensional Gaussian integral formulas.

EMOTION RECOGNITION FROM SPEECH VIA BOOSTED GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS	ICME: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA AND EXPO, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	JUN 28-JUL 03, 2009	New York, NY	IEEE		Emotion recognition; Gaussian mixture model; Bayesian optimal classifier; EM algorithm; boosting	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS	Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and the minimum error rate classifier (i.e. Bayesian optimal classifier) are popular and effective tools for speech emotion recognition. Typically, GMMs are used to model the class-conditional distributions of acoustic features and their parameters are estimated by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on a training data set Then, classification is performed to minimize the classification error w.r.t. the estimated class-conditional distributions. We call this method the EM-GMM algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a boosting algorithm for reliably and accurately estimating the class-conditional GMMs. The resulting algorithm is named the Boosted-GMM algorithm. Our speech emotion recognition experiments show that the emotion recognition rates are effectively and significantly "boosted" by the Boosted-GMM algorithm as compared to the EM-GMM algorithm. This is due to the fact that the boosting algorithm can lead to more accurate estimates of the class-conditional GMMs, namely the class-conditional distributions of acoustic features.

Time activity curves (TACs) of different organs at both rest and stress conditions were extracted from dynamic Rb-82 PET images of 5 normal patients. Combined SimSET-GATE Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate nearly noise-free (NNF) MP PET data from a time series of 3D NCAT phantoms with organ activities modeling different pre-scan delay times (PDTs) and total acquisition times (TATs). Poisson noise was added to the NNF projections and the OS-EM algorithm was applied to generate noisy reconstructed images. The channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) with 32x32 spatial templates corresponding to 4 octave-wide frequency channels was used to evaluate the images. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated from the CHO rating data as an index for image quality in terms of MP defect detection. The 0.5 cycle/cm Butterworth post-filtering on OS-EM (with 21 subsets) reconstructed images generates the highest AUC values while those from iteration number 1 to 4 do not show different AUC values. The optimized PDTs for both rest and stress conditions are found to be close to the cross points of the left ventricular chamber and myocardium TACs, which may promote individualized PDT for patient data processing and image reconstruction. Shortening the TATs; for <similar to 3 minutes from the clinically employed acquisition time does not affect the MP defect detection significantly for both rest and stress studies.

Conventional methods consist of individually reconstructing 2D/3D PET data followed by graphical analysis on the sequence of reconstructed images. The proposed approach maintains the simplicity and accuracy of the EM algorithm by extending the system matrix to include the relation between the parametric images and the measured data. The proposed technique achieves a closed-form solution by utilizing a different hidden complete-data formulation within the EM framework. Additionally, the method is extended to maximum a posterior (MAP) reconstruction via incorporating MR image information, with the joint entropy between the MR and parametric PET features. A Parzen window method was used to estimate the joint probability density of the MR and parametric PET images. Using realistic simulated [(11)C]-Naltrindole PET and MR brain images/data, the quantitative performance of the proposed methods was investigated. Significant improvements in terms of noise vs. bias performance have been achieved, when performing direct parametric reconstruction, and additionally when extending the algorithm to its Bayesian counter-part using MR-PET join entropy.

For the segmentation, different unsupervised clustering techniques are employed to partition the Computed Tomography (CT) brain images into three regions, which are the abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and brain matters. The novel segmentation method proposed is a dual level segmentation approach. The first level segmentation, which purpose is to acquire abnormal regions, uses the combination of fuzzy c-means (FCM) and k-means clustering. The second level segmentation performs either the expectation-maximization (EM) technique or the modified FCM with population-diameter independent (PDI) to segment the remaining intracranial area into CSF and brain matters. The system automatically determines which algorithm to be utilized in order to produce optimum results. The retrieval of the medical images is based on keywords such as "no abnormal region", "abnormal region(s) adjacent to the skull" and "abnormal region(s) not adjacent to the skull". Medical data from collaborating hospital are experimented and promising results are observed.

A successful CBR system highly depends on how to design an effective case retrieval mechanism. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search method which selects the K most similar prior cases for a new case has been extensively used in the case retrieval phase of CBR. Although KNN can be simply implemented, the choice of the K value is quite subjective and wit] influence the performance of a CBR system. To eliminate the disadvantage, this research proposes a significant nearest neighbor (SNN) search method. In SNN, the probability density function of the dissimilarity distribution is estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm. Accordingly, the case selection can be conducted by determining whether the dissimilarity between a prior case and the new case is significant low based on the estimated dissimilarity distribution. The SNN search avoids human involvement in deciding the number of retrieved prior cases and makes the retrieval result objective and meaningful in statistics. The performance of the proposed SNN search method is demonstrated through a set of experiments.

In previous method, expansion terms are usually selected by counting term co-occurrences in the documents. However, term co-occurrences are not always a good indicator for relevance, whereas some arc background terms of the whole collection. In order to remove noise, an EM-algorithm is used in our model to estimate two kinds of relevance weight. One is the relevance weight between query and its relevant term extracted from the top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results. The other is the relevance weight between each query term and its relevant terms extracted from the snapshot of Google search result when that query term is used as search keyword. The estimated relevance weights are used to select good expansion terms for second retrieval. The experiments on the two test collections show that our query expansion model is more effective than the standard Rocchio expansion.

The first model is a usual two components lognormal mixture for which we used the EM algorithm to estimate the parameters. The second one, called a composite lognormal-lognormal model, can in fact be reduced to a particular two components mixture model having truncated lognormals as mixture distributions. This composite model is studied in some detail and we present some specific parameters estimation methods. We also discuss and compare both models fit to the data.

The knowledge-based part of the authentication procedure will include a real-time question and answer session before the users are allowed to proceed to the second stage and identify the correct images from a number of challenge-sets presented to them. The proposed ID algorithm will employ a statistical data classification technique based on the real-time tracking of the user behavior. Two statistical algorithms are proposed for the implementation of these additional features of the system. Importance sampling technique will be employed to select the attributes for the knowledge-based authentication stage while the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm will form the basis of the intrusion detection part of the system. The paper outlines some issues that need to be resolved before proceeding with the implementation of the additional system features and lists some contributions and insights that might be gained from this work. The paper also reports on a recent pilot experiment conducted in relevance with the work.

Super-resolution (SR) aims at generating a high-resolution image or image sequence from several slightly different low-resolution images. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) SR algorithm has been implemented and applied for simultaneous motion estimation and image quality enhancement of respiratory synchronized gated frames. The algorithm was tested on GATE simulated images reconstructed using the one-pass list-mode EM (OPL-EM) algorithm. SR was performed on the gated images with the proposed MAP algorithm. The function yielded by the MAP method was optimized with respect to both the high-resolution image and the motion parameters through a steepest descent algorithm. Two motion estimation models were compared: one based on a sinusoidal model of fixed phase with the motion amplitude optimized for each voxel, the other considering motion as a linear combination of cubic b-splines. Lesion positions were recovered using profiles and image enhancement was assessed by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast measures.

First, spatial-temporal interest points (STIPs) were extracted according to the properties of human movement, and then, histogram of gradient (HOG) was built to describe the distribution of STIPs in each frame.

Existing direct reconstruction methods often use nonlinear compartmental models, which require the knowledge of model order. This paper presents a direct reconstruction approach using a linear spectral representation and does not require model order assumption. A Laplacian prior is used to ensure sparsity in the spectral representation. The resultant maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation is solved by an expectation maximization shrinkage algorithm. A bias correction step is developed to improve the MAP estimate. Computer simulations show that the proposed method achieves better bias-variance tradeoff than a conventional indirect method for estimating parametric images from dynamic PET data.

In this paper, a class of neighborhood-relation signatures (NRS) are proposed, including 1-NRS, 2-NRS and (1,2)-NRS. NRS can be used for detecting polymorphic worms since these worms often remain the same relationship between bytes in changing their patterns. Two signature generation algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization(EM) and Gibbs Sampling are designed to generate NRS. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRS and the correctness of the process of signatures generation. Experiment results show that our approach of defending polymorphic worm based on NRS is more effective than other approach based on existed signatures.

Generally, the EM algorithm is utilized to learn the parameters of the Gaussian mixture. However, the EM algorithm is based on the maximum likelihood framework and cannot determine the number of Gaussians for a sample data set. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a new model selection criterion based on the kurtosis and skewness of the estimated Gaussians. Moreover, a new greedy EM algorithm is constructed via the kurtosis and skewness based criterion. The simulation results show that the proposed model selection criterion is efficient and the new greedy EM algorithm is feasible.

This approach employs maximum projective decomposition algorithm combined fractional Fourier transform with quasi-Newton method to estimate the parameters. Then, the expectation maximization algorithm is used to refine the results. Compared with traditional time-frequency analysis methods, such as short-time Fourier spectrum and Wigner distribution, the simulation results show that this method can obtain more accurate estimation, finer time-frequency resolution and de-noising capability. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of bearing, and the results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient in signal feature extraction.

This paper presents a unified expectation-maximization (EM) approach, where PVE and intensity inhomogeneity are combined together into a built-in-one statistical model in additive and multiplicative formats. It assumes that each tissue type follows a conditionally-independent normal distribution, based on which the summation of all tissue contributions multiplied or added by the bias term leads to mean density value at each voxel. Meanwhile, the summation of all the tissue mixtures, which is unobservable but could be estimated via EM framework (many-to-one mapping), multiplied or added by the bias term would lead to the observed image density at each voxel. In doing so, both the inhomogeneity and tissue mixtures are updated voxel-by-voxel until the convergence of a stable solution. Comprehensive tests on simulated brain MR images strongly demonstrated the feasibilities of additive/multiplicative bias models and the effectiveness of the unified EM approach. In addition, additive and multiplicative bias field models reflect advantages in terms of stability and robustness.

When modeling each tissue type as a conditionally independent Gaussian distribution, the tissue mixture fractions in each voxel via the modeled unobservable random processes of the underlying tissue types can be estimated by maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) algorithm in an iterative manner. This article presents, based on the assumption that PV effect could be fully described by a tissue mixture model, a theoretical solution to the MAP-EM segmentation algorithm, as opposed to our previous approximation which simplified the posteriori cost function as a quadratic term. It was found out that the theoretically-derived solution existed in a set of high-order nonlinear equations. Despite of the induced computational complexity when seeking for optimum numerical solutions to nonlinear equations, potential gains in robustness, consistency and quantitative precision were noticed. Results from both synthetic digital phantoms and real patient bladder MR images were presented, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the presented theoretical MAP-EM solution.

The proposed joint detection and estimation scheme is derived by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, the cooperative communication between the relays and the destination is based on the concept of compress-and-forward (CF) scheme. Most importantly, the distribution detection theory is incorporated in developing the joint detection and estimation rules. Specifically, each relay makes its decision based on its joint detection and estimation rule and then forwards it to the destination node. The destination node makes a decision by fusing the decisions sent from the relays using its joint detection and estimation rule. In our considered structure, the feedback channels are also allowed from the destination node to all the relays to further improves the performance of cooperative communications. The simulation results show that the performance of cooperative communication can improve significantly by using the fusion technique and the feedback channels.

This spectrum-image reconstruction method takes place in integrated spatial and energy domain using the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm. This technique has been demonstrated for combined two-, three- and four-interaction Compton events from an array of 2 cm x 2 cm x 1.5 cm detectors in our previous work. By including Compton continuum events in the system model and using a sensitivity image to correct efficiency effects, the MLEM solution estimates the true incident gamma-ray spectrum with correct branching ratio. For each direction, we can then identify the source isotope based on the peak energy and relative peak area. After identifying the source isotope, the source activity can be estimated. From the reconstructed image and change of the relative peak areas from the branching ratio, the presence of shielding and the material and thickness of shielding can be estimated.

In this paper, we present a novel Linear Hidden Markov (LHM) model for reputation evaluation. LHM model uses the linear autoregressive function to define the reputation evolution, so that the reputation prediction variance can be assessed by a Markov process. Based on Expectation Maximization (EM) calibration method, LHM model aggregates the feedback by using the Kalman filter, which can support further robust inference techniques. Our experiments show that LHM model can effectively capture the reputation value and its prediction variance.

This paper proposes a soft bag-of-features image representation based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) of visual tokens for object categorization. The distribution of local features from each visual token is assumed as the CLAIM and learned from the training data by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm with a model selection method based on the Minimum Description Length. Consequently, we can employ Bayesian formula to compute posterior probabilities of being visual tokens for local features. According to these probabilities, three schemes of image representation are defined and compared for object categorization under a new discriminative learning framework of Bayesian classifiers; the Max-Min posterior Pseudo-probabilities (MMP). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed object categorization approach oil the Caltech-4 database and car side images from the University of Illinois. The experimental results with comparisons to those reported in other related work show that our approach is promising.

We introduce an alternative estimation scheme that operates on the raw projection data and offers a substantial improvement, as measured by the ensemble-mean squared error (EMSE), when compared to using voxel values from a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) reconstructed ROL The scanning-linear estimator is derived as a special case of maximum-likelihood (ML) techniques with a series of approximations to make the calculation tractable. The approximated likelihood accounts for background randomness, measurement noise, and variability in the signal's activity. The resulting estimate of the signal activity is an unbiased estimator: the average estimate equals the true value. By contrast, algorithms that operate on reconstructed data are subject to unpredictable bias arising from the null functions of the imaging system and the object. Using visual inspection of reconstructed data to select an ROI is tantamount to estimating a location and size of the signal. In general, this procedure would be less than ideal, but we remove this source of error by estimating the activity of a spherical signal whose radius and centroid are known. The signal shape and location fully specify a binary ROI template in object space. Although the scanning-linear method can be generalized to more complicated estimation tasks, we will demonstrate its use for estimating only signal amplitude. Noisy projection data are realistically emulated using measured calibration data from the multi-module multi-resolution (M(3)R) small-animal SPECT imaging system. The scanning-linear estimate of signal activity is computed for 800 image samples. The same set of images are reconstructed using the MLEM algorithm (80 iterations), and the mean as well as the maximum value within the ROI is calculated.

Experiments with articifial data were performed to ascertain the robustness of learning. Applying the procedure to data from two publicly available microarray datasets, we conclude that lognormal performed the best function for modeling the marginal distributions of gene expression.

An important task in sea-ice analysis is to segment SAR sea-ice imagery based on the underlying ice type, which is a challenging task to perform automatically due to various imaging and environmental conditions. A novel stochastic ensemble consensus approach to sea-ice segmentation (SEC) is presented to tackle this challenging task In SEC, each pixel in the SAR sea-ice image is assigned an initial sub-class based on its tonal characteristics. Ensembles of random samples are generated from a random field representing the SAR sea-ice imagery The generated ensembles are then used to re-estimate the sub-class of the pixels using a weighted median consensus strategy. Based on the probability distribution of the sub-classes, an expectation maximization (EM) approach is utilized to estimate the final class likelihoods using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Finally, maximum likelihood (ML) classification is performed to estimate the final class of each pixel within the SAR sea-ice imagery based on the estimated GMM and the assigned sub-classes.

Moreover, there is strong evidence that most of the financial return series are not normally distributed. They usually exhibit excess kurtosis which means that there are more probability mass in the tails of the marginal or conditional distribution. Linear time series models such as autoregressive and moving average models assume that the conditional and unconditional distributions of the time series are Gaussian with time-independent variances. Nonlinear time series models such as threshold (Tong, 1990) and GARCH models relax the constant variance assumption but still ally with the assumption that the financial returns are conditionally normal distributed. Mixture-typed time series models, introduced by Wong and Li (2000), are potentially useful in modelling of financial returns. The models are able to capture serial correlations; time-varying means and volatilities; and the shape of the conditional distributions can be time varied from short-tailed to long-tailed, or from unimodal to multi-modal. However, as these models ally with the assumption that return series in each component is conditionally Gaussian, it may underestimate the occurrence of extreme financial events, such as market crashes. Wong et al. (2009) extend the mixture-typed time series models by replacing the Gaussian assumption with the Student t distribution. The Student t-mixture autoregressive (TMAR) model consists of a mixture of g autoregressive components with Student t error distributions. As the tails of Student t distribution can be much heavier than that of normal distribution, it would be able to accommodate some aberrant returns occasionally observed in financial markets. The use of t distributed errors in each component of the model allows for conditional leptokurtic distribution which could account for the commonly observed unconditional kurtosis in the financial data. They successfully apply the class of models to the US 3-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate. Comparison studies indicate that TMAR model has better performance of interval prediction over other commonly used time series models. It is well known that interest rates series and stock indices series behave differently. For example, stock indices behave like a random walk while interest rates evolve with mean-reversion. Hence, the observations for interest rates data in Wong et al. (2009) cannot be directly generalized for stock indices data. In this paper, we apply the class of TMAR models to the return series of Hong Kong Heng Sang Index. We find that the TMAR model also has better performance of interval prediction in the case of stock index data.

Signal Separation of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Mixture: Time Domain Approach	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing	APR 03-05, 2009	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE, IACSIT			BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; NEURAL-NETWORK	In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to solve blind signal separation of nonlinear time-delayed mixtures of statistically independent sources. Both mixing and nonlinear distortion are included in the proposed model. Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach is developed to estimate the parameters in the model and this is formulated within the framework of the generalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Adaptive polynomial basis expansion is used to estimate the nonlinearity of the mixing model. In the E-step, the sufficient statistics associated with the source signals are estimated while in the M-step, the parameters are optimized by using these statistics. Generally, the nonlinear distortion renders the statistics intractable and difficult to be formulated in a closed form. However, in this paper it is proved that with the use of Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) around a linearized point, the M-step is made tract able and can be solved by linear equations.	[Woo, W.

The system consists of 28 detector modules arranged into two half rings (24.6 cm in diameter). Each detector consists of an array of 13x13 LSO crystals each measuring 2 x 2 x 5 mm3, a 2.8 mm thick light-guide, and a R8900-M16 PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan). The 16 anode outputs of a PMT are multiplexed to produce 4 position-encoded signals that resemble the output of a typical block detector in the PET scanner. An active switch board was designed to select signals from either the insert detectors or scanner detectors and feed the output signals to system electronics for event processing, allowing the scanner to switch between its normal operation and the insert mode without shutting down the system. A 3-D translation stage supports and positions the insert concentrically inside the scanner. The axial extend of the insert detectors is 54 mm, centered within the first 3 detector block rings of the scanner. Initial setup of the PET insert system requires the identification of crystal lookup table and photopeak locations, timing alignment of the insert detectors with the scanner. Once completed, the scanner can be switched between the insert and normal modes within a few minutes. Coincidences are sorted into insert-insert (II), insert-scanner (IS) and scanner-scanner (SS) types of events using a custom sorting code. We have developed 2D FBP and 2D ML-EM algorithms to reconstruct single-slice rebinned sinograms, and a 3D OS-EM algorithm to jointly estimate the images using all 3 types of events. Initial tests show a mean, max and min energy resolution of 12.36%, 18.57% and 9.45% FWHM at 511 keV, respectively. Image resolution measured by 22Na point sources is similar to 2-3 mm FWHM and improved from 4-5mm FWHM for scanner system. Full system performance is currently being evaluated.

It is shown that the expectation maximization (EM) approach is complementary to the Kalman filter (KF) approach where the latter provides poor CFO estimation but good channel estimation and the former provides poor channel estimation but good CFO estimation. A hybrid combination of EM and KF approaches is proposed to take advantages of the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of both approaches. Numerical results have shown the hybrid combination is around 1.2dB better than the non-hybrid approaches (EM or KF) in BER performances. The complexity of the hybrid approach is comparable to the KF approach and is much lower than the EM approach.

A Probabilistic Framework for Learning Robust Common Spatial Patterns	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			FILTERS; EEG	Robustness in signal processing is crucial for the purpose of reliably interpreting physiological features from noisy data in biomedical applications. We present a robust algorithm based on the reformulation of a well-known spatial filtering and feature extraction algorithm named Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). We cast the problem of learning CSP into a probabilistic framework, which allows us to gain insights into the algorithm. To address the overfitting problem inherent in CSP, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning robust CSP using from a Student-t distribution. The efficacy of the proposed robust algorithm is validated with both simulated and real EEG data.

Tissue Classification from Brain Perfusion MR Images Using Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Initialized by Hierarchical Clustering on Whitened Data	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		MR perfusion; expectation-maximization algorithm; hierarchical clustering; whitening; segmentation	FLOW	Classification of different perfusion compartments in the brain is important to the profound analysis of brain perfusion. We presents a method based on a mixture of multivariate Gaussians (MoMG) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm initialized by the results of hierarchical clustering (HC) on the whitened data to automatically dissect various perfusion compartments from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR images so that each compartment comprises pixels of similar signal-time curves. Monte Carlo simulations have been designed and executed to assess the performance of the proposed method under various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The results of simulations showed that using EM initialized by HC on whitened data produce the best accuracy of segmentation. Five healthy volunteers participated in this study for the validation of this method. The averaged ratios of gray matter to white matter for relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and mean transition time (MTT) derived from 5 normal subjects were 2.196 +/- 0.097, 2.259 +/- 0.119, and 0.968 +/- 0.023 which are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The proposed method can subserve the diagnosis and assessment of various diseases involving the changes of cerebral blood distribution.	[Wu, Y. T.; Chou, Y. C.; Lu, C. F.; Huang, S.

It is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem. It is similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians in that they both attempt to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. Bayesian rule is a theorem in probability theory named for Thomas Bayesian. It is used for updating probabilities by finding conditional probabilities given new data. In this paper, K-mean clustering algorithm and Bayesian classification are combined to analysis the credit card. The analysis result can be used to improve the accuracy.

Since the VBEM algorithm provides distribution estimation of all parameters, the detection performance can be improved by taking the channel estimation error into account. In addition, with the aid of the soft information provided by the signal detector, the recursive VBEM (RVBEM) algorithm is introduced to track the time-varying channels. Due to the high complexity of the RVBEM algorithm, a novel time-frequency domain recursive VBEM (TF-LCRVBEM) algorithm with low complexity is further proposed. The TF-LCRVBEM algorithm simply predicts the channel impulse responses (CIRs) on time domain and recursively refines them on all subcarriers. The complexity analysis results demonstrate that the TF-LCRVBEM algorithm totally avoids computation of matrix inversion and obtains linear complexity. Moreover, the simulation results show that the proposed receiver not only dramatically outperforms the conventional receiver, but also provides performance close to the optimal receiver with perfect channel state information (PCSI).

To combat this problem, we construct an alternative metric for likelihood or log-likelihood, namely auxiliary function, which results in a novel EM hill-climbing (EM-HC) optimization procedure. We extend our previous efforts along this line of the auxiliary function research to generalize the EM-HC scheme and solve the blind equalization for the complex-valued signals. In this paper, our new EM-HC method, namely efficient Iterative Weighted Least-Mean Squared (IWLMS) algorithm is extended for QPSK and QAM signals. The new version of the IWLMS algorithm greatly outperforms the prevalent blind equalization algorithms based on the constant-modulus and kurtosis criteria according to Monte Carlo simulations.

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model has been used to learn and recognize human actions in videos. Specifically, PLSA employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation during the training. The EM algorithm is an iterative estimation scheme that is guaranteed to find a local maximum of the likelihood function. However its convergence usually takes a large number of iterations. For action recognition with large amount of training data, this would result in long training time. This paper presents an incremental version of EM to speed up the training of PLSA without sacrificing performance accuracy. The proposed algorithm is tested on two challenging human action datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges with fewer number of full passes compared with the batch EM algorithm. And the trained PLSA models achieve comparable or better recognition accuracies than those using batch EM training.

And the data transmission efficiency will be reduced with the increasing number of transmit antennas. According to these problems, a high effective MAP algorithm for MIMO-OFDM is proposed. This algorithm which uses the characteristic of Expectation maximum (EM) algorithm decrease high complexity. To improve the data transmission efficiency and the performance of channel estimation, joint estimation is carried out over multiple OFDM symbols. Besides, depending on the spatial independence of MIMO channel in angle domain, the dimension-reduced MAP algorithm will be enhanced. Simulation results indicate the proposed algorithm obtains better the performance of estimation and higher data transmission efficiency.

Although EM algorithm combined with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator could obtain good performance, its high complexity makes this algorithm unpractical. The proposed algorithm do not require prior knowledge of the channel correlation, avoids inversion induced by LS algorithm and exploits channel coefficients irrelevance in angle domain for ignoring the small-valued channel taps and retaining only the most significant taps (MST) to reduce the effect of noise on the estimates. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm gets better performance than phase shifted orthogonal LS (PSO-LS) and EM algorithms.

The time-activity curve for each voxel is described by a one-tissue compartment, 2-parameter model. Extending previous EM algorithms, a new spatiotemporal complete data space was introduced to optimize the maximum likelihood function. This leads to a straightforward parametric image update equation with moderate additional computation requirements compared to the conventional algorithm. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were performed using 2D (x,t) and 4D (x,y,z,t) simulated list mode data for a brain receptor study. Comparisons with the two-step approach (frame-based reconstruction followed by voxel-by-voxel parameter estimation) show that the proposed method can lead to accurate estimation of the parametric image values with reduced variance, especially for the volume of distribution (V(T)).

However, clustering on attribute variables of objects may give more cluster information. Thus, to have a clustering algorithm that can be designated to construct simultaneously an optimal partition of objects and also attribute variables into homogeneous block is important. This kind of clustering was called block clustering (see Duffy and Quiroz, 1991). Recently, Govaert and Nadif (2003) proposed a block classification EM (block CEM) algorithm and then proposed block fuzzy c-methods (block FCM) in 2006. In this paper, based on Huang and Ng's (1999) fuzzy k-modes (FKM) method, we propose a block FKM clustering algorithm. Several examples are used to make the comparisons between block FCM and the proposed block FKM.

In this article, we propose a novel gateway access algorithm called 'Cog Gap', which is a cognitive method and is designed for Wireless Mesh Networks to maximize the network utilization. The proposed Cog Gap utilizes a destination-hub access model, where multiple gateway nodes are connected by wired links, and packets from a source node can be sent from any connected gateway nodes to increase transmission opportunities. In Cog Gap, we use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the expectation maximization method to handle uncertain traffic pattern and the loss of probing results. A traffic allocation algorithm is then proposed to optimize dynamic multi-gateway access. By modeling the route state determination and transition, we transform the opportunistic gateway access problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) problem. A heuristic and adaptive algorithm named hindsight optimal is used in solving MDP. Simulation results have proven that the proposed Cog Gap algorithm can make full use of the transmission opportunities and does not incur noticeable protocol overhead.

However, the traditional pixel-based image analysis methods cannot meet the needs of this development trend. The paper attempts to present an information extraction approach in terms of image segmentation based on an object-oriented algorithm for high-resolution remote sensing images. An aim of the author' research is to establish an identification system of "pixel-primitive-object". Through extraction and combination of micro-scale coastal zone features, some objects are classified or recognized, e.g., tidal flat, water line, sea wall, and mariculture pond. Firstly, the authors extract various internal features of relatively homogeneous primitive objects using an image segmentation algorithm based on both spectral and shape information. Secondly, the features of those primitives are analyzed to ascertain an optimal object by adopting certain feature rules. The results from this research indicate that our model is practical to realize and the extraction accuracy of the coastal information is significantly improved as compared with the traditional approaches. Therefore, this study provides a potential way to serve the author' highly dynamic coastal zones for monitoring, management, development and utilization.

The method uses an iterative expectation-maximization procedure to estimate demixing parameters including frequency-dependent attenuation and delay. To deal with noise distortion, the method treats noise explicitly as one of its parameters but identifies sources implicitly using a posteriori probabilities. We also extend the method to incorporate prior source statistics, represented as Gaussian mixture model. We evaluated the method in a set of noise conditions, and observed significant and consistent performance improvements than alternative methods.

First, a volumetric shape index (SI) feature based on the second-order partial derivatives of the CT image is calculated. Next, the SI feature is combined with spatial and intensity features to form a five-dimensional feature vectors, which are then clustered using mean shift to produce intensity and shape mode maps. Finally, a modified expectation-maximization (MEM) algorithm is applied on the mean shift intensity mode map to merge the neighboring modes with spatial and shape mode maps as priors. The proposed method has been evaluated on a clinical dataset of thoracic CT scans that contains 80 nodules. A volume overlap ratio between each segmented nodule and the ground truth annotation is calculated. Using the proposed method, the mean overlap ratio over all the nodules is 0.81 with standard deviation of 0.05. Most of the nodules, including challenging juxta-vascular and juxta-pleural nodules, can be properly separated from adjoining tissues.

Estimation of oxygen tension in retinal capillaries using phosphorescence lifetime imaging is addressed in this paper. Separation from tissue and oxygen tension estimation is a more challenging task for capillaries when compared with large retinal vessels due to the finer structure and noise predominance in capillaries. An automated segmentation procedure is applied using the EM algorithm and noise contamination is reduced using a regularization method unlike previous approaches to capillary analysis where segmentation was done manually and noise contamination was ignored. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the retinal image data acquired from rat eyes, and we show that the oxygen tension estimate of retinal capillaries falls in the physiologically expected range.

Unlike in the pilot based channel estimation, the least-squares (LS) channel estimator operating in the DD mode for MIMO-OFDM requires a matrix inversion. The size of the matrix to be inverted depends on the number of transmit antennas and the length of the channel impulse response. The frequency domain (FD) space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) channel estimator calculates the LS estimate iteratively avoiding the matrix inversion with a constant envelope modulation. The drawback with the FD-SAGE channel estimator is the required matrix inversion with a non-constant envelope modulation. The size of the matrix to be inverted depends on the length of the channel impulse response. However, it is considerably less complex than the LS channel estimator in the DD mode. In this paper, a time domain (TD) SAGE channel estimator is derived to avoid the matrix inversion in DD channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems when using non-constant envelope modulation. The derived TD-SAGE channel estimator is shown to offer the same performance as the FD-SAGE channel estimator with reduced complexity.	[Ylioinas, Jari; Raghavendra, M.

Motivated by the aspect model used for dyadic data analysis as well as in probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), we present a probabilistic model with two dependent latent variables for NMTF, referred to as probabilistic matrix tri-factorization (PMTF). Each latent variable in the model is associated with the cluster variable for the corresponding object in the dyad, leading the model suited to co-clustering. We develop an EM algorithm to learn the PMTF model, showing its equivalence to multiplicative updates derived by an algebraic approach. We demonstrate the useful behavior of PMTF in a task of document clustering. Moreover, we incorporate the likelihood in the PMTF model into existing information criteria so that the number of clusters can be detected, while the algebraic NMTF cannot.			zentasis@postech.ac.kr; seungjin@postech.ac.kr					AKAIKE H, 1974, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, VAC19, P716, DOI 10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705; Choi S., 2008, P INT JOINT C NEUR N; Cichocki A, 2008, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V29, P1433, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2008.02.016; Dhillon I, 2003, P 9 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P89; DING C, 2006, P ACM SIGKDD INT C K; GAUSSIER E, 2005, P ACM SIGIR INT C RE; Hofmann T., 1999, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, V11; HOFMANN T, 1999, P INT C UNC ART INT; KIM YD, 2007, P IEEE CVPR 2007 WOR; Kim Y.-D., 2008, P IEEE INT C AC SPEE; Lee D.D., 2001, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, V13; Lee DD, 1999, NATURE, V401, P788; LONG B, 2005, P ACM SIGKDD INT C K; SCHWARZ G, 1978, ANN STAT, V6, P461, DOI 10.1214/aos/1176344136; Shahnaz F, 2006, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V42, P373, DOI 10.1016/j.ipm.2004.11.005; Xu W., 2003, P ACM SIGIR INT C RE; Yoo J., 2008, P 9 INT C INT DAT EN	17	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1520-6149	978-1-4244-2353-8	INT CONF ACOUST SPEE			2009							1553	1556		10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959893		4	Acoustics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Acoustics; Engineering	BKQ01	WOS:000268919200389

So it adds a great deal of difficulty to wireless network optimizers when they are dealing with network problems. In response to this problem, in this paper, taken the CDMA network as an example, the method of wireless network fault diagnosis based on Bayesian Network is discussed. Two diagnosis models, Causation Bayesian Network model and Naive Bayesian Network model, are established and applied to experiment. They are testified to be precise and reliable and the result is used to evaluate the advantage and disadvantage of them. Besides, for the incompleteness of actual performance data, three mature incomplete-data-set learning methods, Monte-Carlo method, Gaussian algorithm and EM algorithm, are applied, whose function and shortcoming are explained.

However, for high accuracy applications, it has a limitation because the noise levels of pseudorange measurements are fairly large. In this case, we can use carrier phase measurements and should use a carrier phase-based RAIM (CRAIM). Conventional CRAIM algorithms have been used by direct extension of PRAIM and assumed a Gaussian measurement error distribution. However, the carrier phase error does not follow the Gaussian distribution perfectly, and therefore the performance of a conventional CRAIM algorithm is degraded. To address this problem, we propose a new CRAIM algorithm using Gaussian sum filters. A Gaussian sum filter can deal with any system nonlinearity or noise distribution, and accurately present the posterior distributions of states. In this paper, a Gaussian mixture parameter optimization technique is introduced and a detailed CRAIM algorithm using a Gaussian sum filter is described. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm detects about 25% smaller faults and generates about 30% lower protection levels than the conventional CRAIM algorithm that uses the overbounded Gaussian model. These results imply that it can provide better accuracy and availability performance just by changing the filtering algorithm.

In this paper, we show that the special characteristics of the DSL channel ensure that despite the large number of vectored Twisted Pairs (TPs), large constellation sizes, as well as the large number of tones, Maximum Likelihood receivers are practical, and as computationally efficient as linear receivers whose use has been suggested recently. The proposed receiver uses the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) iterative receiver, and exploits its ability to converge very rapidly close to the correct solution by initializing the iteration with the output of the Frequency Domain Equalizer (at each TP and tone).

Unlike previous approaches, continuous model for a given range of noise parameters is suggested to allow precise modeling of any predictable ambient noise conditions. The method is based on linked expectation maximization training of a series of Gaussian mixture models in a dense SNR stepping fashion followed by averaging and decimation to reduce storage needs.

Unlike traditional usage, the pLSA is used to model musical genre instead of single music signal in the proposed approach. First, an unsupervised clustering algorithm is utilized to group temporal segments in music signals into several natural clusters. By this means, each music signal is decomposed into a bag of "audio words". Subsequently, the pLSA model of each musical genre is trained through a new iterative training procedure and well-known EM algorithm. This training procedure can iteratively update the pLSA model parameters by discriminatively computing weight of each training music signal and evidently improve the model's discriminative performance. Finally, these models can be used to classify new unseen music signals. Experiments on two commonly utilized databases show that our pLSA based approach can give promising results and the iterative learning procedure is effective.

However, when field-of-view (FOV) is smaller than the object, the projection data are truncated by radioisotope outside FOV. The truncation causes artifact and overestimation, which decreases quantitative accuracy. Recently Defrise et al proposed a new truncation-compensated reconstruction method, that is, the truncated data can be successfully reconstructed by fulfilling following conditions. First, FOV contains zero or background counts outside the object as known value. Second, reconstructed image space is large enough to contain the whole support of the object. They demonstrated their theory by 2D X-ray CT simulation. This study was aimed at evaluating clinical-SPECT usability of a reconstructed image of a selected small region-of-interest (ROI) with the above Defrise's method. This evaluation was performed by computer simulation with a numerical human brain phantom and a detector with 2-mm resolution, 48-mm FOV and a parallel collimator. The projection data were acquired including the area outside the brain. After adding Gaussian noise, the projection data were reconstructed by maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) method on the reconstruction matrix large enough to contain the whole support of the brain. This simulation showed that the truncation compensated reconstruction method could provide the image with high resolution and the counts almost equivalent to that of original image in the selected small ROI without the effect of truncation for human brain. In conclusion, this result suggests that a compact high resolution detector can be used for quantitatively reconstructing a selected small ROI with clinical SPECT camera. This technique can also use the pinhole collimator instead of the compact high resolution detector.

However, when region-of-interest (ROI) is smaller than the object, the projection data are truncated due to radioisotope outside ROI. The truncation causes artifact and overestimation, which decrease quantitative accuracy. In theory, to eliminate the artifact and the overestimation due to truncation, the untruncated data from another large field-of-view (FOV) detector can be used even if the detector has low resolution. This study was aimed at evaluating feasibility of combination of a small FOV high resolution detector and a large FOV low resolution detector in clinical circumstance. This evaluation was performed by computer simulation with a numerical torso phantom. We tested whether the image in a selected small ROI (in this case, ROI was heart) can be obtained with high resolution and without artifact and overestimation. The small FOV detector with high resolution was with 1.14-mm resolution, 80-mm FOV and parallel collimator. The whole of heart was included in this FOV, but the surrounding area was truncated. The large FOV detector with low resolution has 9-mm resolution, 360-mm FOV and parallel collimator like conventional clinical SPECT. The untruncated projections including the whole of thorax were acquired by this detector. Gaussian noises were added to all projection data. Data from the small detector were reconstructed by maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) as iterative method, on the reconstruction matrix large enough to contain the whole of thorax. The reconstructed image from the large FOV detector was used as an initial image in iterative reconstruction. The image obtained by our proposed method had high resolution and the counts almost equivalent to that of original image in the small ROI. In conclusion, this result suggests feasibility of the combination of two detectors with small and large FOV to quantitatively obtain high-resolution image of a selected small ROI with clinical SPECT.

Most popular positioning algorithms first estimate certain parameters (such as Time of Arrival (TOA), Angle of Arrival (AOA) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)) from the received signals. These parameters are then used to estimate the targeted position. In practice, the estimation of these parameters is not errors free and the distribution of the errors is difficult to model exactly. In contrast, we propose a novel one-step approach, which estimates the position and channels directly and jointly from the received signals of the used base stations. We use a Bayesian approach where the prior distribution of the channels follows the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model to estimate the joint posterior probability density function (pdf) of the channels, the targeted position and the transmit time. One application of the joint posterior pdf of the channels, the targeted position and the transmit time is the position determination with classical posterior estimator (such as Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (MMSE)). For computing the joint posterior pdf of the channels, the targeted position and the transmit time, we derived an algorithm which is based on sampling-importance resampling and the expectation maximization technique. Furthermore, we propose a reduced-complexity architecture of the proposed IR UWB localization system using our proposed algorithm. The algorithm can be easily implemented on hardware. Numerical evaluations under the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimator.

Recently proposed method, PPLR, considers the probe-level measurement error and improves accuracy in finding differential gene expression. However, PPLR uses the importance sampling procedure in the E-step of the variational EM algorithm, which leads to less computational efficiency. We modified the original PPLR to obtain an improved model for finding different gene expression. The new model, IPPLR, adds hidden variables to represent the true gene expressions and eliminates the importance sampling in original PPLR. We apply IPPLR on a spike-in data set and a mouse embryo data set. Results show that IPPLR improves accuracy and computational efficiency in finding differential gene expression.

To address these problems, we adapted a rotator based maximum likelihood expectation maximum (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and a fast Monte Carlo simulator. In this paper, a Gaussian rotator is used with the ML-EM algorithm. This algorithm enables the full utilization of the rotational symmetry to reduce the storage of the system matrix, as well as the simulation cost. The fast system matrix simulator is based on egs_pet, a Monte Carlo code using EGSnrc. For a brain-size field of view, the system matrix storage requirement is reduced by a factor of 131,083 with regard to that of the full system matrix. This reduction is achieved by using symmetries and a sparse matrix representation. This enables the system matrix to reside in the main memory of a modern desktop. By combining the symmetry with the fast system matrix simulator, the simulation time is reduced by a factor of 9,240 with regard to an analog GATE simulation. The quality of the reconstructed image was evaluated with the contrast recovery versus background noise. Significant improvements were found with regard to the standard ray-tracing ML-EM.

The basic assumption for the documents in a collection is that each class is composed of a number of mixture components. By indentifying the components in the document collection, the classes of documents can thereby be identified from each other. A semi-supervised clustering method is proposed to identify the components (clusters), and further, unlabeled data is used to produce more accurate clusters in document collection to correspond the components of document classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces better performances than support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, and produces comparable performance with Bayesian classifier with Expectation Maximization (EM) in text classification.

The technique requires a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image and a high spatial resolution multispectral image of the same scene. The proposed approach applies a restoration on the hyperspectral image, while accounting for the joint statistics with the multispectral image. The restoration is based on an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which applies a deconvolution step and a denoising step iteratively. A practical implementation scheme is presented.

The key idea is that with inter-scale communication and intra-scale interaction of the WDHMT model, we can capture hierarchical classification information of the pixels at the vicinity of the weak boundary. Our framework consists of the following steps. Each frame extracted from the image sequence is transformed through discrete wavelet transform to obtain a compressive representation of the original one. Then the wavelet coefficients at each scale are represented by a tree-structured probabilistic graph, namely, hidden Markov tree. After the model parameters are learned through up-down iterated expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, we deduced the classification likelihood information at each scale. Finally, we tested the performance of this algorithm by using a sequence of tobacco leaf images, in which the objects are shaded and the boundaries are relatively weak, with encouraging results.

Cognitive radio is a way of opportunistically sharing the scare spectrum among primary and secondary users of the spectrum. The key challenge in deploying cognitive radio networks is to find out the spectrum holes in the primary wireless systems in order to allow the secondary users to operate. In this paper, we present novel localization algorithms based on grid-search and EM (expectation maximization) methods under the GMM (Gaussian mixture model) to find out the positions of the base stations and identify the spatial spectrum holes for cognitive radio deployments. Under this approach, we model the problem as localizing multiple unknown radio sources using a mobile measurement station, which is different from the problem modeling of many previous localization solutions. We evaluate our localization algorithm using both simulations and experiments.

There are several kinds of generative models proposed for modeling the data containing a large number of SNPs loci according to the characters of human genome. However, such models can only deal with ordered loci. In this paper, we try to model the same data without using the order information. Firstly, we present a clustering model for SNPs by modifying the multi-block model used in GERBIL. It is a two-layer Bayesian network with multiple latent variables. It does not use the order information of the loci. Secondly, we solve the model by employing a structural EM algorithm combined with simulated annealing mechanism. A real data set was analyzed by the model. The results show that the SNPs can be clustered effectively. Such a model is potentially useful for clustering distantly correlated SNPs loci.

As the EM algorithm is a hill-climbing approach, problems such as local maxima, plateau and ridges may appear. In the case of mixture models, these problems involve the initialization of the algorithm and the structure of the data set. We propose a random swap EM algorithm (RSEM) to overcome these problems in Gaussian mixture models. Random swaps are repeatedly performed in our method, which can break the configuration of the local maxima and other problems. Compared to the strategies in other methods, the proposed algorithm has relative improvements on log-likelihood value in most cases and less variance than other algorithms. We also apply RSEM to the image segmentation problem.

The accuracy of this algorithm depends on ROD membership function. In order to differentiate packet loss pattern more accurately, the initialization method based on potential function is proposed by EM algorithm analysis, and the simulation result shows it is superior in convergence speed. Then the modified EM algorithm is applied in creating different packet loss membership function which congestion and wireless error coexist in the network. From the results of simulation, this algorithm has well distinguishing effects in the membership function of different packet loss pattern and practical application value.

Both discrete heterogeneity (there exist classes of objects but all objects within one class are identical) and continuous heterogeneity (there exist classes of objects but, in addition, the objects within a class differ). With continuous heterogeneity, the idea of reconstruction is generalized from reconstruction of a unique 2- or 3-D object to reconstruction of the statistics of the 2- or 3-D object. The basic process is reconstruction by maximum likelihood estimation computed by an expectation-maximization algorithm with classification following as postprocessing given the reconstruction. Two examples are considered, one focusing on classification and one on reconstruction.

In this paper we present an effective approach to tracking and recovery of ego-motion from an image sequence acquired by a single camera attached to a pedestrian. Our approach consists of two stages. In the first phase, human gait analysis is performed and human gait parameters are estimated by frame-by-frame analysis utilising a generalised least squares technique. In the second phase, the gait model is employed within a "predict-correct" framework using a maximum a posteriori expectation maximisation strategy to recover ego-motion and scene structure, while continuously refining the gait model. Experiments on synthetic and real image sequences confirm that the use of the gait model allows for effective tracking while also reducing the computational complexity.

Monte Carlo-based parameter estimation and model inference algorithms are developed to deal with the proposed Gamma-based state space model. A case study using real data from industry is conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model with the commonly used proportional hazard model (PHM). The result shows that the Gamma-based state space model is more appropriate to deal with the situation when the failure data is insufficient.

However, the existing M(3)N formulation does not enjoy primal sparsity, which is a desirable property for selecting significant features and reducing the risk of over-fitting. In this paper, we present an l(1)-norm regularized max-margin Markov network (l(1)-M(3)N), which enjoys dual and primal sparsity simultaneously. To learn l(1)-M(3)N, we present three methods including projected sub-gradient, cutting-plane, and a novel EM-style algorithm, which is based on an equivalence between l(1)-M(3)N and an adaptive M(3)N. We perform extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets. Our experimental results show that: (1) l(1)-M(3)N can effectively select significant features; (2) l(1)-M(3)N can perform as well as the pseudo-primal sparse Laplace M(3)N in prediction accuracy, while consistently outperforms other competing methods that enjoy either primal or dual sparsity; and (3) the EM-algorithm is more robust than the other two in prediction accuracy and time efficiency.

In both cases, the instrumental density is found by minimizing Cross-Entropy. A comparison based on several simulation experiments shows that the defensive mixture has the best performance.

Few approaches currently exist lior detecting the defective pixels using real images captured with cameras equipped with such detectors, and they are ad hoe and limited in their applicability In this paper, we present a probabilistic novel integrated technique for autonomously detecting the defective pixels in image sensor arrays. It can be applied to images containing rich scene information, captured with any digital camera equipped with a solid-state detector, to detect diffierent kinds of defective pixels in the detector. We apply our technique to the detection of various defective pixels in an experimental camera equipped with a charge coupled device (CCD) array and two out of the four HgCdTe detectors of the UKIRT's wide field camera (WFCAM) used for infrared (IR) astronomy [Astron.

TRLFS: Analysing spectra with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy; Expectation maximization	LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; URANIUM SPECIATION; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; URANYL-ION; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURES; U(VI)	A new approach for fitting statistical models to time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) spectra is presented. Such spectra result from counting emitted photons in defined intervals. Any photon can be described by emission time and wavelength as observable attributes and by component and peak affiliation as hidden ones. Understanding the attribute values of the emitted photons as drawn from a probability density distribution, the model estimation problem can be described as a statistical problem with incomplete data. To solve the maximum likelihood task, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived and tested. In contrast to the well known least squares method, the advantage of the new approach is its ability to decompose the spectrum into its components and peaks using the revealed hidden attributes of the photons as well as the ability to decompose a background-superimposed spectrum into the exploitable signal of the fluorescent chemical species and the background. This facilitates new possibilities for evaluation of the resulting model parameters. The simultaneous detection of temporal and spectral model parameters provides a Mutually consistent description of TRLFS spectra. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper. we propose it component reduction technique, that collapses it Gaussian mixture model into a Gaussian mixture with fewer components. The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is usually used to fit a mixture model to data. Our algorithm is derived by extending mixture model learning using the EM-algorithm, In this extension. a difficulty arises from the fact that some crucial quantities cannot be evaluated analytically. We overcome this difficulty by introducing an effective approximation. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to a simple synthetic component reduction task and a phoneme clustering problem.

Especially, we focus on Bayesian methods that can provide soft (probobilistic) information. This soft information is attractive not only for its ability to measure the level of confidence of the solution, but also because it can be used to realize Bayesian data integration, an extremely important task in gene network research. We propose a variable selection formulation of gene regulation and develop an inference solution based on a variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM) learning rule. This solution has better performance and lower complexity than the popular Monte Carlo sampling techniques. In addition, we develop a method to incorporate the often needed constraints into the VBEM algorithm, making it much more suitable for common cases of small data size. To further illustrate the advantage of the VBEM algorithm, we demonstrate a Bayesian data integration scheme using the soft information obtained from the VBEM algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed VBEM algorithm and the corresponding Bayesian data integration scheme is evaluated on both simulated data and the yeast cell cycle microarray data sets.

Although statistical approaches for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the F-2:3 design have been well developed, those for binary traits of biological interest and economic importance are seldom addressed. In this study, an attempt was made to map binary trait loci (BTL) in the F-2:3 design. The fundamental idea was: the F-2 plants were genotyped, all phenotypic values of each F-2:3 progeny were measured for binary trait, and these binary trait values and the marker genotype informations were used to detect BTL under the penetrance and liability models. The proposed method was verified by a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments. These results showed that maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and liability models provide accurate estimates for the effects and the locations of BTL with high statistical power, even under of low heritability. Moreover, the penetrance model is as efficient as the liability model, and the F-2:3 design is more efficient than classical F-2 design, even though only a single progeny is collected from each F-2:3 family. With the maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and the liability models developed in this study, we can map binary traits as we can do for quantitative trait in the F-2:3 design.

Information attainable in some randomly incomplete multivariate response models	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						maximum likelihood estimates; asymptotic optimality; EM algorithm; SAM algorithm; likelihood ratio test statistic		In a general parametric setup, a multivariate regression model is considered when responses may be missing at random while the explanatory variables and covariates are completely observed. Asymptotic optimality properties of maximum likelihood estimators for such models are linked to the Fisher information matrix for the parameters. It is shown that the information matrix is well defined for the missing-at-random model and that it plays the same role as in the complete-data linear models. Applications of the methodologic developments in hypothesis-testing problems, without any imputation of missing data, are illustrated. Some simulation results comparing the proposed method with Rubin's multiple imputation method are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In our proposed algorithm for an UWB Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) system, an appropriate model is selected from the assumed interference models based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) which is an explicit theoretic criterion and a measure of fit of the model. The proposed algorithm does not need a priori information on the interference signals except that we can reduce a computational complexity to implement the algorithm if we have knowledge of the bands of the interference signals. Furthermore, we introduce the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to our algorithm in order to estimate the transmitted signals and the interference signals simultaneously. The proposed algorithm may not require the pilot symbols in the assumed UWB system to detect the presence of other systems. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm validly detects the presence of interference signals on the UWB band.

Precoding in downlink multi-carrier code division multiple access systems using expectation maximisation algorithm	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GAUSSIAN MIXTURES; CDMA; PARAMETERS; CHANNELS	The presence of multiple access interference and hardware complexity of the mobile terminal are two major burdens for multi-carrier code division multiple access schemes. Both burdens can be overcome in downlink by precoding the transmitted signal using the knowledge of the channel state information. In multi-user precoding techniques, the transmitter is optimised to combat channel impairments through the use of new spreading sequences that are obtained by solving an optimisation problem based on some criterion. Among these optimisation problems, the problem based on maximum likelihood is hard and complex to solve. In the proposed precoding scheme, the well-suited expectation maximisation algorithm is used to solve this problem. The proposed precoding technique is simulated and its performance is analysed and compared with some other precoding and detecting techniques. The results show that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the previous precoding schemes.

In order to explore the cause of the anomalous decrease, we drilled the ZK core in Dagang. Ten representative samples are collected from different depths and their isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves are measured. Quantification of magnetic coercivity components is carried out by using the program (Irmunmix V2.2) that uses the expectation-maximization algorithm. The results show that these ten samples can be divided into three groups. The first group contains no moderate magnetic coercivity component; the second group only contains a few moderate magnetic coercivity components; the third group contains many moderate magnetic coercivity components. The content of magnetic coercivity components is closely related to the content of the ferromanganese concretion. More ferromanganese concretions the sample contains, fewer soft magnetic coercivity components and more moderate and hard magnetic coercivity components the sample contains. Correspondingly, the sample of this kind has a low magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic coercivity component analysis indicates that the soft magnetic coercivity components were dissolved and new moderate and hard magnetic coercivity components were precipitated during the formation process of the concretion. This secondary process leads to the anomalous decrease of the magnetic susceptibility. The sample containing more ferromanganese concretions underwent stronger reducing action. Therefore, we conclude that the anomalous decrease of the magnetic susceptibility is the result of the reducing action, which might be the production within a period of enhanced precipitation.

Kalman filter is a representative method but is restricted to Gaussian distributions only. We consider the generalized auto-regressive (GAR) model in order to Capture the non-Gaussian characteristics of speech. Then we present a constrained sequential EM algorithm where Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPFs) are used in the E-step and model parameters are updated in a sequential manner in the M-step under positivity constraints for noise variance parameters. Numerical experiments confirm the high performance of our proposed method, compared to Kalman filter-based methods, in the task of sequential speech enhancement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Saito, H; Oshimi, A; Hayashi, M; Kohno, R				Saito, Hidetoshi; Oshimi, Akira; Hayashi, Masayuki; Kohno, Ryuji			New multivariate noise model and data detection using the expectation maximization algorithm	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Conference (PMRC 2007)	OCT 15-17, 2007	Tokyo, JAPAN			Multivariate autoregressive model; Maximum a posteriori estimation; Low-density parity-check code; Signal detection	A-POSTERIORI ESTIMATION; LINEAR CODES; SYSTEMS	A signal sequence detector in a high areal density recording channel is required to provide robust compensation against unexpected error events. Primarily, a number of error events are caused by media noise and nonlinear distortion. The same problem of signal sequence detection remains to be solved in a future magnetic recording system that comes in predisposed to trend for recording by large-sector size instead of existing single-sector one that consists of 512 information 8-bits bytes. For the above problem, this paper shows the signal estimation method based on statistical inference for such a finite mixture model with known number of degraded noise components. Our signal detection scheme with multivariate autoregressive models for total noise and the expectation maximization algorithm is applied to maximum a posteriori estimation for multivariate mixtures of noise. Furthermore, a non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is used for an error-correcting code that satisfies the specific run-length limited condition in the proposed system. It shows that the proposed error-correcting and signal detection methods are effective in estimating signal sequences degraded by media noise and in improving the error rate performances with respect to the conventional system using the binary LDPC code and univariate autoregressive model.

Supposing X from a mixture of Gamma distributions, two methods are proposed and results are compared. The first method is based on an hierarchical Bayesian model. The conditional predictive probability of a gene to belong to each group is calculated and the gene is assigned to the group for which this conditional probability is higher. The second method uses EM algorithm to estimate the most likely group label for each gene, that is, to assign the gene to the group which contains it with the higher estimated probability.

J	Bitarafan, A; Rajabi, H				Bitarafan, Ahmed; Rajabi, Hossein			The effect of filtrating and reconstruction method on the left ventricular ejection fraction derived from GSPET: a statistical comparison of angiography and echocardiography	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						ECG-gated SPET; Ejection fraction; Image reconstruction; Filtered backprojection; OSEM	MYOCARDIAL-PERFUSION SPECT; QUANTITATIVE GATED SPECT; 1ST-PASS RADIONUCLIDE ANGIOGRAPHY; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; VOLUME; ACCURACY; TL-201; IMAGES; REPRODUCIBILITY	There are different protocols of reconstruction in myocardial gated imaging that produce different values of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). We attempted to determine how the parameters of reconstruction affect the calculated EF. The results were statistically compared with the values obtained from angiography and echocardiography. In this retrospective study, the data from 23 patients were used. All the patients had the angiographic and the echocardiographic data within 2 weeks before the test. Imaging was performed using a single-head gamma camera using technetium-99 methoxyisobutylisonitrile. The image data were reconstructed using 50 different combinations of the ramp, Hanning, Butterworth, Wiener, and Metz filters. The ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) technique was also examined using 12 combinations of iteration and subset. The calculated EF values were analyzed and compared with the echocardiographic and angiographic results. The backprojection technique produced higher values of EF than those derived from echocardiography and angiography. The OSEM on the other hand produced lower values when compared with echocardiography and angiography. On using the backprojection technique, the maximum correlation between the values derived from gated single-photon emission tomography and echocardiography (r = 0.88, P < 0.01) and angiography (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) was observed when using the Metz filter (full width at half maximum = 5 mm and order = 9) and the Gaussian filter (alpha = 3), respectively. In the case of the OSEM technique, the maximum correlation with both angiography and echocardiography was observed when using the iteration = 2 and the subset = 12. On the average, the backprojection technique produces higher values, and iteration technique produces lower estimation of the EF when compared with angiography and echocardiography.

This work was motivated by the projects of the Visualization Centre of the Eotvos Lorand University, where such problems are to be solved. The system's functions are based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) representation of the images. Image matching is done by the distance measure of the representations, based on the approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the GMMs. The GMMs are estimated with an improved expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that avoids convergence to the boundary of the parameter space. These form the basis of the clustering, where a variant of a genetic algorithm is used. The suggested algorithm is able to work with a large number of images or objects, the grid technology is a useful tool for generating several runs simultaneously.

Although prevalent, classical linear analysis techniques are often numerically fragile in high dimensions due to irrelevant, redundant, and noisy information. We developed a robust Bayesian linear regression algorithm that automatically detects relevant features and excludes irrelevant ones, all in a computationally efficient manner. In comparison with standard linear methods, the new Bayesian method regularizes against overfitting, is computationally efficient (unlike previously proposed variational linear regression methods, is suitable for data sets with large numbers of samples and a very high number of input dimensions) and is easy to use, thus demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. We evaluate our technique on synthetic data sets and on several neurophysiological data sets. For these neurophysiological data sets we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed from neural activity in motor cortices. Results demonstrate the success of our newly developed method, in comparison with other approaches in the literature, and, from the neurophysiological point of view, confirms recent findings on the organization of the motor cortex. Finally, an incremental, real-time version of our algorithm demonstrates the suitability of our approach for real-time interfaces between brains and machines. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume that covariates are missing at random (MAR). We use the generalized linear mixed logistic regression model for the repeated binary responses and then propose a joint model for time-dependent missing covariates using information from different sources. A Monte Carlo EM algorithm is developed for computing the maximum likelihood estimates. We propose an extended version of the AlC criterion to identify the important factors that may explain the binary responses, A real plant dataset is used to motivate and illustrate the proposed methodology.

In fact, we consider the reference prior for the range parameter and an inverse gamma prior for the smoothness parameter. We then propose an attractive and straightforward Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior distribution of the model parameters and achieve Bayesian prediction. In a sensitivity analysis, the importance of the prior choice is assessed. Since the posterior results greatly depend on the prior hyperparameters, the Monte Carlo EM algorithm is applied to determine their maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, we utilize this procedure in the geostatistical prediction of carbon monoxide concentrations in Tehran.

We examine two distinct model families common in population ecology to illustrate our ideas, ring-recovery models and capture-recapture models, and we present the computational advantage of this approach. We discuss also the fact that problems associated with identifiability in the classical framework can be overcome using data augmentation, but highlight the dangers in doing so under both inferential paradigms.

In this paper, we present a class of Bayesian minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) turbo receivers for coded multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Instead of using the EXT to estimate the prior SM, we use it in the posterior Bayesian MMSE estimation of the interfering signals. The estimation accuracy is, therefore, improved, leading to better bit-error-rate (BER) performance from our proposed Bayesian receivers. For the cases that we have studied, the proposed receiver with two iterations has a lower BER than the conventional one with five iterations, thus significantly reducing the receiver processing delay and the implementation complexity. Its superior performance is also demonstrated by the higher detector output mutual information and fewer iterations to achieve convergence, which is obtained from the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis.

The problem of estimating the mass, M(r), within radius r is converted into a problem of estimating a regression function nonparametrically, subject to shape restriction. We represent the restrictions by the interception of quadratic cones and use the second-order cone programming to estimate the unknown parameters. We establish asymptotic results that are used to construct confidence intervals M(r). We apply the technique to new kinematic data for four dwarf galaxies. Results indicate that dark matter dominates the stellar kinematics of these systems at all radii.

J	Wu, JM; Chen, MH; Lin, ZH				Wu, Jiann-Ming; Chen, Meng-Hong; Lin, Zheng-Han			Independent component analysis based on marginal density estimation using weighted Parzen windows	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Blind source separation; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Weighted Parzen window; Entropy; Potts encoding; Mean field annealing; Density estimation; Independent factor analysis	BLIND SEPARATION; MODELS; ALGORITHM; MIXTURE	This Work Proposes a novel algorithm for independent component analysis (ICA) based on marginal density estimation. The proposed ICA algorithm aims to search for an effective demixing matrix as well as weighted Parzen window (WPW) representations for marginal densities of independent components so as to express a factorial joint density for high dimensional observations. Following the linear mixture assumption, independent component analysis is mathematically translated to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of independent components. By using Potts encoding, we express the KL divergence in an approximating form, which is shown to be tractable with respect to the WPW parameters as well as the demixing matrix and can be minimized by two interactive dynamic modules derived by the annealed expectation-maximization method and the natural gradient descent method, respectively. By numerical simulations, we test the proposed ICA algorithm with observations separately sampled from linear mixtures of independent sources and real world signals, including fetal electrocardiograms, mixed facial images and event-related potentials, extensively showing its accuracy and reliability for independent component analysis in comparison with some other popular ICA algorithms.

J	Barquist, L; Holmes, I				Barquist, Lars; Holmes, Ian			xREI: a phylo-grammar visualization webserver	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EVOLUTION; PROTEIN; GENOMES; TREES; SUBSTITUTION; ELEMENTS; DATABASE	Phylo-grammars, probabilistic models combining Markov chain substitution models with stochastic grammars, are powerful models for annotating structured features in multiple sequence alignments and analyzing the evolution of those features. In the past, these methods have been cumbersome to implement and modify. xrate provides means for the rapid development of phylo-grammars (using a simple file format) and automated parameterization of those grammars from training data (via the Expectation Maximization algorithm). xREI (pron.

J	Joernsten, R; Keles, S				Joernsten, Rebecka; Keles, Suenduez			Mixture models with multiple levels, with application to the analysis of multifactor gene expression data	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						clustering; gene expression; mixture model; model selection; profile expectation-maximization	VARIABLE SELECTION	Model-based clustering is a popular tool for summarizing high-dimensional data. With the number of high-throughput large-scale gene expression studies still on the rise, the need for effective data- summarizing tools has never been greater. By grouping genes according to a common experimental expression profile, we may gain new insight into the biological pathways that steer biological processes of interest. Clustering of gene profiles can also assist in assigning functions to genes that have not yet been functionally annotated. In this paper, we propose 2 model selection procedures for model-based clustering. Model selection in model-based clustering has to date focused on the identification of data dimensions that are relevant for clustering. However, in more complex data structures, with multiple experimental factors, such an approach does not provide easily interpreted clustering outcomes. We propose a mixture model with multiple levels, MIX(L), that provides sparse representations both "within" and "between" cluster profiles. We explore various flexible "within-cluster" parameterizations and discuss how efficient parameterizations can greatly enhance the objective interpretability of the generated clusters. Moreover, we allow for a sparse "between-cluster" representation with a different number of clusters at different levels of an experimental factor of interest. This enhances interpretability of clusters generated in multiple-factor contexts. Interpretable cluster profiles can assist in detecting biologically relevant groups of genes that may be missed with less efficient parameterizations. We use our multilevel mixture model to mine a proliferating cell line expression data set for annotational context and regulatory motifs. We also investigate the performance of the multilevel clustering approach on several simulated data sets.

J	Singh, M; Singh, P				Singh, Monica; Singh, Puneetpal			Factor IX gene haplotypes and its relevance for the indirect genetic analysis of haemophilia B in its Indian perspective	BLOOD COAGULATION & FIBRINOLYSIS			English	Article						factor IX gene; haplotypes; India; indirect genetic analysis; linkage disequilibrium; polymorphism	DNA POLYMORPHISMS; CARRIER DETECTION; FACTOR-VIII; POPULATION; FREQUENCIES	In developing countries, especially in those with limited facilities and low budget resources, a reliable approach to carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of haemophilia B might be based on indirect diagnostic strategies. As, the cost-effectiveness of indirect genetic analysis of haemophilia B has been little investigated so far, we here report our experience in India. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of Ddel/intron1, Xmnl/intron 3 and Hhal/3' flanking region of the gene for factor IX (F9) was investigated in 68 individuals (23 haemophilia patients, 18 obligate carriers, 27 probable carriers) from 23 families of haemophilia B. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was done and haplotypes were generated employing the expectation-maximization algorithm. Ddel (+) and (-) allele frequencies were found to be 0.522 and 0.478, respectively, with the highest observed heterozygosity of 46.6% as compared to XmnI (24.4%) and Hhal (42.2%). The frequencies of haplotype III and VI, that is Ddel (+)-Xmnl (-)-Hhal (-) and Ddel (-)-Xmnl (-)-Hhal (-) were observed to be 0.363 and 0.257, respectively. Haplotype III was found to be the most heterogeneous that suggests its efficacy in the indirect genetic analysis of F9 gene. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed no association between Ddel/Hhal (D'= 0.092); however, significant but incomplete linkage disequilibrium was observed in Xmnl/Hhal and Ddel/Xmnl D' = 0709, 0.515, respectively). The overall cumulative polymorphism information content of these three markers increased from about 0.33 to 0.72, which suggested the efficiency of haplotyping of these markers over individual gene analysis in the direction of carrier assessment of haemophilia B in India.

J	Tian, FZ; Yu, J; Huang, HK				Tian Fengzhan; Yu Jian; Huang Houkuan			Learning Bayesian networks with the combination of evolutionary algorithm and EMI method	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Bayesian networks; learning; evolutionary algorithm; EMI method		Most Bayesian network (BN) learning algorithms use EM algorithm to deal with incomplete data. But EM algorithm is of low efficiency due to its iterative parameter refinement, and the problem will become even worse when multiple runs of EM algorithm are needed. Besides, EM algorithm usually converges to local maxima, which also degrades the accuracy of EM based BN learning algorithms. In this paper, we replace EM algorithm used in BN learning tasks with EMI method to deal with incomplete data. EMI is a very efficient method, which estimates probability distributions directly from incomplete data rather than performs iterative refinement of parameters. Base on EMI method, we propose an effective algorithm, namely EMI-EA. EMI-EA algorithm uses EMI method to estimate probability distribution over local structures in BNs, and evaluates BN structures with a variant of MDL scoring function. To avoid getting into local maxima of the search process, EMI-EA evolves BN structures with an Evolutionary algorithm (EA). The experimental results on Alarm, Asia and an examplar network show that EMI-EA algorithm outperforms EM-EA for all samples and E-TPDA algorithms for small and middle size of samples in terms of accuracy. In terms of efficiency, EMI-EA is comparable with E-TPDA algorithm and much more efficient than EM-EA algorithm. EMI-EA also outperforms EM-EA and M-V algorithm when learning BNs with hidden variables.

We then propose a new exact algorithm to compute posteriors by improving the PMDA-Exact using the sampling-wise IBF. If the posterior mode is available from the EM algorithm, then these two algorithms compute posteriors well and eliminate the convergence problem of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We show good performances of our methods by some examples.

Due to the mathematical relationship between incidence and prevalence, several methods have been developed to obtain incidence based on prevalence. The present study didactically describes a method to estimate age and time incidence, based on: repeated measurements of prevalence for an event, events related to the individual's age; and events with the characteristics of a chronic disease. The method was used to analyze literacy in the Brazilian population, using prevalence by age obtained from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) for 1981, 1985, 1989, 1992, 1995, and 2001, and allowed obtaining literacy incidence estimates for ages 5 to 20 years, for the years 1960 through 2001. The method adjusts incidence parameters for age and time with the help of a generalized linear model for categorical data and uses the EM algorithm to obtain non-observed data.
