This work formulates the dynamic traffic flows by a parameter-driven discrete time series model. A modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters of the model. The conditional expectation given y in the E step of the EM algorithm is replaced by the marginal expectation. Applications of the model and the algorithm are illustrated by analyzing the traffic flow data. Through the data collected by the detectors, the traffic condition about the network can be estimated, smoothed and predicted. This model can be embedded in a chip for signal control and queue management procedures of ITSs.

A multi-compartment anthropomorphic phantom was setup to mimic whole-body FDG cancer imaging and scanned twelve times in 3D mode. Eight of the scans had twenty-six Ge-68 "shell-less" lesions (6, 8, 10, 12, 16 mm diam.) placed throughout the phantom with various target:background ratios. This provided lesion-present and lesion-absent datasets with known truth appropriate for evaluating lesion detectability by localization receiver operating characteristics (LROC) methods. Four reconstruction schemes were studied: (1) Fourier rebinning (FORE) followed by 2D attenuation-weighted ordered-subsets expectation-maximization; (2) fully-3D AW-OSEM; (3) fully-3D ordinary-Poisson line-of-response (LOR-)OSEM; and (4) fully-3D LOR-OSEM with an accurate point-spread function (PSF) model. Two forms of LROC analysis were performed. First, a channelized non-prewhitened (CNPW) observer was used to optimize processing parameters (number of iterations, post-reconstruction filter) for the human observer study. Human observers then rated each image and selected the most-likely lesion location. The area under the LROC curve (A(LROC)) and the probability of correct localization were used as figures-of-merit. The results of the human observer study found no statistically significant difference between FORE and AW-OSEM3D) (A(LROC)=0.41 and 0.36, respectively), an increase in lesion detection performance for LOR-OSEM3D (A(LROC)=0.45, p=0.076), and additional improvement with the use of the PSF model (A(LROC)=0.55, p=0.024). The numerical CNPW observer provided the same rankings in performance among algorithms, but obtained different values of ALROC. These results show improved lesion detection performance for the reconstruction algorithms with more sophisticated statistical and imaging models as compared to the previous-generation algorithms.

Robust statistics based expectation-maximization algorithm for channel tracking in OFDM systems	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-14	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2007)	JUN 24-28, 2007	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	IEEE			DISPERSIVE FADING CHANNELS	Decision directed channel tracking (DDCT) at fade rates in OFDM based systems is addressed in this Existing DDCT algorithms like the (EM) algorithm [1] suffer from error propagation and poor performance when applied to large frames at high rates. We propose a robust EM algorithm which mitigates effect of error propagation and is able to track the channel in decision directed mode even over frame durations 2-3 fade cycles. This EM algorithm uses the Huber's cost in the maximization step instead of the non-robust least or Kalman cost function. Further, the noise variance is using the robust median absolute deviation estimator instead of the standard maximum likelihood estimator. The proposed robust EM based DDCT scheme has a better error rate and MSE performance when compared to Kalman filter based pilot assisted channel tracking scheme with a 6.25% pilot overhead, even at a normalized Doppler of 0.04.

Many proposed fuzzy models use one-dimensional fuzzy sets and partition multidimensional input-spaces by Cartesian products of these univariate membership functions. The drawback of this approach is the complexity of the model in terms of the number of rules, which grows exponentially with the number of inputs (curse of dimensionality). Furthermore, decomposition errors which are detrimental to the performance of the model can be occurred. In order to avoid such drawbacks, it is desirable to work with multidimensional membership functions directly for the modeling of multidimensional and highly nonlinear systems. This paper proposes a clustering based identification of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models. The clusters are obtained by the expectation-maximization (EM) identification of a mixture of Gaussians. The proposed method is applied to well-known benchmark problems, and the obtained results are compared with results from the existing fuzzy clustering based identification techniques.

A series of improvements are made to these ingredients of the general framework of language models which is used in domain-specific information retrieval. First, an EM algorithm is proposed to estimate the importance weights of query terms, and the Bayesian smoothing is used to compute the productive probabilities of important terms. Next, a new algorithm based on Dynamic Bayesian Network is proposedfor obtaining the explanation probabilities between terms. Experiment shows that the improved model performs remarkably better for domain-specific information retrieval than some traditional retrieval techniques, and the extended framework has good expansibility.

SEM algorithm is based on the stochastic, expectation, and maximization steps to iteratively estimate the parameters of the classes in many applications including hyperspectral data cube (HDC). However, the application of SEM algorithm for classification of hyperspectral imagery becomes impractical because of the huge amount of data (e.g. 512 x 512 x 220). To avoid this problem, we proposed a preprocessing step for SEM algorithm to fast classify the data cube formulating an Object Detection algorithm based on SEM for detecting small objects in hyperspectral imagery. In the proposed preprocessing step, we utilize the exponential of Euclidian Distance for rapidly separation of data cube into a potential object of interest class and a background class. Then, SEM algorithm is employed to classify the potential object of interest class further into classes to detect the object of interest class. In the conducted experiments using real hyperspectral imagery, the results of the proposed algorithm show comparatively low false alarm rate even with a challenging scenarios.

The standard solution of having many random starting points for the EM algorithm is often too expensive computationally. We propose to obtain better starting points for EM by splitting and merging components in models with already estimated parameters. This way we extend our previous work, where only a component splitting was used and the need for a component merging was noticed. We discuss theoretical properties of a component merging. We propose an algorithm that learns latent class models by performing component splitting and merging. In the experiments with real-world data sets, our algorithm in a majority of cases performs better than the standard algorithm. A promising extension would be to apply our method for learning cardinalities and parameters of hidden variables in Bayesian networks.

Successful data mining applications require good quality data. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning technique that smoothes out a substantial amount of attribute noise and handles missing attribute values as well. Our approach is inspired by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It iteratively refines each attribute-value using a predictor constructed from the previously refined values (known values in the first iteration). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in smoothing out attribute noise and corroborate the efficacy of our technique by showing improved classification accuracy on a number of real world data sets from UCI repository [2]. Moreover, we show that our technique can easily be adapted to fill up missing attribute-values in classification problems more effectively than other standard approaches.

Differently from the conventional EM based algorithms, the proposed algorithm can track multiple sound sources without knowing their starting points. Moreover, an idea of the group tracking is applied to the particle filtering algorithm so that better tracking performances can be obtained. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed algorithm.

The receiver is an optimized MAP Turbo processor that exploits information from all available transmissions in an optimized way, using only the minimum required number of pilots for initial channel estimation. Our model does not account for CFO or transmitter non-linearities. The system uses an imbedded pilot structure in the frequency domain to initially estimate the channel. Further improvement of these estimates takes place based on the EM algorithm and the available received vectors, including all antennas and transmissions of the OFDM word. We show that this configuration achieves high gains compared to a standard ARQ system with packet combining and soft decision decoding of a higher constraint length, nu = 7 convolutional code. Finally, the potential of the approach in more realistic models (e.g. with CFO or nonlinear transmission) is established due to the minimum number of pilots employed herein.

Therefore, localizing multiple moving sounds and human faces is necessary so that robots can locate a desired person. For sound source localization, we used a cross-power spectrum phase analysis (CSP) method and showed that CSP can localize sound sources only using two microphones and does not need impulse response data. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was shown to enable a robot to cope with multiple moving sound sources. For face localization, we developed a method that can reliably detect several faces using the skin color classification obtained by using the EM algorithm. To deal with a change in color state according to illumination condition and various skin colors, the robot can obtain new skin color features of faces detected by OpenCV, an open vision library, for detecting human faces. Finally, we developed a probability based method to integrate auditory and visual information and to produce a reliable tracking path in real time. Furthermore, the developed system chose and tracked people while dealing with various background noises that are considered loud, even in the daily-life environments.

To track moving people in daily-life environments, localizing multiple moving sounds is necessary so that robots can locate talkers. However, the conventional method requires an array of microphones and impulse response data.

The CSP can localize sound sources using only two microphones and does not need impulse response data. Moreover, the EM algorithm increases the system's effectiveness and allows it to cope with multiple sound sources. We confirmed that the proposed method performs better than the conventional method. In addition, we added a particle filter to the tracking process to produce a reliable tracking path and the particle filter is able to integrate audio-visual information effectively. Furthermore, the applied particle filter is able to track people while dealing with various noises that are even loud sounds in the daily-life environments.

Bayesian network is a powerful framework to infer gene pathways. We developed a novel Bayesian network, in which we use Gaussian mixture models to describe continuous gene expression data and learn gene pathways. Mixture parameters were estimated using an EM algorithm, while the optimal number of mixture component for each gene node and the optimal network topology best supported by the data were identified using the Bayesian Information criterion (BIC). We applied the proposed approach to a histone pathway in yeast and to a less explored circadian rhythm pathway in honeybee. The performance of the proposed approach was compared against alternative Bayesian network algorithms that either discretize the gene expression information or use single distribution instead of mixtures. Evaluation shows that our approach outperforms other approaches in terms of more accurate inference of the known network and can effectively predict gene pathways with different topology using continuous data. In addition, the estimated mixture model can facilitate an intuitive description of the gene node behavior, thus enhancing the interpretation of the inferred network.

This approach is shown to successfully capture the global shape variations of objects like faces, cars and hands. However the AAM representation cannot deal with articulated objects, like cows and horses. We therefore extend our approach to a representation that allows for multiple parts with the relationships between them modeled by a Markov Random Field (MRF). Finally, we propose an algorithm for efficiently performing inference on part-based MRF object models by speeding up the estimation of observation potentials. We use manually collected landmarks to compare the alternative models and quantify learning performance.

This automated process is carried out within a multi-resolution framework that follows a coarse-to-fine strategy. Additionally, a novel segmentation approach using the Fisher-Rao criterion, embedded in the generic Expectation-Maximization algorithm, is employed. Multiple decisions from a classifier group are aggregated using a two-step classifier combiner that consists of a majority voting process and a weighted sum rule using priori classifier accuracies. The developed system, when tested on 14,616 image tiles, had the best overall accuracy of 96.89%. Furthermore, multi-resolution scheme combined with automated feature selection process resulted in 34% savings in computational costs on average when compared to a previously developed single-resolution system. Therefore, the performance of this system shows good promise for the computer-aided pathological assessment of the neuroblastic differentiation in clinical practice.

EM based channel estimation and decoding in FDM turbo mast detectors	2007 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & NETWORKING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	MAR 11-15, 2007	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			OFDM SYSTEMS; BLAST	Channel parameter estimation is an important task for coherent detection and constitutes a key challenge in MIMO systems. Turbo-Bell Labs Laboratory Architecture Systems (T-BLAST) with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to improve communication quality and capacity. In this paper, we propose a modified Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for T-BLAST systems in frequency selective channels. It is based on a combination of data and pilot based channel estimate with approximated coefficients. These coefficients are obtained by resolving an optimization problem using the Lagrangian Multipliers. The algorithm we present takes advantage of the exchange message between the two Soft Input Soft Output (SISO) modules of the Turbo receiver to attain the best estimation performance. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through the simulation of an OFDM T-BLAST system with two-transmit and three-receive antennas.	[Kora, A.

EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ALGORITHM	Correction for tissue attenuation is the most important factor affecting the Poisson characteristics of positron emission tomography (PET) data. Although a weighting scheme incorporating the attenuation correction factors in the update rule of expectation-maximization (EM) image reconstruction algorithm has previously been presented [1], no exact distribution of pre-corrected measurements has been proposed to date. This paper introduces a fixed multiplicative Poisson distribution to model the PET data compensated for the effect of photon attenuation. We show that the attenuation-weighted EM update rule can be derived in a formal way via maximizing the log-likelihood of pre-corrected measurements. We use the proposed distribution to develop a joint penalized-likelihood approach for reconstruction of regional time activity curves (TACs) and regions-of-interest from dynamic brain PET projection data. The new method yields lower error in reconstructed TACs compared to the joint reconstruction approach based on ordinary Poisson approximation.

Inspired by spectroscopic images of solar flares, which are very intense at some energies but very weak at others, we develop a multiscale intensity estimation method which can adapt to spatial inhomogeneities, spectral emission lines, and large spectral dynamic ranges. This approach exploits the fact that boundaries between different physical structures exist at every spectral band, even when the contrast is very small in some of those bands. Incorporating this denoising method into a generalized expectation-maximization method allows very faint features to be accurately reconstructed from blurry, photon-limited observations.

This model can apply for the choice problems of multi services and multi brands under various decision-making processes. In addition to the model based on EM algorithm, we tried some conventional models and compared them. The model based on EM algorithm enables us to know what kinds of customers are classified into a certain class. Moreover, we could construct more accuracy model than conventional model and found the existence of two decision-making processes.

Such mismatches could be caused by heterogeneous cameras and/or different shooting positions of the cameras. In particular, we consider focus mismatches across views, i.e., such that different portions of a video frame can undergo different blurriness/sharpness changes with respect to the corresponding areas in frames from the other views. We propose an adaptive filtering approach for cross-view prediction in multi-view video coding. The disparity fields are exploited as an estimation of scene depth. An Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to classify the disparity vectors into groups. Based on the classification result, a video frame is partitioned into regions with different scene-depth levels. Finally, for each scene-depth level, a two-dimensional filter is designed to minimize the average residual energy of cross-view prediction for all blocks in the class. The resulting filters are applied to the reference frames to generate better matches for cross-view prediction. Simulation results show that, when encoding across views, the proposed method achieves up to 0.8dB gain over current H.264 video coding.

The typical maneuvering models, as described, essentially, are prior models and use fixed and constant evolved matrix and designed noise level for whole filtering procedure Actually, the motion of target is always too complicated to be prior modeled as a fixed form meanwhile, Q used to reflect the mis-match error between the mathematic model and the actual maneuvering mode, thus is time-varying and severely influenced by the environment around the target Therefore, the prior F and Q can not characterize the maneuvering mode exactly, hence, by assumption that the state evolution and the likelihood of measurements data can be represented by Gaussian distribution, the method of identifying F and Q online is developed Comparing with the standard IMM filtering, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and filtering precision can be improved to some extent.

This algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method. A complete Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis of the proposed algorithms is also given in this paper. Because this algorithm can provide accurate estimation of channel conditions and synchronization parameter for DS-CDMA receivers, even with a simple equalization module, for example, a one-tap multiplier based frequency domain equalizer (FDE), good performance can be achieved at a low cost.

Both of the PSF and the variance of the observation noise have to be identified from the turbulence degraded images before restoring them. An approach of identification and restoration for the turbulence degraded images based on the parameter estimation arc, proposed The turbulence degraded image is expressed as an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. The maximum likelihood (ML) approach is used to the identification of the ARMA parameters. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to optimize the nonlinear likelihood function in an efficient way. This identification and restoration algorithm is used to the wind tunnel experimenting images, and the experimental results show that the restoration effect are improved obviously. The true image and the PSF are identified in the process of identifying the ARMA parameters.

Evolutionary tree reconstruction using structural expectation maximization and homotopy	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						evolutionary tree reconstruction; maximum likelihood; structural expectation maximization; homotopy method	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; MONTE-CARLO; INFERENCE; ALGORITHM; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION	The evolutionary tree reconstruction algorithm called SEMPHY using structural expectation maximization (SEM) is an efficient approach but has local optimality problem. To improve SEMPHY, a new algorithm named HSEMPHY based on the homotopy continuation principle is proposed in the present study for reconstructing evolutionary trees. The HSEMPHY algorithm computes the condition probability of hidden variables in the structural through maximum entropy principle. It can reduce the influence of the initial value of the final resolution by simulating the process of the homotopy principle and by introducing the homotopy parameter P. HSEMPHY is tested on real datasets and simulated dataset to compare with SEMPHY and the two most popular reconstruction approaches PHYML and RAXML. Experimental results show that HSEMPHY is at least as good as PHYML and RAXML and is very robust to poor starting trees.

The enhanced image density of the tagged colonic materials causes a significant partial volume (PV) effect into the colon wall as well as the lumen space (air or CO(2)). The PV effect into the colon wall can "bury" polyps of small size by increasing their image densities to a noticeable level, resulting in false negatives. It can also create false positives when PV effect goes into the lumen space. Modeling the PV effect for mixture-based image segmentation has been a research topic for many years. This paper presents the practical implementation of our newly developed statistical image segmentation framework, which utilizes L the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm to estimate (1) tissue fractions in each image voxel and (2) statistical 14 model parameters of the image under the principle of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). This partial-volume expectation-maximization (PV-EM)mixture-based MAP image segmentation pipeline was tested on 52 CTC datasets; downloaded from the website of the VC Screening, Resource Center, with each dataset consisting of two scans of supine and prone positions, resulting in 104 CT volume images. The cleansed lumens by the automated PV-EM image segmentation algorithm were visualized with comparison to our previous work, with the gain achieved mainly in the following three aspects: (1) the tissue fraction information of those voxels with PV effect have been well preserved, (2) the problem of incomplete cleansing of tagged materials in our previous work has been mitigated, and (3) the interference caused by small bowel was significantly released.

Implementation and efficiency of virtual colonoscopy requires rigorous cleansing of colon prior to the examination. Electronic colon cleansing is a new technology that virtually clean stool residues tagged with contrast agents from the obtained computed tomography (CT) images. From our previous studies on electronic colon cleansing, we found that residual stool and fluid are often problematic for optimal viewing of colon. In this paper, we focus on developing a model-based approach to correct both non-uniformity and partial volume effects appearing in regions of bone and tagged stool residues. A statistical method for maximum a posterior probability (MAP) was developed to identify and virtually clean the tagged stool residuals. In calculating the solution, the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed. Experimental results of electronic colon cleansing are promising.

The hidden Markov tree (HMT) model captures the key features of the joint probability density of the wavelet coefficients of real-world data. One potential drawback to the HMT framework is the deficiency for taking account of intrascale correlations that exist among neighboring wavelet coefficients. In this paper, We propose to develop a joint hidden Markov model by fusing the wavelet Bayesian denoising technique with an image regularization procedure based on HMT and Markov random field (MRF). The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate hyperparameters and specify the mixture model. The noise-free wavelet coefficients are finally estimated by a shrinkage function based on local weighted averaging of the Bayesian estimator. It is shown that the joint method outperforms lee filter and standard HMT techniques in terms of the integrative measure of the equivalent number of looks (ENL) and Pratt's figure of merit(FOM), especially when dealing with speckle noise in large variance.

On the other hand. evolutionary computational technique is characterized as a soil computing learning method with its roots in the theory of evolution. During the past decade, SVM has been commonly used as a classifier for various applications. The evolutionary computation has also attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition and has shown significant performance improvement on a variety of applications. However, there has been no comparison of the two methods. In this paper, first we propose an improvement of a coevolutionary Computational classification algorithm, called Improved Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized EM (I-CFS-EM) algorithm. It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds Lip the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase. We also give an intensive analysis of the pros and cons of both approaches.

While this typically relies on feature point correspondence, the epipolar constraint can also be used for improving the accuracy of correspondence. We propose a probabilistic framework for estimating the epiploar geometry, in which the geometry and the feature correspondence are estimated iteratively at the same time. Using the EM algorithm to maximize a posteriori, our approach updates feature correspondence with estimated epipolar geometry. The correspondence is further improved with local diffusion on a prior Markov Random Field model. In turn, more accurate epipolar geometry is recovered. Experiments show this approach produces more accurate fundamental matrix compared with typical methods and can handle some challenging situations such as view rotation and scale changes.

The main contribution of this work is the proposal of using nonlocal sparse representations to characterize the prior constraint of undamaged audio. When combined with observation constraint, we obtain an alternating projection based audio concealment algorithm which recovers missing data in a parallel and distributed fashion. We also present two extensions of PDAC for more challenging situations: expectation-maximization PDAC (EM-PDAC) to handle consecutive packet loss and filter-bank PDAC (FB-PDAC) to repair complex music signals. Excellent preliminary experimental results are reported for a wide range of audio materials and loss conditions.

Most important clinical features are derived from the borders of a region of interest, which reflects the shape characteristics and volumetric variation of the target. The partial volume (PV) effect renders a significant error for current hard segmentation which assigns a single tissue label to each image voxel. We have proposed an expectation-maximization (EM) framework for soft image segmentation which aims to quantify the tissue mixture percentages in each voxel. By imposing a priori Markov random field (MRF) penalty on the spatial distribution of each tissue mixture, the algorithm searches a maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for the tissue model parameters of the given image and the tissue mixture percentages in each voxel. This work studied the sensitivity of the iterative MAP-EM algorithm to the initial estimate and the properties of its convergence for the estimation of the model parameters and tissue mixtures in the presence of noise. By computer simulations, it was found that the estimation of the model parameters is not sensitive to the parameters' initial estimate (even with greater than 100% error) if the initial estimate of the tissue mixtures is within 10% error from the phantom values. The MRF penalty on the tissue mixture spatial distribution is necessary to ensure the convergence of the iterative tissue mixture estimation in the case of noise level proportional to mean (i.e., similar to Poisson noise). The noise level and initial estimate error are fully within practical conditions, demonstrating that the MAP-EM algorithm is potentially valid in practice. It provides a theoretical or deterministic solution to the PV effect, and its successful implementation could improve quantitative volumetric and feature analyses.

Variability across trials may reflect habituation, fatigue, or changes in cognitive states of the brain. A wide range of trial-to-trial variability can be represented using the LDSR model, including the constant response (CR) model as a limiting case. The spatiotemporal signal waveform is assumed constant but unknown, and is represented using a linear combination of spatial and temporal basis functions. The background noise is assumed to be spatially correlated with unknown covariance matrix. We obtain the maximum-likelihood estimates of the amplitude variability and signal waveform via a generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The expectation step involves a Kalman fixed-interval smoother which tracks the trial-to-trial amplitude variability while the maximization step estimates the signal waveform, spatial noise covariance, and LDSR model parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model using both real and simulated evoked response data. ne performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of the mean squared error of the amplitude estimates.

Specifically, it encodes both spatial and color information in a nonparametric kernel density estimator, and incorporates local MRF constraints and global pose inferences to propagate beliefs over image space iteratively to determine a coherent segmentation. This ensures the segmented humans resemble the shapes of human poses. Additionally, a layered occlusion model and a probabilistic occlusion reasoning method are proposed to handle segmentation of multiple humans in occlusion.

However, knowing the number and length of the original flows is necessary for some applications. This paper provides a novel method that uses flow statistics formed from sampled packet stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of flows in the unsampled stream. First, flows are classified as small (S) or large (L) based on their probability that no packet is sampled. For large flows we use maximum likelihood estimation to infer their length distribution, and for short flows we apply least square method. The theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of this method is well under control, and the experiment results demonstrate the inferred distributions are as accurate as EM algorithm.

To describe accurate speed, flow and density of a inulticlass users traffic flow, an adequate model is needed. Mostly, user's classes are determined by types of vehicles. However, it is unrealistic to consider drivers with the same type of vehicles have the same driving behavior. Conventionally, classifying driving behavior is obtained through tracking trace of individual vehicles, experimenting by driving simulator or inquiring by questionnaire. It costs a lot and may produce bias because of the design of questionnaire or experiment. Therefore, a new method, which is based on pattern recognition technique, is proposed to classify driving behavior in multiclass user traffic flow. In this study, driving behavior, which performs as speed distributions, is assumed to be Gaussian distributions. According to the assumption, the expectation-maximization algorithm is employed to train and classify different driving behavior. With the method, a economical and automatic way for traffic data processing and parameter extracting is obtained.

Direct-conversion radio frequency transceivers are appealing because they avoid costly IF analog components. This kind of transceivers imply analog RF I/Q separation. The mismatch between the analog components in the in-phase and quadrature branches introduces an unwanted in-band interference. Unfortunately, OFDM-based systems are very sensitive to I/Q mismatch, mostly when high order modulation schemes are applied. A digital compensation of this unwanted effect is required. In this paper, we developed an iterative method for estimating and compensating the transmitter/receiver frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance jointly with the propagation channel in the frequency domain. The new estimation technique resorts to the iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm in order converge to the ML estimation for both channel and IQ imbalance coefficients in presence of unknown transmitted data symbols. Although the the estimation may be perform in the absence of known pilot symbols, the algorithm provides flexibility in terms of pilot sequence, allocation and load in order to improve its convergence. An advanced low complexity equalizer is proposed which compensates for the frequency-dependent IQ imbalance. Simulation results show optimal performance even in the absence of any pilot symbol and large IQ mismatches. The proposed technique enables the system to achieve high SNRs.

The parameters of the model are estimated using expectation-maximization algorithm. The scheme allows the decoding to be automatically adapted to attacks that the watermarked images have undergone and, in consequence, to improve the decoding accuracy. Experiments on a QIM based watermarking system have clearly verified the significant improvement of the decoding accuracy achieved by the proposed maximum likelihood decoding in comparison to conventional threshold decoding.

Though we can solve this kind of model selection problem with some statistical criteria such as the minimum description length (MDL) through implementing the EM algorithm, the process of evaluating these criteria may incur a large computational cost. From competitive learning perspective, some more efficient approaches such as rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL) have also been developed for unsupervised image segmentation. However, the segmentation results are not satisfactory and the object of interest may be merged with other regions, since the RPCL algorithm is sensitive to the rival learning rate. In order to solve such problems, we then propose an iterative entropy regularized likelihood (ERL) learning algorithm for unsupervised image segmentation based on the finite mixture model, which can make automatic model selection through introducing entropy regularization into maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. Some segmentation experiments on the Corel image database further demonstrate that the iterative ERL learning algorithm outperforms the MDL based EM (MDL-EM) algorithm and the RPCL algorithm, and leads to some promising results.

We have proposed an entropy regularized likelihood (ERL) learning principle for the finite mixtures to solve this model selection problem under regularization theory. In this paper, we further give an asymptotic analysis of the ERL learning, and find that the global minimization of the ERL function in a simulated annealing way (i.e., the regularization factor is gradually reduced to zero) leads to automatic model selection on the finite mixtures with a good parameter estimation. As compared with the EM algorithm, the ERL learning can go across the local minima of the negative likelihood and keep robust with respect to initialization. The simulation experiments then prove our theoretic analysis.

The model proposed comprises two phases. First, the model structure is initialized in a constructive offline fashion, via an Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM). In the second phase the system is modified dynamically, via adding and pruning operators. At this stage, we propose a recursive learning algorithm, which is based on the EM optimization technique. This online algorithm determines automatically the number of rules necessary at each step. In this way, the model structure and parameters are updated during the adaptive training. The adaptive learning process reduces model complexity and defines automatically its structure providing an efficient model. The proposed approach is applied to build a time series model for monthly streamflow forecasting. The performance of the approach is compared with conventional models used to forecast streamflows. Results show similar errors, however, the suggested model presents a simpler and more parsimonious structure.

The model proposed is based on Takagi-Sugeno system and it comprises two phases. First, a fuzzy rule base structure is initialized and adjusted via the Expectation Maximization optimization technique (EM). In the second phase the initial system is modified and the structure is determined in a constructive fashion. This phase implements a constructive version of the EM algorithm, as well as adding and pruning operators. The constructive learning process reduces model complexity and defines automatically the structure of the system, providing an efficient time series model. The performance of the proposed model is verified for two series of the reduced data set at the Neural Forecasting Competition, for one to eighteen steps ahead forecasting. Results show the effectiveness of the constructive time series model.

Additionally, in the initial codebook generating procedure, the PNN algorithm is used to reduce LBG algorithm's sensitivity to initial codebook. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only significantly improves codebook quality, but also preserves most details of the original image. An even more important feature is that the proposed algorithm is robust to common image processing operations such as cropping, sharpening and filtering.

The proposed 2D-HMM model can capture, for example, dependency among diagonal states, which can be critical in many image processing, applications. A new Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm suitable for estimation of the new model is derived, where a novel General Forward-Backward (GFB) algorithm is proposed for recursive estimation of the model parameters. A new conditional-independent subset-state sequence structure decomposition is proposed for the 21) Viterbi algorithm. The new model can be applied to many areas such as trajectory classification and image segmentation. Application to aerial image segmentation shows the superiority of our model compared to the existing 2D-HMM model.

These detectors are based on modeling the image using Student-t statistics. As a result, due to the generative properties of the Student-t density function, such models are spatially adaptive and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm can be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of their parameters. Using these image models detectors based on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio and Rao tests are derived for this problem. Numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate the properties of these detectors and compared them with previously proposed detectors.

It consists of a probabilistic model of interaural level and phase differences and an EM algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of this model. By assigning points in the interaural spectrogram probabilistically to sources with the best-fitting parameters and then estimating the parameters of the sources from the points assigned to them, the system is able to separate and localize more sound sources than there are available channels. It is also able to estimate frequency-dependent level differences of sources in a mixture that correspond well to those measured in isolation. In experiments in simulated anechoic and reverberant environments, the proposed system improved the signal-to-noise ratio of target sources by 2.7 and 3.4dB more than two comparable algorithms on average.

Pattern recognition, image analysis, and morphometrics have been the major contributors to this area but now bioinformatics is driving the subject as well, and new challenges are emerging; also the methods of pattern recognition are evolving for bioinformatics. Shape analysis for labelled landmarks is now Moving to the new challenges of unlabelled landmarks motivated by these new applications. ICP, EM algorithms, etc. are well used in image analysis but now Bayesian methods are coming into the arena. Dynamic Bayesian networks are other developments. We will discuss the problem of averaging, image deformation, projective shape and Bayesian alignment. The aim of this talk will be to convince the scientists that statistical shape analysis is pivotal to the modern pattern recognition.

By exploiting motion present in the environment, our approach is able to recover a probabilistic model of the sensor network connectivity graph and the underlying traffic trends. We employ a reasoning system made up of a stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm and a higher level search strategy employing the principle of Occam's Razor to look for the simplest solution explaining the data. The technique is assessed through numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a real sensor network.

Several authors proposed unsupervised methods to draw automatically VOIs in PET studies. Among them, Wong proposed a k-means approach [1] and Brankov proposed Expectation-Maximization methods based on the similarity metrics [2], and compared his methods to others [1; 3; 4]. We have designed an automated segmentation method, the Local Means Analysis (LMA), based on local differences in the pharmacokinetics. The method is validated on simulated rat phantom images that include physiological movements, as well as on a real dataset of dynamic PET images acquired in rats.

The original pointsets are embedded in a spectral representation and the actual matching is carried out in the embedded space. We analyze the advantages of this choice as well as the reasons for which the task remains a difficult one. In particular, we show that although embedded-space matching still has intrinsic combinatorial difficulties, it can be solved by searching for an optimal orthogonal transformation that aligns the two shape embeddings. Relying on the model based clustering formalism, we propose a probabilistic formulation which casts the matching into an EM algorithm. Outliers are properly handled by the algorithm and a simple strategy is adopted to initialize it. Experiments are performed with three embedding methods (Isomap, LLE, and Laplacian embedding) and with 3-D voxelsets representing a human-motion sequence.

In particular we show that the problem is equivalent to aligning two sets of points under an orthogonal transformation acting onto the d-dimensional embeddings. The method may well be viewed as belonging to the model-based clustering framework and is implemented as an EM algorithm that alternates between the estimation of correspondences between data-points and the estimation of an optimal alignment transformation. Correspondences are initialized by embedding one set of datapoints onto the other one through out-of-sample extension. Results for pairs of voxelsets representing moving persons are presented. Empirical evidence on the influence of the dimension of the embedding space is provided, suggesting that working with higher-dimensional spaces helps matching in challenging real-world scenarios, without collateral effects on the convergence.

Forward modeling of the observed signal and prior information or constraints on the solution are needed. Many types of constraints have been considered. However, a general framework is required that can accommodate for multiple priors and enables the evaluation of their contribution. With this in mind, we developed an empirical Bayesian framework based on hierarchical linear models. Our approach entails the estimation of both the expected source distribution and its conditional variance, the latter being constrained by an empirically determined mixture of prior variance components corresponding to the constraints one wants to introduce. Finally, a second level of inference based on Bayesian model selection enables one to compare different combinations of priors. We describe here the methodological framework, the estimation scheme and illustrate its application on a single subject MEG data set.

There are two novel aspects of the algorithm: it seeks to explicitly reduce the number of nonzero parameters in the measure to eliminate noninformative or useless information sources and it uses a Bayesian model for parameter estimation which has not been previously applied to the fuzzy measure learning problem. The method uses a hierarchical model that implements a sparsity promotion algorithm through a Gibbs sampler. This approach builds on the methods proposed by Figueiredo et. al which uses Expectation Maximization (EM) to maximize the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) criterion under a distribution that promotes sparsity. Additional constraints are needed to satisfy the requirements of fuzzy measures. Figueiredo's algorithm does not have a mechanism for imposing these constraints. The constraints are imposed by sequentially exploring the lattice tree of the power set and requiring that each fuzzy measure value assigned to a set lies in the domain of a truncated Gaussian determined by the fuzzy measures of supersets of the set under consideration.

At best, the standard software or methods will no longer be directly applicable when data are missing, incomplete or irregularly spaced (e.g., as with wavelets). Self-consistency is a very general and powerful statistical principle for dealing with such problems. Conceptually it is extremely appealing, for it is essentially a mathematical formalization of iterating common-sense "trial-and-error" methods until no more improvement is possible. Mathematically it is elegant, with one fixed-point equation to solve and a general projection theorem to establish optimality. Practically it is straightforward to program because it directly uses the regular/complete-data method for iteration. Its major disadvantage is that it can be computationally intensive. However, increasingly efficient (approximate) implementations are being discovered, such as for wavelet de-noising with hard and soft thresholding. This brief overview summarizes the author's keynote presentation on those points, based on joint work with Thomas Lee on wavelet applications and with Zhan Li on the theoretical properties of the self-consistent estimators.

Multi-person tracking requires re-identification of a person when he/she leaves one field of view, and later appears at another. For this, we use appearance cues. Under the assumption that all observations of a single person are Gaussian distributed, the observation model in our approach consists of a Mixture of Gaussians. In this paper we propose a distributed approach for learning this MoG, where every camera learns from both its own observations and communication with other cameras. We present the Multi-Observations Newscast EM algorithm for this, which is an adjusted version of the recently developed Newscast EM. The presented algorithm is tested on artificial generated data and on a collection of real-world observations gathered by a system of cameras in an office building.

Methods: An explicit formula for estimating the IR functions from observations of multivariate input processes of the linear systems and the corresponding counting process (output process) is derived utilizing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Results: The validity of the estimation formula was verified through Monte Carlo simulations in which two presynaptic spike trains and one postsynaptic spike train were assumed to be observable. The IR functions estimated on the basis of the proposed identification method were close to the true IR functions. Conclusions: The proposed method will play an important role in identifying the input-output relationship of pre- and postsynaptic neural spike trains in practical situations.

In the present work we study by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations the effects of the finite spatial resolution and the limited number of counts, i.e. the statistical noise, on the reconstructed image contrast of numerical phantoms. These phantoms, of simple geometry, mimic the tumor (specific) and the normal tissue (non specific) boron concentrations. The simulated projection data were reconstructed using the expectation-maximization maximum-likelihood algorithm. These studies will help in the improvement of BNCT dosimetry.

In spectral analysis, acoustic energies in spectrogram are clustered into acoustic objects (i.e., music notes) with our method called Harmonic-Temporal-structured Clustering (HTC) utilizing EM algorithm over a structured Gaussian mixture with constraints of harmonic structure and temporal smoothness. After onset and offset timings are found from separated energies of music notes through note power envelope modeling to obtain the piano-roll representation, the rhythm and tempo are simultaneously recognized and estimated in terms of maximum posterior probability given a probabilistic note duration models with HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and probabilistic "rhythm vocabulary." Variable tempo is also modeled by a smooth analytic curve. Rhythm recognition and tempo estimation is alternately performed to iteratively maximize the joint posterior probability. Experimental results are also shown.

To achieve this capacity, perfect channel knowledge must be known at the receiver. When mobility is involved, the channel varies with time and has to be estimated precisely. Conventional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used for tracking the channel parameters but as the number of antennas increase, the EM algorithm has to simultaneously track many parameters and this results in slower convergence. We propose a Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-Maximization (SAGE) algorithm for tracking channel changes for a time-selective fading channel which has faster convergence than the EM algorithm. We show the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the SAGE algorithm when concatenated with a low complexity Multi-Dimensional Parity Check (MDPQ code. We further propose an iterative joint 'Turbo" SAGE-MDPC which further improves the BER performance of the system.

We show its performance by applying it to skin detection. In contrast to previously presented methods, we use only a rough skin direction vector instead of a static skin model as a priori knowledge. Thus, higher robustness is achieved in images captured under unconstrained conditions. We formulate the segmentation as a clustering problem in color space. A homogeneous color region in image space is modeled using a 3D gaussian distribution. Parameters of the gaussians are estimated using the EM algorithm with spatial constraints. We transform the image by a whitening transform and then apply a fuzzy k-means algorithm to the hue value in order to obtain initialization parameters for the EM algorithm. A divisive hierarchical approach is used to determine the number of clusters. The stopping criterion for further subdivision is based on the edge image. For evaluation, the proposed method is applied to skin segmentation and compared with a well known method.

In this paper an unsupervised contextual change-detection method is proposed for two-date multichannel SAR images, by adopting a data-fusion approach. Each SAR channel is modelled as a distinct information source and Markovian data fusion is used by introducing a suitable Markov random field model.

In order to optimize the accuracy of the change maps, a multiscale approach can be adopted, in which observations at coarser and finer scales are jointly exploited. In this paper, a multiscale contextual unsupervised change-detection method is proposed for optical images, which is based on discrete wavelet transforms and Markov random fields. Wavelets are applied to the difference image to extract multiscale features and Markovian data fusion is used to integrate both these features and the spatial contextual information in the change-detection process. Expectation-maximization and Besag's algorithms are used to estimate the model parameters. Experiments on real optical images points out the improved effectiveness of the method, as compared with single-scale approaches.

Conventional schemes using the EM algorithm assume the random walk model as a process equation of a channel impulse response, and thus have insufficient tracking ability to fading fluctuation over fast fading channels. To improve the tracking ability, the proposed channel estimation method employs the differential model having the first and higher order differentials of the channel impulse response with respect to time. Computer simulations under the fast fading condition demonstrate that the proposed method is much superior in packet error rate to the conventional schemes employing the random walk model.

The classifier is based on switched dynamical models, with each model describing a specific motion regime. We present a semi-supervised modified version of the classical Baum-Welch algorithm, which is able to take into account a subset of known model labels. The experimental results reported, using both synthetic and real data, show that the classifier learned with semi-supervision leads to a higher classification accuracy than the fully unsupervised version, thus validating the proposed approach.

Multiple transmitter localization is of interest for uncoordinated cognitive radio systems, which must identify and transmit over unused radio spectrum without cooperation from conventional transmitters. We employ the EM algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the maximum-likelihood estimation problem. Because the EM algorithm finds only a locally optimal solution, we explore the use of clustering to generate "smart" initial estimates of the transmitter locations. Simulation results show that, as the number of sensors increases, the proposed EM technique achieves gains of up to an order of magnitude over constricted particle swarm optimization, a popular global optimization technique.

A wavelet-based EM algorithm for the restoration of medical pulse-echo ultrasound datasets	2007 IEEE/SP 14TH WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	14th IEEE/SP Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing	AUG 26-29, 2007	Madison, WI	IEEE, SP			BLIND DECONVOLUTION; IMAGES; TISSUE; MODEL	The application of pulse-echo ultrasound to anatomical imaging is well established, but despite the prevalence of this imaging modality in modern clinical practice, typical ultrasound images still suffer from blurring and poor resolution and there is significant scope for developing restoration algorithms to address this problem. As with other similar inverse problems, the design of an effective restoration algorithm is contingent on a good image model, and in this respect, the problem is challenging because the acoustic reflectivities of soft tissues have statistical characteristics that are substantially different to those of natural images studied in mainstream image processing. Whereas natural images tend to be piecewise-smooth and are well sparsified by a wavelet basis, the acoustic reflectivities of soft tissues exhibit piecewise-smoothness only on a macroscopic scale; on a microscopic scale, they exhibit a pseudo-random texture. Previously, we presented a simple model of acoustic reflectivity which could adequately account for this dual behaviour and we described a statistically-motivated restoration algorithm that simply alternated between Wiener filtering and dual-tree complex wavelet shrinkage [1]. Our previous results for two-dimensional images showed improved performance compared to other methods based on less sophisticated image models, and in this paper, we extend our algorithm to three-dimensional datasets to correct also for out-of-plane (elevational) blurring.

To this end, we view the coordinates for the pixels in both, the target model and its candidate as random variables and make use of a generative model so as to cast the tracking task into a maximum likelihood framework. This, in turn, permits the use of the EM-algorithm to estimate a set of latent variables that can be used to update the target-center position. Once the latent variables have been estimated, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence so as to minimise the mutual information between the target model and candidate distributions in order to develop a target-center update rule and a kernel bandwidth adjustment scheme. The method is very general in nature. We illustrate the utility of our approach for purposes of tracking on real-world video sequences using two alternative kernel functions.

The performance evaluation is tested in terms of a patch-based image superresolution problem. Assuming a multi-variate Gaussian mixture model for the distribution of all image content, unsupervised probabilistic clustering via expectation maximization allows segmentation of the domain. Subsequently, for the regression component of the algorithm, a modified support vector regression provides per class nonlinear regression while appropriately weighting the relevancy of training points during training. Relevancy is determined by probabilistic values from clustering. Support vector machines, an established convex optimization problem, provide the foundation for additional formulations of learning the kernel matrix via semi-definite programming problems and quadratically constrained quadratic programming problems.

By modeling the phase uncertainty either as an unkown deterministic variable/process or random variable/process with known a priori probability density function, a number of receiver algorithms with various amount of unoptimality have already been proposed to solve the problem. Contrary to the previous contributions, we look at the problem from the variational Bayesian perspective. In particular, efficient iterative joint estimation and detection schemes, based on the generic variational Bayesian (VB) framework, are derived for the constant phase model as well as for the dynamic phase model. In addition, the VB-based approach is related to the optimal noncoherent receiver and to the receiver obtained via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

In our research we have represented the AR(1) models in linear state space form and applied the Kalman Filters to estimate the different unknown parameters of the model. Many methods have been proposed by researchers for the estimation of the parameters in the case of the linear state space models. In our work we have emphasized on the estimation through the Maximum Likelihood (ML). Statisticians have used many algorithms to optimise the likelihood function and they have proposed many filters; publishing their results in many papers. In spite of the fact that this field is so extended, we have emphasized our study in the financial field. Two quasi-Newton algorithms: Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman (BHHH) and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm have been chosen for this study. A practical study of these algorithms applied to the maximization of likelihood by means of the Kalman Filter have been done. The results are focused on efficiency in time of computation and precision of the unknown parameters estimation. A simulation study has been carried out, using as true values the parameters of this model published in the literature, in order to test the efficiency and precision of our implemented algorithms.

In this paper, an efficient method for face recognition called mixture-of-Laplacianfaces (or LPP mixture model) is proposed, which obtains several sets of Laplacianfaces through Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Experiments carried out by using this on ORL, FERET and COIL-20 indicate superior performance as compared with method based on Laplacianfaces and other contemporary subspace methods.

In this paper we compare the 3 methods of estimating word translation probabilities for selecting the word translation in Thai - English Machine Translation. The 3 methods are (1) Method based on frequency of word translation (2) Method based on collocation of word translation, and (3) Method based on Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. For evaluation we used Thai - English parallel sentences generated by NECTEC. The method based on EM algorithm is the best method in comparison to the other methods and gives satisfying results.

The algorithm is derived on the basis of the variational Bayes (VB) method, which is a Bayesian generalization of the EM algorithm. For the purpose of the derivation of the algorithm as well as the comparison with existing algorithms, we present two formulations of the EM algorithm for RSL. One yields a variant of the IRLS algorithm, which is the standard algorithm for RSL. The other is an extension of Roweis's formulation of an EM algorithm for PCA, which yields a robust version of the alternated least squares (ALS) algorithm. This ALS-based algorithm can only deal with a certain type of outliers (termed vector-wise outliers). The VB method is used to resolve this limitation, which results in the proposed algorithm. Experimental results using synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the IRLS algorithm in terms of the convergence property and the computational time.

The channel model is represented in state space form, while the Expectation Maximization algorithm and Kalman filtering are used in the channel parameter and state estimation, respectively. The inphase and quadrature components of the wireless channel and its parameters are estimated from received signal measurements. The proposed algorithm is tested using measurement data, and the results are presented. Moreover, an optimal power control algorithm based on the estimated parameters and channel states is proposed. Numerical results indicate that a significant gain in performance can be achieved using the proposed algorithms.

In a previous study (2006) we have introduced the Gaussian mixture as an appropriate model for an urban area when treated as a single object. Here the choice of the number of components of the mixture is addressed as a model selection problem. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used for choosing the best fitting Gaussian mixture. The EM algorithm is used for the estimation of the parameter and the optimal, parsimonious model is obtained by minimizing the AIC value, under some supplementary conditions on the weights of the different mixture components, so that the identified components arc significant and well separated.

The covariance matrix of the supervector which is a concatenation of all the Gaussian means in HMM, is clearly a good measure of such parameter correlation. In this paper, we propose to treat the supervector as a latent variable under HMM, and perform estimation of the hidden supervector's covariance matrix directly from the acoustic frames using EM algorithm. In contrast to traditional methods which depend on using well-trained/adapted supervector samples, the proposed method is more theoretically sound and capable of dealing well with speaker-specific data sparseness. Moreover, the idea of conducting utterance-level correlation analysis, estimating utterance eigenvoices, and performing (unsupervised) utterance adaptation is explored. Experiments on the OGI Numbers database show that the proposed approach achieves better adaptation performance than the traditional methods, and the utterance-level correlation analysis is found to be useful.

Three different types of coincidences are acquired; coincidences between insert and insert (Type II), coincidences between insert and scanner (Type IS), and coincidences between scanner and scanner (Type SS). The type II and IS data acquired in the proposed system does not sample the imaging FOV completely, hence an 2D iterative algorithm based on expectation maximization is developed that can estimate the activity in the FOV using all the three data sets. A novel approach to compute the 2D system matrix for the detector pairs acquiring coincidenes of type IS is developed that can account for gamma rays hitting the lateral surface of the detectors in the insert. This requires developing a new model for computing the system matrix in which the probabilities are computed using the lateral surfaces as well as the front surface of the detectors in the insert. Normalization factors are computed using a direct method to compensate for the non-uniformity in the intrinsic detection efficiency that depends on the material and length of the crystal. The proposed system is built in GATE and the data is generated with no attenuation and scatter from the phantom. It is demonstrated qualitatively using the simulation data that images with no visible artifacts can be reconstructed using the developed model for the system matrix and the normalization factors incorporated with the system matrix. A singular value decomposition and point source study is also performed to demonstrate the improvement in the proposed model compared to a conventional model for the system matrix.

For the practical use of MAPs, the major problem is an appropriate parametrization of the MAP according to measured data traces. Parameter fitting of MAPs results in a complex nonlinear optimization problem and available fitting approaches either provide rough approximations with MAPs of order two or three, or yield large state spaces with dimensions over 50. The challenge is to build compact MAPs with up to 10 states that capture realistic traffic behavior. In this paper we present a new fitting approach which combines the established expectation maximization algorithm to fit the probability density function and an evolutionary algorithm for autocorrelation fitting. The new algorithm essentially improves the adoption of autocorrelation properties in comparison to pure EM algorithms.

The CLSM is an optical fluorescence microscope that scans a specimen in 3D and uses a pinhole to reject most of the out-of-focus light. However, the quality of the images suffers from two basic physical limitations. The diffraction-limited nature of the optical system, and the reduced amount of light detected by the photomultiplier cause blur and photon counting noise respectively. These images can hence benefit from post-processing restoration methods based on deconvolution. An efficient method for parametric blind image deconvolution involves the simultaneous estimation of the specimen 3D distribution of fluorescent sources and the microscope PSE By using a model for the microscope image acquisition physical process, we reduce the number of free parameters describing the PSF and introduce constraints. The parameters of the PSF may vary during the course of experimentation, and so they have to be estimated directly from the observed data. A priori model of the specimen is further applied to stabilize the alternate minimization algorithm and to converge to the solutions.

The proposed scheme is composed of three modules that are a motion direction estimator, a motion length estimator and a motion combination selector. In order to identify the motion directions, the proposed scheme is based on a trial restoration by using forward ramp motion blur in horizontal and vertical directions and an analysis of directional information in frequency domain via a Radon transform. Autocorrelation functions of image derivatives in several directions are employed for estimation of the motion lengths. A proper combination of motion vectors is identified based on an analysis of local autocorrelation functions of non-flat component of restoration results. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

It has been known that the performance of hypothesis testing can be improved using a Rician distribution, but a main obstacle to its use is computational load. In statistical inference, maximum likelihood estimation of parameters and the likelihood ratio method of hypothesis testing are commonly used for the Rician and Gaussian distributions, especially generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRTs) for the Ricain distribution. But, by considering Rician-distributed data, maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) are not acquired as a solution of a closed form expression unlike ordinary least squares (OLSs) for Gaussian-distributed data. In this study, we apply an iterative optimization solution by means of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm to the Rician maximum likelihood estimation problem. Our simulation results suggest that the EM algorithm is an efficient way to find Rician MLEs, so that it makes hypothesis testing based on the Rician	[Park, Chang-hyun; Kim, Soo Yong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Taejon 305701, South Korea	Kim, SY (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, 373-1 Guseong Dong, Taejon 305701, South Korea.						den Dekker AJ, 2005, MAGN RESON IMAGING, V23, P953, DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2005.07.008; Friston K.J., 1995, HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING, V2, P189, DOI DOI 10.1002/HBM.460020402; Marzetta T.L., 1995, P INT C AC SPEECH SI, V5, P3651; Nan FY, 1999, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V18, P320, DOI 10.1109/42.768841; RICE RO, 1948, BELL SYST TECH J, V27, P109; Sijbers J, 2004, MAGNET RESON MED, V51, P586, DOI 10.1002/mrm.10728; Sijbers J, 1998, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V17, P357, DOI 10.1109/42.712125	7	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1680-0737	978-3-540-36839-7	IFMBE PROC			2007	14		1-6				2472	2475				4	Engineering, Biomedical; Physics, Applied; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	Engineering; Physics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	BIM52	WOS:000260855901106

We employ the adaptive mean shift to determine the number of modes in a mixture model and to detect their components each mixture mode. We consider the use of the EM algorithm, combined with mean field annealing theory, for parameter estimation by Markov random field models from unlabelled data in the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Lastly, the color images are segmented by using posterior probability of each pixel computed from the GMM. The experiment shows that the method can effectively and automatically segment natural images without specifying the number of initial components in GMM.

An evaluation of iterative reconstruction strategies on mediastinal lesion detection using hybrid Ga-67SPECT images	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			NUMERICAL OBSERVERS; TUMOR-DETECTION; SPECT; LROC; COMPENSATION; ATTENUATION; SCATTER	Hybrid LROC studies can be used to more realistically assess the impact of reconstruction strategies, compared to those constructed with digital phantoms. This is because hybrid data provides the background variability that is present in clinical imaging, as well as, control over critical imaging parameters, required to conduct meaningful tests. Hybrid data is obtained by adding Monte Carlo simulated lesions to disease free clinical projection data. Due to Ga-67 being a particularly challenging radionuclide for imaging, we use Ga-67 hybrid SPECT data to study the effectiveness of the various correction strategies developed to account for degradations in SPECT imaging. Our data was obtained using GE-VG dual detector SPECT-CT camera. After determining a target lesion contrast we conduct pilot LROC studies to obtain a near-optimal set of reconstruction parameters for the different strategies individually. These near-optimal. parameters are then used to reconstruct the final evaluation study sets. All LROC study results reported here were obtained employing human observers only. We use final LROC study results to assess the impact of attenuation compensation, scatter compensation and detector resolution compensation on data reconstructed with the RBI-EM algorithm. We also compare these with FBP reconstructions of the same dataset. Our experiment indicates an improvement in detection accuracy, as various degradations inherent in the image acquisition process are compensated for in the reconstruction process.	[Pereira, N.

However, in real prediction problems this is not usually the case for different reasons. For example, the training set is not usually representative of the whole problem due to sample selection biases during its acquisition. In addition, the measurement biases in training could be different than in test (for example, when the measurement devices are different). Another reason is that in real prediction tasks the statistical structure of the classes is not usually static but evolves in time, and there is usually a time lag between training and test sets. Due to these different problems, the performance of a learning algorithm can severely degrade. Here we present a new learning strategy that constructs a classifier in two steps. First, the labeled examples of the training set are used for constructing a statistical model of the problem. In the second step, the model is improved using the unlabeled patterns of the test set by means of a novel extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm presented here. We show the convergence properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance with an artificial problem. Finally we demonstrate its strengths in a heart disease diagnosis problem where the training set is taken from a different hospital than the test set.

At the same time as on-line computational complexity is reduced, performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is increased in comparison with a Gaussian mixture-based estimator that obtains its parameters through probability density estimation by means of the expectation maximization algorithm. Moreover, our method increases performance in PSNR compared to several other previous error concealment algorithms.

Doubly iterative receiver for single carrier cyclic-prefix transmissions with EM-based channel estimation	GLOBECOM 2007: 2007 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 07)	NOV 26-30, 2007	Washington, DC	IEEE			SYSTEMS	Single carrier cyclic-prefix (SCCP) transmission is the scheme that can support the increasing demand of nowadays high data rate applications. The block iterative generalized decision feedback equalizer (BI-GDFE) is an iterative and effective interference cancellation scheme which has near-ML performance yet with very low complexity. In order to deploy this scheme, the channel state information (CSI) must be available at the receiver. In this paper, the problem of channel estimation using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is investigated. The BI-GDFE provides the soft information of the transmitted signal for the EM-based algorithm. The resulted receiver becomes a doubly iterative scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm, the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is also derived. Computer simulations show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed receiver can reach the performance of BI-GDFE with perfect CSI.

Proposed since about fifteen years, ICE works under weak hypotheses and has been successfully applied in many unsupervised processing problems. In particular, it gave good results in unsupervised image segmentation based on complex models like hidden fuzzy Markov fields, hidden evidential Markov fields, or triplet Markov fields. However, there were no general theoretical results concerning its asymptotic behavior until now. The aim of this paper is to provide a general theorem, and to specify two applications: the mixture proportion estimation in a very general setting, and estimation of the components means in Gaussian mixture. The position of ICE with respect to the "Expectation-Maximization" (EM) method is also briefly discussed.

The receiver is derived based on the space alternating-generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) method. It performs joint channel estimation, spatial diversity combining and successive co-channel interference (CCI) cancellation. The channel impulse response of all users are jointly estimated, while the users' transmitted symbols are detected successively. The receiver has a tractable complexity that increases linearly with the number of interferers. Two practically relevant applications are investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations: single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) in the GSM system and dual antenna interference cancellation (DAIC) in the EDGE system. Simulations using the TU3 channel model show that the new proposed scheme achieves a significant performance gain compared to the conventional receiver at low signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs).

This new method extends our initial work (RD method presented by Preza(1)) which was based on the assumption that the specimen does not absorb light and thus only the specimen's phase function or optical path length (OPL) distribution was computed from rotationally-diverse (RD) DIC images. In this paper; we quantify this approximation by modeling the magnitude of the synthetic object as a deviation from unity by a small perturbation. Synthetic, noiseless DIC data are generated from these test objects and processed with the RD method. Our results show that although for weakly absorbing objects the RD method may be adequate for some applications, in general the results can be quantitatively unacceptable. This supports the development of the new alternating minimization method presented in this paper. Preliminary results from the current implementation of the AM method show that the discrepancy measure utilized in the method goes to zero as iterations increase but a constrain on the estimated magnitude is necessary in order to obtain quantitative specimen properties.

By wrapping the feature selection algorithm inside the classifier, i.e, introducing wavelet transform while using EM algorithm to calculate the parameters of GMM image segmentation model, it can get more multi-scale feature information of images, and hence reducing the number of iteration and enhancing the efficiency of image segmentation. The performance of the wrapper-based image segmentation is shown on real-world which proves that the algorithm has better effect of image segmentation.

So far, efficient computational approach has not been developed for the prediction of various types of alternative splicing patterns that occur widely in human genome as well as in other organism. Some of splicing alternative exons, such as alternatively spliced internal type, have some combination of characteristics which make it easy to distinguish from constitutive exons. This work explores the use of EM algorithm, Gibbs sampling and support vector machine (SVM), for alternatively spliced internal Exons prediction. Its prediction accuracy was evaluated by using an independent set of exons and by comparison with results obtained from other commonly used classification method (Logistic regression analysis) using the same dataset. The accuracy of the prediction is 83.6%, which is comparable to the results obtained by other classification method.

Unfortunately global models are inadequate to represent the spatially varying nature of most images, which are much better modeled as piecewise smooth. This paper advocates the concept of local influence neighbourhoods (LINs). The influence neighbourhood of a pixel is defined as the set of neighbouring pixels which have a causal influence on it. LINs can therefore be used as a part of the prior model for Bayesian denoising, deblurring and restoration. Using LINs in prior models can be superior to pixel-based statistical models since they provide higher order information about the local image statistics. LINs are also useful as a tool for higher level tasks like image segmentation. We propose a fast graph cut based algorithm for obtaining optimal influence neighbourhoods, and show how to use them for local filtering operations. Then we present a new expectation-maximization algorithm to perform locally optimal Bayesian denoising. Our results compare favourably with existing denoising methods.

Apply the input vector, x(p) to input units. Calculate the outputs from hidden layer, net-input values to each unit in the output layer, the outputs, the error terms for output units and error terms for the hidden units. Update weights on output layer and weights on hidden layer. Calculate the error term, E(p). p=0 and initialize the weights at both layers. (1) W((1)) and W((2)) randomly. (2) E-step : Compute the expected hidden targets for the hidden units Z(n)boolean AND. (3) M-step : Compute W((1)) and W((2)). (4) Let p=p+1 and go back to step (2) until certain convergence conditions are satisfied. Using BP algorithm, error at output is '0' for HRV input. The program for training the Perceptron using BP algorithm is written in 'C' language. The program for training the Perceptron using ML method is written in MAT LAB. The latter is faster than the former. The training of the Perceptron using ML method yields the 1(st) layer weights of 15132 and the 2(nd) layer weights of 8.1. Error at output is '0' for HRV input. Since the hidden targets are completely separable, finding the first-layer weights can he done through training M individual neurons simultaneously. The quadratic training error between the output and the desired target is minimized to obtain the new 2(nd) layer weights 8.1. This is equivalent to training the original 2 layer (nonlinear) network is decomposed into training a set of single neurons, which can be done much faster than training original (nonlinear) layer network. Hence the program for training the Perceptron using ML method is faster than the program using BP algorithm.	[Rao, V. K.

Our approach is based on explicit knowledge of the audio in the form of a score match - a correspondence between a symbolic score and the music audio, giving the times of all musical events. We employ the familiar idea of masking the short time Fourier transform to eliminate the solo part. The ideal mask is estimated by fitting a model to the data, whose note-based components are derived from the score match. The parameters for our probabilistic model are estimated using the EM algorithm.

It is partly due to the fact that the commonly agreed evaluation methodology has not been established yet in the field. The common practice is using manual lip labelling as the ground truth for evaluation marked by human labellers. Our empirical results using the Expectation-Maximization procedure show that human labeller introduce subjective noises while labelling the lip-localization and often the subjective noises added can be too significant to be directly used for evaluation as ground truth. We argue in the paper that to train and evaluate a lip analysis system one has to measure the quality of human operators and infer the "ground truth" from the manual labelling, simultaneously.

Applying EM algorithm for segmentation of textured images	World Congress on Engineering 2007, Vols 1 and 2	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering 2007	JUL 02-04, 2007	London, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Engineers		texture; segmentation; GLCM; EM; Bayes	CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	Texture analysis plays an increasingly important role in computer vision. Since the textural properties of images appear to carry useful information for discrimination purposes, it is important to develop significant features for texture. Various texture feature extraction methods include those based on gray-level values, transforms, auto correlation etc. We have chosen the Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method for extraction of feature values. Image segmentation is another important problem and occurs frequently in many image processing applications. Although, a number of algorithms exist for this purpose, methods that use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm are gaining a growing interest. The main feature of this algorithm is that it is capable of estimating the parameters of mixture distribution. This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method based on EM algorithm in which the analysis is applied on vector data rather than the gray level value.

Steganalysis feature improvement using expectation maximization - art. no. 657506	Visual Information Processing XVI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Visual Information Processing XVI	APR   10, 2007	Orlando, FIJI	SPIE		steganography; steganalysis; feature extraction; Expectation Maximization; mixture models; Bayes classifier		Images and data files provide an excellent opportunity for concealing illegal or clandestine material. Currently, there are over 250 different tools which embed data into an image without causing noticeable changes to the image. From a forensics perspective, when a system is confiscated or an image of a system is generated the investigator needs a tool that can scan and accurately identify files suspected of containing malicious information. The identification process is termed the steganalysis problem which focuses on both blind identification, in which only normal images are available for training, and multi-class identification, in which both the clean and stego images at several embedding rates are available for training. In this paper an investigation of a clustering and classification technique (Expectation Maximization with mixture models) is used to determine if a digital image contains hidden information. The steganalysis problem is for both anomaly detection and multi-class detection. The various clusters represent clean images and stego images with between 1% and 10% embedding percentage. Based on the results it is concluded that the EM classification technique is highly suitable for both blind detection and the multi-class problem.

A new time-domain method for system identification and BSS is proposed based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for sources distribution. The algorithm is based on the generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) method for joint estimation of the AR model parameters and the GMM parameters of the sources. The method is tested via simulations of synthetic and real audio Signals. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the well-known multidimensional linear predictive coding (LPC), and it achieves higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in the BSS problem.

A recently proposed auxiliary-channel-based technique allows one to efficiently compute upper and lower bounds on the information rate of such channels. Towards tightening these bounds, we propose iterative expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithms to optimize the parameters of the auxiliary finite-state machine channel (FSMC). From a channel coding perspective, optimizing the lower bound is related to increasing the achievable mismatched information rate, i.e. the information rate of a communication system where the maximum-likelihood decoder at the receiver is matched to the auxiliary channel and not to the true channel. We provide explicit solutions for optimizing the upper bound and the difference between the upper and the lower bound and we discuss a method for the optimization of the lower bound for data-controllable channels with memory. We discuss examples of channels with memory, for which application of the developed theory results in noticeably tighter information rate bounds.

The receivers iterates between detection and estimation. For each iteration, we calculate first the expectation of ODFM symbols by using a posteriori probabilities provided by MAP decoder and second we maximise a proposed metric to obtain both frequency offset and then symbol-timing. The channel can be identified by means of these estimates. This algorithm can work in transmission mode and thus can be used to estimate the residual errors or track the change of the parameters. The performance of the proposed synchronization approach, in terms bit error rate and mean square error of the estimated frequency offset, is shown.

We formulate these issues as problems of estimating the maximum likelihood. By examining the error distribution of a range finder, we model it as a normal distribution along the line of sight. To align range images, our method estimates the parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) approach. By assuming the error model, the algorithm is implemented as an extension of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. For merging range images, our method computes the signed distances by finding the distances of maximum likelihood. Since our proposed method uses multiple correspondences for each vertex of the range images, errors after aligning and merging range images are less than those of earlier methods that use one-to-one correspondences. Finally, we tested and validated the efficiency of our method by simulation and on real range images.

This MLE estimator is also capable to accommodate any space-time coded (STC)-OFDM transmission. Then by incorporation of proposed ML estimator into the initialization step of conventional turbo receiver, a novel turbo receiver with CFO estimation/compensation capability is developed for MIMO-OFDM systems. Simulation results are presented which clearly show the application of the proposed MILE estimator into the turbo receiver structure leads to a bit-error rate (BER) that is only slightly higher than that of a perfectly synchronized system, making it highly applicable.

Moreover, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) for both CFO and channel estimators are developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves almost ideal performance compared with the CRB for both channel and frequency offset estimations.

EM-Based channel estimation algorithms for MIMO turbo receivers	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Engineering	APR 11-12, 2007	Lahore, PAKISTAN	IEEE			PARITY-CHECK CODES; OFDM; SYSTEMS	Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), can improve communication quality and capacity. In this paper, we consider channel estimation issue in a MIMO-OFDM system using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes at transmitter and iterative detection based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator and a soft LDPC decoder at receiver. We first consider a previously proposed solution based on least-square estimator (LSE). Since matrix inversion is required in LSE algorithms, their computational cost for implementation is high. Then, we resort to the expectation-maximization (EM)-type algorithms, which significantly reduce the complexity of the channel estimation, and propose a modified turbo receiver for LDPC-coded MIMO-OFDM systems which performs the channel estimation by Space Alternating Generalized EM (SAGE) algorithm. Based on simulation results, the performance of the proposed receiver is quite satisfying.

Losses due to contention is a serious problem in OBS networks. Since the core nodes have limited capabilities, loss rate cannot be determined at the nodes. Thus, estimating the losses on a path purely based on end-to-end measurements and thereafter develop proactive measures for loss reduction is an attractive option. For the first time, we apply a tomographic technique that can estimate the losses at the core nodes from end-to-end measurement between the edge nodes. We use passive unicast tomography to minimize the network overhead. We model the problem of estimating loss rate at the nodes from path-level measurements as a Maximum Likelihood problem and solve it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In simulations, we use a multiple source, multiple destination embedding on the NSFNET topology and observe losses on multiple paths to infer losses at the core nodes. The estimated losses are found to match closely with actual losses measured.	[Sankar, A.; Venkatesh, T.; Murthy, C.

Performance Evaluation of 4D Reconstruction Methods for Gated Cardiac Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography in Obese Patients	COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY 2007, VOL 34	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual Conference on Computers in Cardiology	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2007	Durham, NC				SPECT	The purpose of this study is to evaluate 4D reconstruction methods for the processing of gated cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images from obese patients. Clinical gated SPECT projection data were reconstructed using the ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OS-EM) and the 4D rescaled block-iterative maximum a posteriori (RBI-MAP) reconstruction algorithms. The data were used to derive a relative distribution of quantitative tetrofosmin uptake ratios for the various organs. Using anthropometric data, body sizes were determined for a standard obese male and female NURBS-based cardiac torso (NCAT) phantom. Tetrofosmin uptake ratios were modeled in the obese phantoms and projection data were generated. Poisson noise was simulated, and the noisy data were reconstructed with OS-EM and 4D RBI-MAP. The projected and reconstructed data from the obese phantoms make for a realistic model of tetrofosmin uptake distribution. Qualitatively, 4D processing methods substantially improve visualization of cardiac motion in these very noisy images. We conclude that the tetrofosmin patient models provide a realistic, controllable test vehicle on which to evaluate 4D processing methods for gated cardiac SPECT. 4D processing methods improve the quality of gated SPECT images in obese patients, providing a usable representation of cardiac motion in these difficult-to-image patients.

Adaptive patch features for object class recognition with learned hierarchical models	2007 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-8	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 17-22, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE, hp invent, INI-GraphicsNet, VIOSO				We present a hierarchical generative model for object recognition that is constructed by weakly-supervised learning. A key component is a novel, adaptive patch feature whose width and height are automatically determined. The optimality criterion is based on minimum-variance analysis, which first computes the variance of the appearance model for various patch deformations, and then selects the patch dimensions that yield the minimum variance over the training data. They are integrated into each level of our hierarchical representation that is learned in an iterative, bottom-up fashion. At each level of the hierarchy, pairs of features are identified that tend to occur at stable positions relative to each other, by clustering the configurational distributions of observed feature co-occurrences using Expectation-Maximization. For recognition, evidence is propagated using Nonparametric Belief Propagation. Discriminative models are learned on the basis of our feature hierarchy by combining a SVM classifier with feature selection based on the Fisher score. Experiments on two very different, challenging image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework for object class recognition, as well as the contribution of the adaptive patch features towards attaining highly competitive results.

The derivation of the MAP criterion in this case leads to an expression for which no exact implementation exists in the literature. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm we propose has linear-time complexity per iteration.

Multiplicative updates for L-1-regularized linear and logistic regression	ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS VII, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis	SEP 06-08, 2007	Ljubljana, SLOVENIA				ALGORITHMS	Multiplicative update rules have proven useful in many areas of machine learning. Simple to implement, guaranteed to converge, they account in part for the widespread popularity of algorithms such as nonnegative matrix factorization and Expectation-Maximization. In this paper, we show how to derive multiplicative updates for problems in L-1-regularized linear and logistic regression. For L-1-regularized linear regression, the updates are derived by reformulating the required optimization as a problem in nonnegative quadratic programming (NQP). The dual of this problem, itself an instance of NQP, can also be solved using multiplicative updates; moreover, the observed duality gap can be used to bound the error of intermediate solutions. For L-1-regularized logistic regression, we derive similar updates using an iteratively reweighted least squares approach. We present illustrative experimental results and describe efficient implementations for large-scale problems of interest (e.g., with tens of thousands of examples and over one million features).

In this paper, we present a principled solution to object association where both the scene and the object motion are modeled. By making the motion model of each object with respect to time explicit, we are able to solve the trajectory association problem in a unified framework for overlapping or non-overlapping cameras. We recover the assignment of associations while simultaneously computing the maximum likelihood estimates of the inter-camera homographies and the trajectory parameters using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Quantitative results on simulations are reported along with several results on real data.

Active EM to Reduce Noise in Activity Recognition	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces	JAN 28-31, 2007	Hawaii, HI	ACM SIGART, ACM SIGGHI		Intelligent interface; machine learning; noise; Expectation-Maximization; active learning	ALGORITHM; QUERY	Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the Current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their Current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning,. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results Oil real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision. and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.

For interactive navigation, scanning will need to be performed over extended time periods or even continuously. However, continuous CT is likely to expose the patient and the physician to potentially unsafe levels of radiation. Before CT can be used appropriately for navigational purposes, the dose problem must be solved. Simple dose reduction is not adequate, because it degrades image quality. This problem can be overcome if the traditional filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction is replaced with the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) approach. MLEM is more accurate in that it incorporates Poisson statistics of the noisy projection data, especially at low doses. Our study shows that MLEM reconstruction is able to reduce x-ray dose from 200 to 11 mAs (the lowest dose-simulator setting in the present study) without significant image degradation. Taking advantage of modern CT scanners and specialized hardware, it may be possible to perform continuous CT scanning at acceptable radiation doses for intraoperative visualization and navigation.

The method uses the rib centerlines as the reference for initial nodule registration. From an automatically-identified starting point near the spine, each rib is locally tracked and segmented by expectation-maximization. The ribs are automatically labeled, and the centerlines are estimated using skeletonization. 3D rigid affine transformation is used to register the individual ribs in the reference and target scans. For a given nodule in the reference scan, a search volume of interest (VOI) in the target scan is defined by using the registered ribs. Template matching guided by the normalized cross-correlation between the nodule template and target locations within the search VOI is used for refining the registration. The method was evaluated on 48 CT scans from 20 patients. The slice thickness ranged from 0.625 to 7 mm, and the in-plane pixel size from 0.556 to 0.82 mm. Experienced radiologists identified 101 pairs of nodules. Two metrics were used for performance evaluation: 1) the Euclidean distance between the nodule centers identified by the radiologist and the computer registration, and 2) a volume overlap measure defined as the intersection of the VOIs identified by the radiologist and the computer registration relative to the radiologist's VOL The average Euclidean distance error was 2.7 +/- 3.3 mm. Only 2 pairs had an error > 10 mm. The average volume overlap measure was 0.71 +/- 0.24. Eight-three out of 101 pairs had overlap ratios > 0.5 and only 2 pairs had no overlap.

Biased estimation of Rician K factor	2007 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS & SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing	DEC 10-13, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE			biased estimation; Rician K factor; maximum likelihood (ML); mean squared error (MSE); James - Stein estiamtor (JSE); expectaion - maximization (EM) algorithm		The time varying envelope of the received signal, for the case when a Line of Sight (LoS) component exists between the transmitter and the receiver, is described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. The Rician factor is a measure of the severity of the fading, with K = 0 being the most severe Rayleigh fading, and K = infinity representing essentially a non-fading channel. K factor estimation is often thus required for link budget calculation as well as to determine the best possible space - time precoder when multiple transmit antennas are used. Here, we discuss the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and a moment based estimator for the estimation of the K factor. The James - Stein Estimator (JSE), which is a biased, non - linear estimator, is then used to estimate the K factor and its performance is compared with the MLE. It is shown that using biased estimators (such as the JSE) for K factor estimation, can significantly improve the estimation performance. At low and high K factors, the JSE is similar to MLE, whereas for medium values of K, the JSE can outperform MLE significantly.

Estimation of the hyperexponential density with applications in sensor networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						hyperexponential density; bursty traffic engineering; parameter estimation; nonlinear optimization; sensor networks; rainfall prediction	DISTRIBUTIONS; MIXTURES; EXPONENTIALS	This paper solves the problem of estimation of the parameters of a hyperexponential density and presents a practical application of the solution in sensor networks. Two novel algorithms for estimating, the parameters of the density are formulated. In the first algorithm, an objective function is constructed as a function of the unknown component means and an estimate of the cumulative distribution function (cdf), of the hyperexponential density. The component means are obtained by minimizing this objective function, using quasi-Newtonian techniques. The mixing probabilities are then computed using these known means and linear least squares analysis. In the second algorithm, an objective function of the unknown component means, mixing probabilities, and an estimate of the cdf is constructed. All the 2M parameters are computed by minimizing this objective function, using quasi-Newtonian techniques. The developed algorithms are also compared to the basic EM algorithm, and their relative advantages over the EM algorithm are discussed The algorithms developed are computationally efficient and easily implemented, and hence, are suitable for low-power and sensor nodes with limited storage and computational capacity. In particular, we demonstrate how the structure of these algorithms may be exploited to be effectively utilized in practical situations, and are hence ideal for sensor networks.

The main motivation for this is the belief that classification performance can. be improved by utilizing the contextual information provided by unlabeled data. This paper approaches the problem from a generative classifier perspective, and proposes a new kernel-based method based on combining likelihoods from the labeled examples with those of unlabeled examples. Preliminary results on synthetic low-dimensional data show that the performance of the technique is comparable to that of existing semi-supervised generative approaches based on mixture models trained using Expectation-Maximization. However, a distinct advantage of the proposed approach is that it relies on optimizing only a single parameter. The paper describes how this can be done using cross-validation.

Simultaneous covariance driven correspondence (CDC) and transformation estimation in the expectation maximization framework	2007 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-8	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 17-22, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE, hp invent, INI-GraphicsNet, VIOSO			POINT-SETS; REGISTRATION; ALGORITHM; GEOMETRY; SHAPES	This paper proposes a new registration algorithm, Covariance Driven Correspondences (CDC), that depends fundamentally on the estimation of uncertainty in point correspondences. This uncertainty is derived from the covariance matrices of the individual point locations and from the covariance matrix of the estimated transformation parameters. Based on this uncertainty, CDC uses a robust objective function and an EM-like algorithm to simultaneously estimate the transformation parameters, their covariance matrix, and the likely correspondences. Unlike the Robust Point Matching (RPM) algorithm, CDC requires neither an annealing schedule nor an explicit outlier process. Experiments on synthetic and real images using a polynomial transformation models in 2D and in 3D show that CDC has a broader domain of convergence than the well-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and is more robust to missing or extraneous structures in the data than RPM.

When Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of a time course is high, it is known that the Gaussian approximation of Rice distribution works well. However, SNRs are not known before data analysis and imaging with high spatial resolution which decreases SNRs is increasingly required in functional studies. In this paper, we suggest a method to build up an activation map based on Rician distributed modeling via Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This Rician-EM allows simple iterations and very easy interpretations related to an existing approach. We perform simulations to compare the developed technique with an existing approach.

The model is used to generate a fully 3D, Monte Carlo system response matrix (SRM) for Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) reconstruction. Significant efforts have been taken to ensure a faithful match to the actual tomograph. One of the main considerations with Monte Carlo SRMs is statistical accuracy, as any error in the matrix could propagate into the reconstructed image. In theory, it is possible to simulate an arbitrarily large number of events, making the statistical errors in the matrix insignificant compared to the data. However, at a certain point, errors in the data limit any further improvement in accuracy due to higher statistics in the matrix. An effort to achieve the best possible quantitative accuracy, while optimizing the tradeoff between model accuracy and computation time is presented. Realistic rat brain simulations have been reconstructed using multiple realizations of system matrices at varying count levels. The sensitivity of our methods to the errors in the data, as well as the reconstruction algorithm has been analyzed. The overall goal of this study is to find the SRM with the best tradeoff between resolution and noise for our reconstruction, and simultaneously validate the use of our model for quantitative analyses with the RatCAP.

Since direct maximization of the likelihood function is infeasible, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is invoked as an iterative, feasible method of data detection. Two algorithms are proposed, one derived by direct application of the standard EM algorithm in the present context of OFDM data detection, whereas the other employs soft data estimates resulting in enhanced performance. The use of Kalman filtering is also examined as a means of complexity reduction and handling of the case of a non-negligible frequency offset (FO). The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by simulations which show significant gains over the PHN-compensation method employed by OFDM-based standards.

We propose to model the CIRs as realizations of a mixture density, where the individual component probability density functions represent the clusters. It is shown that the clustering can be simply achieved by the application of the expectation maximization algorithm. Furthermore, this work studies the impact of a-priori knowledge and the number of available CIR observations on the clustering performance, which is evaluated based on measured CIRs.

MRFs can make up for deficiencies in observed information by adding a-priori knowledge to the image interpretation process in the form of models of spatial interaction between neighbouring pixels. In data fusion problems, interaction might also be assumed between corresponding pixels in two different kinds of image of the same scene. Alternatively, temporal interaction might be assumed between corresponding pixels in consecutive frames of a video sequence. In object tracking or robotic navigation problems, a similar relationship may exist between pixels of an observed image and those of a predicted image, derived from models of the motion and scene. In all of these cases the MRF model can be extended to incorporate this additional knowledge. This paper explains the theory of Extended-Markov Random Field (E-MRF) segmentation techniques, surveys the research which has been crucial to their development and presents results from new work in this area with an application to robotic vision in conditions of extremely poor visibility.

We propose a Bayesian approach to the image registration problem. The images are regarded as noisy measurements of an underlying 'true' image-function. Additionally, the image data is considered incomplete, in the sense that we do not know which pixels from a particular image are occluded in the other images. We describe an EM-algorithm, which iterates between estimating values for all hidden quantities, and optimizing the optical flow by differential techniques. The Bayesian way of describing the problem leads to more insight in existing differential approaches, and offers some natural extensions to them. The resulting system involves less parameters and gives an interpretation to the remaining ones. An important feature is the photometric detection of occluded pixels.

The DL tracker overcomes the combinatorial complexity of tracking by substituting the discrete assignment problem with a problem of continuous optimization of the maximum likelihood criterion in a low-dimensional parameter space. DL enables efficient optimization of the likelihood via a combination of Expectation-Maximization optimization of a smoothed likelihood with gradual reduction of the likelihood smoothing. The non-combinatorial complexity enables the DL tracker to process a large number of data frames in a single optimization process, resulting in high detection performance of weak targets. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate practical usefulness of DL for Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) target tracking. We evaluate quality of DL track estimates by constructing Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves for a simulated scenario. We also evaluate performance of the DL tracker incorporating measurements from moving platforms and approximate road priors.

Usually, multivariate Gaussian distributions for continuous data ([2, 8, 4J) or Bayesian networks for nominal data ([15, 16]) are applied. In this paper we combine both approaches in a family of Bayesian models for continuous data that are able to handle univariate as well as multivariate nodes, different types of distributions, e.g. Gaussian as well as Poisson distributed nodes, and dependencies between nodes. The models we introduce can be used for unsupervised, semi-supervised as well as for fully supervised learning tasks. We evaluate our models empirically on generated synthetic data and on public datasets thereby showing that they outperform classifiers such as SVMs and logistic regression on mixture data.

The technique first selects the suitable bands as the candidates for fusion. Then, the bands based on curvelet transform are fused into several components. The fused hyperspectral components as the extracted features are fed into the supervised classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Model. After the estimation of the GMM with Expectation Maximization, the pixels are classified based on the Bayesian decision rule. One requirement of the technique is that the training samples should be provided from the hyperspectral data to be analyzed. The main merits of the new method contain tow folds. One is the novel feature extraction based on curvelet transform which fully makes use of the spectral properties of the hyperspectral data. The other one is the low computing complexity by reducing the data dimension significantly. Experimental result on the real hyperspectral data demonstrate that the proposed technique is practically useful and posses encouraging advantages.

To recognize affective content in video, a video affective content representation and recognition framework based on Video Affective Tree (VAT) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) was proposed. The proposed video affective content recognizer has good potential to recognize the basic emotional events of audience. However, due to Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods like the Baum-Welch algorithm tend to converge to the local optimum which is the closer to the starting values of the optimization procedure, the estimation of the recognizer parameters requires a more careful examination. A Genetic Algorithm combined HMM (GA-HMM) is presented here to address this problem. The idea is to combine a genetic algorithm to explore quickly the whole solution space with a Baum-Welch algorithm to find the exact parameter values of the optimum. The experimental results show that GA-HMM can achieve higher recognition rate with less computation compared with our previous works.

But direct measurement of network characteristics is sometimes infeasible. Network tomography comes out as an effective solution for this problem. It makes inference for network internal parameters with end-to-end measurement, and introduces probabilistic reasoning idea into network measurement. However, despite of this advantage, its computational overhead caused by the inverse inference is still a problem for practical use. In this paper, we make an overview of network tomography techniques and point out three methods to reduce computational complexity of delay distribution inference in large scale network monitoring.

However the techniques of low dose imaging at X-ray mass examination or thin slice imaging provide degraded CT images by noise. The CT images have specific noise, called streak artifact. In this paper, we apply an adaptive Wiener filter (AWF) based on the Gaussian mixture distribution model (GMM), proposed previously to reduce Gaussian white noise.

Perturbation methods based on additive randomization allows accurate estimation of the Probability Density Function (PDF) via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm but it has been shown that noise-filtering techniques can be used to reconstruct the original data in many cases, leading to security breaches. In this paper, we propose a generic PDF reconstruction algorithm that can be used on non-additive (and additive) randomization techiques for the purpose of privacy-preserving data mining. This two-step reconstruction algorithm is based on Parzen-Window reconstruction and Quadratic Programming over a convex set - the probability simplex. Our algorithm eliminates the usual need for the iterative EM algorithm and it is generic for most randomization models. The simplicity of our two-step reconstruction algorithm, without iteration, also makes it attractive for use when dealing with large datasets.

Phase noise mitigation in channel parameter estimation for TDM MIMO channel sounding	CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE FORTY-FIRST ASILOMAR CONFERENCE ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS & COMPUTERS, VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	41st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	NOV 04-07, 2007	Pacific Grove, CA	Naval Postgrad Sch, ATK Miss Res, IEEE Signal Proc Soc			GENERALIZED EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION	Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radio channel sounders commonly employ time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniques to switch between the elements of the transmit and receive antenna arrays. However, phase noise of the local oscillators in the transmitter and the receiver of a TDM MIMO channel sounder can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates of relevant channel parameters, such as the channel capacity and the parameters of propagation paths. In this paper we derive a new SAGE algorithm for path parameter estimation that compensates for the effect of phase noise. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new algorithm always outperforms the traditional SAGE algorithm [2], [3] and that it is able to practically mitigate this effect, provided the phase noise variance is below a certain threshold. The general conclusion is that the new SAGE algorithm is able to compensate for the effect of phase noise in practical channel sounding equipments, provided the used sounding sequences are sufficiently short. Further investigations are needed to quantitatively assess the relationship between the maximum duration of the used sounding sequences and the short-term statistics of phase noise for this compensation to be effective.

The extension of Haralick 2D texture feature to the 3D domain was studied. Calculation of separate co-occurrence matrix for each voxel in the 3D image is proposed. The co-occurrence matrix is calculated from all voxels in a small rectangular window around the voxel. This makes it possible to segment given 3D image as opposed to calculating the feature for the pre-segmented regions of an image. Consequently, such features can be used to search for very small regions with different texture properties (like tumours). A set of abdomen CT images is used for evaluation of the proposed approach. The segmentation method we used is model-based, using Gaussian Mixture Model. EM algorithm is used for learning the parameters of mixture model from training data-set.

This model is expected to be useful to represent non-homogeneous populations. It uses a conditional independence assumption given the latent class to which a statistical unit is belonging. However, it leads to a criterion that proves difficult to optimise by the standard approach based on the EM algorithm. An Evolutionary Algorithms is designed to tackle this discrete optimisation problem, and an extensive parameter study on a large artificial dataset allows to derive stable parameters. Those parameters are then validated on other artificial datasets, as well as on some well-known real data: the Evolutionary Algorithm performs repeatedly better than other standard clustering techniques on the same data.

The cluster analyses aim to provide answers to the question as to the impact of land-use structures on the performance potential of towns and cities. Drawing on the database established, 11 attribute variables for the analysis were selected that significantly characterise a city's land-use structures and go a long way towards moulding its economic and ecological performance. We show that no cluster structure exists in the data set. Therefore we investigate the data set by using Gaussian Mixture-Models estimating by Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This indicates that three or two variables suffice to classify the cities. The next step in our exploratory research is to conduct and to compare the results of different classification algorithms for these three and two variables. The classification based on EM algorithm allows us to identify 8 classes. We discuss them and compare this result with results of some cluster analyses with a separate view to balancing the economic and ecological performance potential of towns and cities.

The use of GMM approach is motivated by that the individual Gaussian components of a GMM are shown to represent some general speaker-dependent spectral shapes that are effective for speaker identity modeling. For speaker model training, a fast re-estimation algorithm based on highest likelihood mixture clustering is introduced. In this work, the GMM is evaluated on TI Speaker ID task via series of experiments (model convergence, effect of feature set, number of Gaussian components, and training utterance length on identification rate). The database consisted of Malay clean sentence speech database uttered by 10 speakers (3 female and 7 male). Each speaker provides the same 40 sentences utterances (average length- 3.5s) with different text. The sentences for testing were different from those for training. The GMM achieved 98.4% identification rate using 5 training sentences. The model training based on highest likelihood clustering is shown to perform comparably to conventional expectation-maximization training but consumes much shorter computational time.

Robotic systems that rely on high quality sensory data can be sensitive to data containing outliers. Since the standard Kalman filter is not robust to outliers, other variations of the Kalman filter have been proposed to overcome this issue, but these methods may require manual parameter tuning, use of heuristics or complicated parameter estimation. Our Kalman filter uses a weighted least squares-like approach by introducing weights for each data sample. A data sample with a smaller weight has a weaker contribution when estimating the current time step's state. We learn the weights and system dynamics using a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. We evaluate our Kalman filter algorithm on data from a robotic dog.

The receiver algorithm could efficiently estimate both channel coefficients and noise power spectral density (PSD). However, their previous work considered only a single user channel environment, so they tested only for a constant noise PSD. In the current paper, we extend the single user to a more realistic multiuser environment for the testing of a time-varying interference plus noise PSD estimation. Also our proposed adaptive PSD estimation scheme will be compared with a conventional system in which a constant PSD is assumed. It will show that the proposed iterative EM scheme can provide accurate interference plus noise PSD estimates to the LDPC decoder.

EM channel estimation for iterative DS-CDMA receiver using LDPC codes with M-ary modulation	2007 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2007)	OCT 29-31, 2007	Orlando, FL	IEEE				This paper proposes an iterative pilot-symbol-aided direct-sequence code-division multiple-access receiver. The receiver uses a regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, iterative demodulation and decoding, and iterative estimators for the fading amplitude and noise power spectral density (PSD). The expectation-maximization channel-estimation Performance is analyzed for an additive white Gaussian noise channel as well as a Rayleigh fading channel. Pilot symbols are periodically distributed throughout each LDPC codeword followed by direct-sequence spreading and an M-ary modulation, e.g., quadriphase-shift keying. After initial estimates of the fading amplitude and noise PSD are obtained by using pilot information, subsequent values of these parameters are iteratively updated by using the soft feedback from the LDPC decoder. The updated fading amplitude and noise PSD estimates are iteratively passed to the LDPC decoder, which results in decoding performance close to that obtained with perfect channel knowledge.

The method is grounded on fitting the temporal autocorrelation function (TACF) and the frequency correlation function (FCF) of the simulation model to those of measured channels. We have studied the possibility of exploiting the diversity in the frequency and time domains to improve the estimates of the TACF and FCF of the channel, obtained from the time-varying frequency response of the measured channel. The proposed method of determining the parameters of the channel simulator uses numerical optimization techniques and is called the iterative nonlinear least squares approximation (INLSA) algorithm. The simulation results show that the quality of the approximation of the TACF and FCF achieved by applying the INSLA algorithm is better than that attained by using the well-known subspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm.

In this work we quantified this improvement using two existing methods: (1) a very simple analytical expression only valid for a central point in a large uniform disk source, and (2) efficient analytical approximations for post-filtered maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction with a fixed target resolution, predicting the image quality in a pixel or in a small region based on the Fisher information matrix. The image quality was investigated at different locations in various software phantoms. Simplified as well as realistic phantoms, measured both with TOF positron emission tomography (PET) systems and with a conventional PET system, were simulated. Since the time resolution of the system is not always accurately known, the effect on the image quality of using an inaccurate kernel during reconstruction was also examined with the Fisher information-based method. First, we confirmed with this method that the variance improvement in the center of a large uniform disk source is proportional to the disk diameter and inversely proportional to the time resolution. Next, image quality improvement was observed in all pixels, but in eccentric and high-count regions the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased slower than in central and low- or medium-count regions. Finally, the CNR was seen to decrease when the time resolution was inaccurately modeled (too narrow or too wide) during reconstruction. Although the optimum is rather flat, using an inaccurate TOF kernel might introduce artifacts in the reconstructed image.

As a result, the quality of performance of the data demodulation remains low using the estimates insufficiently smoothed of the noise. This report proposes a novel method using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for simultaneously estimating the Doppler shifts and the complex amplitudes of the path-wise channel responses. The results of computer simulation show capability of proposed method much superior to the conventional one.

Unfortunately, because of the factors such as loose clothing, image noise and background segmentation errors, the efforts of these methods get very limited effects. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for markerless model-based human body motion capture which is robust to the inaccurate human body reconstruction caused by the factors mentioned above. We extracted a volume data (voxel) representation from silhouettes in multiple video images. In the consideration of the human body model, we construct an articulated model with a potential energy which emphasize the skeleton of the human body and is not sensitive to the outline details of the human body surface. Then, we fit the human body model to the volume data in an expectation-maximization framework and recover the pose of the human body.

In the proposed scheme, two processes are considered. The expectation step divided the received signals into multiple hidden signals in time domain. The hidden signals, as "complete data", will be used to calculate the expectation of the likelihood function. In the maximum step, by maximize the expectation of likelihood function, the required parameters -RFO, CSI and data symbols-are estimated sequentially in an approximate method by expanding second-order Taylor series.

Considering the failure of wavelet in representing the geometry of image edges in dimension 2, here a new contourlet HMT model for image fusion is proposed. Because the CHMT model efficiently captures all dependencies across scales, space and directions through a tree structured dependence network, it can give more accurate description of images. Moreover, the CHMT has a simple tree structure with fewer parameters than wavelet HMT (WHMT), which enables efficient training using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Inputting the contourlet coefficients of source images to train the CHMT model, we can get the edge probability density functions. Local inner-product fusion rule is performed on the high-frequency directional sub-bands, which is acquired by the product of the high-frequency directional coefficients by the edge probability density function of CHMT. The low-frequency sub-bands are compared to preserve the coefficients whose module are minimum. The experiment results show the superiority of the proposed image fusion method to WHMT and contourlets, both in image clarity, implementation speed, standard deviation, average gradient and average cross entropy.

In this paper, we propose two methods that simultaneously separate data points into similar clusters and select informative variables that contribute to the clustering. Our methods are in the framework of penalized model-based clustering. Unlike the classical L-1-norm, penalization, the penalty terms that we propose make use of the fact that parameters belonging to one variable should be treated as a natural group. Numerical results indicate that the two new methods tend to remove non-informative variables more effectively and provide better clustering results than the L(1-)norm approach.

This algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method. Because this algorithm can provide accurate estimation of channel conditions and synchronization parameter for DS-CDMA receivers, even with a simple equalization module, for example, a one-tap multiplier based frequency domain equalizer (FDE), a receiver architecture following this approach can still provide better performance than the costly multi-tap multiplier based equalizer, such as the time domain equalizer (TDE). Performance is well maintained under fast fading channel for mobile stations at high velocity. Moreover, a generic receiver architecture purely based on frequency domain equalization for a composite radio environment, that is CDMA and Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, is also proposed in this paper. This architecture can be readily implemented by software defined radio (SDR) technology. Our results manifest that this adaptive receiver architecture is very promising and can achieve good performance with low cost.

Based on the estimated information of Doppler shifts, a FDE-based receiver architecture is developed to exploit Doppler diversity in frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate that this receiver structure features a low computational complexity while achieving good performance compared with traditional receiver structures in DS-CDMA systems.

In this paper, the method of selecting cluster number is proposed using finite mixture modeling algorithm and penalized Fisher class separability measure criterion, at the same time the data set is partitioned into several appropriate clusters. The cluster number searching process can be partitioned so that the hierarchical clustering analysis is used to construct a 'tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by the iterative optimization, which continues to improve the clustering. The iterative optimization strategy is designed using Finite mixture model and penalized Fisher class separability measure. The parameterized architecture of the data set is described by Finite mixture model, which parameters are iteratively learned using expectation-maximization, or EM algorithm. The mixture model complexity, i.e. the number of clusters is selected to maximize the penalized Fisher class separability measure criterion.

Effect of different reconstruction algorithms on the dynamics and modeling parameters of 18F-Galacto-RGD in mice	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				So far FBP (Filtered Back Projection) is still the standard reconstruction method for kinetic modeling of PET data. Iterative reconstruction algorithms, such as OSEM (Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization) or MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) create images with better signal-to-noise ratios and less streak artifacts. This is of special interest in the short-time frames with low statistics at the beginning of a dynamic acquisition. To determine if iteratively reconstructed PET data could be used for kinetic modeling of pre-clinical data, we compared OSEM2D and OSEM3D/MAP data with FBP data using microPET data. Nude mice (n=6) bearing a human melanoma tumor were imaged over 90 minutes with a FOCUS 120 microPET. We applied 18F-Galacto-RGD via a tail vein catheter into the animal (9-19 MBq). 18F-Galacto-RGD is used for imaging the alpha(upsilon)beta 3 expression during angiogenesis and on specific tumor cells. Each list mode dataset was binned into 19 frames and reconstructed with FBP, OSEM2D and OSEM3D/MAP. The data was not corrected for scatter and attenuation. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn on the heart and tumor tissue. No corrections for spillover and partial volume effect were applied. For the kinetic modeling of the tumor data a standard 2-tissue-compartment model with reversible binding was used (fitting parameters: K-1, k(2), k(3), k(4) (rate constants) and D-upsilon (vascular blood fraction)). The input function TACs of the iteratively reconstructed data showed no considerable difference to the FBP data. Only the OSEM3D/MAP TACs for the tumor VOls were clearly and consistently higher for all datasets than the corresponding FBP and OSEM2D TACs. Kinetic modeling shows negligible parameter changes for K-1, k(2), k(3) and k(4) for all reconstruction algorithms. The higher OSEM3D/MAP tumor values are compensated only with an overestimated (D-upsilon (D-upsilon(FBP)=2.2%, D-upsilon(OSEM3D/MAP)=3.3%). Further work needs to be done on optimizing the iteration settings for the OSEM3D/MAP.

Recent success of language modeling in information retrieval have let us consider again about multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification. In this paper, we propose a semantic smoothing method for Naive Bayes model, biomedical documents were indexed by the concept of UMLS, and at the same time concept pairs which are context-sensitive were extracted as topic signature, the translation between concept pair and concept is attained using EM algorithm. Then classification model is estimated by a mixture model combined with this semantic smoothing method. Ontology-based document representation can deal with synonym and reduce the concept vector. The semantic smoothing method can partly solve the sparseness of data. Our method is evaluated on OHSUMED and genomic track collection, and proper results were attained. We found this semantic smoothing method can attain better results than other simple smoothing method, also this method is significant because of its simpleness, comprehensibility.

This algorithm is capable of selecting the number of classification of SAR image using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for Gaussian mixture model. Our approach benefits from the properties of Genetic algorithms (GA) and the EM algorithm by combination of both into a single procedure. The population-based stochastic search of the GA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables escaping from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. Some experiment results are given based on our proposed approach, and compared to that of the other algorithms. The experiments on the SAR images show that the method based on the CA-EM outperforms the other method.

Probabilistic Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (PMHT) is an efficient approach for dealing with it. Essentially PMHT is based on the method of Expectation-Maximization for handling with association conflicts. Linearity in the number of targets and measurements is the main motivation for a further development, and extension of this methodology. Unfortunately, compared with the Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDAF), PMHT has not yet shown its superiority in terms of track-lost statistics. Furthermore, the problem of track extraction and deletion is apparently not yet satisfactorily solved within this framework. Four properties of PMHT are responsible for its problems in track maintenance: Non-Adaptivity, Hospitality, Narcissism and Local Maxima.(1,2) In this work we present a solution for each of them and derive an improved PMHT by integrating the solutions into the PMHT framework. The new PMHT is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations. A sequential Likelihood-Ratio (LR) test for track extraction has been developed and already integrated into the framework of traditional Bayesian Multiple Hypothesis Tracking.(3) As a multi-scan approach, also the PMHT methodology has the potential for track extraction. In this paper an analogous integration of a sequential LR test into the PMHT framework is proposed. We present an LR formula for track extraction and deletion using the PMHT update formulae. As PMHT provides all required ingredients for a sequential LR calculation, the LR is thus a by-product of the PMHT iteration process. Therefore the resulting update formula for the sequential LR, test affords the development of Track-Before-Detect algorithms for PMHT. The approach is illustrated by a simple example.

Both methods produce source estimates characterized by very compact, localized activity regions consistent with some neurophysiological evidence. While these methods have been studied extensively in the statistics and signal processing communities, they remain somewhat underutilized in the context of MEG and EEG source imaging. This paper presents simple extensions of both FOCUSS and MCE with the potential for handling flexible orientation constraints, estimation of distributed sources, and spatio-temporal smoothing. The resulting algorithms are easily implemented via the EM algorithm.

In this paper a method of human posture estimation is described incorporating the concept of an opportunistic fusion framework aiming to employ manifold sources of visual information across space, time, and feature levels. One motivation for the proposed method is to reduce raw visual data in a single camera to elliptical parameterized segments for efficient communication between cameras. A 3D human body model is employed as the convergence point of spatiotemporal and feature fusion. It maintains both geometric parameters of the human posture and the adoptively learned appearance attributes, all of which are updated from the three dimensions of space, time and features of the opportunistic fusion. In sufficient confidence levels parameters of the 3D human body model are again used as feedback to aid subsequent in-node vision analysis. Color distribution registered in the model is used to initialize segmentation. Perceptually Organized Expectation Maximization (POEM) is then applied to refine color segments with observations from a single camera. Geometric configuration of the 3D skeleton is estimated by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

However, when a portion of photons is deviated from their original path by scattering, it is not valid to assume that these photons are the survival photons along the lines connecting the x-ray source and the individual locations where they are detected. Since these photons do not carry the correct spatial information, the final image is contaminated. Researchers are seeking techniques to reduce scattering, and hence, improve image quality; by scatter compensation. Previously, we presented a post-acquisition scatter compensation technique based on an underlying statistical model. We used the Poisson noise model, which assumed that the signals in the detector individually followed the Poisson process. Since most x-ray detectors are energy integrating rather than photon counting, the Poisson noise model can be improved by taking this property into account. In this study, we developed a Gaussian noise model by the matching-of-the-first-two-moments method. The Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the scatter-free image was derived via the expectation maximization (EM) technique. The maximum a posteriori estimate was; also calculated. The Gaussian noise model was preliminarily evaluated on a full-field digital mammography system.

In this paper, we use the neural networks for predicting the strengths of protein interaction. This method is capable of exploring all possible interactions between domains and make predictions based on all the domains. Compared to expectation-maximization method and association method, the experimental results show that the proposed schemes can infer strengths of protein-protein interactions with better performances.

Wavelet coefficients of training images in the same directions at different scale are organized into tree-type data as training samples for OCSVMs. Likelihood probabilities for observations of segmentation image can be obtained from trained OCSVMs. Maximum likelihood classification is used for image raw segmentation. Bayesian rule is then used for pixel level segmentation by fusing raw segmentation result. In experiments, synthetic mosaic image, aerial image and SAR image were selected to evaluate the performance of the method, and the segmentation results were compared with presented hidden Markov tree segmentation method based on EM algorithm. For synthetic mosaic texture images, miss-classed probability was given as the evaluation to segmentation result.

However, the biophysical variable products are limited to certain resolutions and some products are incomplete in space. Therefore these products can not meet the needs of many operational applications. Therefore, more and more attentions have been paid to fusing or assimilating multi-sensor and multi-temporal data to improve the biophysical variable products with precision as high as possible and high temporal resolution and variable spatial resolutions in recent years. In this paper, the multiscale Kalman filter (MKF) is introduced to fuse the biophysical products from different kinds of remote sensing data. The multiscale Kalman filter allows us to model explicitly and very efficiently the spatial dependence and scaling properties of remote sensing data, and can be used to produce optimal estimation of biophysical variables at any desired spatial scale given uncertain and sparse observations at different scales. Taking leaf area index as an example, our method is tested by fusing LAI products from MODIS and Landsat ETM+, and the results show that the method can be used to fuse effectively different biophysical variables inverted from different sensors.

However, when the foreground objects with fractional boundary are blended to the scene behind using unknown alpha values, due to the spatially varying disparities for different layers, the color constancy does not hold any more. In this paper, we address the fractional stereo matching problem. A probability framework is introduced to establish the correspondences of pixel colors, disparities, and alpha values in different layers. We propose an automatic optimization method to solve a Maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem using Expectation-Maximization (EM), given the input of only a narrow-band stereo image pair. Our method naturally encodes pixel occlusion in the formulation of layer blending without a special detection process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using difficult stereo images.

Since most of the ICD-9 codes are unevenly represented in the medical records, a weighted scheme is employed to balance positive and negative examples. The weights turn out to be associated with the instance Priors from a probabilistic interpretation, and an efficient EM algorithm is developed to automatically update both the weights and the regularization parameter Experiments on a large-scale real patient database suggest that the weighted ridge regression outperforms the conventional ridge regression and linear support vector machines (SVM).

However, the mixture number of GMM must be given in model training. The cluster expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a well-known technique in which the mixture number is regarded as an estimated parameter. This paper presents a new model that integrates an improved cluster algorithm into the estimating process of GMM with the embedded transformation. In the approach, the transformation matrix, the mixture number and other traditional model parameters are simultaneously estimated according to a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is demonstrated on a database of three data sessions for text independent speaker identification. The experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional GMM with cluster EM algorithm.

The maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm is becoming more important than filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm which can incorporate various physical models into image reconstruction scheme. However, ML-EM converges slowly. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named AC-ML-EM (accelerated and convergent maximum likelihood expectation maximization) by introducing gradually decreasing correction factor into ML-EM. AC-ML-EM has a higher speed of convergence. Through the experiments of computer simulated phantom data and real phantom data, AC-ML-EM is shown faster and better quantitatively than conventional ML-EM algorithm.

In this work, we study the problem of rearranging elements within a tensor in order to maximize these correlations, so that information redundancy in tensor data can be more extensively removed by existing tensor-based dimensionality reduction algorithms. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to tackle this essentially integer optimization problem. In each step, the tensor structure is refined with a spatially-constrained Earth Mover's Distance procedure that incrementally rearranges tensors to become more similar to their low rank approximations, which have high correlation among features along certain tensor dimensions. Monotonic convergence of the algorithm is proven using an auxiliary function analogous to that used for proving convergence of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, we present an extension of the algorithm for conducting supervised subspace learning with tensor data. Experiments in both unsupervised and supervised subspace learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in improving data compression performance and classification accuracy.

Capable gamers can easily get bored, while beginners tend to give up after trying several times because the game does not correspond to their level of interest. Therefore, this paper proposes that the user's play pattern to be modeled on the basis of probability and level designer will dynamically generates the gaming level accordingly. We analyze user's play pattern and design pattern based on GMM (probability model) and dynamically generate the level with online learning technique adapting the reinforcement technique. The play pattern is modeled using GMM and in order to create game level dynamically, the method of updating the weight of enemy creation using online script is proposed. Finally, we apply our proposed method to a 2D shooting game and introduce user's play pattern leading to design pattern in the game.

These DM methods also may not discuss the robustness of solutions, either by considering data preprocesses for outliers and missing values, or by considering uncontrollable noise factors. In order to address these problems, we propose an extended robust data mining (ERDM) model. The main concerns of this model are three-fold. The proposed ERDM conducts outlier test and expectation maximum (EM) algorithm to carry out the data preprocess. The proposed ERDM then reduces the dimensionality to find the significant factors among a large number of input factors using correlation-based feature selection (CBFS) method and best first search (BFS) algorithm. Finally, the proposed model utilizes the theory of robust design to handle the noise factors using the concept of surrogate variable and the response surface methodology (RSM).

The former is simple in coding and fast in execution, but its partitioning is too pure since it overlooks the fuzziness; whereas the latter, taking the fuzziness into account, is more reasonable for partitioning, but the algorithm complexity and cost will increase. Based on the research of hard partitioning and fuzzy partitioning, the idea of fuzzy factor is proposed By adjusting fuzzy factor, hard partitioning and fuzzy partitioning are unified, and the clustering analysis of switching regression models becomes more flexible. It is demonstrated by simulation experiment that it is feasible to find the optimal combination of speed and fuzziness according to the practical application.

We show that the OFDM channel estimation process can be substantially improved by using,a blind estimation module, namely the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, in addition to a conventional non-blind estimation module such as pilot symbol-aided channel estimation (PSAC). We provide a mathematical framework for the EM module and present computer simulations on its performance for an OFDM system operating in a frequency dispersive mobile channel. An additional benefit is revealed by our simulations which show that the proposed method is particularly powerful when the pilot insertion rate, i.e. overhead, is low.

Our hypothesis was that scatter caused these artifacts. To test. this assumption, we studied the performance of forward- and back-projection procedures in the EM algorithm for simulated and experimental SPELT data. First, synthetic scatter-free projections and projections with only one scattered photon in each view were created for a simulated simple object, and reconstructed with a fully 3D ordered-subsets EM (OSEM) algorithm. Then, Monte Carlo simulated brain SPELT (with no scatter and with scatter present), a mini-Defrise phantom, and patient SPELT were reconstructed. We confirmed our hypothesis: hot-spot artifacts appeared only in the reconstruction from noisy projections but not in the reconstruction from scatter-free projections. We investigated a practical and simple method, critical path-length control (CPLC), for suppression of the hot-spot artifacts. To this end we performed reconstructions with or without CPLC and quantitatively evaluated the results including estimation of accuracy, bias, contrast-to-noise ratio, and uniformity. We found that the OSEM-with-CPLC method significantly reduced hot-spot artifacts, and yielded a similar or improved image quality. We conclude that the CPLC method provides a useful yet simple tool to reduce scatter-related hot-spot artifacts.

SPECT data were acquired in a 128x64 matrix, in 120 views with a circular orbit. The numerical Zubal brain phantom was used to simulate a FBC HMPAO Tc-99m brain SPECT scan, and a low noise and scatter-free projection dataset was obtained using the SimSET Monte Carlo package. A SPECT scan for a mini-Defrise phantom and brain HMPAO SPECT scans for five patients were acquired with a triple-head gamma camera (Triad 88) equipped with a low-energy high-resolution (LEHR) FBC. The reconstructed images, obtained using clinical filtered back projection (FBP), OSEM with a line-length system model (LLSM) and 3D TV regularization, and OSEM with FVSM and 3D TV regularization were quantitatively studied. Overall improvement in the image quality has been observed, including better axial and transaxial resolution, better integral uniformity, higher contrast-to-noise ration between the gray matter and the white matter, and better accuracy and lower bias in OSEM-FVSM, compared with OSEM-LLSM and clinical FBP.

This algorithm provides a powerful tool for the analysis of complex data, such as clinical diagnosis and biological expressions data, due to its robustness to various data distributions and its accuracy in establishing appropriate groups from data. The algorithm combines a distribution model and the fuzzy degrees concept. Compared to the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which is a well-known distribution estimating algorithm, the PLV algorithm has the considerable advantage that it can be applied to various data types, i.e. it is not restricted solely to Gaussian data distributions. Additionally, the proposed algorithm has a better performance than the well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm, i.e. the FCM algorithm, where it can address compact regions, other than simply dividing objects into several equal populations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by conducting clustering tasks on the contents of several medical diagnosis and biological expressions datasets.

A new SAGE based list detection algorithm is proposed to operate as a receiver front-end to approximate the MAP algorithm with reduced complexity and with minor losses in the performance. The receiver front-end, a decoder, and a channel estimator constitute an iterative receiver to jointly decode the transmitted bits and to estimate the channel state. The proposed receiver front-end shows a good performance when compared to the other MAP approximation, i.e., to the K-best list sphere detector (LSD) and a linear front-end. Furthermore, the whole iterative receiver performs well with the low pilot overhead despite the fast fading channel.

Developing an effective method to predict the cost and quality of software projects based on facts such as project characteristics and two-side cooperation capability at the beginning of the project can aid us in finding ways to reduce the risks. Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is a good tool for analyzing uncertain consequences, but it is difficult to produce precise network structure and conditional probability table. In this paper, we build up the network structure by Delphi method for conditional probability table learning, and learn to update the probability table and confidence levels of the nodes continuously according to application cases, which would subsequently make the evaluation network to have learning abilities, and to evaluate the software development risks in organizations more accurately. This paper also introduces the EM algorithm to enhance the ability in producing hidden nodes caused by variant software projects.

Learning MLN from data is important in constructing MLN. Real-world data usually contains missing data, learning MLN from missmig data is more difficult than learning it from complete data, because we can't compute the exact number of the cases. We put forward a MLN learning algorithm MEM (MLN Expectation Maximization), it can learn MLN from relational missing data by expanding EM algorithm with our previous works. We define relational missing data, design initial MLN and complete algorithm for the relational missing data. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MEM can effectively learn MLN from relational missing data.

We present an improved SBL sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) blind equalizer and a low complexity Sparse Bayesian blind equalizer in OFDM systems. By assuming a parameterized channel prior and using EM algorithm to estimate the parameter from the Monte Carlo sample, the algorithm could produce an accurate sparse channel estimate. Better channel estimate makes the trial distributions in the original SMC more accurate and improves the BER performance. Based on the observation that increasing the particle number to sample the signal space is inefficient, we proposed a novel low complexity Sparse Bayesian blind equalizer. Simulation results show that both algorithms outperform original SMC algorithms significantly under sparse channel conditions.

A Gaussian mixture model is employed to model the normal operating range of the machine. A Gaussian random vector is introduced to model the possible deviations of the observed sensor values from their corresponding normal values. Different levels of deviations are elegantly handled by the covariance matrix of this random vector, which is estimated adaptively for each input observation. Our algorithm doesn't require faulty operation training data, as desired by previous methods. Significant improvements over the previous methods are achieved in our tests.

Such an addition leads to multiple iterations in the E-step. Besides, the clustering result depends mainly on the choice of the spatial coefficient, which is used to weigh the penalty term but is hard to determine a priori. Furthermore, it may not be appropriate to assign a fixed coefficient to every site, regardless of whether it is in the class interior or on the class border. In estimating class posterior probabilities, sites in the class interior should receive stronger influence from their neighbors than those on the border. To that end, this paper presents a variant of NEM using varying coefficients, which are determined by the correlation of explanatory attributes inside the neighborhood.

The algorithm is essentially a method for obtaining sufficiently sparse solutions of under-determined systems of linear equations with additive Gaussian noise. The method is based on iterative Expectation-Maximization of a Maximum A Posteriori estimation of sources (EM-MAP) and a new steepest-descent method is introduced for the optimization in the M-step. The solution obtained by the proposed algorithm is compared to the minimum l(1)-norrn solution achieved by Linear Programming (LP). It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster than the interior-point LP method, while providing better accuracy.

A drawback of this approach is that the number of components of the finite mixture model is not known in advance, nevertheless, it is a key issue for EM algorithms. In this paper, a penalized minimum matching distance-guided EM algorithm is discussed. Under the framework of Greedy EM, a fast and accurate algorithm for estimating the number of components of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed. The performance of this algorithm is validated via simulative experiments of univariate and bivariate Gaussian mixture models.

Nevertheless, its convergence speed relies on the value of learning rate. In general, selection of an appropriate learning rate is a nontrivial task. To circumvent such a selection, this paper further studies the MWL learning framework, and develops a batch RPEM algorithm accordingly provided that all observations are available before the learning process. Compared to the adaptive RPEM algorithm, this batch RPEM need not assign the learning rate analogous to the EM, but still preserve the capability of automatic model selection. Further, the convergence speed of this batch RPEM is faster than the EM and the adaptive RPEM. The experiments show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

It provides flexibility in describing a prior. A wavelet based complexity penalty term is used in this paper. This penalty stems from a multi-scale Poisson likelihood factorizations of the image formation. So it is capable of extracting the signal from Poisson noise polluted data. ART (Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) is one of the most important iterative reconstruction algorithms. The pART (penalized Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) is proposed by using this regularization technique as a penalty term in the ART algorithm. First, the fact that ART implies an objective function is pointed out. The CM penalty term is then added in the objective function of ART. In this way, it is integrated into the iterative framework of the ART algorithm. Numerical studies were carried out to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. Different FOM (Figure of Merit) techniques were used to evaluate the image quality. The pART algorithm shows significant image quality improvements with regard to the traditional ART in those studies.

However, most traditional distributed knowledge discovery (DKD) methods assume that the distributed databases derive from a single virtual global table, where they share the same semantics and data structures. This data heterogeneity and the underlying semantics bring a considerable challenge for DKD. In this paper, we propose a model-based clustering method for aggregate databases, where the heterogeneous schema structure is due to the heterogeneous classification schema. The underlying semantics can be captured by different clusters. The clustering is carried out via a mixture model, where each component of the mixture corresponds to a different virtual global table. An advantage of our approach is that the algorithm resolves the heterogeneity as part of the clustering process without previously having to homogenise the heterogeneous local schema to a shared schema. Evaluation of the algorithm is carried out using both real and synthetic data. Scalability of the algorithm is tested against the number of databases to be clustered; the number of clusters; and the size of the databases. The relationship between performance and complexity is also evaluated. Our experiments show that this approach has good potential for scalable integration of semantically heterogeneous databases.

It has the benefits of both EM and SOM algorithms, without constraints on source signals. We first used the proposed approach to denoise the mixed images and then use it again to achieve separation.

The iterative detection/decoding and channel estimation are combined to improve system performance. With the aid of the candidate list from list sphere decoder (LSD), the channel frequency response of each subcarrier is estimated by the recursive expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which uses sequential processing over all the significant symbol combinations in the limited candidate list. Moreover, with the prior knowledge of the second-order statistics of the fading channel in time domain, the time-varying channel impulse responses are tracked by the Kalman predictor based on the estimated channel frequency response. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can track the time-varying channel effectively and offer substantial performance gains over the conventional soft decision-directed Kalman filtering techniques.

Using the candidate list obtained by the list sphere decoder (LSD), the soft information is calculated and fed back to the channel estimator which is based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We set a soft symbol threshold to avoid the performance deterioration due to the unreliable detected symbols. With the aid of the decomposed component signals obtained at the E step, the soft symbols with low reliability are recalculated and the more accurate soft information is used in the channel estimation.

Based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models, our method has two advantages. First, structural expectation maximization algorithm is embedded into a DBN framework, allowing it to learn the network with unknown structure and incomplete data, which cannot be tackled by expectation maximization algorithm. Second, since learning only from gene expression data is not enough to accurately estimate a gene network, we incorporate transcription factor binding location data through a structure prior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by the analysis of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae cell cycle data. The experimental results show that this new approach suits for dealing with missing values. Furthermore, combination of heterogeneous data from multiple sources ensures that our results are more accurate than those recovered from gene expression data alone.

The video image is represented with a weighted graph. A dynamic Potts model with external fields is used to store the probability distribution of the image pixels. The external fields are important for weighting terms in mixture distributions and thus allow more flexible and robust image segmentation. An online expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters of the model. Experimental results on different video clips show the proposed approach is capable of retrieving different objects such as cars, planes, animals and human beings effectively.

However this problem has not received enough consideration when the data streams are generated in a distributed fashion, whereas such a scenario is very common in real life applications. There exist constraining factors in clustering the data streams in the distributed environment: the data records generated are noisy or incomplete due to the unreliable distributed system; the system needs to on-line process a huge volume of data; the communication is potentially a bottleneck of the system. All these factors pose great challenge for clustering the distributed data streams. In this paper we proposed an EM-based (Expectation Maximization) framework to effectively cluster the distributed data streams, with the above fundamental challenges in mind. In the presence of noisy or incomplete data records, our algorithms learn the distribution of underlying data streams by maximizing the likelihood of the data clusters. A test-and- cluster strategy is proposed to reduce the average processing cost, which is especially effective for online clustering over large data streams. Our extensive experimental studies show that the proposed algorithms can achieve a high accuracy with less communication cost, memory consumption and CPU time.

Given a collection of biomedical literature from a digital library addressing a set of objects (e.g., proteins) and their descriptions (e.g., protein functions), the tasks of class-attribute mining include: (1) to identify and summarize latent classes in the space of objects, (2) to discover latent attribute themes in the space of object descriptions, and (3) to summarize the commonalities and differences among identified classes along each attribute theme. We approach this mining problem through a mixture language model and estimate the parameters of the model using the EM algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model with an application called protein community identification and annotation from Medline, the largest biomedical literature digital library with more than 16 millions abstracts.

In the paper, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to learn the face texture from video. The proposed approach models the video sequence as a mixture of dynamic face-layers and background layers, where the dynamic face-layers may undergo 3D motions in the video. The hidden variables and their generating process is represented by probabilistic graphical model. The model is learnt by EM algorithm with variational approximation. The proposed approach offers several advantage over existing algorithms. First, it derive its learning power by a generative model which naturally represents the generating process of videos. Second, it does not require any labelling or face detection algorithm. Third, the application domain of the proposed algorithm is not restricted to extracting face texture and it can be adapted to model other objects as well. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is capable of learning the appearance model of faces with complex 3D motions in the video.

To achieve better freeway management, effective traffic performance evaluation parameters are crucial. Most of the current evaluation parameters are from a macroscopic point of view, e.g., level-of-service based on traffic density. This paper proposes evaluation parameters in a microscopic way and investigates the relationship between macroscopic level of service (LOS) derived from roadway sensor readings and the microscopic quality of service (QOS) of traffic from the drivers' point of view. This is important for several ITS applications that need to monitor roadway network traffic conditions, e.g., incident detection. It has been found that macroscopic LOS does not represent the microscopic traffic flow quality very well. A new criterion for determining microscopic traffic flow quality is proposed using average speed values and speed coefficient of variation (CV) of micro-trips. A Gaussian mixture model and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are used to find the best partitioning thresholds. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality of service measure.

In this article, we present a novel statistical model for monitoring environment-induced genes of major effects on longitudinal outcomes of a trait. This model is derived within the maximum likelihood framework, incorporated by mathematical aspects of growth and developmental processes. A typical structural model is implemented to approximate time-dependent covariance matrices for the longitudinal trait. This model allows for a number of biologically meaningful hypothesis tests regarding the effects of major genes on overall growth trajectories or particular stages of development. It can be used to test whether and how major genetic effects are expressed differently under altered environmental agents. In a well-designed case-control study, our model has been employed to detect cocaine-dependent genes that affect growth trajectories for head circumference during childhood. The detected gene triggers significant effects on growth curves in both cocaine-exposed (case) and unexposed groups (control), but with different extents. Significant genotype-environment interactions due to this so-called environment-sensitive gene are promising for further studies toward its genomic mapping using polymorphic molecular markers.

Extraction of relevant muscular activities from noisy recordings	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						surface electromyography; noise reduction; classification expectation-maximization (CEM); autoregressive modeling; wavelet transform	WAVELET TRANSFORM; COMFORT; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	The aim of this paper is to develop a method to extract relevant activities from surface electromyography (SEMG) recordings under difficult experimental conditions with a poor signal to noise ratio. High amplitude artifacts, the QRS complex, low frequency noise and white noise significantly alter EMG characteristics. The CEM algorithm proved to be useful for segmentation of SEMG signals into high amplitude artifacts (HAA), phasic activity (PA) and background postural activity (BA) classes. This segmentation was performed on signal energy, with classes belonging to a chi(2) distribution. Ninety-five percent of HAA events and 96.25% of BA events were detected, and the remaining noise was then identified using AR modeling, a classification based upon the position of the coordinates of the pole of highest module. This method eliminated 91.5% of noise and misclassified only 3.3% of EMG events when applied to SEMG recorded on passengers subjected to lateral accelerations. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kim, NK; Xie, J				Kim, Nak-Kyeong; Xie, Jun			Protein multiple alignment incorporating primary and secondary structure information	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Gibbs sampling; likelihood function; protein sequence motifs; secondary structures; segment overlap	SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; BAYESIAN MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; PROGRAMS; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; ACCURACY; MATRICES; MOTIFS	Identifying common local segments, also called motifs, in multiple protein sequences plays an important role for establishing homology between proteins. Homology is easy to establish when sequences are similar (sharing an identity > 25%). However, for distant proteins, it is much more difficult to align motifs that are not similar in sequences but still share common structures or functions. This paper is a first attempt to align multiple protein sequences using both primary and secondary structure information. A new sequence model is proposed so that the model assigns high probabilities not only to motifs that contain conserved amino acids but also to motifs that present common secondary structures. The proposed method is tested in a structural alignment database BAliBASE. We show that information brought by the predicted secondary structures greatly improves motif identification.

For nonlinear and non-Gaussian models, sequential updating is not as straightforward as in the linear Gaussian model. In this paper, densities are approximated as finite mixture models as is done in the Gaussian sum filter(GSF). A novel approach(UGSF) for filtering nonlinear non-Gaussian dynamic system is proposed based on GSF and Uniformly Random Design(URD). Due to the good properties of URD, the novel method can update the means and covariances of the mixands more efficiently. To keep the number of the mixands constant, a method of weighted Expectation-Maximization(WEM) algorithm is used. Simulations are presented to exhibit the performance of the novel filter.

J	Minemura, E				Minemura, Eiji			An interest-rate model analysis based on data augmentation Bayesian forecasting	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; dynamic linear model; Markov-chain Monte Carlo; computational simulation; probability measure transformation	STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; INFERENCE; GARCH	In this paper, the author presents an efficient method of analyzing an interest-rate model using a new approach called 'data augmentation Bayesian forecasting.' First, a dynamic linear model estimation was constructed with a hierarchically-incorporated model. Next, an observational replication was generated based on the one-step forecast distribution derived from the model. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling method was conducted on it as a new observation and unknown parameters were estimated. At that time, the EM algorithm was applied to establish initial values of unknown parameters while the 'quasi Bayes factor' was used to appreciate parameter candidates. 'Data augmentation Bayesian forecasting' is a method of evaluating the transition and history of 'future,' 'present' and 'past' of an arbitrary stochastic process by which an appropriate evaluation is conducted based on the probability measure that has been sequentially modified with additional information. It would be possible to use future prediction results for modifying the model to grasp the present state or re-evaluate the past state. It would be also possible to raise the degree of precision in predicting the future through the modification of the present and the past. Thus, 'data augmentation Bayesian forecasting' is applicable not only in the field of financial data analysis but also in forecasting and controlling the stochastic process.

J	Sun, Y; Xiong, ZX; Wang, XD				Sun, Yong; Xiong, Zixiang; Wang, Xiaodong			Progressive image transmission over differentially space-time coded OFDM systems	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						progressive image transmission; differentially space-time coding; OFDM; joint source-channel coding; SPIHT; JPEG 2000	DISPERSIVE FADING CHANNELS; WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS; ERROR PROTECTION; MODULATION; DIVERSITY; RECEIVERS	In this paper, we consider progressive image transmission over differentially space-time coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and treat the problem as one of optimal joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in the form of unequal error protection (UEP), as necessitated by embedded source coding (e.g., SPIHT and JPEG 2000). We adopt a product channel code structure that is proven to provide powerful error protection and employ low-complexity decision-feedback decoding for differentially space-time coded OFDM without assuming channel state information. For a given SNR, the BER performance of the differentially spacetime coded OFDM system is treated as the channel condition in the JSCC/UEP design via a fast product code optimization algorithm so that the end-to-end quality of reconstructed images is optimized in the average minimum MSE sense. Extensive image transmission experiments show that SNR/BER improvements can be translated into quality gains in reconstructed images. Moreover, compared to another non-coherent detection algorithm, i.e., the iterative receiver based on expectation-maximization algorithm for the space-time coded OFDM systems, differentially space-time coded OFDM systems suffer some quality loss in reconstructed images. With the efficiency and simplicity of decision-feedback differential decoding, differentially space-time coded OFDM is thus a feasible modulation scheme for applications such as wireless image over mobile devices (e.g., cell phones).

Robust DoA estimation by extension of the SAGE algorithm: algorithm description and trails results	IEE PROCEEDINGS-MICROWAVES ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article							EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION; ANTENNAS	By extending the space-alternating generalised expectation-maximisation (SAGE) parameter estimation algorithm to include a novel cost variant process, the robustness of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation from the SAGE algorithm is shown to improve. A novel extension to the standard SAGE algorithm that enhances the parameter estimation process is first introduced. Field trials that have been conducted using an adaptive antenna to verify the performance of this algorithm are presented. Results show that the extended SAGE algorithm improves DoA performance compared to standard SAGE by 5 degrees, when operating in an urban environment.

A batch EM algorithm was first applied, resulting in an estimator of the MAP sequence of turn rates. In this algorithm, the Kalman smoother and the, Viterbi algorithm were implemented repeated until the optimal estimation was achieved. Second, a recursive algorithm was derived using a modified EM cost function and could track a maneuvering coordinated turn motion target online. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that, the position and velocity accuracy based on the batch EM algorithm are greatly improved compared with the interacting multiple model algorithm. When the turn rate is stable, the position and velocity accuracy are also improved by the recursive EM algorithm.

Environmental data not only contains missing data with high incidence, but also contains some outliers. An improved robust expectation-maximization principal component analysis (EMPCA) was proposed to remove the outliers and estimate the missing data. The method was illustrated by an industrial wastewater treatment plant, in shenyang. The experimental results show the proposed EMPCA can effectively detect and rectify the outliers, estimate those missing data points.

Finite mixture models for nonidentical multiple tooled manufacturing	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						finite mixture distribution; FMD; fraction nonconforming; injection molding; log PDF; multiple cavity; nonidential multiple tooled; NIMT; ratio of tail probabilities	EM ALGORITHM; DISTRIBUTIONS	This paper presents a novel method to assess nonidentical multiple tooled (NIMT) manufacturing processes (like multiple cavity injection molding) using finite mixture distribution (FMD) models. A stepwise methodology is presented, including supporting mathematics and statistics. The methodology is illustrated and supported by its application to two sets of real multicavity injection molding data. The method is commercially relevant and is significant in that it allows enhanced examination of the fraction of the parts nonconforming or better setting of the specification level. Included are discussions of FMD models versus normal models and novel tail probability comparison methods (ratio of tail probabilities and log PDF comparisons). The methodology is recommended for NIMT processes, and is thought to better address the adequacy evaluation of processes where there are multiple nonidentical distributions mixing in production.

Normal/independent noise in VIRGO data	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop	DEC 14-17, 2005	Brownsville, TX					The analysis of data taken during the C7 VIRGO commissioning run showed strong deviations from Gaussian noise. In this work, we explore a family of distributions, derived from the hypothesis that heavy tails are an effect of a particular kind of nonstationarity, heterocedasticity (i.e. nonuniform variance), that appear to fit VIRGO noise better than a model based on the assumption of Gaussian noise. To estimate the parameters of the noise process (including the heterogeneous variance) we derived an expectation-maximization algorithm. We show the consequences of non-Gaussianity on the fitting of autoregressive filters and on the derivation of test statistics for matched filter operation.

Reducing artifacts in pelvic bone SPECT: An assessment of lesion detectability using numerical and human observers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						attenuation correction; dynamic SPECT; LROC study; numerical observers; pelvic SPECT	BLADDER ARTIFACTS; IMAGES	In pelvic bone SPECT using Tc-99m labeled compounds, physical effects such as nonhomogeneous attenuation and the accumulation of activity into the bladder during the data acquisition process can often result in data inconsistencies. With filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction, this may result in streak artifacts. Various methods for attenuation compensation can be employed to account for some of these streaks, but if the rate of uptake of tracer in to the bladder is sufficient, the resultant streaks may be significant enough to impair lesion detection. We have investigated various reconstruction methods in an effort to reduce these artifacts. In order to assess the impact of inconsistent bladder activities on the detection of pelvic lesions, SPECT imaging was simulated using the Zubal voxelized phantom, for cases of both a static bladder activity and a changing activity distribution. Reconstructions were performed using FBP, ordered subset-expectation maximization (OSEM) and dynamic expectation maximization (dEM) and was assessed for lesion delectability using a channelized, nonprewhitening (CNPW) numerical observer model. This observer model was used to optimize reconstruction strategies for a human LROC observer study. The human LROC observer study was performed in order to assess the various reconstruction methods in terms of lesion delectability. Three human observers were used in this test. The results of this test indicate that FBP performs significantly worse than static OSEM iterative reconstruction with attenuation correction when assessed using the area under the LROC curve (maximal A(LROC) = 0.47 for FBP versus 0.71 for OSEM). Visually, the dEM algorithm produces images with slightly reduced streak artifacts compared to OSEM, but this improvement was not reflected in significantly improved ALROC values. In fact, when assessed using human LROC methodology, delectability actually decreased slightly when using dEM (maximal ALROC = 0.71 for OSEM versus 0.66 for dEM), although this reduction was not determined to be statistically significant. It is possible that the slightly reduced performance of the dEM algorithm may be due, in part, to not performing an optimization in the number of reconstruction iterations as was performed for the OSEM method.

Inference methods for saturated models in longitudinal clinical trials with incomplete binary data	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						clinical trial; multiple-imputation; expectation-maximization; data augmentation	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODEL	In the longitudinal studies with binary response, it is often of interest to estimate the percentage of positive responses at each time point and the percentage of having at least one positive response by each time point. When missing data exist, the conventional method based on observed percentages could result in erroneous estimates. This study demonstrates two methods of using expectation-maximization (EM) and data augmentation (DA) algorithms in the estimation of the marginal and cumulative probabilities for incomplete longitudinal binary response data. Both methods provide unbiased estimates when the missingness mechanism is missing at random (MAR) assumption. Sensitivity analyses have been performed for cases when the MAR assumption is in question. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Also, Expectation Maximization by itself cannot estimate time-varying density functions. In this paper, a novel stochastic technique is introduced to overcome these two limitations. Kernel density estimation is used to obtain a discrete estimate of the true density of the given data. A Stochastic Learning Automaton is then used to select the number of mixture components that minimizes the distance between the density function estimated using the Expectation Maximization and discrete estimate of the density. The validity of the proposed approach is verified using synthetic and real univariate and bivariate observation data.

The first method uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate transforms for location and covariance parameters, and the second uses a generalized EM (GEM) approach which reduces computation in making updates from 0(p) to 0(p), where p is the feature dimension. We present the results of speaker adaptation on TIMIT phone classification and recognition experiments with relative error reductions of up to 6%. Importantly, we find minimal differences in the results from EM and GEM. We therefore propose that the GEM approach be applied to adaptation of hidden Markov models which use non-diagonal covariances. We provide the necessary update equations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This is called the inverse blackbody radiation problem. This problem is inherently ill-posed due to the characteristics of the kernel in the underlying integral equation given by Planck's law. The functions involved in the problem are all non-negative. Csiszar's I-divergence is an information-theoretic discrepancy measure between two non-negative functions. We derive iterative methods for minimizing Csiszar's I-divergence between the measured power spectrum and the power spectrum arising from the estimate according to the integral equation. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem, unconstrained algorithms often produce poor estimates, especially when the measurements are corrupted by noise. To alleviate this difficulty, we apply regularization methods to our algorithms. Penalties based on Shannon's entropy, the L-1-norm and Good's roughness are chosen to suppress the undesirable artefacts. When a penalty is applied, the pertinent optimization that needs to be performed at each iteration is no longer trivial. In particular, Good's roughness causes couplings between estimate components. To handle this issue, we adapt Green's one-step-late method. This choice is based on the important fact that our minimum I-divergence algorithms can be interpreted as asymptotic forms of certain expectation-maximization algorithms. The effectiveness of our methods is illustrated via various numerical experiments.

J	Hamdan, H; Govaert, G				Hamdan, Hani; Govaert, Gerard			Mixture model approach for acoustic emission control of cylindrical pressure equipment	JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD; CLUSTERING METHODS; EM ALGORITHM; CRITERIA	In this paper, we present a new and original mixture model approach for acoustic emission (AE) data clustering. AE techniques have been used in a variety of applications in industrial plants. These techniques can provide the most sophisticated monitoring test and can generally be done with the plant/pressure equipment operating at several conditions. Since the AE clusters may present several constraints (different proportions, volumes, orientations, and shapes), we propose to base the AE cluster analysis on Gaussian mixture models, which will be, in such situations, a powerful approach. Furthermore, the diagonal Gaussian mixture model seems to be well adapted to the detection and monitoring of defect classes since the weldings of cylindrical pressure equipment are lengthened horizontally and vertically (cluster shapes lengthened along the axes). The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm applied to a diagonal Gaussian mixture model provides a satisfactory solution but the real time constraints imposed in our problem make the application of this algorithm impossible if the number of points becomes too big. The solution that we propose is to use the CEM (Classification Expectation-Maximization) algorithm, which converges faster and generates comparable solutions in terms of resulting partition. The practical results on real data are very satisfactory from the experts point of view.

J	Li, H				Li, H			The covariance structure and likelihood function for multivariate dyadic data	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						diallel design; EM algorithm; exchangeability; maximum likelihood; patterned covariance; social relations model	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; QUADRATIC ANALYSES; VARIANCE; MODELS; ECM	This paper extends the results in Li and Loken [A unified theory of statistical analysis and inference for variance component models for dyadic data, Statist. Sinica 12 (2002) 519-535] on the statistical analysis of measurements taken on dyads to the situations in which more than one attribute are measured on each dyad. Starting from the covariance structure for the univariate case obtained in Li and Loken (2002), the covariance structure for the multivariate case is derived based on the group symmetry induced by the assumed exchangeability in the units. Our primary objective is to document the Gaussian likelihood and the sufficient statistics for multivariate dyadic data in closed form, so that they can be referenced by researchers as they analyze those data. The derivation carried out can also serve as an example of multivariate extension of univariate models based on exchangeability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Li, TF; Chang, SC; Lee, CB				Li, Tze Fen; Chang, Shui-Ching; Lee, Chung-Bow			A simple statistical speech recognition of mandarin monosyllables	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Bayes decision rule; linear predict coding; speech recognition	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ISOLATED WORD RECOGNITION; VECTOR QUANTIZATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; LINEAR PREDICTION; EM ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; CHAINS	Each mandarin syllable is represented by a sequence of vectors of linear predict coding cepstra (LPCC). Since all syllables have a simple phonetic structure, in our speech recognition, we partition the sequence of LPCC vectors of all syllables into equal segments and average the LPCC vectors in each segment. The mean vector of LPCC is used as the feature of a syllable. Our simple feature does not need any time consuming and complicated nonlinear contraction and expansion as adopted by the dynamic time-warping. We propose several probability distributions for the feature values. A simplified Bayes decision rule is used for classification of mandarin syllables. For the speaker-independent mandarin digits, the recognition rate is 98.6% if a normal distribution is used for feature values and the rate is 98.1% if an exponential distribution is used for the absolute values of the features. The feature proposed in this paper to represent a syllable is the simplest one, much easier to be extracted than any other known features. The computation for feature extraction and classification is much faster and more accurate than using the HMM method or any other known techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Freeman, J; Modarres, R				Freeman, J; Modarres, R			Estimating the bivariate mean vector of censored environmental data with Box-Cox transformations and E-M algorithm	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Box-Cox transformation; censored data; confidence region; delta-method; E-M algorithm; maximum likelihood	REGRESSION-ANALYSIS	We present a method for estimating the mean vector from a bivariate skew distribution that includes some unobserved data below the detection limits. The method uses a Box-Cox transformation, of which the parameters are found by maximizing the likelihood function over a fixed power transformation set. To estimate the mean vector and the covariance matrix, we develop an E-M algorithm solution. Given a transformation, we obtain expressions for the mean vector, covariance matrix, and the asymptotic covariance of the vector of means in the original scale. Expressions are obtained for a confidence region for the vector of means. The performance of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method in selecting the correct power transformation and the coverage rate of the confidence region under several conditions are investigated in a simulation study. This method gives reliable results for finding effective transformations and the coverage rate for highly skew data sets. The method is applied to water quality monitoring data.

In order to correct the degradation, a new multiple point spread function (PSF) model is introduced and used to restore X-ray diffraction image data (XRD). Raw PSFs are collected from isolated spots in high-resolution areas on the diffraction patterns which represent the orientation of DLDs. An adaptive ridge regression (ARR) technique is used to remove noise from the raw PSF data. A target Gaussian function is used to model the raw PSFs. A maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm combined with a multi-PSF model is employed to restore high intensity, asymmetrical protein X-ray diffraction data. Experimental results using a single and multiple PSFs are presented and discussed. We show that using a multiple PSF model in the deconvolution algorithm improved the quality of the XRD and as a result the spot integration error (chi(2)) and corresponding electron density mapare improved.

J	Hartley, R; Lanot, G				Hartley, R; Lanot, G			Heterogeneous demand responses to discrete price changes: an application to the purchase of lottery tickets	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						unobserved heterogeneity; Poisson distribution; expectation/maximisation algorithm; lottery	EM ALGORITHM; MIXTURE LIKELIHOODS; INFORMATION MATRIX; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GEOMETRY	During the survey period of any household expenditure survey price variations may occur. Such variation can be used to identify heterogeneous demand responses to price changes. This is feasible because expenditure surveys usually contain a large number of observations. The principal difficulty for estimation arises because of the sampling process which generates the data. An estimable model of individual purchase is presented and is estimated in the case of the demand for lottery tickets. This model allows identification of heterogeneous responses to changes in the rollover state (i.e. whether last week's jackpot has been added to the current jackpot). The distribution of heterogeneous responses, in the form of a bivariate mixing distribution, is shown to be identified from the available data. The EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the mixing distribution. The estimates imply that there is substantial heterogeneity in the population both in the normal expenditure levels and in the reaction to a jackpot rolled over. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this work was to assess the influence of data rebinning and reconstruction on lesion detectability and quantification for a high-resolution 3-D PET/CT system, in order to optimize 3-D PET/CT oncological protocols. Oncological F-18-FDG PET studies were Monte Carlo (MC) simulated, based on a normal-weight oncological patient study, varying lesion size, lesion-to-background ratio, statistics, and including or not attenuation and scatter effects. Single slice rebinned (SSR), Fourier rebinned (FORE) and Fully 3-D (3-D) sinograms were considered. Reconstruction was carried out using ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and attenuation weighting OSEM (AWOSEM). Human observers evaluated images in terms of clinical parameters characteristic of lesion detectability and quantification: lesion number and lesion size. By comparison with the known activity map (input for MC simulations), identified lesions were classified as true and false positive; the true positive fraction (TPF) and sensitivity were derived, as indices of lesion detectability. % maximum number of lesions identified with erroneous size (MAX(Is)) and % errors on lesion-to-background ratio (epsilon LBR) were calculated as quantitative indices for lesion characterization. The results show that, when images corrected for scatter and attenuation are considered, 2-D rebinning allows more lesions to be identified than 3-D, with the best detectability found using FORE + AWOSEM: in this case, sensitivity was found equal to 0.43, higher than with SSR + OSEM (0.30), SSR + AWOSEM (0.23), FORE + OSEM (0.35) and 3-D (0.18 for both OSEM and AWOSEM). Quantitatively, smaller MAX(Is) and smaller epsilon LBRs were found using FORE + AWOSEM, in comparison to 3-D + AWOSEM (p = 0.125 for both parameters); FORE + OSEM presented the smallest epsilon LBRs. Our findings, from one single simulated patient with lesions in the abdomen, suggest that, in the considered case, FORE is more suitable for lesion detectability and quantification than 3-D, FORE + AWOSEM presenting better performance for lesion detectability and spatial characterization, FORE + OSEM for the quantification of lesion activity concentration.

Cluster Analysis is an unsupervised learning technique that takes large collections of data points and attempts to identify clusters of similar points. More formally, it tries to create clusters to optimize various mathematical properties, such as minimizing the maximum spread of each cluster, or minimizing the sum of the spreads. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to create clusters from a data set, including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and expectation maximization. Association Rules have become one of the central tools in transactional data mining. They can also be applied as a way of looking for correlations and associations within epidemiological data. Support Vector Machines are a popular classification method which produce linear classifiers in the form of cutting hyperplanes, which divide the space into positive and negative examples. Through the so-called "kernel-trick" it can also produce non-linear rules by projecting the data into a different space. Statistical Techniques are a bedrock of epidemiological study, through sampling, hypothesis testing, experiment design, and inference techniques. An important suite of methods draw on Bayesian inference, giving more interpretable confidence bounds and simpler model fitting. Boosting is a very influential technique for "boosting" the quality of classifier-based methods by varying the emphasis put on examples to focus the classification method on the "harder examples". The output of a number of rules is then combined by taking a weighted majority vote. The method has been extended to a wide variety of settings, and applied to a large number of different scenarios. External Memory Algorithms are needed when the volume of data being processed exceeds the internal (fast) memory of the machine, and means that some data must reside on external (slow) memory, ie disks. Such methods give deep insights into the structure and properties of the underlying algorithms.

We conclude that if we can estimate the recent HIV incidence in a country, then HIV prevalence can be rather accurately estimated. Our results lead us to think that while the official estimates for Canada and Mexico may be fairly accurate, those for the United States are rather uncertain.

A promising direction is a family of partially-supervised relation extraction systems that require little manual training. However, the output of such systems tend to be noisy, and hence it is crucial to be able to estimate the quality of the extracted information. We present Expectation-Maximization algorithms for automatically evaluating the quality of the extraction patterns and derived relation tuples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of relations.			eugeneag@microsoft.com					Agichtein E., 2000, P 5 ACM INT C DIG LI; BALDWIN B, 2003, LINGPIPE SYSTEM; Brin Sergey, 1998, P 1998 INT WORKSH WE; CULOTTA A, 2004, P HUM LANG TECHN C N; Dempster A., 1977, J ROYAL STAT SOC; DOWNEY D, 2005, P 19 INT JOINT C ART; GRISHMAN R, 2002, P HUM LANG TECHN C H; GRISHMAN R, 1997, INORM EXTRACTION INT; Hasegawa T., 2004, P ANN M ASS COMP LIN; LIU B, 2002, P ICML C; RILOFF E, 1996, P 13 NAT C ART INT; Salton G., 1989, AUTOMATIC TEXT PROCE; YANGARBER R, 2000, P C APPL NAT LANG PR; YI JH, 1999, P 1999 WORKSH WEB IN; ZHAO SB, 2005, P ANN M ACL	15	0	0	SIAM	PHILADELPHIA	3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA		978-0-89871-611-5	SIAM PROC S			2006							539	543				5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BUJ09	WOS:000289491100056

Analysis of Region of Interest Quantification for PET Image Reconstruction with Selective Regularization	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			SPATIAL-RESOLUTION PROPERTIES; PENALIZED-LIKELIHOOD RECONSTRUCTION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; A-POSTERIORI RECONSTRUCTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; LESION DETECTABILITY; MAP RECONSTRUCTION; SIDE INFORMATION	Quantifying PET tracer uptake in a region of interest (ROI) is an important task in a variety of applications including brain imaging, myocardial imaging, and tumor activity assessment. Many post-reconstruction correction methods that compensate for spatial resolution or partial volume effects have been proposed for ROI quantification. Here our goal is to optimize the image reconstruction methods themselves for this task through the use of spatially variant regularization. We investigate and analyze a selective regularization strategy where reduced smoothing is imposed across the boundary of a pre-specified ROI which can be drawn, for example, from a coregistered CT image. Preliminary simulation results show that this strategy leads to better bias/variance trade-offs than spatially uniform regularization. However, the penalty function for selective smoothing is space-variant and therefore it is not straightforward to predict the bias and variance of ROI uptake estimators in a computationally efficient way without expensive Monte Carlo simulation. Here we develop a computationally efficient method to predict bias and variance through use of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity and local Fourier approximations.

When software fault-detection rates change in the software testing phase, fault-detection processes can be generally modeled by Markov modulated processes. This paper deals with a unified parameter estimation. method for Markov modulated software reliability models as well as the typical pure birth process models. In numerical examples, we evaluate a goodness-of-fit for the Markov modulated software reliability models with realfault data, and show numerically that the Markov modulated software reliability models are superior to the existing pure birth process models in the viewpoint of information criterion.

Starting upon the consideration that fading correlation prevents, in this scenario, the symbols to be decoded independently, the causal (i.e., corresponding to zero decoding delay) Maximum-Likelihood (ML) receiver is first derived: as expected, the resulting structure has a complexity which grows exponentially in the number of users, preventing any practical implementation. Sub-optimum detection strategies are thus investigated, basically through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm: the resulting receiver can be thought of as a combination of an interference suppressor and a Kalman filter, both operating iteratively. The results show that the newly proposed receiver achieves near-optimum performance and outperforms its direct competitors based on decorrelating detection.

Different watermarking schemes have been suggested for images. This paper proposes a watermarking algorithm based on image segmentation and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The image is first segmented using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. For each segment, the image segment is subdivided into pixels blocks of size 8 x 8 (64 pixels), and zigzag reordered. The DCT of the block is then computed. Then, a pseudorandom sequence of real numbers is embedded in the DCT domain of each image segment. Different experiments are conducted to show the performance of the scheme under different types of attacks. The results show that our proposed watermark scheme is robust to common signal distortions, including geometric manipulations.

In this paper, we first implement a WSD system for nouns and verbs, then the language sense model (LSM) for information retrieval is proposed. The LSM combines the terms and senses of a document seamlessly through an EM algorithm. Retrieval on TREC collections shows that the LSM outperforms both the vector space model (BM25) and the traditional language model significantly for both medium and long queries (7.53%-16.90%). Based on the experiments, we can also empirically draw the conclusion that the fine-grained senses will improve the retrieval performance when they are properly used.

While normal mixture models are often used to cluster data sets of continuous multivariate data, a more robust clustering can be obtained by considering the t mixture model-based approach. Mixtures of factor analyzers enable model-based density estimation to be undertaken for high-dimensional data where the number of observations n is very large relative to their dimension p. As the approach using the multivariate normal family of distributions is sensitive to outliers, it is more robust to adopt the multivariate t family for the component error and factor distributions. The computational aspects associated with robustness and high dimensionality in these approaches to cluster analysis are discussed and illustrated.

Steven			ROC analysis of PET imaging performance of two PET/CT scanners based on lesion detectability in a torso phantom	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; WHOLE-BODY PET; FDG-PET; RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS; ATTENUATION CORRECTION; TUMOR-DETECTION; LUNG-CANCER; 3D PET; IMAGES; METHODOLOGY	Positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) are established imaging tools. Integrated PET/CT scanners are now commonly used in radiation treatment planning to delineate accurate tumor margins, to identify nodal involvement, and in post-treatment follow-up assessments. The use of PET/CT images for quantitative selection of dose prescriptions is also being considered. The usefulness of the images produced for these applications depends strongly on the interplay between the performance of the imaging system and the skill of the diagnostician. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PET component of two PET/CT scanners using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the ability of human observers to identify the presence of simulated tumors in PET images of an anthropomorphic torso phantom. We also assessed the effects of PET acquisition and reconstruction parameters (such as acquisition length and reconstruction method) on the observers' performances and the relationship of performance to physical system factors (such as resolution and sensitivity). Image data of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose distribution in the phantom and water-filled acrylic spheres were acquired with the PET/CT scanners; the spheres simulate tumors. Data were obtained for a variety of acquisition and reconstruction parameters available on the scanners. Positive and negative images were generated from the acquired image data, representing up to two simulated tumors per image as visualized with the various system parameters. The images were rated for the presence of tumors by "trained" observers (physicians who use radiologic images daily in patient management) and "untrained" observers (medical physicists, post-doctoral researchers, and medical physics graduate students who do not use these images routinely). ROC curves were generated to assess readers' performances relative to the scanners' parameters as characterized by area under the curve (A(z)). Overall, the untrained group provided little discriminating power in this study, perhaps because of its heterogeneous levels of experience. Trained observers consistently outperformed untrained observers. As well, trained observers performed significantly better using Reveal HD system images than with images generated in the Discovery ST two-dimensional (2D) mode (p<0.01); however, differences between other pairings of scanners were not significant. Of the three reconstruction algorithms investigated (ordered-subset expectation maximization [OSEM], filtered backprojection, and direct-inversion Fourier transform), OSEM produced the smallest A(z) for trained observers. Because of its higher sensitivity and higher resolution, the fully 3D Reveal HD facilitated better performance by the trained observers than the Discovery ST 2D mode. To further evaluate the use of PET/CT in radiation therapy treatment planning, we will plan to expand this study to include fused PET/CT images and specific radiation therapy treatment planning tasks, such as drawing clinical target volume margins around tumors.

Here we report a genome-wide analysis of motifs involved in human brain-specific or muscle-specific alternative splicing. Comparing relative abundance of alternative splice forms based on Bayesian statistics, we identified many tissue-specific exon skipping events in normal or tumor samples from brain or muscle. Motifs possibly function in these events were subsequently distinguished using EM algorithm. Analyses of these motifs suggest that some exons are tissue-specifically skipped through a loop out mechanism and motif locations are sometimes important. Furthermore, comparison of motifs in normal and tumor samples suggests that there may exist different tumorigenesis mechanisms between brain and muscle. These results provide some insights into the regulation mechanism of alternative splicing and may throw light on cancer therapy.

The method is based on a stochastic multiresolution analysis which involves all partial sums (scales) of normalized differences between the projected images and the detector data for each row of the sinogram. Previous methods involved only the single total sum of these differences for all detectors. Our method is theoretically founded on recent results from probability theory on the almost sure behaviour of the maximum of the partial sum process for Poisson data. Preliminary tests indicate that this method produces predictions for the optimal stopping iterations which are robust relative to modeling errors in the system matrix and has a signal-to-noise ratio which is 80% of the maximal SNR available from the MLEM iterates.

The main advantage of the method is the ability to bypass the problem of overlapping patterns in neighboring positions of sequences by using a Markov random field (MRF) prior. This model consists of two components, the first models the pattern and the second the background. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters and provides closed form updates. Special care is also taken to overcome the known dependence of the EM algorithm to initialization. This is done by applying an adaptive clustering scheme based on the k-means algorithm in order to produce good initial values for the pattern multinomial model. Experiments with artificial sets of sequences show that the proposed approach discovers qualitatively better patterns, in comparison with maximum likelihood (ML) and Gibbs sampling (GS) approaches.

After a general review of our studies, we will describe our recent researches on propagation of polarization entangled photons in optical fibres focused on the investigation of the effect of two-photon interference in the second-order Glauber's correlation function and on the characterization of this quantum channel as a Complete Positive (CP) map. We will then describe an innovative method, based on detectors operating in Geiger mode (on/off), for reconstructing the photon statistics of quantum optical states, presenting experimental data collected to test the extension of this method to multi-partite states.

The main characteristic of our approach is to use a stochastic approximation algorithm to approximate the conditional expectation of the complete-data sufficient statistic rather than the unknown parameter itself. Compared to existing approaches, the new algorithm requires no analytical gradient or Hessian computation, it deals with parameter constraints straightforwardly and the resulting estimate can be shown to be Fisher-efficient in general settings. This approach is illustrated on the classic direction of arrival (DOA) model.

Multi target direction-of-arrival tracking using road priors	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference, Vols 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT				PARTICLE FILTERS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; DENSITIES; ARRAYS	In this paper, we present a multi target particle filter DOA tracker that can incorporate road prior information at a single array node. The filter uses a batch of DON's to determine the state vector, based on an image template matching idea. The filter likelihood is derived with the joint probability density association principles so that no DOA measurement is associated to more than one target. The filter state update has the target DOA, the target velocity over range ratio, and the target heading parameters. We present two approaches for incorporating the road information. In the first approach, the road prior is injected at the weighting stage of the tracker, where a raised mixture Gaussian distribution, derived from the road headings at the target DOA, constraints the particles. The second approach is based on modifying the state update function with a compound model, where a mixture of the constant velocity model and the road information is used. In this case, the filter uses an online EM algorithm to update the state vector along with the mixture components. Computer simulations demonstrate the performance of the approaches.

We propose a space-time signal detector based on the EM algorithm. The principal concept of the proposed receiver is the exploration of the neighbourhood for each transmitted symbol. Based on the neighbourhood subsets, the detector provides a close approximation of the a posteriori probability (APP) for each encoded bit. Accordingly, extrinsic information is extracted and exchanged between the EM-based detector and the MAP decoder in each iteration. The proposed receiver is scalable, in the sense that, the extent of the neighbourhood can be shrunk or expanded to provide a tradeoff between the computational complexity and bit error rate performance.

However, given that the solution space is large and multimodal, EM is prone to produce inconsistent and sub-optimal solutions over multiple runs. This paper presents a novel global greedy learning method called the Greedy Elimination Method (GEM) to alleviate these problems. GEM is simple to implement in any finite mixture model, yet effective to enhance the global optimality and the consistency of the solutions. It is also very efficient as its complexity grows only linearly with the number of data patterns. GEM is demonstrated on clustering synthetic datasets using the mixture of Gaussian model, and on clustering the shrinking spiral data set using the mixture of Factor Analyzers.

To make the results more comprehensive, the algorithm was tested on both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic PNNs. Normally, user have to define the number of clusters through trial and error method, which makes random initialization to be of stochastic nature. Global k-means was chosen as the initialization method because it can autonomously find the number of clusters using a selection criterion and can provide deterministic clustering results. The proposed algorithm was tested on benchmark datasets and real world data from the cooling water system in a power plant.

One of the problems encountered was the high computational cost and low efficiency of the development phase. In this paper we compare our original development approach of evaluating summaries produced by an exhaustive search over all parameters with a much faster development method using an expectation maximization algorithm that minimizes perplexity in order to find the optimal combination of linguistic models for the speech summarisation task. Perplexity proves to be sufficiently correlated to the objective evaluation metrics used in the summarisation literature that it can be used in this fashion. For a much reduced computational cost (approximately 500 times faster), final relative improvements are very similar to those previously obtained, ranging from 1.5% to 21.3% on all investigated metrics for summaries made from automatic speech recogniser transcriptions.

Space-variant neural network approach to blind image deconvolution	10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL MULTITOPIC CONFERENCE 2006, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE International Multitopic Conference	DEC 23, 2006	Islamabad, PAKISTAN			image restoration; blind deconvolution; neural networks; ARMA model	EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM; RESTORATION; IDENTIFICATION; BLUR	A new space-variant neural network based blind image deconvolution method is proposed for restoring degraded images and the space-variant blur simultaneously. The neural network model is based on an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process in which the AR part of the neural network defines the image model and its coefficients, while the MA part defines the degradation process. Since the blur affects textured region and smooth regions differently the image is divided into blocks, which have been categorized into four classes according to their activity. Furthermore it is assumed that blur is space-invariant in each block. This classification enhances the texture of relatively textured regions while suppressing the noise in relatively smoother backgrounds. A new cost function motivated by the human visual perception system is also proposed for the neural network. This comprises of two new terms for matching the second order local statistics of each block in order to improve the visual quality of the restored image. Improvement in signal to noise ratio (ISNR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the estimated blur have been used as figures of merit. Our proposed algorithm has given better results in terms of ISNR and NMSE compared to some of the results available in the literature.

However, the existing ensemble training algorithms sometimes generate unnecessary large ensembles, which consume extra computational resource and may degrade the performance. Ensemble pruning algorithm aims to find a good subset of ensemble members to constitute a small ensemble, which saves the computational resource and performs as well as, or better than, the non-pruned ensemble. This paper will introduce a probabilistic ensemble pruning algorithm by choosing a set of "sparse" combination weights, most of which are zero, to prune the large ensemble. In order to obtain the set of sparse combination weights and satisfy the non-negative restriction of the combination weights, a left-truncated, non-negative, Gaussian prior is adopted over every combination weight. Expectation-Maximization algorithm is employed to obtain maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of weight vector. Four benchmark regression problems and another four benchmark classification problems have been employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

We generated 3D NCAT phantoms with different body sizes, organ uptake ratios, lesion sizes and lesion contrasts to simulate variations found in a patient population. Monte Carlo methods were then used to generate projection data. The projections were reconstructed using the OS-EM algorithm with different compensations including attenuation compensation (AC), AC and scatter compensation (SC) and AC, SC and collimator-detector response compensation (CDR). We used the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) for all the 3 settings of ROC studies. The area under ROC curves (AUC) was used as the figure of merit to optimize the updates number and postfilter cut-off frequency of OS-EM with different compensations and then compare the optimized methods. The results show that all 3 different settings of ROC study give consistent results for comparing optimized OS-EM with different compensations. ROC setting 2, which involves localization uncertainty and nonlinear combination of body size variations have better statistical power than the SPKE setting (setting 1). The AUC of CHO in ROC setting 2 and 3 are significantly lower than that of setting 1 which may predict better the human observers' performances in clinical trials.([1])	[Chen, Si; Tsui, Benjamin M.

PET Reconstruction Using Generalized Natural Pixels and a Monte Carlo Generated System Matrix	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			3D; SPECT	The spatially variant detector response can reduce spatial resolution in PET imaging. In iterative reconstruction methods, the detector response can be modeled into the system response matrix (SRM). Unfortunately, the SRM for current PET scanners can be very large. We have been evaluating PET reconstruction using generalized natural pixel (GNP) functions. With these pixel functions, the SRM becomes block-circulant for a ring-PET scanner, thereby substantially reducing the number of non-redundant elements in the SRM. Application of the generalized natural pixel functions assumes a perfect rotationally symmetric system. There are no such PET scanners in reality. We developed a method to correct and match an actual PET scanner geometry to a virtual rotationally symmetric system. The Geant4 based GATE Monte Carlo simulation code was used to model a 2D version of the Philips Allegro PET scanner consisting of one ring with 616 GSO crystals. The simulation code modeled all interactions within the detector. To evaluate and compare reconstruction algorithms, a simulated 2D phantom and two physical phantoms were used to collect simulated or experimental LOR-binned fan beam sinogram data. Reconstruction was performed using either an algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) with generalized natural pixels, or a LOR-based maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm (MLEM) using Siddon ray tracing. We studied the contrast versus noise as a function of iteration number. The GNP-ART method clearly outperforms the LOR-MLEM with higher contrast at the same noise level. This can be simply attributed to the improvement of spatial resolution in GNP-ART by modeling spatially variant detector response in the SRM.

However the performance may be degraded when irrelevant variables are included. To overcome this drawback, we adopt the concept of feature salience as the feature weight to measure the relevance to the clusters in the subspace, and integrate it into the RPEM algorithm. The proposed algorithm distinguishes the probably redundant features and estimate the number of clusters automatically and simultaneously in a single learning paradigm. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and benchmark real data set have shown the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

The segmentation method consists of a pre-processing stage for initialization and the final segmentation stage. First, in the initial segmentation stage, we adopt the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the Deterministic Annealing Expectation Maximization (DAEM) algorithm to compute the posterior probabilities for each pixels belonging to some region. And then we usually segment an image to assign each pixel to the object with maximum posterior probability. Next, we use the level set method to achieve the final segmentation. By using the level set method with a new defined speed function, the segmentation accuracy can be improved while making the boundaries of each object much smoother. This function combines the alignment term, which makes a level set as close as possible to a boundary of object, the minimal variance term, which best separates the interior and exterior in the contour and the mean curvature term, which makes a segmented boundary become less sensitive to noise. And we also use the Fast Matching Method for re-initialization that can reduce the computing time largely. The experimental results show that our proposed method can segment exactly the synthetic and CT images.

In practice, however. there are users whose information of spreading codes and channel codes is not available. In this case, a blind multiuser detector for unknown interferers can be applied within the iterative receiver. In the paper, we attempt to estimate the covariance of interferers within the iterative receiver based on the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm. Through iterations, a better estimate of the covariance of interferers is available and it results in a better performance.

Explicit solutions are given for MIMO channel estimation with Gaussian prior and noise covariance estimation with inverse-Wishart prior. Simulation of a GSM-like system provides empirical proof that the VBEM-algorithm is able to provide better performance than the EM-algorithm. However, if the posterior distribution is highly peaked, the VBEM-algorithm approaches the EM-algorithm and the gain disappears. The potential gain is therefore greatest in systems with a small amount of observations compared to the number of parameters to be estimated.

We propose a real-time method for robust speech detection in natural, noisy environments. It is based on a fusion of high order statistics of the LPC residual and autocorrelation, and adopts an on-line version of Expectation Maximization algorithm for the classification. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method provides better detection performance under different types of natural noises, working robustly against other voices in the context of multi-speaker interactive situations. As the proposed method is based on features which have a low computational cost, and has a small latency, it is suitable for real-time tracking applications.

A sample background subtraction algorithm is used to get the binary mask of moving objects for segmenting the video sequence captured by fixed camera. Then a mixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) using the expectation-maximization (EM) scheme is fitted to the motion data extracted from the binary mask. Unlike previous literatures using k-means where every observed data set only assigned to a single HMM, the proposed approach allows every video segment to belong to more than a single HMM with some probability. Expermients with real data demonstrate the benefit when there is more "overlap" the processes generating the data. The promising potential of HMM-based motion clustering for mining similar video segments from surveillance video is also indicated by the experimental results.

An exciting field called video mining is now putting forward which focuses on extracting semantic info, implicit patterns and knowledge from video data. In this paper, a surveillance video data mining approach is proposed to discover similar video segments from surveillance video through a probabilistic model. First, a simple background subtraction algorithm is utilized to get the binary mask of moving objects. So the motion of every frame is calculated to segment the sequence of surveillance video. Then a mixture of hidden Markov models using the expectation-maximization scheme is fitted to the motion data with some probability to identity the similar segments. Finally, abnormal events and meaningful patterns are mined. Experiments with real-time video demonstrate the promising potential of this approach.

This will result in a global blurring of the images, smoothing across edges and possibly discarding valuable image information for detection tasks. The purpose of this study is to investigate which possible advantages a non-linear, edge-preserving postfilter could have on lesion detection in Ga-67 SPECT imaging. Image quality can be defined based on the task that has to be performed on the image. This study used LROC observer studies based on a dataset created by CPU-intensive Gate Monte Carlo simulations of a voxelized digital phantom. The filters considered in this study were a linear Gaussian filter, a bilateral filter, the Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion filter and the Catte filtering scheme. The 3D MCAT software phantom was used to simulate the distribution of Ga-67 citrate in the abdomen. Tumor-present cases had a 1-cm diameter tumor randomly placed near the edges of the anatomical boundaries of the kidneys, bone, liver and spleen. Our data set was generated out of a single noisy background simulation using the bootstrap method, to significantly reduce the simulation time and to allow for a larger observer data set. Lesions were simulated separately and added to the background afterwards. These were then reconstructed with an iterative approach, using a sufficiently large number of MLEM iterations to establish convergence. The output of a numerical observer was used in a simplex optimization method to estimate an optimal set of parameters for each postfilter. No significant improvement was found for using edge-preserving filtering techniques over standard linear Gaussian filtering.

Analytical methods have become an alternative to Monte Carlo Simulations. In order to reduce the storage of this huge matrix and to make some calculations feasible it is posible to factorize this matrix. Each new factor matrix can incorporate different data acquisition effects but the geometric matrix is still the crux. We propose here and exact analytical 3D true solid angle of view model for the elements in this geometric transition matrix. Initial results suggest that some relevant differences could exist with some aproximate models previously proposed to date.	[de la Prieta, R.; Hernandez, J.

MUSIC and ESPRIT are subspace-based methods while SAGE is a maximum-likelihood technique. A BPSK signal was transmitted off-the-air and was received under varied system parameters. The three algorithms were then applied on the recorded data. The performance of the three algorithms was compared based on their capability to estimate the signal's general DoA. The results showed that SAGE has an average deviation in signal localization of 3.5 degrees, followed by MUSIC 3.8 degrees and ESPRIT 9.7 degrees. Further tests show that SAGE can closely estimate the signal DoA with lower data samples than MUSIC and ESPRIT. For subspace-based methods, a 4-element antenna array gives better estimates than a 2-element array.

It is also very difficult to take into account the 3D nature of the images. Thus. semior fully-automatic methods are of great interest. Current segmentation algorithms based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure present some limitations. The algorithm by Ashburner et al., 2005, does not allow multichannel inputs, e.g. two MR images of different contrast, and does not use spatial constraints between adjacent voxels, e.g. Markov random field (MRF) constraints. The solution of Van Leemput et al., 1999, employs a simplified model (mixture coefficients are not estimated and only one Gaussian is used by tissue class, with three for the image background). We have thus implemented an algorithm that combines the features of these two approaches: multichannel inputs, intensity bias correction, multi-Gaussian histogram model, and Markov random field (MRF) constraints. Our proposed method classifies tissues in three iterative main stages by way of a Generalized-EM (GEM) algorithm: (1) estimation of the Gaussian parameters modeling the histogram of the images, (2) correction of image intensity non-uniformity, and (3) modification of prior classification knowledge by MRF techniques. The goal of the GEM algorithm is to maximize the log-likelihood across the classes and voxels. Our se-mentation algorithm was validated on synthetic data (with the Dice metric criterion) and real data (by a neurosurgeon) and compared to the original algorithms by Ashburner et al. and Van Leemput et al. Our combined approach leads to more robust and accurate segmentation.

This problem resides at the core of many motion tracking methods with applications in human motion capture, action recognition, medical-image analysis, etc. We describe an articulated and bending surface representation well suited for this task as well as a method which aligns (or registers) such a surface to 3-D data. Articulated objects, e.g., humans and animals, are covered with clothes and skin which may be seen as textured surfaces. These surfaces are both articulated and deformable and one realistic way to model them is to assume that they bend in the neighborhood of the shape's joints. We will introduce a surface-bending model as a function of the articulated-motion parameters. This combined articulated-motion and surface-bending model better predicts the observed phenomena in the data and therefore is well suited for surface registration. Given a set of sparse 3-D data (gathered with a stereo camera pair) and a textured, articulated, and bending surface, we describe a register-and-fit method that proceeds as follows. First, the data-to-surface registration problem is formalized as a classifier and is carried out using an EM algorithm. Second, the data-to-surface fitting problem is carried out by minimizing the distance from the registered data points to the surface over the joint variables. In order to illustrate the method we applied it to the problem of hand tracking. A hand model with 27 degrees of freedom is successfully registered and fitted to a sequence of 3-D data points gathered with a stereo camera pair.

The main idea consists a modelling the case base by a bayesian network. Bayesian networks are excellent tools for the modelling of the uncertain in terms of their clear graphic representation as well as the conditional probabilities laws defined on this graph. Our network allows a representation of a qualitative and causal knowledge in addition to a quantitative knowledge which expresses the uncertainty. It contains four levels: clinical, biologic, medical imaging and diagnosis-therapy. Each level has a table containing the different conditional probabilities. in order to get a good final diagnosis. Each level is composed of a set of attributes; each attribute corresponds to a node of a network. The arcs describe the relations between these attributes as conditional probabilities of attributes in the case. We have used the exact algorithm of inference JLO-Jensen, Lauritzen et Olesen- to calculate the conditional probabilities. When we have a new case, it is inserted in the network and is propagated to the network. When some signs are missed, we have used another algorithm of learning EM- Expectation Maximisation to estimate the conditional probabilities of the missed variables in order to get a good learning. We have chosen this modelling in order to obtain a good final diagnosis.

The Turbo receiver structures for SFBC/STBC-OFDM systems under consideration consists of an iterative MAP Expectation/Maximization (EM) channel estimation algorithm, soft MMSE SFBC/STBC decoder and a soft MAP outer-channel-code decoder. MAP-EM employs iterative channel estimation and it improves receiver performance by re-estimating the channel after each decoder iteration. Moreover, the MAP-EM approach considers the channel variations as random processes and applies the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) orthogonal series expansion. The performance of the proposed approaches are studied in terms of mean square error and bit-error rate. Through experimental results, the effect of a pilot spacing on the channel estimator performance and sensitivity of turbo receiver structures on channel estimation error are studied.

Previous studies have estimated R-0 from outbreaks of the disease, but these estimates are prone to uncertainties due to the small population sizes and the short data runs. This study uses data from smallpox deaths in London over the period 1708 to 1748. Although smallpox was endemic in the population at this time, by using the EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of an age-structured nonlinear model of the disease dynamics, an estimate of R-0 is obtained. The algorithm exploits the structure of the model in which the parameter vector is affine, once estimates of the states have been obtained from an extended Kalman smoother. The model also reveals the importance of temperature and rainfall on the transmissibility of the disease.

Pattern recognition in multiband imagery using stochastic expectation maximization	OPTICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS IV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Information Systems IV	AUG 16-17, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		pattern recognition; SEM algorithm; Gaussian mixture model; remote sensing data	TARGET DETECTION; ALGORITHM; PCA	Hyperspectral sensors can facilitate automatic pattern recognition in cluttered imagery since man made objects often differ considerably from the natural background in absorbing and reflecting the radiation at various wavelengths i.e., the identification of the objects is based on spectral signature of the objects in the scene. In this paper, a unified approach for pattern recognition with known object signature is formulated by generating Gaussian mixture model to effectively utilize the underlying statistics of the data cube. To estimate the model parameters, enhanced version of the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm is employed, which is also used successfully for image classification by reducing the unwanted information in the data cube. In the proposed scheme, at first we used the modified SEM to identify the different classes in the scene including the desired object class. Then, the Mahalanobis distance between the desired object signature and distributions of the mixture model is employed to detect the object class. Finally, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability for each pixel is estimated and Bayesian decision law is applied in order to isolate object pixels. The proposed algorithm has been tested using real life hyperspectral imagery and the results show that the algorithm shows robust performance in noisy environment.

The theoretically optimal approach to this multi-target filtering is a suitable generalization of the recursive Bayes nonlinear filter. However, this optimal filter is intractable and computationally challenging that it must usually be approximated. We report on the approximation of a multi-target non-linear filtering for Sensor Management that is based on the particle filter implementation of Stein-Winter probability hypothesis densities (PHDs). Our main focus is on the operational utility of the implementation, and its computational efficiency and robustness for sensor management applications. We present a multitarget Particle Filter (PF) implementation of the PHD that include clustering, regularization, and computational efficiency. We present some open problems, and suggest future developments. Sensor management demonstrations using a simulated multi-target scenario are presented.

The new framework utilizes an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate simultaneously (1) tissue fractions in each image voxel and (2) statistical model parameters of the image data under the principle of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). The previous EM approach models the PV effect by down-sampling a voxel and then labels each subvoxel as a pure tissue type, where the number of subvoxels labeled by a given tissue type over the total number of subvoxels reflects the fraction of that tissue type inside the original voxel. The tissue fractions in each voxel in this discrete PV model are represented by a limited number of percentage values. In the new MAPEM approach, the PV effect is modeled in a continuous space and estimated directly as the fraction of each tissue type in the original voxel. The previous discrete PV model would converge to the proposed continuous PV tissue-mixture model if there is an infinite number of subvoxels within a voxel. However, in practice a voxel is usually down-sampled once or twice for computational reasons. A simulation study reveals that the continuous PV model is not only more realistic but also more accurate than the discrete PV model.

First part of the paper analyzes the estimation problem based on the assumption that there is no temporal correlation between link losses for different probes. We have applied Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to this problem. We compared the results of EM with a direct approach developed in [2]. The second part of the paper is based on the assumption of Markov temporal correlation between packet losses. We applied EM algorithm to this problem with E-step approximated by Gibbs sampling, completely factorized variational and structured variational approximation. We observed from simulation that the links closer to observed nodes give more accurate results and that structured variational approximation improves simple variational approximation results considerably.

However, it remains unknown whether these results can be applied to iterative reconstruction methods which are based discrete-discrete imaging models. In this paper, we explore the behavior of iterative reconstruction methods for truncated data. We evaluate the maximum-likelihood (ML) expectation-maximization (EM) method under three data truncation cases, namely, the classical interior and exterior tomography problems, and a new type of peripheral ROIs which satisfy the data sufficiency condition for the two-step Hilbert transform method [1]. The simulation results show that the peripheral ROIs can be reconstructed by ML-EM method regardless of truncation, but the interior and exterior problem suffer from different degrees of artifacts. These results are consistent with existing analytical data sufficiency conditions. We also numerically calculate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the truncated system matrix, which shows that when the analytical sufficient condition for an ROI is satisfied, the singular vectors associated with very small singular values have little intersection with the ROI.

A cyclically equal-spaced, equal-energy interleaved pilot preamble is proposed by which two iterative estimators are developed. In the first estimator, we develop a modified SAGE (space alternating generalized expectation-maximization) method by incorporating multiuser interference cancellation in both time and frequency domains into the SAGE method. The proposed modified SAGE method yields a faster convergence rate, a better estimation performance, and a lower complexity than the existing conventional SAGE method from [10]. In the second method, we propose a very low complexity ad-hoc method to replace the high complexity frequency offset estimator of the first method. The proposed ad-hoc method is developed based on the time-domain characteristics of the pilot preamble and the frequency-domain power concentration property of OFDMA systems. It achieves almost the same estimation performance as the first proposed method but requires significantly lower complexity. Both proposed methods are not only better in estimation performance, convergence rate, and complexity, but also more robust to the number of active uplink users than the existing method while requiring only one OFDM training symbol and no restriction of the data subcarrier assignment scheme.

There, however, are not many studies that describe the topological relationship between multibple cables for autonomous operation of robotics device. In this paper, an autonomous computing way to create 3-D topological model of multiple cables using image is discussed. Cable model is described by probablity density function and optimized its parameters via EM Algorithm, that indicates the configuration and topological relationships. In order to manipulate the object cables then, depth from sensor to points are added to the unique points in topological graph structure derived from EM model. The quantitative results of basic experiment that was aimed to prove the recognition possibility via the algorithm are reported.

While large amount of monitoring data can be collected from such systems for fault analysis, one challenge is how to correlate the data effectively across distributed systems and observation time. Much of the internal monitoring data reacts to the volumes of user requests accordingly when user requests flow through distributed systems. In this paper, we use Gaussian mixture models to characterize probabilistic correlation between flow-intensities measured at multiple points. A novel algorithm derived from Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to learn the "likely" boundary of normal data relationship, which is further used as an oracle in anomaly detection. Our recursive algorithm can adaptively estimate the boundary of dynamic data relationship and detect faults in real time. Our approach is tested in a real system with injected faults and the results demonstrate its feasibility.

In this paper, we present a novel automated flow segmentation method by using PC-MRA image series. The intensity time series of each pixel is modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process and features including the Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC), covariance matrix of LPC and variance of prediction error are extracted from each profile. Bayesian classification of the feature space is then achieved using a non-Gaussian likelihood probability function and unknown parameters of the likelihood function are estimated by a generalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The efficiency of the method evaluated on both synthetic and real retrospective gated PC-MRA images indicate that robust segmentation of CSF and vessels can be achieved by using this method.

Background image and target-existing image are converted from RGB space to HSV space. The Euclid distance between these two transformed images in HSV space is computed and compared with that in RGB space. To segment the target region from the background, SEM algorithm is applied. Then the MAP criterion is used for further segmentation. With certain prior knowledge about the size of the target, final segmentation result is got by region growing algorithm. The result of simulation shows that these segmentation methods are very efficient when used together.

In many situations, these tasks involve complex behaviors combining different functionalities (e.g. perception, localization, motion planning and motion execution). These behaviors are often programmed with a strong focus on the robustness of the behavior itself, not on the definition of a "high level" model to be used by a task planner and an execution controller. We propose to learn behaviors models as structured stochastic processes: Dynamic Bayesian Network. Indeed, the DBN formalism allows us to learn and control behaviors with controllable parameters. We experimented our approach on a real robot, where we learned over a large number of runs the model of a complex navigation task using a modified version of Expectation Maximization for DBN. The resulting DBN is then used to control the robot navigation behavior and we show that for some given objectives (e.g. avoid failure. optimize speed), the learned DBN driven controller performs much better than the programmed controller. We also show a way to achieve efficient incremental learning of the DBN. We believe that the proposed approach remains generic and can be used to learn complex behaviors other than navigation and for other autonomous systems.

In these studies, subjects often drop out of the study before the occurrence of the terminal event and the problem of interest then becomes modelling the relationship between the time to dropout and the internal covariate. Dupuy and Mesbah (2002) (DM) proposed a model that described this relationship when the value of the covariate at the dropout time is unobserved. This model combined a first-order Markov model for the longitudinally measured covariate with a time-dependent Cox model for the dropout process. Parameters were estimated using the EM algorithm and shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. In this paper, we propose a test statistic to test the validity of Dupuy and Mesbah's model. Using the techniques developed by Lin (1991), we develop a class of estimators of the regression parameters using weight functions. The test statistic is a function of the standard maximum likelihood estimators and the estimators based on the weight function. Its asymptotic distribution and some related results are presented.

Using this timeframe reconstruction, an appropriate trade-off between time resolution and noise has to be found. To overcome these drawbacks smoothing techniques and advanced dynamic reconstruction algorithms are more and more applied. Especially for the last, list-mode reconstruction is the predestinated approach, as the data are acquired in the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution. In this contribution we study dynamic reconstruction algorithms that base on the ML-EM algorithm for the small animal PET scanner ClearPET (TM) Neuro. In a simulated example we generate list-mode data and compute time activity curves from the reconstructed images. We compare dynamic reconstruction methods, like timeframe reconstruction-with and without temporal smoothing-and reconstruction with B-splines as temporal basis functions.

The q-EM algorithm is a one-parameter generalization of the standard EM algorithm that has been successfully used in many applications. With q-EM algorithm, we investigate iterative schemes for joint channel estimation and signal detection over frequency selective channels. We show that the convergence speed is improved by replacing the standard expectation with q-expectation, which was first introduced in the Tsallis entropy literature. Simulation results with different q values are given. A variable-q strategy is proposed to further improve the system performance.

In this paper we propose a semi-parametric model-based clustering algorithm in which the underlying model is a mixture of Gaussian. Each gene expression data builds a Gaussian kernel, and the uncertainty of microarray data is naturally integrated in the data representation. Our algorithm provides a principled method to automatically determine parameters - number of components in the mixture, mean, covariance, and weight of each Gaussian - by mean-shift procedure [2] and curvature fitting. After the initialization, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed for clustering to achieve Maximum Likelihood (ML). The performance of our algorithm is compared with standard EM algorithm using real data as well as synthetic data.

The target application is QoS signaling in a mobile ad hoe network (MANET) environment where the channel bandwidth is variable and the mobile device handles bandwidth requests arriving from multi-hop flows. An admission controller maintains a reserved rate to limit the aggregate traffic rate and to make admission decisions. We analyze the behavior of a rate adjustment scheme based on a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) model, which captures the flow-level and burst-level characteristics of variable bit rate traffic. We propose a scheme for adjusting the reserved rate using traffic measurements and an MMPP parameter estimation applied to a reduced MMPP model. Finally, we develop a scheme to estimate parameters for a heuristic rate adjustment scheme that can be executed in real-time. We present numerical results that illustrate the modeling approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bandwidth allocation schemes.

Within this framework, problems with missing pixels or pixel components, and hence unobservable wavelet coefficients, are handled simultaneously with denoising. The hyperparameters of the model are estimated via the marginal likelihood by the EM algorithm, and a part of the output of its E-step automatically provide optimal estimates, given the specified Bayesian model, of the noise-free image. This unified empirical-Bayes based framework, therefore, offers a statistically principled and extremely flexible approach to a wide range of pixel estimation problems including image denoising, image interpolation, demosaicing, or any combinations of them.

Images with the diffraction-limited resolution of a 22.8 m single-dish telescope can be reconstructed if raw images are taken at several different hour angles. Computer-generated and laboratory LBT interferograms were simulated that are similar to the data which can be obtained with the LINC-NIRVANA beam combiner instrument. From the simulated interferograms, diffraction-limited images were reconstructed with the regularized Building Block method, which is an extension of the Building Block method.(2) We compare the Building Block reconstructions to images obtained with the Richardson-Lucy (RL) method(3,4) and the Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) method.(5,6) Our image reconstruction studies were performed with computer-simulated J-band and laboratory H-band raw data of a galaxy with simulated total magnitudes of J = 16 to 18 and H = 16 to 19, respectively. One of the faintest structures in the images has a brightness of J similar to 25. The simulated reference stars within the isoplanatic patch have magnitudes of J = 20 - 21 and H = 19. All three methods are able to reconstruct diffraction-limited images of similar quality.

There have been several studies in image reconstruction for two-dimensional planar objects using the coded aperture imaging technology. However, coded aperture imaging for three-dimensional (3D) objects has not been extensively investigated. In this paper, a 3D reconstruction method for near-field coded aperture imaging is presented. We first introduce an "out-of-focus" correction factor into the generic expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for 3D near-field coded aperture images with the assumption that the photon emissions of coded aperture projections follow the Poisson statistics. The ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) method is adapted for a full 3D coded aperture image reconstruction. A 3D capillary tube phantom filled with Tc-99m radioactive solution was used to evaluate the performance of our methods. A dual-head SPECT camera, one head quipped with a coded aperture module and the other with a parallel-hole collimator, was utilized for image acquisitions. Images were reconstructed using the modified EM and OSEM methods associated with the depth-dependent out-of-focus correction. The preliminary phantom results show that our methods may have the potential of reconstructing 3D near-field coded aperture images and also providing superior image resolution as compared to conventional parallel-hole collimated images.

This formidable amount of data poses a real problem in the image reconstruction and its applications. It also has been the major bottleneck in further developments of the higher resolution PET scanners. To remedy this problem in the image reconstruction, we developed a new algorithm based on the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) technique incorporated with the symmetry properties of the projection and backprojection processes, especially in the 3D OSEM algorithm. We refer to this technique as the SSP (Symmetry and SIMD based Projection-backprojection) algorithm. As a demonstration, the algorithm was applied to the OSEM (Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization) 3D algorithm with HRRT data and it effectively reduced the total image reconstruction time to 80 folds.

For each local region an individual model is trained to approximate or classify data efficiently. The idea is to use locality in the input space as an useful constraint to realize diversity in an ensemble. The method automatically determines the size of the ensemble, realises an outlier detection mechanism and shows superiority over comparable methods in a benchmark test. Also, the method was extended to a hierarchical framework allowing a user to solve complex learning tasks by combining different sub-solutions and information sources.

The method introduces the relationships of observed image intensities and distance between pixels to the traditional neighborhood potential function, so that to describe the probability of pixels being classified into one class. We transform the segmentation process to maximum a posteriori (MAP) by Beyes theorem. Finally, the iterative conditional model (ICM) is used to solve the MAP problem. In the experiments, this method is compared with traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) and MRF image segmentation techniques using synthetic and real images. The experiment results and SNR-CCR histogram show that the algorithm proposed is more effective for noisy image segmentation.

However when applied to large data sets with a large proportion of missing data, the EM algorithm may converge slowly.. The triple jump extrapolation method can effectively accelerate the EM algorithm by substantially reducing the number of iterations required for EM to converge. There are two options for the triple jump method, global extrapolation (TJEM) and componentwise extrapolation (CTJEM). We tiled these two methods for a variety of probabilistic models and found that in general, global extraplolation yields a better performance, but there are cases where componentwise extrapolation yields very high speedup. In this paper we investigate when componentwise extrapolation should be preferred. We conclude that, when the Jacobian of the EM mapping is diagonal or block diagonal, CTJEM should be preferred. We show how to determine whether a Jacobian is diagonal or block diagonal and experimentally confirm our claim. In particular we show that CTJEM is especially effective for the semi-supervised Bayesian classifier model given a highly sparse data set.

This algorithm is based on a function approximation scheme from the perspective of optimization in function space rather than parameter space, i.e., stage-wise additive expansions of GMDs are used to search for optimal models instead of gradient descent optimization of model parameters. In the proposed approach, GMD starts from a single Gaussian and is built up by sequentially adding new components. Each new component is globally selected to produce optimal gain in the objective function. MLE and MMI are unified under the H-criterion, which is optimized by the extended BW (EBW) algorithm. A partial extended EM algorithm is developed for stage-wise optimization of new components. Experimental results on WSJ task demonstrate that the new algorithm leads to improved model quality and recognition performance.

The model can adapt to changes in object appearance over time. A mixture of three Gaussian distributions models the value of each pixel. An online Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to update the parameters of the Gaussians. The observation model in the particle filter is designed based on the adaptive appearance model. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can track objects well under illumination change, large pose variation, and partial or full occlusion.

When variables of concern are continuous types, the problem is classical in classical regression problems. Most of the data mining techniques including decision trees are designed to handle discrete type variables only. With complex data, most of the data mining techniques first transform continuous variables into discrete variables before applying the techniques. Hence the result depends on the discretiztion method applied. This paper proposes an algorithm to select a best subset using the original data set. The algorithm is based on mutual information (MI) introduced by Shannon [Shan48]. It computes MI's of up to two-dimensional variables: both continuous, both discrete, or one continuous and one discrete. It has and automatic stopping criterion when appropriate subset is selected.

This method takes into account the non-Gaussian statistical distribution of the modulated desired signal in order to produce a DC estimate that is more accurate than the conventional sample average of the received signal. Specifically, two iterative algorithms are derived based on the generalized expectation-maximization algorithms for jointly estimating the DC offset, the noise variance, and the parameters that characterize the signal distribution. As an application, we consider the special case where the modulated signal has a constant-envelope characteristic. Using the GSM/EDGE air interface, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant reduction in the DC-offset estimation error, which translates into performance gains in receiver sensitivity when used in direct-conversion receivers.

The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed to solve this problem, which begins a search from the primitive initial point. Then the multi-thread EM (m-EM) algorithm was proposed, which begins the multiple-token EM search from the primitive initial point, resulting in excellent solutions in compensation for a rather heavy computing cost. These previous work indicate the potential of using the primitive initial point as the starting point of the EM algorithm. The paper investigates experimentally the characteristics of a landscape of a likelihood surface around the primitive initial point for a multivariate Gaussian mixture, and based on the observation proposes sensible ways of running the EM algorithm.

Feasibility study of multipinhole collimators for high resolution small animal imaging	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			PINHOLE SPECT; RECONSTRUCTION	Multipinhole SPECT has the potential to overcome the inherent low efficiency of single pinhole gamma cameras typically used in small animal radionuclide imaging. By increasing the detector efficiency, multipinhole SPECT cameras allows to use reduced radionuclide dose and shorter scanning times than single pinhole gamma cameras. Reduced scanning times are advantageous for longitudinal studies where small animal models must be imaged several times. In addition, a spatial resolution of 1 mm or better is often required in drug delivery research and myocardial perfusion studies. In this article, we evaluate multipinhole collimator designs to obtain the best pinhole configuration that will increase the detector efficiency and maximize the use of a recently developed CZT with 128x128 pixels. Additionally the multipinhole design minimize the overlap of the projection data to avoid artifacts in the tomographic reconstructions. For this purpose, we simulated the acquisition of projection data from point sources, microspheres phantoms, and resolution phantoms, by using a in house developed Monte Carlo program which accounts for the gamma photons interactions with the pinhole and detector crystal. The generated projection data was reconstructed using a standard ML-EM algorithm adapted for multipinhole radionuclide imaging. We determined the multipinhole collimator efficiency, resolution, and signal to noise ratio for several possible multipinhole configurations. A design of five pinhole arrays allowed high efficiency imaging (3.93 fold) while achieving a spatial resolution of 1mm or better. Reconstruction of hot rod phantom data showed that a contrast of 90% between the hot rods and cold background was obtained after 45 iterations of the ML-EM algorithm.

EM-MMSE based channel estimation for OFDM systems	2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology, Vols 1-6			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology	DEC 15-17, 2006	Bombay, INDIA	IEEE				Accurate estimation of time-varying wireless channels is a difficult task in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Pilot based techniques have normally been employed for channel estimation. However, for time varying channels, pilot symbols need to be transmitted periodically to overcome the effect of time selective fading. Expectation-Maximization (EM) based technique may be used in such situations avoiding the need for periodic retransmission of pilot symbols. In order to reduce the complexity of EM algorithm, we propose an EM-MMSE based iterative procedure to estimate the time-varying channel. The proposed algorithm is not only computationally simpler than EM method but also yields performance improvement over conventional pilot based methods.

Lip deformation is modeled by a statistically deformable model based on Active Shape Model(ASM). In ASM based methods, it is assumed that a training set forms a cluster in shape parameter space. However if there are some clusters in shape parameter space due to an incorrect position of landmark point, ASM may not be able to locate new examples accurately. In this paper, Gaussian mixture is used to characterize the distribution of shape parameter. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to determine the maximum likelihood parameters of Gaussian mixture. During search, we resolved the updated locations by projecting a shape into the shape parameter space by using Gaussian mixture. The experiment was performed on many images, and showed very encouraging result.

The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the MIMO channels via the EM algorithm requires the computation of the posterior mean and covariance of transmit symbol vectors which involve an exhaustive search of all possible symbol combinations and are computationally prohibitive for large systems. However, most of the symbol combinations contribute very little to the estimation. Therefore, we suggest that sequential Gaussian approximation (SGA) algorithm can be used to identify the M most significant symbol combinations and we can approximate the mean and covariance based on those symbol combinations. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

BLT is an ill-posed inverse source problem subject to Cauchy data of the diffusion model. Several algorithms were developed to regularize this problem. Although those algorithms produce encouraging results, they theoretically require the completely measured data on the external surface. In practice, the observed data is often incomplete due to physical limitations. The BLT problem in this situation is similar to limited angle X-ray CT although the imaging model is more complicated with BLT. In this work, we formulate a mathematical model for BLT from partial data and generalize our previous results on the solution uniqueness to the partial data case. Also, we extend our previous methods to handle incomplete data. The first method is a variant of the well-known EM algorithm. The second one is based on the Landweber scheme. Both methods allow incorporation of knowledge-based constraints. Numerical and physical phantoms are used to evaluate and validate the proposed algorithms.

However, the circular-orbit cone-beam projection data do not satisfy Tuy's data-sufficiency condition, and are not sufficient for artifact-free image reconstruction. Many researchers, such as H. Yang, H. Bruder, B. Nett and so on, have investigated some possible approaches to reduce the artifacts due to data insufficiency. Data extrapolation methods may help in "completing" the unmeasured projection. In the paper, we consider two data extrapolation methods, one in the Radon space (i.e., the projection space), and the other one in the frequency space (i.e., the Fourier transform of the Radon space). These two methods are implemented using computer simulations. Neither of these methods is as good as the image reconstructed with an iterative ML-EM algorithm. We believe that in order to further reduce the data insufficiency artifacts, an iterative POCS (projection onto convex sets) method should be used.

In the paper the expectation-maximization (EM algorithm according to maximum likelihood (ML) criterion is applied to the problem ofjoint channel estimation and data detection of space-time block coded system over time-selective fading channels. In order to ensure fast converge. of the algorithm, the initial of parameters is carefully chosen by combining the pilot symbols matrix assisted estimation and linear interpolation. At the basis of initialization, a series of iterations of the EM algorithm, in which consists of an estimation phase followed by detection/decoding phase, are utilized to realize the joint estimation and detection/decoding scheme. In decoding phase, linear decoding method is used due to the orthogonality of the space-time block code, thus its computation complexity is greatly reduced Simulation results show that the scheme works with novel performance.

In this paper, we present the EM algorithm to learn the parameters in causal independence models based on the symmetric Boolean function. The developed algorithm enables us to assess the practical usefulness of the symmetric causal independence models, which has not been done previously. We evaluate the classification performance of the symmetric causal independence models learned with the presented EM algorithm. The results show the competitive performance of these models in comparison to noisy OR and noisy AND models as well as other state-of-the-art classifiers.

Extreme Value Theory based Decision Directed OFDM Channel Tracking	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-12	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2006)	JUN 11-15, 2006	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE			REGRESSION; ESTIMATORS; SYSTEMS	Decision directed channel tracking (DDCT) at high fade rates in OFDM based systems is addressed in this paper. Channel estimation in DDCT can be formulated as a linear errors-in-variables regression problem. While most of the errors in the regression matrix (equalization errors) are Gaussian in nature, few of the detected symbols can have high error due to the frequency and time selective fading. These poor symbol decisions behave like outliers in the regression matrix and give rise to contaminated Gaussian noise distributions. Classical estimators like total least squares (TLS) and the expectation-maximization (EM) based estimators exhibit poor performance in the presence of such outliers. We propose the Huber's M (HM) estimator and an extreme value theory (EVT) based M estimator for the DDCT problem. The proposed HM and EVT-HM estimators are robust to outliers and have an efficiency greater than 95% in purely Gaussian noise. The error rate performance of the proposed HM and EVT-HM estimators are compared with that of the TLS estimator, and the EM based estimator proposed in [4].

Leverage Weighted Decision Directed Channel Tracking for OFDM Systems	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-12	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2006)	JUN 11-15, 2006	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE			HAT MATRIX; REGRESSION	Decision directed channel tracking (DDCT) in OFDM systems can suffer from error propagation at high fade rates, due to the combined effect of rapid variation of the channel, long frame length and frequency selectivity of the channel. Conventional estimators like the 2D-minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator and the expectation maximization (EM) based Kalman channel estimator [3] show poor performance when they are applied to DDCT over large frame lengths, due to the error propagation induced by wrong symbol decisions. The poor symbols decisions usually act like leverage points in the regression matrix, and can be identified using the hat matrix as a leverage diagnostic. We use extreme value theory (EVT) on the hat matrix to define a channel estimator, which, in addition to exploiting time and frequency correlation of the channel, downweighs leverage points before utilizing them in the estimator structure. The proposed EVT-leverage weighted (LW) estimator reduces error propagation in the frame since it downweighs possible wrong decisions before using them in the channel estimator structure. The proposed EVT-LW estimator has a significantly better error rate performance when compared to both the 2D-MMSE estimator [2] and the EM based Kalman estimator [3].

A single time activity curve (TAC) is extracted for each segmented region. This TAC is then used to estimate the kinetic parameters of the segmented region. Current methods perform this task in two independent steps; first dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images are reconstructed from the projection data using conventional tornographic reconstruction methods, then the time activity curves (TAC) of the pixels are clustered into a predetermined number of clusters. In this paper, we propose to cluster the regions of dynamic PET images directly on the projection data and simultaneously estimate the TAC of each cluster. This method does not require an intermediate step of tomographic reconstruction for each time frame. Therefore the dimensionality of the estimation problem is reduced. We compare the proposed method with weighted least squares (WLS) and expectation maximization with Gaussian mixtures methods (GMM-EM). Filtered backprojection is used to reconstruct the emission images required by these methods. Our simulation results show that the proposed method can substantially decrease the number of mislabeled pixels and reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the cluster TACs.

The heterogeneous sensors are such as cameras, RFID readers and range finders. They are different from each other in degree of accuracy of localizing and identifying objects. Errors in identifying objects is a problem which makes localization difficult. We formulate a localization and identification problem with a hidden variable R which describes associations between objects and observed values. We estimate objects' positions and the asssociation vector R by an EM algorithm. We illustrate the algorithm in a case of using simulated cameras and RFID readers. Experimental results show that our method can localize and identify objects more accurately than other methods without the R.

The targeted system is the low-density-parity-check (LDPC) coded multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. The proposed estimator, which can be theoretically derived from the message-passing algorithm, can track a fast fading channel, and allows the parallel implementation of the whole receiver. A simplified version of P-RLS (SP-RLS) that can reduce the computational complexity is also proposed. Compared to the RLS with smoothing and removing (SR-RLS) [9], P-RLS can reduce the computational time by parallelization, and SP-RLS can further reduce the computational time and complexity. Computer simulations show that SP-RLS achieves almost the same packet error rate (PER) performance as that of P-RLS. It also achieves almost the same PER performance as that of SR-RLS with double iterations. Even in this case, the computational time and complexity of SP-RLS are smaller than those of SR-RLS.

We simplify the problem by employing a statistical sampling technique to obtain an approximate solution. With the proposed method, an unbounded large data set can be sampled in a number of random configurations, and that data can be used to describe the data set as a whole. The efficiency of the method depends largely on the ability to draw samples effectively which in turn depends on how close we can estimate the target density. We use finite mixture models to represent the probability density functions of the data stream. Then, we apply the EM algorithm twice to learn the model parameters.

Optimal adaptive solution to powersplit problem in vehicles with Integrated Starter/Generator	2006 IEEE VEHICLE POWER AND PROPULSION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)	SEP 06-08, 2006	Windsor, ENGLAND			energy management; hybrid electric vehicle; Integrated Starter/Generator; fuel economy		The implementation of an Integrated Starter/Generator into vehicles with a conventional drive train is an effective way to create a Hybrid Electric Vehicle. These vehicle configurations offer a high potential in fuel reduction, but they require a suitable Energy Management (EM) strategy. This paper shows that typical vehicle characteristics determine the general behavior of the EM algorithm. Furthermore, it will be shown that an optimal strategy exists without predicting the future vehicle speed. This strategy is directly suitable for on-line vehicle implementation. Simulation results illustrate the correctness of the strategy and provide insight into the expected fuel profits.	[Kessels, J. T. B. A.; van den Bosch, P. P.

The system uses spatial diversity at the receiver, by employing a number of uncorrelated (independent) antennas. The normalized Doppler frequencies are in the order of 0.02 to 0.04, i.e. fast changing channel conditions. The system uses a single pilot slot every 10-15 slots, for initial channel estimation (acquisition) per user, so only minimal overhead is required We show that this configuration achieves very high gains first by virtue of the EM detector that simultaneously detects user data and tracks the channel changes, and second by employing the APP decoder, while at the same time it converges very closely to the ideal, perfect channel side information receiver	Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, ECE Dept, Pomona, CA 91768 USA	Ketseoglou, T (reprint author), Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, ECE Dept, 3801 Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.

A total of 400 conference papers were collected and categorized into 4 major topics (Intelligent Tutoring System, Cognition, e-Learning, and Teacher Education). In this study, we have implemented a 80-20 split of collected papers. 80% of the papers were meant for keywords extraction and BN parameter learning whereas the other 20% were aimed for predictive accuracy performance. A feature selection algorithm was applied to automatically extract keywords for each topic. The extracted keywords were then used for constructing BN. The prior probabilities were subsequently learned using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The network has gone through a series of validation by human experts and experimental evaluation to analyze its predictive accuracy. The result has demonstrated that the proposed BN has outperformed Naive Bayesian Classifier, and BN learned from the training data.

We introduce a new family of mean value functions which can be either NHPP-I of NHPP-Pi according to the choice of the distribution function. The proposed mean value function is motivates by the fact that a strictly monotone increasing function can be modeled by a distribution function and that an unknown distribution function can be also approximated by a mixture of beta distributions. Many existing mean value functions can be regards as special cases of the proposed mean value functions. The maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the parameters contained in the proposed model.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is one of the approaches which has been applied, even though Principal Components (PCs) have no clear physical meanings. In this paper, we present a PCA based feature selection within a wrapper framework called PFSBEM (hybrid PCA based Feature Selection and Boost-Expectation-Maximization clustering). PFSBEM uses a two-step approach to select features. The first step retrieves feature subsets with original physical meaning based on their capacities to reproduce sample projections on PCs. The second step then searches for the best feature subsets that maximize clustering performance. Experiment results clearly show that our feature sets improve the class prediction with respect to the chosen performance criteria.

This type of model is, therefore, ideal for describing genetic networks. The genetic network inference problem based on a set of differential equations is generally defined as a parameter estimation problem. On the basis of this problem definition, several computational methods have been proposed so far. On the other hand, the genetic network inference problem based on a set of differential equations can be also defined as a function approximation problem. For solving the defined function approximation problem, any type of function approximator is available. In this study, on the basis of the latter problem definition, we propose a new method for the inference of genetic networks using a normalized Gaussian network model. As the EM algorithm is available for the learning of the NGnet model, the computational time of the proposed method is much shorter than those of other inference methods. The effectiveness of the proposed inference method is verified through numerical experiments of several artificial genetic network inference problems.

Localization algorithms that use acoustic signal energy measurements at individual sensor nodes are proposed. The maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm is known as an algorithm for source localization. The ML algorithm has high accuracy to estimate source location, however the calculation amount of the ML algorithm is large. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to realize the ML algorithm with less amount of calculation. An EM algorithm processed at a center, that is, the centralized EM algorithm is proposed in which each sensor node sends observed information to the center. The total cost of the centralized data processing is expensive, because the communication cost is large when the transmission distance from each sensor node to the center is long. On the other hand, the distributed data processing can reduce the transmission cost and thus the total cost, because data is processed in each sensor node and thus the amount of communication can be reduced. In this paper, we propose a distributed EM algorithm for acoustic source localization that is applicable to a source with unknown signal energy. We show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy and reduces the communication cost.

In particular, we focus on data clustering with a treestructured model for each cluster. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to draw a sample of clusterings, while the likelihood of a clustering is computed by exact averaging over the model class, including the dependency structure on the variables. Experiments on synthetic data show that this method usually outperforms the expectation-maximization algorithm by Meila and Jordan [1] when the number of observations is small (hundreds) and the number of variables is large (dozens). We apply the method to study how much single nucleotide polymorphisms carry information about the structure of human populations.

The approach uses a prior weight to emphasize on the importance of class, which acts as a parameter of the likelihood function for both labeled and unlabeled data. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to compute maximum likelihood point estimate. Experimental results demonstrate appropriate classification accuracy on both synthetic and benchmark data sets.

Noise robust Aurora-2 speech recognition employing a codebook-constrained Kalman filter preprocessor	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc			ENHANCEMENT	In this paper, a speech signal estimation framework involving Kalman filters for use as a front-end to the Aurora-2 speech recognition task is presented. Kalman-filter based speech estimation algorithms assume autoregressive (AR) models for the speech and the noise signals. In this paper, the parameters of the AR models are estimated using a expectation-maximization approach. The key to the success of the proposed algorithm is the constraint on the AR model parameters corresponding to the speech signal to belong to a codebook trained on AR parameters obtained from clean speech signals. Aurora-2 noise-robust speech recognition experiments are performed to demonstrate the success of the codebook-constrained Kalman filter in improving speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments. Results with both clean and multi-conditional training are provided to show the improvements in the recognition accuracy compared to the base-line system where no pre-processing is employed.

The twin problems of visual feature extraction and representation are explicitly addressed. Simple paradigms for supervised and unsupervised feature extraction are presented to represent the extremes in visual perception system design. Visual feature representation is addressed through a combination of Isomap, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, and Expectation Maximization (EM), a statistical learning scheme. A joint probability distribution of this representation is computed offline based on existing training data. Example applications based on real visual data from heterogenous, unstructured environments demonstrate the versatility of the generative models.

Part I: Design patterns extraction by adaptive and efficient color image segmentation method	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE			English	Article						image indexing method-based regions; textile design patterns extraction; unsupervised color image segmentation	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CLASSIFICATION	To realize a system for textile design patterns retrieval, we adopt an Image Indexing Method- Based Region. This indexing method is achieved by regions segmentation process followed by regions indexing one. Note that the later indexing process strongly T depends on the quality of produced segmentation, and will have a negative impact on retrieval results. Therefore, an efficient segmentation method must be developed. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and efficient unsupervised color image segmentation method. The proposed method is based on Gaussian Mixture Model, and cluster validity index. The model parameters are estimated using EM algorithm, and the optimal cluster number is detected by Cluster Validity Index. Using this method, the design patterns are well extracted. In the second part of this work, the outcome of this segmentation results will be supplied to the input of the indexing process to complete our retrieval system.

The number and the initial position of the patches are unknown, hence their estimation is a challenging problem. It is solved by adding iterated steps of split and merge to a modified Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This allows for precise adjustment of the number of patches, independent from the initial model. The proposed approach overcomes the problem of classical EM, which produces an optimal solution only if the number and position of model components is well estimated.

The proposed approach provides a precise estimation of the number of model components (line segments) and their initial parameters independent of their initial values. We use principles of perceptual grouping to evaluate the approximation quality obtained in each Expectation Maximization (EM) step. By evaluating EM approximation quality we are able to recognize a locally optimal solution, and modify the number of model components and their parameters.

Neither the order of data points nor the number of needed line segments (surface patches) are known. In particular, point sets can be obtained by laser range scanner mounted on a moving robot or given as edge pixels/voxels in digital images. Polygonal approximation of edge pixels can also be interpreted as grouping of edge pixels to parts of object contours. The presented approach is described in the statistical framework of Expectation Maximization (EM) and in cognitively motivated geometric framework. We use local support estimation motivated by human visual perception to evaluate support in data points of EM components after, each EM step. Consequently, we are able to recognize a locally optimal solution that is not globally optimal, and modify the number of model components and their parameters. We will show experimentally that the proposed approach has much stronger global convergence properties than the EM approach. In particular, the proposed approach is able to converge to a globally optimal solution independent of the initial number of model components and their initial parameters.

Maximum likelihood and the graphical EM algorithm	2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vols 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	19th Annual Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		bio-informatics; maximum likelihood; stochastic context free grammars; inside-outside; Viterbi score; graphical EM	CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMARS	A challenge in the design of SCFGs for some applications is the computation of the probability distributions associated with its production rules. The most popular methods for this task are by far the Inside-Outside (10) algorithm, which maximizes the likelihood of a data set, and the Viterbi Score (VS) algorithm, which maximizes the likelihood of its best parse trees. Even though both algorithms are very demanding and have a similar time complexity, VS is known to require an overall lower computational cost in practice. Several methods have been developed to accelerate the computation of production rules probabilities with IO. Among them is the graphical EM (gEM) algorithm. During pre-processing, it computes the rules used in the production of the data set, and organizes them into an ordered data structure called "support graphs." The iterative process uses these graphs to optimize the likelihood of the data set in a similar way to the IO algorithm. In this paper, a VS variant of gEM, that selects in the support graphs the elements belonging to the best parse trees of the data set, is proposed. The performance of the original algorithm, gEM(IO), and the new one, gEM(VS), are compared in terms of time and space complexity, convergence time, and perplexity. An experimental protocol is defined such that the impact on performance of factors like training set size, sequence length, and ambiguity of grammars can be assessed. Computer simulations are performed on the real-world European Molecular Biology Laboratory data set, consisting of DNA sequences. Results indicate that gEM(VS) provides significantly lower convergence time and time complexity, at the expense of a moderately higher perplexity and space complexity level.

It was found that the conventional least-squares (LS) channel estimators and multiuser detectors will be significantly degraded when some sub-carrier are contaminated by narrowband interfering signals. A new weighted least M-estimate (WLM) multiuser detector, which is based on the M-estimation and weighted least square (WLS) concept, is proposed to jointly suppress the multiple access interference (MAI) and time-varying NBI. To reliably estimate the channel in NBI, a weighted recursive least M-estimate (WRLM) channel estimator is also employed to estimate the time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. Simulation results show that the proposed WLM multiuser detector significantly outperforms over the conventional linear decorrelator under NBI.

In previous work we have developed a solution for this problem based on a maximum likelihood estimator that is computed by an expectation maximization algorithm. In the expectation maximization algorithm the expensive step is the expectation which requires numerical evaluation of 3- or 5-dimensional integrations of a square matrix of dimension equal to the number of Fourier series coefficients used to describe the 3-D reconstruction. By taking advantage of the rotational properties of spherical harmonics, we can reduce the integrations of a matrix to integrations of a scalar. The key property is that a rotated spherical harmonic can be expressed as a linear combination of the other harmonics of the same order and the weights in the linear combination factor so that each of the three factors is a function of only one of the Euler angles describing the orientation of the projection.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of factor analyzed HMMs (FAHMMs) is usually done via the EM algorithm, meaning that initial estimates of the model parameters is a key issue. In this paper we report on experiments showing some evidence that the use of a discriminative criterion to initialize the FAHMM maximum likelihood parameter estimation can be effective. The proposed approach relies on the estimation of a discriminant linear transformation to provide initial values for the factor loading matrices, as well as appropriate initializations for the other model parameters. Speech recognition experiments were carried out on the Wall Street Journal LVCSR task with a 65k vocabulary.

Lip assistant can automatically convert acoustic speech to lip parameters with a bit rate of 2.2kbps, and decode them to video-realistic mouth animation on the fly. We use multi-stream HMMs (MSHMMs) and the principal component analysis (PCA) to model the audio-visual speech and the visual articulations, which are learned from AV facial recordings. Speech is converted to lip parameters with natural dynamics by an expectation maximization (EM)-based audio-to-lip converter. The video synthesizer generates video-realistic mouth animations from the encoded lip parameters via PCA expansion. Finally, mouth animation is superimposed on the original video as an assistant for hearing impaired viewers to make a better understanding on the audio-visual contents. Experimental results shows that lip assistant can significantly improve the speech intelligibility of both machines and humans.

Under Bayesian framework, RVM is used to learn the log-likelihood ratio of the statistics of the interested object region to those of the nearby backgrounds. Then, the online selected sparse vectors by RVM are integrated to construct an adaptive representation of the tracked object. Meanwhile, the trained RVM classifier is embedded into particle filtering for tracking. To avoid distraction by the particles in background region, the extreme outlier model is incorporated to describe the posterior probability distribution of all particles. Subsequently, mean-shift clustering and EM algorithm are combined to estimate the posterior state of the tracked object. Experimental results over real-world sequences have shown that the proposed method can efficiently and effectively handle drastic illumination variation, partial occlusion and rapid changes in viewpoint, pose and scale.

Motifs are generally represented by matrices (PWM or PSSM) or strings. However, these representations cannot model biological binding sites well because they fail to capture nucleotide interdependence. It has been pointed out by many researchers that the nucleotides of the DNA binding site cannot be treated independently, e.g. the binding of zinc finger in proteins. hi this paper, a new representation called Scored Position Specific Pattern (SPSP), which is a generalization of the matrix and string representations, is introduced which takes into consideration the dependent occurrences of neighboring nucleotides. Even though the problem of finding the optimal motif in SPSP representation is proved to be NP-hard, we introduce a heuristic algorithm called SPSP-Finder, which can effectively find optimal motifs in most simulated cases and some real cases for which existing popular motif-finding software, such as MEME and AlignACE, fail.

Non-Gaussian AR estimators are usually highly non-linear and computationally prohibitive. This paper presents an efficient algorithm that jointly estimates the AR parameters and the excitation statistics and dynamics of voiced speech signals. A model called the Hidden Markov-Autoregressive model (HMARM) is designed for this purpose. The HMARM models the excitation to the AR model using a Hidden Markov Model with two Gaussian states that have, respectively, a small and a large mean but identical variances. This formulation enables a computationally efficient exact EM algorithm to learn all parameters jointly, instead of resorting to pure numerical optimization or relaxed EM algorithms. The algorithm converges in typically 3 to 5 iterations. Experimental results show that the estimated AR parameters have much lower bias and variance than the conventional Least Squares solution. We also show that the new estimator has a very good shift-invariance property that is useful in many applications.

The characteristic of the incoming traffic stream of UTRAN is studied based on the measured trace traffic from the simulations. The main idea of the aggregated traffic modelling is to employ Batch Markov Arrival Process (BMAP) model as an analytically tractable model, which considers different lengths of packets and batch arrivals. In this paper, the setup and customization of the BMAP model for characterizing the aggregated traffic in UTRAN is presented. The accuracy of the BMAP model is demonstrated by comparing with simulations and Poisson traffic model. At the end the potential application of the presented approach and its advantages is briefly discussed.

However, how to shift disparity estimation from encoder to decoder to support distributed coding applications poses a new challenge. In this paper, we present a symmetric distributed coding protocol in which interlaced representations of stereo pair are finely and coarsely quantized as primary and secondary channels respectively. At the decoder, side information is generated from the primary channel by an expectation maximization (EM)-like algorithm and a novel dual exploitation of the secondary channel is proposed to simultaneously resolve intensity uncertainty and refine disparity estimation. Preliminary experimental results for synthetic images are reported to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.

Wavelet coefficients of image are characterized by a two-state Gaussian mixture model (GMM), while their local spatial interactions are modeled by a Markov random field (MRF) model. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the GMM, and an iterative updating technique known as iterative conditional modes (ICM) is applied to optimize the binary labels containing the positions of those wavelet coefficients that represent the useful signal in each subband. For each wavelet coefficient a shrinkage factor is finally determined, depending on its initial shrinkage factor and on the local spatial neighborhood in the label. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the new scheme outperforms other wavelet denosing methods, such as yielding significantly superior image quality, increasing peak signal-to-noise ration (PSNR).

B	Li, ZH; Leung, H			IEEE	Li, Zhenhua; Leung, Henry			An expectation maximization based simultaneous registration and fusion algorithm for radar networks	2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vols 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	19th Annual Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		sensor registration; sensor fusion; expectation maximization; radar network	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD REGISTRATION; KALMAN FILTER; SENSORS	Multiple radars are often used to form a radar network in target tracking applications. Through fusing the complementary and redundant information obtained from multiple radars, we can improve the performance of target tracking. In multisensor target tracking, sensor registration is an essential process to eliminate the tracking errors caused by each sensor's systematic biases. In this paper, we present an expectation maximization (EM) based simultaneous registration and fusion algorithm for multiple radars network. This simultaneous registration and fusion approach has advantages over other track registration techniques such as augmented Kalman filtering approach. Systematic biases (including radar time bias, radar two angular biases, and radar range bias) are estimated using the EM algorithm. The EM algorithm can guarantee that the estimated systematic biases can converge to a stationary point of the maximum likelihood function. In order to track manoeuvering targets, three kinematic models are used to have a more complete description of the motion of a target: the constant velocity (CV), the constant acceleration (CA), and the coordinated turn (CT) models. The conditional expectations and covariances of the system states can be effectively computed by interactive multiple model (IMM) approach. The IMM method is a recursive hybrid filtering technique that provides a good balance between performance and complexity. We employ a fixed-interval smoother-based IMM approach to estimate the system states. The forward and backward Kalman filters are used to obtain a smooth estimate. The IMM approach is combined with the EM algorithm for simultaneous registration and fusion. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps: the first step is to adopt the fixed-interval smoother-based IMM method to calculate the conditional expectation of the log likelihood function using the current estimate of the systematic biases and the observations; the second step updates the parameter estimate by maximizing the log likelihood function. Two numerical examples are presented in this paper. A recursive posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) is used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. We first suppose the target is moving in a constant velocity and a single state space model (CV) is considered for the description of the target motion. By comparing with the UKF based approach, which combines the biases into the state vector and estimates the augmented state using unscented Kalman filter, the proposed EM based method leads to accurate estimates of the target position and velocity. Then, we use the proposed approach to track manoeuvering target and three kinematic models are used to describe the target motion: CV, CA, CT Although relatively large errors exist during the period of model switching, the overall estimation errors are gradually reduced by the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well in radar network target tracking.

In this paper, the traditional vector approximation is improved. Firstly, it decreases the dimensions by LLE (locally-linear-embedding). As a result of it, a set of absolute low dimensions are gotten. Then, this paper uses the Gaussian mixture distribution and estimates the distribution through EM (expectation-maximization) method. The original data vectors are replaced by vector approximation. This approach gains higher efficiency and less run time. The experiments show a remarkable reduction of I/O. They also show an improvement on the indexing performance and then speed the image retrieval.

In addition, tissue and instruments have similar gray levels in US images and the interface between instruments and tissue is poorly defined.. We present an algorithm that automatically estimates instrument location in intracardiac procedures. Expert-segmented images are used to initialize the statistical distributions of blood, tissue and instruments. Voxels are labeled of voxels through an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm using information from the neighboring voxels through a smoothing kernel. Once the three classes of voxels are separated, additional neighboring information is used to give spatial information based on the shape of instruments in order to correct for misclassifications. We analyze the major axis of segmented data through their principal components and refine the results by a watershed transform, which corrects the results at the contact between instrument and tissue. We present results on 3D in-vitro data from a tank trial, and 3D in-vivo data from a cardiac intervention on a porcine beating heart. The comparison of algorithm results to expert-annotated images shows the correct segmentation and position of the instrument shaft.

Compared with the pilot-aided maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation, the performance of the estimation can be improved effectively without increasing the number of pilot symbols with the SBE algorithm. Simulation results are presented to verify the rationality of the SBE in terms of the mean square error (MSE), while it also shows that the performance can reach the CRLB at moderately high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

Unlike traditional image segmentation algorithms that segment an image using feature similarity, our method is able to learn high-level object characteristics (aspects) from a large number of unlabeled images containing similar objects to facilitate image segmentation. Our method does not require human to annotate the training set and works without supervision. We use a graphical model to address the learning of aspects and layout extraction together. In particular, aspect-feature dependency from multiple images is learned via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We demonstrate that, by associating latent aspects to spatial structure, the proposed method achieves much better layout extraction results than using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis.

A common technique used for attenuation correction is based on patient-specific attenuation maps reconstructed from transmission data acquired with external sources. However, the transmission process increases measurement time, costs and radiation exposure, and generates misregistration errors due to patient motion. In this paper, we propose a framework for simultaneous reconstruction of activity distribution together with the attenuation map from emission data alone. The estimation process is accomplished by solving a nonlinear stationary state space model with a divided difference filter. A Zubal digital thorax phantom data is used to demonstrate the benefits of such a reconstruction.

Our goal is to achieve a middle-level understanding of image semantics to bridge the semantic gap existing in the-field. of image mining and retrieval. With the help of a popular search engine, semantically relevant images are collected, and concept-sensitive salient regions are extracted automatically based on an attention model. Then the semantic concept model is learned from the joint distribution of all salient regions with Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, by incorporating semantically irrelevant un-salient regions as negative samples, the discriminative power of the solution is further enhanced. Experiments demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed method.

However, the enrollment data for text-dependent system usually is very limited. Expectation Maximization(EM) training of HMM will suffer from noisy estimation because of limited enrollment. Adaptation is a popular solution in this scenario. The target model is formed by adapting the generic model based on limited speaker specific training data. Although the adaptation scheme can tolerate much less training data than direct EM method, the traditional method does not account the topology of HMM might be different for different speaker. The topology information further distinguish the target speaker from impostors. In this paper, we propose a unsupervised learning method to learn the topology of HMM for each speaker. The experimental results indicate that with learning the topology, the framework is more effective than traditional adaptation methods. In the pure acoustic matching experiments, the proposed method is the best system under extremely small amount enrollment data(1 training utterance) and moderate training data. That mainly due to explicitly including the label information in background modeling and discriminant capability of unsupervised learning of HMM topology.

But it is a more difficult thing that learning structures of Bayesian Networks from uncompleted data. A compound learning algorithm is proposed; it combines the EM algorithm, Monte Carlo sampling algorithm and evolution algorithm together, uses EM algorithm to learn parameters of networks in uncompleted data, then samples the best network, converts the uncompleted data to completed data, and then evolves the structure using evolution algorithm. This algorithm could get over the defect of EM algorithm that frequently gains local maximum. Because data processing is based on posterior networks structures, structures of Bayesian Networks is optimizing and optimizing with evolution computing, the reliability of complementary data is higher. Learning rate is high and performance of this algorithm is good.

Many clustering methods for multispectral images are based on a per-pixel classification, while uses only spectral information and ignores spatial information. In this work, a new clustering algorithm for multispectral images, based on both spectral and spatial information, is presented. This algorithm is integrated with generalized mixture Gaussian model (GMM) and Markov random field (MRF). The number of clusters is automatically identified by using the pseudolikelihood information criterion (PLIC). We examine the behavior of this model when applied to multispectral remote sensing images.

This paper proposes a method to build a Bayesian networks model in order to assess the learner's knowledge level and instruct the learner. This e-learning assessing and instructing system is designed and implemented based on multi-agent systems (ELAIS). In this system, the knowledge cognitive level, the learning priorities and weakness of a learner could be analyzed and assessed through the tracking information. Then the corresponding instruction will give to the learner in order to improve the learner's learning efficiency.

This paper presents an improved FMRF segmentation method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The originality of this algorithm based on the fact that there are many interlaced edges or mixed areas among different types of regions in SAR images, which are often caused by the limited resolutions of the acquisition systems or speckle noise of sensor. Fuzzy method is just a shortcut for this kind of uncertain classification, which could give more flexible and reasonable segmentation than the 'hard' method. Although many scholars had done much work in the two-level FMRF segmentation, we improved the algorithm from two-level to multi-level and gave more clear and reasonable threshold definitions for hard and fuzzy MRF. The first part of our work involves definitions of the multi-level FMRF and standards for hard and fuzzy MRF. Then we apply the simulated annealing (SA) and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to search global optimal resolutions and estimate unknown parameters. Finally the segmentation experiments of two SAR images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient to distinguish interlaced edges or mixed areas and successful to restrain noise.

The main goal of pattern discovery in DNA sequences is to identify sequences of important biological function hidden in the huge amounts of genomic sequences. Several methods and techniques have been proposed and implemented in this field. However, in order to reduce computational time and complexity, most of them either focus on finding short DNA patterns or require explicit specification of pattern lengths in advance. Scientists need to find longer patterns without specifying pattern lengths in advance and still have good performance. In this paper, we propose a pattern discovery algorithm called Pattern Discovery with Confidence (PDC). Based on biological studies, we propose a new measurement system that can identify over-represented patterns inside DNA sequences. Using this measurement, PDC algorithm can narrow the search space by checking dependency along the pattern, thus extending the pattern as long as possible without the need to restrict or specify the length of a pattern in advance. Experimental tests demonstrate that this approach can find long, interesting patterns within a reasonable computation time.

However, we have to first determine the number of experts, which is often hardly known. Derived from regularization theory, a regularized minimum cross-entropy(RMCE) algorithm is proposed to train ME model, which can automatically make model selection. When time series is modeled by ME, it is demonstrated by some climate prediction experiments that RMCE algorithm outperforms EM algorithm. We also compare RMCE algorithm with other regression methods such as back-propagation(BP) algorithm and normalized radial basis function(NRBF) network, and find that RMCE algorithm still shows promising results.

The basic idea is to decompose the observed sensor data, which is a superimposition of multiple sources, into individual components in the frequency domain and then estimate the corresponding location parameters associated with each component separately. Instead of the conventional alternating projection method, we propose to adopt the EM algorithm in this paper; our method involves two steps, namely Expectation (E-step) and Maximization (M-step). In the E-step, the individual incident source waveforms are estimated. Then, in the M-step, the maximum likelihood estimates of the source location parameters are obtained. These two steps are executed iteratively and alternatively until the pre-defined convergence is reached. The computational complexity comparison between our proposed EM algorithm and the existing alternating projection scheme is investigated. It is shown through Monte Carlo simulations that the computational complexity of the proposed EM algorithm is significantly lower than that of the conventional alternating projection algorithm.

In this paper we present a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for recovering the connectivity information (i.e. topological map) of a network using only detection events from deployed sensors. The technique is based on stochastically reconstructing samples of plausible agent trajectories allowing for the possibility of transitions to and from sources and sinks in the environment. We demonstrate robustness to sensor error and non-trivial patterns of agent motion. The result of the algorithm is a probabilistic model of the sensor network connectivity graph and the underlying traffic trends. We conclude with results from numerical simulations and an experiment conducted with a heterogeneous sensor network.

Photo events are characterized by the coherence of multimodality including time, content and camera settings. We incorporate these multimodal metadata into a unified probabilistic framework, in which event is taken as a latent semantic concept and discovered by fitting a generative model through an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This approach is general and unsupervised, without any training procedure or predefined threshold. The experimental evaluations on 14k photos taken by 10 amateur photographers have indicated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework in browsing and searching personal photo collections.

We dub this problem distributed ensemble classification, addressing e.g. when individual classifiers are trained on different (e.g. proprietary, legacy) databases or operate (perhaps remotely) on different sensing modalities. Typically, fixed, principled (untrained) rides of classifier combination such as voting methods are used in this case for aggregating decisions. Alternatively, we take a transductive approach, optimizing the combining rule for an objective function measured on the unlabeled batch of test data. We propose specific maximum likelihood (ML) objectives that are shown to yield well-known forms of aggregation, albeit with iterative, EM-based adjustment to account for possible mismatch between the class priors used by individual classifiers and those reflected in the new data batch. We also propose an information-theoretic method which outperforms the NIL methods and addresses some problem instances where the ML methods are not applicable. On benchmark data from the UC Irvine machine learning repository, all our methods give improvements in accuracy over the use of fixed rules when there is prior mismatch.

Since, PET image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem, new methodologies need to be developed. Although previous studies show that incorporation of spatial and median priors improves the image quality, the image artifacts such as over-smoothing and streaking are evident in the reconstructed image. In this work, we use a simple, yet powerful technique to tackle the PET image reconstruction problem. Proposed technique is based on the integration of Bayesian approach with that of finite impulse response (FIR) filter.

Image reconstruction by inhomogeneous diffusion for positron emission tomography	ICIEA 2006: 1ST IEEE CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-3, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA 2006)	MAY 24-26, 2006	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE Ind Elect Chapter, IEEE Ind Applicat/Power Elect Chapter, IEEE Singapore Sect, IEEE Ind Elect Soc			GIBBS-PRIORS; EM ALGORITHM	In positron emission tomography (PET), image reconstruction is a demanding problem. Since, PET image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem, new methodologies need to be developed. Although previous studies show that incorporation of spatial and median priors improves the image quality, the image artifacts such as over-smoothing and streaking are evident in the reconstructed image. In this work, we use a simple, yet powerful technique to tackle the PET image reconstruction problem. Proposed technique is based on the integration of Bayesian approach with that of finite impulse response (FIR) filter. A FIR filter is designed whose coefficients are determined based on the surface diffusion model. The resulting reconstructed image is iteratively filtered and fed back to obtain the new estimate. Experiments are performed on a simulated PET system. The results show that the proposed approach is better than recently proposed MRP algorithm in terms of image quality and normalized mean square error.

Unsupervised change-detection from multi-channel SAR data	2006 7th Nordic Signal Processing Symposium			English	Proceedings Paper	7th Nordic Signal Processing Symposium	JUN 07-09, 2006	Reykjavik, ICELAND				IMAGES; MODEL	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data presents a great potential for environmental monitoring applications and natural disaster management thanks to their insensitivity to atmospheric and Sun-illumination conditions. However the automatic generation of change maps from multichannel SAR images acquired on the same geographic area at different times is still an open issue in the remote-sensing literature. In the present paper an automatic unsupervised contextual change-detection method is proposed for two-date multichannel SAR images, by integrating a SAR-specific extension of the Fisher transform with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm or with some of its variants (the Landgrebe-Jackson EM and the Stochastic EM algorithms), applied according to a Markov random field model for the image data. The method is validated by experiments on SIR-C/XSAR data.

Two adaptive methods were implemented, namely the incremental version of the expectation-maximization (EM) and segmental k-means algorithms. The algorithms were implemented in an ECG segmentation system which classificatory is based on HMM. The performance criteria adopted are waveform detection, segmentation precision, and ischemia detection. For the tests, were used the QT and ST-T databases. The experiments have shown that the system adaptation for each individual improves the system reliability and increases the system performance. Furthermore, our results compare favorably with other works in the literature.	Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil	Muller, SMT (reprint author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil.

Two types of pdfs are introduced for the source signals, based on two essential speech signal features, harmonicity and sparseness, while the pdf for the room acoustics is defined based on an inverse filtering operation. The EM algorithm is used to solve this maximum likelihood problem efficiently. The resultant algorithm elaborates the initial source signal estimate given solely based on its source signal features by integrating them with the room acoustics feature through the EM iteration. The effectiveness of the present method is shown in terms of the energy decay curves of the dereverberated impulse responses.

Past studies of visual speech recognition can be broadly divided into two approaches, the image-based method and the model-based method. The image-based method is a method in which sonic preprocessing, such as subsampling and principal component analysis, is applied to the pixel values of the original image, and the result is used as the feature vector. In this approach, the position and size of the lips and the illumination conditions have a direct effect on the recognition rate. Thus, the normalization of these factors is the basic technique. The ordinary approach in the conventional normalization is to provide a criterion independently of the HMM, and to apply normalization before learning. In this paper, normalization by the ML (maximum likelihood.) criterion is considered. Normalized training is proposed in which the normalization processes for elements such as the position, size, inclination, mean brightness, and contrast of the lips are integrated with the training of the model. The proposed method is formulated on the basis of an EM (expectation maximization) algorithm in which monotonically increasing behavior of the likelihood of the training data is guaranteed, by iteration of normalized training. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a word recognition experiment using the M2VTS database. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

One of the major difficulties in designing a practical and effective restoration algorithm is to develop a model for the tissue reflectivity that can adequately capture significant image features without being computationally prohibitive. The reflectivities of biological tissues do not exhibit the piecewise smooth characteristics of natural images considered in the standard image processing literature; while the macroscopic variations in echogenicity are indeed piecewise smooth, the presence of sub-wavelength scatterers adds a pseudo-random component at the microscopic level. This observation leads us to propose modelling the tissue reflectivity as the product of a piecewise smooth echogenicity map and a unit-variance random field. The chief advantage of such an explicit representation is that it allows us to exploit representations for piecewise smooth functions (such as wavelet bases) in modelling variations in echogenicity without neglecting the microscopic pseudo-random detail. As an example of how this multiplicative model may be exploited, we propose an expectation-maximisation (EM) restoration algorithm that alternates between inverse filtering (to estimate the tissue reflectivity) and logarithmic wavelet denoising (to estimate the echogenicity map). We provide simulation and in vitro results to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm yields solutions that enjoy higher resolution, better contrast and greater fidelity to the tissue reflectivity compared with the current state-of-the-art in ultrasound image restoration.

The inference for GRNs provides important insights into the fundamental biological processes such as growth and is useful in disease diagnosis and genomic drug design. Due to the experimental design, multilevel data hierarchies are often present in time-course gene expression data. Most existing methods, however, ignore the dependency of the expression measurements over time and the correlation among gene expression profiles. Such independence assumptions violate regulatory interactions and can result in overlooking certain important subject effects and lead to spurious inference for regulatory networks or mechanisms. In this paper, a multilevel mixed-effects model is adopted to incorporate data hierarchies in the analysis of time-course data, where temporal and subject effects are both assumed to be random. The method starts with the clustering of genes by fitting the mixture model within the multilevel random-effects model framework using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The network of regulatory interactions is then determined by searching for regulatory control elements (activators and inhibitors) shared by the clusters of co-expressed genes, based on a time-lagged correlation coefficients measurement. The method is applied to two real time-course datasets from the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome. It is shown that the proposed method provides clusters of cell-cycle regulated genes that are supported by existing gene function annotations, and hence enables inference on regulatory interactions for the genetic network.

Our contributions are mainly two fold. First, we include a preprocessing called "local clustering" before the hierarchical clustering algorithm to merge very similar adjacent speech segments. This local clustering aims to reduce the number of segments to be clustered by the hierarchical clustering, so as to dramatically increase the processing speed. Second, we perform a postprocessing called "cross EM refinement" to purify the clusters generated by the hierarchical clustering. This algorithm is based on the idea of cross validation and EM algorithm. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed cross EM refinement approach reduces the speaker diarization error by up to 56%, with an average reduction of 22% compared to the traditional hierarchical clustering method.

In particular, we classify a sentence for an event into four time-slots; morning, daytime, evening, and night. To realize our goal, we focus on expressions associated with time-slot (time-associated words). However, listing up all the time-associated words is impractical, because there are numerous time-associated expressions. We therefore use a semi-supervised learning method, the Naive Bayes classifier backed up with the Expectation Maximization algorithm, in order to iteratively extract time-associated words while improving the classifier. We also propose to use Support Vector Machines to filter out noisy instances that indicates no specific time period. As a result of experiments, the proposed method achieved 0.864 of accuracy and outperformed other methods.

A channel tracking method based on a MAP version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and on a block representation of channel variations has been proposed. It performs better than already existing recursive algorithms but have a quadratic complexity. In this paper, we propose a simplified MAP algorithm which has a linear complexity and we examine its convergence properties.

However, quantitative accuracy in PET images is not guaranteed in the iterative method that needs a stopping rule for iteration. In this study, a new approach of stopping rule is proposed combined with an analytical method, which gives PET images with quantitative accuracy.

However, it is worth noting that the resulting software reliability models, called phase-type software reliability models, generalize the existing models but may involve a number of model parameters in the phase-type software reliability model, so that the usual maximum likelihood estimation based on the Newton's method or quasi-Newton's method does not often function well. In this paper, we develop EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithms for the phase-type software reliability models with two types of fault data: fault-detection time data and grouped data with arbitrary time intervals. In numerical examples, we compare the EM algorithms with the quasi-Newton's method and illustrate the effectiveness on our unified model and parameter estimation method.

Gathering software engineering data can be expensive. Such precious and costly data cannot afford to be missing. However missing data is a common problem and software engineering database is not an exception. Though there are many algorithms to solve problem of incomplete data, unfortunately few have been developed in the field of Software Engineering. Missing data causes significant problem. With inaccurate data or missing data, it is very difficult to know how much a project will cost or worth. Missing data leads to loss of information, causes biasness in data analysis and hence results to inaccurate decision-making for project management and implementation. In this paper, an imputation technique for imputing missing data based on global-local Modified Singular Value Decomposition (MSVD) algorithm, INI was proposed. This technique was used for estimating missing data in a software engineering database (PROMISE). Its performance was evaluated and compared with two existing imputation techniques, Expectation Maximization (EM) and Mean Imputation (MI). Varying percentages of missings, (1%, 10%, 15%, and 20% 25%) were introduced in the original dataset in order to have an incomplete dataset for imputation. Simulations were carried for comparative purposes. Imputation Error (IE) was use as an evaluation criterion. Study results showed that, the only method that consistently outperformed other methods (EM and MI), guarantee a higher accuracy of imputed data, prompt and less bias at all level of missings is the global-local MSVD, INI. It maintained consistency at all level of missings compared to EM and MI. It was found that EM is not suitable for data with missing proportion greater than 20%. While MI lost in all count to EM and INI.

The simultaneous existence of these two categories requires a careful statistical modelling and, accordingly, an appropriate processing treatment. We take over the traditional Gaussian model for rural areas and resume the model of Gaussian mixtures for urban areas which we've introduced In a previous study. Processing of satellite images involves two stages: the classification (segmentation) of the satellite Image and the regularization of the segmented image. We use a modified MAP method in order to perform segmentation of mixed, urban & rural images. Training the MAP segmentation is achieved by the EM algorithm. The obtained segmented images are improved using a modified MAP-Markov regularization. Our conclusions are supported by an extended experimental analysis.

Region-based Efficiency Correction for the High-Resolution quad-HIDAC PET scanner	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE				The very high resolution quad-HIDAC PET scanner has four detector banks each with four planar high density avalanche chambers, capable of collecting billions of lines-of-response (LORs), with very high spatial resolution, good absolute sensitivity and a large field of view (170 mm x 170 mm x 280 mm). However, it is crucial to correct for degrading factors introduced by the scanner's geometry and detection. A plane converter efficiency estimation method based on acceptance regions is presented, in which it is possible to represent a plane converter as a set of detection efficiency areas. LORs registered in a particular region in coincidence with another in the opposite plane converter are registered in a square array named a co-occurrence matrix, which is the basis of the method. The reciprocal of these factors are used as a multiplicative correction within the list-mode EM algorithm, event by event. A methodology to obtain the system-geometric correction factors is described and included within the reconstruction process as a normalisation component. Reconstructed images from a uniform (18)F cylinder source (3 cm diameter, 5 cm length) and a (68)Ge line source (15.5 cm length), were used to assess the region-efficiency and system-geometry correction.

Fast Monte Carlo Simulation Based Joint Iterative Reconstruction for Simultaneous (99m)Tc/(123)I Brain SPECT Imaging	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			ACCELERATION; VALIDATION; SCATTER	Simultaneous (99m)Tc/(123)I SPECT allows assessment of two functions under identical physiological conditions. Separation of these isotopes is difficult, however, because their energies are close. Most correction methods do not fully model either physical effects or patient-specific activity and attenuation distributions, and often reject scattered photons, rather than using the information they carry. We have developed a fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based multiple-isotope and multiple-energy joint ordered-subset expectation maximization (JOSEM) iterative reconstruction algorithm, MC-JOSEM, that simultaneously corrects for scatter and crosstalk. We evaluated MC-JOSEM for simultaneous brain perfusion ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) and neurotransmission ((123)I-altropane) SPECT. MC simulations of (99m)Tc and (123)I studies were generated separately and then combined to mimic simultaneous (99m)Tc/(123)I SPECT. All details of photon transport through the brain, the collimator, and detector, including Compton and coherent scatter, septal penetration and backscatter from components behind the crystal, were modeled. We reconstructed images from simultaneous dual-isotope projections in two ways. First, we reconstructed the photopeak-energy-window projections (with an asymmetric energy window for (123)I) using the standard ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm (AW-OSEM). Second, we reconstructed the 3-energy-window projections using a MC based iterative reconstruction that we have developed (MC-JOSEM). After fifteen iterations of reconstruction of (99m)Tc images, root mean square errors (RMSE) of activity estimates in several brain structures from MC-JOSEM were reduced by 79-94% compared to AW-OSEM in the thalamus, striata, white matter, and gray matter. Similarly, RMSE of activity estimates from (123)I images reconstructed by fifteen iterations of MC-JOSEM were reduced by 30-58% compared to AW-OSEM in the striata and background.

A phantom was scanned with CT and SPECT to compare quantitative imaging performance of MC-JOSEM with that of a triple-energy-window method (TEW) in which estimated scatter was also included additively within JOSEM, TEW-JOSEM. We acquired very-high-count projections of three 5.5-cc spheres of (111)In taped in different locations in a water-filled torso/spine/lung phantom; 14 scans were then obtained with (111)In only in the background for generating synthetic images of spheres in background. MC scatter estimates, which were used by MC-JOSEM, were computed once after 5 iterations (60 projections, 10 subsets) of TEW-JOSEM. Images after 36 iterations of both TEW-JOSEM and MC-JOSEM were obtained and counts were measured within volumes-of-interest centered on the spheres in all sphere+background and background-only image sets. The bias ranged from 7.7% to 14.1% for TEW-JOSEM, and from 8.9% to 11.3% for MC-JOSEM, while the precision was significantly better for MCJOSEM (5.4% to 11.2%) than for TEW-JOSEM (9.2% to 17.9%). MC-JOSEM is a promising approach for quantitative SPECT.

The insert device can be used to zoom into a particular organ of interest. Introduction of the insert inside the scanner leads to three types of coincidences: insert-insert (II), insert-scanner (IS) and scanner-scanner (SS). In typical whole-body PET scanners, coincidences recorded in the scanner are sorted into parallel-beam sinograms and images are reconstructed using linear or iterative techniques. In the PET-insert system, the coincidences of type IS have an inherent fan-beam geometry. Reconstruction using parallel-beam sinograms introduces severe streaking artifacts in the images. The coincidences sorted into fan-beam sinograms reduce the artifacts in the reconstructed images. The approach to compute the kernel was derived from CT as there exists an analogy between the PET-insert geometry and a fourth generation CT scanner geometry. In this approach, the weights in the kernel are computed using the intersection of a cone with a voxel. We previously developed two dimensional reconstruction algorithms for this novel system geometry. We extend this work to three dimensions in this paper. A maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm was used to reconstruct the data. The kernel was validated with a contrast recovery study using a digital phantom. Images reconstructed from experimental data show good quality without any visible artifacts.

Several categorization algorithms exist that attempt to correctly classify gasoline samples in data sets. We demonstrate a method that can improve classification performance by maximizing hit-rate without using a priori knowledge of compounds in gasoline samples. This is accomplished by using a variable reduction technique that de-clutters the data set from redundant information by minimizing multivariate structural distortion and by applying a greedy Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that optimally tunes parameters of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). These methods initially classify premium and regular gasoline samples into clusters relying on their gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) spectral data and then they discriminate them into their winter and summer subgroups. Approximately 89% of the samples were correctly classified as premium or regular gasoline and 98.8% of the samples were correctly classified according to their seasonal characteristics.

We generate in situ hybridized gene expression cellular resolution maps (a set of multiple 2D images for each gene) of the mouse brain. Using a digital mouse brain atlas and advanced image analysis methods, gene expression profiles for each brain structure is calculated. We present a method to identify brain structure clusters with similar expression for a given gene using multivariate model-based clustering. In this study a family of Gaussian mixture models is used. Variation in the model is derived from parameterizing the covariance matrix by the shape, volume and orientation. Using Expectation Maximization and Bayesian Information Criterion both optimal model parameters and the number of clusters are determined.

Maintaining Gaussian mixture models of data streams under block evolution	COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - ICCS 2006, PT 1, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2006)	MAY 28-31, 2006	Reading, ENGLAND	Intel Corp, IBM, SGI, Microsoft Res, EPSRC, Springer, ACET Ctr, Univ Reading, SIAM, IMACS, UK e Sci Programme				A new method for maintaining a Gaussian mixture model of a data stream that arrives in blocks is presented. The method constructs local Gaussian mixtures for each block of data and iteratively merges pairs of closest components. Time and space complexity analysis of the presented approach demonstrates that it is 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard EM algorithm, both in terms of required memory and runtime.

Although the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm yields the maximum-likelihood solution it requires a careful initialization of the parameters and the optimal number of kernels in the mixture may be unknown beforehand. We propose a criterion based on the entropy of the pdf (probability density function) associated to each kernel to measure the quality of a given mixture model. Two different methods for estimating Shannon entropy are proposed and a modification of the classical EM algorithm to find the optimal number of kernels in the mixture is presented. We test our algorithm in probability density estimation, pattern recognition and color image segmentation.

Hybrid modular mechanistic/ANN modelling of a wastewater phosphorus removal process	16TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING AND 9TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING	Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Conference Event of the 9th Symposium on Process Systems Engineering (PSE 2006)/16th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-16)	JUL 09-13, 2006	Garmisch-Partenkirchen, GERMANY				NEURAL-NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE	The hybrid modular mechanistic/ANN technique was applied to a wastewater phosphorus removal process with simulation data. The hybrid model was able to describe accurately the process dynamics. With the expectation-maximisation identification technique, the mixture of experts (ME) network converged to a configuration where the two experts developed independent expertise in describing either the phosphorus release state or the phosphorus storage state, which is precisely the main metabolic switch occurring in this process. The final ME network provided a more structured representation of the underlying cellular kinetics. This resulted in higher accuracy and generalisation capacity of the final hybrid mechanistic/ME model.

So non-Gaussian signals/noise require a different modelling and processing approach. In this paper, we discuss a new Bayesian estimation technique for non-Gaussian signals corrupted by colored non Gaussian noise. The method is based on using zero mean finite Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for signal and noise. The estimation is done using an adaptive non-causal nonlinear filtering technique. The method involves deriving an estimator in terms of the GMM parameters, which are in turn estimated using the EM algorithm. The proposed filter is of finite length and offers computational feasibility. The simulations show that the proposed method gives a significant improvement compared to the linear filter for a wide variety of noise conditions, including impulsive noise. We also claim that the estimation of signal using the correlation with past and future samples leads to reduced mean squared error as compared to signal estimation based on past samples only.

However, such algorithms are computationally intensive. With the aim to accelerate list-mode 3D-OSEM, we investigated the use of graphics processing units (GPUs). Primarily designed to deliver high-definition graphics for video games in realtime, GPUs are now increasingly being used as cost-effective high-performance coprocessors for scientific computing. Parallelizable algorithms such as list-mode OSEM are drastically accelerated when the 24 programmable units of the GPU are used to carry the heaviest part of the computation: the line forward and backward projections.

The proposed receiver attempts to separate users' combined signals by resorting to the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Each separated user's signal is then passed to an expectation-conditional maximization (ECM)-based processor that jointly performs frequency acquisition, channel estimation and decoding at each iteration. As compared with conventional OFDMA systems that employ hard-decision equalization and decoding, the proposed receiver can exploit the soft-decision feedback derived from the MAP decoder to provide more reliable synchronization, channel estimation and interference suppression. Simulations indicate that the proposed scheme provides accurate decoding for unsynchronized OFDMA uplink transmissions over frequency-selective fading channels.	[Pun, Man-On; Kuo, C. -C.

The parameters of the probabilistic mixture model are determined using an EM algorithm. The problem of interest here requires neither the accurate arterial blood measurements as the input function nor the existence of a reference region. The effects of mPCA are examined in two different ways on the basis of whether the compartmental model for tracer dynamics is considered. First, the mPCA approach itself is used to classify all voxels into the specific binding and non-specific binding groups, and the resulting power is used for revealing the underlying distribution volume (DV) image. Second, the proposed mPCA-based classification approach is incorporated as the clustering preprocessing into our earlier work [4] to simultaneously estimate the DV parametric image and the input function. The efficiency and superiority of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by real brain PET data.

This work investigates an approach to motion compensated reconstruction of motion-contaminated data, thus applicable to any scanner in the field (e.g. without list-mode acquisition capability), assuming externally-tracked motion information; it involves incorporation of the measured motion information into the system matrix of the EM algorithm. Furthermore, it is shown that the effect of motion-contamination of the attenuation factors should also be modeled and taken into account in the reconstruction task.	[Rahmim, A.; Rousset, O.

The literature is abound with motif search methods. But as the motifs of a promoter are consensus patterns of very short length and the chance of finding putative promoters is high, global feature methods gain importance. In this paper a simple global feature extraction method is proposed for the recognition of sigma-70 promoters in E.coli. It is shown that a simple feedforward neural network classifier achieves a precision of nearly 80% in contrast to the high end classifiers and heavy features proposed in the literature achieving a similar performance. Additionally, a scheme is proposed for locating promoter regions in a given DNA segment.

Noise study in Monte Carlo estimated system matrix for OPET	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE				The traditional method for estimating system matrices consists of simulating a number of annihilation events at each voxel position such that some error measured is minimized. However, axial sensitivity decreases as we move away from the center of the FOV and the number of detected coincidences is substantially smaller at the edge of the scanner than at the center. Therefore, the statistical error in computing should be increasingly larger for voxels at the edge of the image. To remedy in part this problem, we propose to estimate the system matrix using a number of events inversely proportional to plane sensitivity and compare its performance against the traditional approach by computing simple Figures-of-Merit. We simulate a noise cylinder phantom, a point-source phantom and a contrast phantom to measure noise, image resolution and contrast recovery, respectively, by image plane. Images are reconstructed using a ML-EM algorithm with system matrices built with the two methods. Simulation results show that noise is more uniform across the entire FOV when the matrix is estimated as proposed than when the traditional approach is used. Contrast recovery and resolution are not greatly improved.

Most popular model-based clustering techniques might yield poor clusters if the parameters are not initialized properly. To reduce the sensitivity of initial points, a novel algorithm for learning mixture models from multivariate data is introduced in this paper The proposed algorithm takes advantage of TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under STability-reTaining Equilibra CHaracterization) to compute neighborhood local maxima on likelihood surface using stability regions. Basically, our method coalesces the advantages of the traditional EM with that of the dynamic and geometric characteristics of the stability regions of the corresponding nonlinear dynamical system of the log-likelihood function. Two phases namely, the EM phase and the stability region phase, are repeated alternatively in the parameter space to achieve improvements in the maximum likelihood. Though applied to Gaussian mixtures in this paper, our technique can be easily generalized to any other parametric finite mixture model. The algorithm has been tested on both synthetic and real datasets and the improvements in the performance compared to other approaches are demonstrated The robustness with respect to initialization is also illustrated experimentally.

The use of such concept required the definition of several parameters and notions like the generalised mixture notion. A distribution mixture is said to be "generalised" when the exact nature of components is not known, but each belongs to a finite known set of families of distributions. However, we must define which distribution can represent the, optimal choice of every component. We show in this paper that the Pearson system associated with an adaptive Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be adapted to such problem. That is, when we know that a sample proceeds from one family of the set considered, we have a decision rule for what family it belongs to considering the Pearson system. which is a set of eight families, the decision rule above is defined by the use of "Skewness"' and "kurtosis". The different algorithms so obtained are then applied to the problem of unsupervised Bayesian image segmentation. The efficiency of those methods is compared via numerical studies and via results of unsupervised segmentation of different images.

An incremental adaptation method is presented in this paper called AGMMA which be based on the modified segmental-EM algorithm and apply it to speaker recognition system. The initial model is trained on a limited amount of data and adapted recursively to enrich itself incrementally with the data available in each session. The proposed method evaluates the expectation of the initial data, which would be used in the segmental EM algorithm applied on both initial and new data, by the statistics of initial data. Experiments were taken on YOHO database that was a high quality microphone speech database and an attendance system that ran over eleven months. The results on YOHO database showed that AGMMA outperforms ARGMM and classical Bayesian adaptation in most of the cases. Significant profits are also achieved when AGMMA applied to the attendance system in real-life environment.

In this paper we motivate the robust detection and estimation problem using recent results for cooperative sensing in Cognitive Radios and multi-object tracking in sensor networks. As a first step, we formulate an abstract version of the problem that is solved under different assumptions. We use Expectation Maximization (EM) framework to successfully weed out the lying nodes. We consider different types of lying behavior. In the simplistic case of liars behaving the same over all observations. In the more complex cases, the lying behavior of the users changes over time. The solution to the problem of detection in the presence of lying nodes has been developed from two view points. In the first case we consider the binary variable being detected as a latent variable, and in the second case we consider the binary variable as a parameter. The results under the two schemes are presented and compared. In all of the cases considered in this paper, we show that the factors that maximally impact the estimation/decision process are the mean of the liars, the variance of the channel, and the number of observations.

A new time-domain method for system identification and BSS for MIMO-AR models in proposed based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for sources distribution. The algorithm is based on generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) for joint estimation of the AR model parameters and the GMM parameters of the sources. The method is tested via simulations of synthetic and audio signals mixed by a MIMO-AR model. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the well-known multidimensional linear predictive coding (LPC), and it enables to achieve higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in the BSS problem.

A prior distribution is chosen for the wavelet coefficients of the unknown channel impulse response, in order to capture the well known sparseness property of the wavelet representation. This prior yields, in maximum a posteriori estimation, a thresholding rule within the EM algorithm. We particularly focus on reducing the number of estimated parameters by iteratively discarding "unsignificant" wavelet coefficients from the estimation process. In addition, the proposed algorithm enhances the estimation accuracy in terms of mean square error with less computational complexity than traditional semi-blind methods. Simulation results using IEEE UWB channel models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms pilot based channel estimation in terms of mean square error and and bit error rate.

Exploiting the replication property of the GPS C/A code within each symbol, we develop a coherent preprocessing approach based on a sample mean model. This model employs long integration time that improves the SNR and enhances receiver robustness against interference and weak signal effects. It also allows a simplified expression for the likelihood function which facilitates the use of computationally efficient iterative techniques for solving the complex ML optimization problem. In the proposed approach. the ML estimator is iteratively computed using the fast and low-complexity SAGE (Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization) algorithm. The proposed scheme is a candidate for indoor GPS navigation, as demonstrated by computer simulations.	[Sahmoudi, M.; Amin, M.

The representation should contain the biologically meaningful information hidden in the primary sequence of the protein. Conserved or similar subsequences are strong indicators of functional and structural similarity. In this study we present a feature mapping that takes into account the models of the subsequences of protein sequences. An expectation-maximization algorithm along with an HMM mixture model is used to cluster and learn the models of subsequences of a given set of proteins.

Unsupervised learning of dense hierarchical appearance representations	18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol 2, Proceedings	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2006)	AUG 20-24, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IAPR, CAA, Hong Kong Baptist Univ				We describe an unsupervised, probabilistic method for learning visual feature hierarchies. Starting from local, low-level features computed at random locations, the method combines features hierarchically. At each level of the hierarchy, pairs of features are identified that tend to occur at stable positions relative to each other by clustering the configurational distributions of observed feature cooccurrences using Expectation-Maximization. Stable pairs of features thus identified are combined into higher-level features. This learning scheme results in a graphical model that constitutes a probabilistic representation of a flexible visual feature hierarchy. For detection, evidence is propagated using Nonparametric Belief Propagation, a recent generalization of particle filtering. In experiments, the proposed approach demonstrates effective learning and robust detection of objects in the presence of clutter and occlusion.

A remedy for nonstationarity in background transition regions for real time hyperspectral detection	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference, Vols 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					Real-time hyperspectral systems rely on a variety of statistical detection methods that all require the adaptive estimation of first- and second-order background statistics. Inadequate adaptation can occur when an airborne sensor encounters a physical transition area (e.g. forest to meadow), resulting both in excessive false detections, and in the failure to detect targets that have been strategically positioned in boundary areas. Here we describe a two-component statistical mixture model that gracefully grows the capabilities of deployed systems to adapt to abrupt transitions. First, the parameters of a bi-modal Gaussian model are found with a modified Expectation Maximization technique. Next, the detection phase of processing tests for hypotheses that allow mixtures of these background components, with unknown mixing fraction estimated as part of a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). A straightforward application of existing real time spectral whitening modules allows the simultaneous diagonalization of the estimated covariance matrices of both primary mixture components. This generates, for both anomaly- and signature-based detection, only a small additional computational burden, consisting of a standard Newton-Raphson algorithm applied to a polynomial function.

Investigation of Equal Magnitude Respiratory Gating in Quantitative Myocardial SPECT	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			PROJECTOR-BACKPROJECTOR; SCATTER COMPENSATION; PHANTOM; MOTION	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of respiratory gating in myocardial SPECT using different numbers of gates where each gate contains an equal magnitude of heart and diaphragm motion. The 4D NURBS-based Cardiac-Torso (NCAT) phantom was used to generate 96 3D phantoms equally spaced over a complete respiratory cycle modeling the activity distribution from a typical Tc-99m Sestamibi study with the maximum movement of the diaphragm and heart set at 4 cm (heavy breathing). The 96 time frames were grouped to simulate various gating schemes (4, 6, 8, and 10 gates) in which each gate contained an equal magnitude of respiratory motion (1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6 the total motion respectively). Projection data, including effects of attenuation, collimator-detector response and scatter, from each respiratory gate and each gating scheme were generated and reconstructed using the OS-EM algorithm with correction for attenuation using gated attenuation maps. Bull's-eye polar plots were generated from the reconstructed images for each gate. Two regions-of-interest were placed over the lateral and inferior walls, and their average intensity ratio was determined. A ratio that deviates from 1 indicates a non-uniformity artifact caused by RM. Our results indicate that the RM artifacts are less prominent in gates near end-expiration and more prominent near end-inspiration. The artifacts are reduced the most when going from the ungated case to the gated case. We conclude that respiratory gating is an effective way to reduce RM artifacts. Effective implementation of respiratory gating to further improve quantitative myocardial SPECT requires optimization of the gating scheme based on the amount of respiratory motion of the heart during each gate and the placement of the gates within the respiratory cycle.

The reliability and quality of software is often improved by applying a software faults prediction model prior to system deployment. A faults prediction model is typically built using a training dataset consisting of software measurements and known defect occurrence knowledge of a previously developed similar software project. However, practical issues during software development often limit the availability of the number of defects associated with all modules in the training data. We present a semi-supervised learning method for software faults modeling when there is limited defect occurrence knowledge of the training program modules. The approach uses the popular EM algorithm for estimating missing data values and employs k-means clustering to facilitate augmentation of the training dataset with program modules without known defect data. An empirical case study of real-world software measurement and faults data is used to evaluate the semi-supervised learning methodology. The software faults prediction of an independent test data is shown to improve with the proposed modeling approach.

The state-transition probabilities that maximize the information rate are determined by using expectation-maximization. Then, the channel capacity of DAPPM is obtained and compared to that of pulse-position modulation (L-PPM) and differential pulse-position modulation (L-DPPM). it is shown that DAPPM achieves a higher capacity and is less sensitive to multipath dispersion than PPM and DPPM.

This may involve dynamically creating Web pages that are unique per user or using the desires of a user to determine what Web documents to retrieve. This paper presents a Web mining model based on dynamic clustering and hidden Markov model. The output of the model is some information for dynamically creating a web page which can best meet the user's desires. The assumption of the dynamic clustering is that if a group of users who have the same interest trend, those pages they have visited are probably related. We propose that human should be the authority to judge the correlation of two pages. First, the model statistic a user's web browsing records in the log file; find a group of users who have the same interest trend with the user; collect all the pages in which this group of users are interested; calculate the correlation between pages; and cluster the pages into several categories according to a predetermined threshold. Each web page category is considered as a stochastic state variable. In the second phase, our model based on hidden Markov model is further constructed to mine the latent desires of a user given an observed sequence of Web pages that the user have browsed. In order to get the optimal parameters (transition probability matrix, the conditional probability and the initial state) in the model, we applied the Baum-Welch parameter estimation method in EM algorithm to train the model on the data set. Experimental results show that the model is practicable and efficient.

We derive this function based on a statistical model of the wavelet coefficients. This three-component mixture model describes the coefficients in each subband as a mixture of small, medium, and large coefficients to which different amplification factors are assigned. The model parameters are estimated from each subband using the EM algorithm. The algorithm has a small number of user-specified parameters while can obtain good enhancement results.

While the vision sensors provide high accuracy measurements for position estimation, they require suitable features of objects for accurate recognition and detection as prior knowledge. Especially, learning of appearance based features of objects requires large quantities of training data, which makes development costs. This paper proposes a method for learning appearance based features of objects using auxiliary data of RFID. In this method, the RFID device is used as a supervisor to semi-automatically construct the training data set for each objects. Since it is difficult to observe what ID does an object image correspond to, this problem comes down to supervised learning using incompletely labeled features. This paper proposes a learning method using Kernel PCA and EM Algorithm, and verifies the effectiveness and robustness of this method.

The proposed technique is based on the use of multiple active contour models (ACMs) for the simultaneous segmentation of both lungs and outlier detection. The technique starts by grey-level thresholding of the images followed by edge detection. Then the edge points are organized in strokes and a set of weights summing to one is assigned to each stroke. These weights represent the soft assignment of the stroke to each of the ACMs and depend on the distance between the stroke points and the ACM units, on gradient direction information and also on the stroke size. Both the weights and the ACMs energy minimization are computed using the generalized expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm. Initialization of the ACM's is fully automatic. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

When sufficiently high pulse repetition rates are available, it is possible to obtain several samples of the clutter in a time interval short enough that key contributors to the clutter remain approximately stationary. This paper develops an approach to estimate the clutter subspace in such scenarios and exploit this estimate for clutter suppression and improved detection performance.

Stochastic Discrete Reconstruction (SDR) for Nuclear Medicine Tomographic Systems	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE				To address the challenge posted by novel tomographic systems we have designed a stochastic reconstruction method. Our algorithm considers every event separately, therefore the method is ideally suited and designed for reconstruction of data from imaging systems with a large number of line of responses (LORs) that usually yield up to only one event per LORs. SDR is also entirely compatible with reconstruction of unusual geometries such as for time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) or Compton aperture imaging. The main idea behind the SDR is to find in the reconstruction area the origin of each of the detected events. In every iteration of the algorithm, the possible origin of each event is changed stochastically according to some predefined transition probability. The reconstruction is considered completed when the system reaches equilibrium. Then, the activity in each voxel is estimated by the current number of events in the voxel normalized by the sensitivity of the system. This approach does not require either projection or backprojection operations as would be the case for standard iterative algorithms. We tested the performance of the new method using 2D computer simulations of standard tomographic parallel geometry. For the reconstructions with a high level of noise, the bias and variance obtained by the SDR reconstructions was in the range of 5-10% which was comparable to the results obtained by maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM).

To prevent redundant reports of the object, a centroid processing algorithm is used to associate and fuse multiple detections, called primitives, into a single object measurement. At the 2001 SPIE conference,(1) Part I of this paper was presented wherein a new recursive least squares algorithm was derived that produces a single range-bearing centroid estimate. In this Part II paper, the problem is revisited to address one important aspect not previously considered. We develop a new algorithm component that will parse merged measurements that result from the presence of closely-spaced targets. The technique uses tracker feedback to identify the number of constituents in which to decompose the identified merged measurement. The algorithm has two components: one is a decomposition group formation algorithm, and the second is the expectation-maximization based centroid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results are presented that show the algorithm improves tracker completeness as well as measurement accuracy in scenarios with closely spaced objects.

The system will have two orthogonal pairs of rotating planar detectors operating in coincidence mode, for which performing fully 3-D image reconstruction in a clinically-relevant time frame is a challenge. This contribution describes a framework for fast list-mode ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) iterative image reconstruction and two additional techniques to speed image reconstruction. First, a novel analytic approach to sensitivity normalization matrix calculation was developed. Second, parallelization was accomplished for sensitivity normalization matrix calculation and the iteration step of OSEM. The algorithm was tested using a Monte Carlo simulation of a 3 minute clinical PEM-PET acquisition for an ellipsoidal breast phantom with spherical tumors. Timing tests were made on two workstations, one with 2 CPUs and one with 4 dual core CPUs (8 effective processors). On the 8 processor system the sensitivity normalization matrix was computed in 21 sec and fully 3-D image reconstruction with this precomputed sensitivity matrix was achieved in 4.6 min. Thus fully 3-D iterative image reconstruction for PEM-PET in a clinical time frame is achievable.

Next, by annealing the free parameter that controls this bias, we achieve further improvements. We then describe an alternative kind of structural bias, toward "broken" hypotheses consisting of partial structures over segmented sentences, and show a similar pattern of improvement. We relate this approach to contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005a), apply the latter to grammar induction in six languages, and show that our new approach improves accuracy by 1-17% (absolute) over CE (and 8-30% over EM), achieving to our knowledge the best results on this task to date.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most common methodology in such studies. In order to measure the volume of putamen in MR image, accurate segmentation method is highly desirable. In practice, the inhomogeneity effect in MR imaging process generates gradual changes in white-to-gray matter contrast in putamen area, which makes segmentation task rather difficult. In the present study, an adaptive fuzzy rule base (FRB) system is proposed and applied to both simulated and real MR images for putamen segmentation. Comparing to FSL (FMRIB Software Library)'s Automatic Segmentation Toolbox (FAST), K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed adaptive FRB system demonstrates better performance in putamen segmentation.

J	Song, XY; Lee, SY				Song, XY; Lee, SY			A maximum likelihood approach for multisample nonlinear structural equation models with missing continuous and dichotomous data	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article							LATENT VARIABLE MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; FIT INDEXES; NORMALIZING CONSTANTS; DATA AUGMENTATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPONENTS	Structural equation models are widely appreciated in social-psychological research and other behavioral research to model relations between latent constructs and manifest variables and to control for measurement error. Most applications of SEMs are based on fully observed continuous normal data and models with a linear structural equation. However, discrete nonnormal data and missing data are rather common, and sometimes it is necessary to incorporate nonlinear structural equations for assessing the impact of nonlinear terms of the exogenous latent variables to the endogenous latent variables. Moreover, to study the behaviors of different populations, it is necessary to extend from a single sample model to a multisample model. In this article, a maximum likelihood (ML) approach is developed for analyzing a multisample nonlinear structural equation model, in the context of mixed continuous and dichotomous data that involve data that are missing at random. The article demonstrates the newly developed methods for estimation and model comparison by a simulation study, a synthetic data application, and a real application to study latent psychological constructs of job attitude, emotion, and benefit attitude that are related to organizational and management research.

Our classifier includes a prior for the weights between different neurons such that it prefers mixture models made up from neurons having classification boundaries as orthogonal to each other as possible. We derive an EM algorithm for learning the mixing proportions and weights of each neuron, consisting of an exact E step and a partial M step, and show that our model covers the regions of high posterior probability in weight space and tends to reduce overfitting. We demonstrate the way in which our mixture classifier works using a toy 2-dimensional data set, showing the effective use of strategically positioned components in the mixture. We further compare its performance against SVMs and one-hidden-layer neural networks on four real-world data sets from the UCI repository, and show that even a relatively small number of neurons with appopriate competitive priors can achieve superior classification accuracies on held-out test data.

PMHT is linear in the number of targets and the number of measurements, moreover, it is guaranteed to converge to locally optimal state estimates. However, it violates the rule that no target can be assigned more than one measurement. This heresy leads to a plethora of local maxima that cause performance problems. These problems are greatly reduced by applying the PMHT method to multi-frame data sequences, that is, to the set of all possible measurement sequences in the last L scans. The blend of PMHT and limited enumeration reduces the mismatch induced by violating the "at most one measurement per target" rule. Two new PMHT algorithms are presented. Both are linear in the number of targets and the number of enumerated sequences.	Metron Inc, Reston, VA USA	Streit, RL (reprint author), Metron Inc, 11911 Freedom Dr, Reston, VA USA.						Anderson B.

The problem today is not often lack of information, but instead, information overload. Graphs have demonstrated to be a useful framework to represent and analyze large amounts of information. Classical strategies such as Bayesian Networks, Semantic Networks and Graph Matching are some examples of the power of graphs. We will introduce two different but related graph-based structures that will allow us to span the temporal performance of decision-making processes. Given that most of the high level information fusion problems of interest are NP-Hard, there is a need to separate methodologies between "near real-time" tools and forensic heuristics. With this in mind we will introduce a real-time decision-making tool (INFERD) and a forensic graph matching algorithm (TruST).

An IA acquires concepts through learning relations between visual features of objects and acoustic features of human speech. In this task, the IA has to find out which Visual features are indicated by a speech. Previous concept acquisition systems find Out them by using probabilistic methods, however, such approaches need much samples to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, firstly, we propose basic concept acquisition system using Online-EM algorithm without the biases. And then, we implement two types of learning biases to accelerate a learning process into our system. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve efficient learning.

An IA acquires word meanings through learning the relations among visual features of objects and acoustic features of human speech. In this task, the IA has to find out which visual features are indicated by the speech. Previous works introduced stochastic approaches to do this, however, such approaches need many examples to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, firstly, we propose a word meaning acquisition method for the IA based on an Online-EM algorithm without learning biases. Then, we implement two types of biases into it to accelerate the word meaning acquisition. Experimental results show that the proposed method with biases can efficiently acquire word meanings.

Gaussian mixture model is used for clustering of texture feature vectors. Medical diagnosing described here consists of learning part and inference part. In learning part knowledge is accumulated from cases with known diagnosis, which involves mixture model parameters estimation for every diagnosis considered. Inference is done by calculating the mixture value and maximizing it over every diagnosis considered. EM algorithm is used for Gaussian mixture model parameters estimation. For every possible diagnosis, parameters of one mixture model have to be calculated. To demonstrate the method, we present the experiment with real data, diagnosing the common liver lesions using computed tomography (CT) images.

In this paper, we present three computationally efficient iterative receivers for joint channel estimation and data detection in SIMO systems. These receivers result from an application of the expectation-maximization (EM) and the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) receivers with perfect channel state information (CSI) is plotted and compared with the BER performance of the proposed iterative receivers. Proposed receivers exhibit near ML performance with a few iterations.

Wavelet packets decompose signals in to broader components using linear spectral bisecting. In this paper, mixtures of speech signals are decomposed using wavelet packets, the phase difference between the two mixtures are investigated in wavelet domain. In our method Laplacian Mixture Model (LMM) is defined. An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for training of the model and calculation of model parameters which is the mixture matrix. Therefore individual speech components of speech mixtures are separated.	Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran	Tinati, MA (reprint author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran.

The framework includes various particular types of model, such as factor analysis, latent class analysis, latent trait analysis, latent profile models, mixtures of factor analysers, state-space models and others. The simplest scenario, of a single discrete latent variable, includes finite mixture models, hidden Markov chain models and hidden Markov random field models. The paper gives a brief tutorial of the application of maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to the estimation of parameters within these models, emphasising especially the fact that computational complexity varies greatly among the different scenarios. In the case of a single discrete latent variable, the issue of assessing its cardinality is discussed. Techniques such as the EM algorithm, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and variational approximations are mentioned.

Iterative EM estimation based LDPC CDMA receiver	2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, Vols 1-5	CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE ASILOMAR CONFERENCE ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS		English	Proceedings Paper	40th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA			EM Algorithm; iterative receiver; LDPC		This paper proposes a scheme of iteratively obtaining an estimate of channel coefficient and noise power spectral density (PSD), initially with the aid of pilot symbols. The iterative receiver employs a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and channel estimation based on expectation maximization. Pilot bits are distributed among subframes followed by spreading and binary phase-shift keying. At the receiver, an initial estimate of channel coefficient and noise PSD is obtained using pilot information. Subsequent values of channel coefficient and noise PSD are both iteratively updated by the soft feedback from the LDPC decoder. The updated channel coefficient and noise PSD are iteratively passed to the LDPC decoder, which results in an improved decoding accuracy, as shown.

The signal strength and the noise-power spectral density are separately estimated by applying the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The higher throughput of the proposed system relative to a conventional 3(rd) Generation Partnership Project system is verified through simulations using a Jakes fading environment. The complexity of the proposed EM iterative parameter-estimation scheme is low because the required number of complex multiplications is equal to only four times the fading block size.

The model parameters, which are mean vectors, covariance matrices and mixture weights, are trained in an unsupervised learning method using the expectation maximization algorithm. Experiments have shown that the GMM is an effective method capable of achieving high identification rate. However, the GMM approach is not always effective because of ambiguity inherently existing in the cell phase data. To enhance the effectiveness of the GMM for solving this specific problem, the relaxation labeling (RL) is proposed to be used with the GMM. The RL algorithm is a parallel algorithm that updates the probabilities of cell phases by using correlation or mutual information between cell phases to reduce uncertainty among GMMs having overlapping properties.

Our goal is to segment brain tissues for creating biomechanical model. The proposed segmentation method is based on 3-D region growing and outperforms conventional approaches by stepwise usage of intensity similarities between voxels in conjunction with edge information. Since the intensity and the edge information are complementary to each other in the region-based segmentation, we use them twice by performing a coarse-to-fine extraction. First, the edge information in an appropriate neighborhood of the voxel being considered is examined to constrain the region growing. The expanded region of the first extraction result is then used as the domain for the next processing. The intensity and the edge information of the current voxel only are utilized in the final extraction. Before segmentation, the intensity parameters of the brain tissues as well as partial volume effect are estimated by using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in order to provide an accurate data interpretation into the extraction. We tested the proposed method on T1-weighted MR images of brain and evaluated the segmentation effectiveness comparing the results with ground truths. Also, the generated meshes from the segmented brain volume by using mesh generating software are shown in this paper.

Since compression performance depends on exploiting the redundancy between images, knowing the disparity is important at the decoder. Unfortunately, distributed encoders cannot calculate this disparity and communicate it. We consider a toy problem, the compression of random dot stereograms, and propose an Expectation Maximization algorithm to perform unsupervised learning of disparity during the decoding procedure. Our experiments show that this can achieve twice as efficient compression compared to a system with no disparity compensation and perform nearly as well as a system which knows the disparity through an oracle.

Dirichlet aspect weighting: A generalized EM algorithm for integrating external data fields with semantically structured queries by using gradient projection method	ICDM 2006: Sixth International Conference on Data Mining, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				In this paper we address the problem of document retrieval with semantically structured queries - queries where each term has a tagged field label. We introduce Dirichlet Aspect Weighting model which integrates terms from external databases into the query language model in a bayesian learning framework. For this model, the dirichlet prior distribution is governed by parameters which depend on the number of fields in the external databases. This model needs additional examples to be augmented to the semantically structured query These examples are obtained using pseudo relevance feedback. We formulate a loglikelihood function for the Dirichlet Aspect Weighting model and maximize it using a novel Generalized EM algorithm. Compari. son of the results of Dirichlet Aspect Weighting model on TREC 2005 Genomics Track dataset with baseline methods using pseudo relevance feedback, while incorporating terms from external databases shows an improvement.

The proposed EM algorithm learns the parameters of the different models in real time without requiring a priori information on either the number of models or the model parameters. Using the real ground penetrating radar (GPR) data, the learning performance of the EM-IMM technique is analyzed and commented upon. Numerical receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and detected images indicate that the proposed EM-IMM based abrupt change detector has a better detection and imaging performance than the conventional Kalman filter for land mine detection applications.

But the main drawback of EM is that its solution can highly depend on its initial values, and consequently produce sub-optical maximum likelihood estimates. Thus a genetic initialization algorithm(GIA) is proposed to overcome this limitation. K-mean, FCM, and GIA is compared based on several experiments on synthetic and real data sets. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed GIA achieve the highest likelihood.

Based on the specialties of computed radiography (CR) images and medical image processing, we have study the filtering methods for computed radiography images noises. On the base of analyzing computed radiography imaging system in detail, the author think that the major two noises are Gaussian white noise and Poisson noise. Then, the different relationship of between two kinds of noises and signal were studied completely. By considering both the characteristics of computed radiography images and the statistical features of wavelet transformed images, a multiscale image filtering algorithm, which based on two-state hidden markov model (HMM) and mixture Gaussian statistical model, has been used to decrease the Gaussian white noise in computed images. By using EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm to estimate noise coefficients in each scale and obtain power spectrum matrix, then this carried through the syncretized two Filter that are IIR(infinite impulse response) Wiener Filter and HMM, according to scale size and achieve the experiments as well as the comparison with other denoising methods were presented at last.
