Geo-referenced Time-series Summarization Using k-Full Trees: A Summary of Results	12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING WORKSHOPS (ICDMW 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)	DEC 10-13, 2012	Brussels, BELGIUM	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), FWO, IBM, SAS, Yahoo, NASA, Biside, KNIME, Univ Antwerpen, Univ Libre Bruxelles (ULB)		Spatial Data Mining; Summarization; Geo-referenced Time-series; Full Trees		Given a set of regions with activity counts at each time instant (e.g., a listing of countries with number of mass protests or disease cases over time) and a spatial neighbor relation, geo-referenced time-series summarization (GTS) finds k-full trees that maximize activity coverage. GTS has important potential societal applications such as understanding the spread of political unrest, disease, crimes, fires, pollutants, etc. However, GTS is computationally challenging because (1) there are a large number of subsets of k-full trees due to the potential overlap of trees and (2) a region with no activity may be a part of a larger region with maximum activity coverage, making apriori-based pruning inapplicable. Previous approaches for spatio-temporal data mining detect anomalous or unusual areas and do not summarize activities. We propose a k-full tree (kFT) approach for GTS which features an algorithmic refinement for partitioning regions that leads to computational savings without affecting result quality. Experimental results show that our algorithmic refinement substantially reduces the computational cost. We also present a case study that shows the output of our approach on Arab Spring data.

In many applications, the speech activity detection has to be performed on highly degraded audio streams. We present here our work to address the challenge of speech activity detection for highly degraded channel conditions. We present two two-pass modified cumulative sum (CUSUM) approaches based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation and regularized feature-based maximum likelihood linear regression (RFMLLR) adaption. In this paper, we compare the two approaches to a single-pass modified CUSUM baseline system with Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of speech and non-speech classes. The systems are evaluated on two test sets. Each consists of data from eight highly degraded channels. Our two-pass MAP adaptation system reduces the total error by 27%-54% relative compared to the single-pass baseline system. We present also experiments showing additional gains of 3%-25% relative by using channel-specific GMM models for speech and non-speech instead of a single channel-independent GMM model for each.

This technique has been established and well-explored by many researchers. However, some decision tree algorithms may produce a large structure of tree size and it is difficult to understand. Furthermore, misclassification of data often occurs in learning process. Therefore, a decision tree algorithm that can produce a simple tree structure with high accuracy in term of classification rate is a need to work with huge volume of data. Pruning methods have been introduced to reduce the complexity of tree structure without decrease the accuracy of classification. One of pruning methods is the Reduced Error Pruning (REP). To better understand pruning methods, an experiment was conducted using Weka application to compare the performance in term of complexity of tree structure and accuracy of classification for J48, REPTree, PART, JRip, and Ridor algorithms using seven standard datasets from UCI machine learning repository. In data modeling, J48 and REPTree generate tree structure as an output while PART, Ridor and JRip generate rules. In additional J48, REPTree and PART using REP method for pruning while Ridor and JRip using improvement of REP method, namely IREP and RIPPER methods. The experiment result shown performance of J48 and REPTree are competitive in producing better result. Between J48 and REPTree, average differences performance of accuracy of classification is 7.1006% and 6.2857% for complexity of tree structure. For classification rules algorithms, Ridor is the best algorithms compare to PART and JRip due to highest percentage of accuracy of classification in five dataset from seven datasets. An algorithm that produces high accuracy with simple tree structure or simple rules can be awarded as the best algorithm in decision tree.	[Omar, W.

Based on Semantic Web technologies, different machine learning applications have been designed. Particularly important is the possibility to create complex metadata descriptions for any problem domain, based on pre-defined ontologies. In this paper we evaluate the use of a semantic similarity measure based on pre-defined ontologies as an input for a classification analysis in the context of social network analysis. A link prediction between actors of two real world social networks is performed, which could serve as a recommendation system. The social networks involve different types of relations and nodes. We measure the prediction performance based on a semantic similarity measure as well as traditional approaches. The findings demonstrate that the prediction accuracy based on the semantic similarity is comparable to traditional approaches and shows that data mining on complex social networks using ontology-based metadata can be considered as a very promising approach.

J	Orsenigo, C; Vercellis, C				Orsenigo, Carlotta; Vercellis, Carlo			Regularization through fuzzy discrete SVM with applications to customer ranking	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; fuzzy sets; support vector machines; marketing; credit risk		In the context of classification most efforts have been devoted to deriving accurate prediction models from a set of examples whose class is supposed to be known with certainty. However, there are situations where class labels are affected by an intrinsic vagueness, as in ranking customers for marketing campaigns or credit approval. In this paper we propose a new two-phase fuzzy classification method aimed at generating accurate classification rules when labels are uncertain. In the first phase, an ensemble method is applied in order to derive the value of the class membership function for each example in the dataset. In the second phase, an optimal classification model is obtained by solving a fuzzy variant of discrete support vector machines. Computational tests performed on benchmark and real world marketing and credit risk datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method when it is compared to alternative classification techniques. Furthermore, the tests reveal that the new fuzzy discrete SVM model is a robust regularization method capable of generating stable classification rules, reducing the variance of the error and smoothing out the noise due to outliers.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM				Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			A context-aware data mining process model based framework for supporting evaluation of data mining results	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Context; Data mining process; KDDM; Evaluation; Decision analysis; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Post-processing	VALUE-FOCUSED THINKING; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; DECISION TREES; INDUCTION; VECTORS; PROJECT	The knowledge discovery via data mining process (KDDM) is a multiple phase that aims to at a minimum semi-automatically extract new knowledge from existing datasets. For many data mining tasks, the evaluation phase is a challenging one for various reasons. Given this challenge several studies have presented techniques that could be used for the semi-automated evaluation of data mining results. When taken together, these studies suggest the possibility of a common multi-criteria evaluation framework. The use of such a multi-criteria evaluation framework, however, requires that relevant objectives, measures and preference function be identified. This implies that the context of the DM problem is particularly important for the evaluation phase of the KDDM process. Our framework utilizes and integrates a pair of established tightly coupled techniques (i.e. Value Focused Thinking (VFT) and the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methods) as well as established techniques from multi-criteria decision analysis in order to explicate and utilize context information in order to facilitate semi-automated evaluation.

Our research aims to extract SN links in internet chat with multiple users engaging in synchronous overlapping conversations all displayed in a single stream. We approached this problem using three methods which build on previous research. Response-time analysis builds on temporal proximity of chat messages; word context usage builds on keywords analysis and direct addressing which infers links by identifying the intended message recipient from the screen name (nickname) referenced in the message [1]. Our analysis of word usage within the chat stream also provides contexts for the extracted SN links. To test the capability of our methods, we used publicly available data from Internet Relay Chat (IRC), a real-time computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool used by millions of people around the world. The extraction performances of individual methods and their hybrids were assessed relative to a ground truth (determined a priori via manual scoring).	[Osesina, O.

Speech can be considered only as a different type of signal and processed as a time series. Stuttered speech is rich in events also known as dysfluencies, typically repetitions. This paper describes a new method for enumerating complex repetitions. Classical approaches to stuttered speech analyzed dysfluencies in very short intervals, which were sufficient for recognizing simple repetitions of phonemes. However, the problem of repetitions of syllables or words was typically ignored due to high computational demands of classical methods for analysis of longer intervals. Our approach uses a method adopted from data mining and bioinformatics, together with efficient representation of speech signal, which simplifies processing of speech enough to enable analysis of longer intervals. Results show applicability of the proposed method.

This includes the use of software tools that can help with digital investigations. A novel method for the analysis and visualisation of network forensics traffic data, based on growing hierarchical self-organising maps (GHSOM), is presented. Self-organising maps have shown to be successful for the analysis of highly-dimensional input data in data mining applications as well as for data visualisation. Moreover, the hierarchical architecture of the GHSOM is more flexible than a single SOM in the adaptation process to input data, capturing inherent hierarchical relationships among them. To evaluate the performance of this method in the field of network forensics, traffic data has been clustered and visualised in a hierarchical fashion to enhance the ability of digital forensics to find evidence of attacks or anomalous behaviour in the network. Experimental results show the utility of this approach.	[Palomo, E. J.; Dominguez, E.; Luque, R.

We focus on streamlining service levels i.e., finding right resolution level for each ticket, to reduce time, efforts and cost for ticket handling, without affecting workloads and user satisfaction. We formalize this problem and present two statistics-based search algorithms for identifying problems suitable for left-shift (from expensive, expertise-intensive L2 level to cheaper, simpler L1 level) and right-shift (from L1 to L2). The approach is domain-driven: it produces directly usable and often novel results, without any trial-and-error experimentation, along with detailed justifications and predicted impacts. This helps in acceptance among end-users and more active use of the results. We discuss one real-life case-study of results produced by the algorithms.

Association rule is a very important Knowledge form. Finding these valuable rules from brain images is a significant research topic in the field of data mining. Discovering frequent itemsets is the key process in association rule mining. Traditional association rule algorithms adopt an iterative method which requires large amount of calculation. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm which based on association graph and matrix (GMA) pruning to reduce the amount of candidate itemsets. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient for different values of minimum support.

The high-dimensional data stream clustering is a difficult problem for the data stream mining because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream make most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In this paper, DS_CABOSFV, a high-dimensional data stream clustering algorithm based on CABOSFV algorithm is presented. Our empirical tests show that DS_CABOSFV has low computational complexity and good efficiency for high-dimensional data stream clustering.

The study employs Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Probabilistic Neural Net (PNN), Genetic Programming (GP) and Logistic Regression (LR) for classification. A dataset of 2500 phishing and non phishing emails is analyzed after extracting 23 keywords from the email bodies using text mining from the original dataset. Further, we selected 12 most important features using t-statistic based feature selection. Here, we did not find statistically significant difference in sensitivity as indicated by t-test at 1% level of significance, both with and without feature selection across all techniques except PNN. Since, the GP and DT are not statistically significantly different either with or without feature selection at 1% level of significance, DT should be preferred because it yields 'if-then' rules, thereby increasing the comprehensibility of the system.

There are various algorithms and tools available for this purpose. Data mining has a vast range of applications ranging from business to medicine to engineering. In this paper, we discuss the application of data mining in education for student profiling and grouping. We make use of Apriori algorithm for student profiling which is one of the popular approaches for mining associations i.e. discovering co-relations among set of items. The other algorithm used, for grouping students is K-means clustering which assigns a set of observations into subsets. In the field of academics, data mining can be very useful in discovering valuable information which can be used for profiling students based on their academic record. We apply Apriori algorithm to the database containing academic records of various students and try to extract association rules in order to profile students based on various parameters like exam scores, term work grades, attendance and practical exams. We also apply K-means clustering to the same set of data in order to group the students. The implemented algorithms offer an effective way of profiling students which can be used in educational systems.

A class of database applications that look for access patterns in a group of data that can be used to predict future behavior. Mining access pattern is the sequence of accesses pursued by users frequently; is a kind of interesting and useful knowledge in practice. Essentially, a Mining Access Pattern is a special case of sequential pattern in commercial websites. A data structure called Mining Access Pattern tree or MAP-tree in short, is developed, which stores highly compressed, critical information for access patterns mining and facilitates the development of algorithms for mining access patterns efficiently in commercial websites which promotes business transactions such as selling the products which are carried out over the web and that has been a key driving force in the rapid growth of electronic commerce. In this paper we explore a new data mining capability which mines access patterns in commercial websites by applying the weblog mining to E-commerce servers. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We first apply the association rule mining technique to the medical database annotated with BI-RADS lexicons by doctors, to find out the interesting BI-RADS lexicon values. Then, we select the image processing algorithms which effectively represent the chosen BI-RADS lexicon values. Finally, the features obtained from the selected image processing algorithms are used to build our classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether each tumor is benign or malignant. Our experimental result shows that our classifier is accurate with fast execution time.

Features evolve, concepts drift, and novel classes are introduced. Therefore, any classification algorithm that intends to operate on streaming data must have mechanisms to mitigate the obsolescence of classifiers trained early in the stream. This is typically accomplished by either continually updating a monolithic model, or incrementally updating an ensemble. Traditional static data mining algorithms futile in a streaming context (and often in a distributed sensor network) due to their need to iterate over the entire data set locally. Our approach -- named HSMiner (Hierarchical Stream Miner) -- takes a hierarchical decomposition approach to the ensemble classifier concept. By breaking the classification problem into tiers, we can better prune the irrelevant features and counter individual classification error through weighted voting and boosting. In addition, the atomic decomposition of feature inputs enables straightforward mapping to distributing the ensemble among resources in the network. The implementation proves to be fast and very memory conservative, and we emulate a distributed environment via signal-linked threads. We examine the theoretical and empirical analysis of our approach, specifically examining trade-offs of three different novel class detection variations, and compare these results to a similar method using benchmark data sets.

Data Clustering: Integrating Different Distance Measures with Modified k-Means Algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT COMPUTING FOR PROBLEM SOLVING (SOCPROS 2011), VOL 2	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving (SocProS 2011)	DEC 20-22, 2011	Roorkee, INDIA	Roorkee Local Ctr, Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee Campus	Inst Engn	Cluster Analysis; Decimal Scaling; Distance Measures; Mk-Means Algorithm		Unsupervised learning is the process to partition the given data set into number of clusters where similar data objects belongs same cluster and dissimilar data objects belongs to another cluster, k-Means is the partition based unsupervised learning algorithm which is popular for its simplicity and ease of use. Yet, k-Means suffers from the major shortcoming of passing number of clusters and centroids in advance. Decimal scaling is one of the normalization approaches which standardize the features of the dataset and improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. Integrating different distance measures with modified k-Means algorithm help to select the proper distance measure for specific data mining application. This paper compare the results of modified k-Means with different distance measures like Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance, Cosine Measure Distance and the Decimal Scaling normalization approach. Result Analysis is taken on various datasets from UCI machine dataset repository and shows that Mk-Means is advantageous and improve the effectiveness with normalized approach and Minkowski distance measure.

In intrusion detection systems, feature selection plays an important role in a sense of improving classification performance and reducing the computational complexity. In this paper, we focus on improving identification of major network attacks like DoS, R2L and Probe using various feature selection techniques (IG, CHI2 and OCFS). This research work explored the possibility of employing a variety of classifiers, but limited to J48, Naive Bayes and AdaBoost. Empirical evaluations were completed based on a standard network intrusion data set (KDDCUP99). The Experimental results show that the feature selection approach gives considerable increase of performance in detecting network intrusions as compared to normal approach.

Since these multiple articles are domain specific and application centric therefore have similarity in contents and the relevant information is also repeated. Thus reading these all related articles completely one by one to get the latest research developments in the interested domain is time-consuming, unnecessary, irrelevant, cumbersome and impossible. These problems are solved by developing an innovative solution called Optimized Summary System (OSS) which optimizes and summarizes these articles using various Data Mining strategies such as extraction and clustering which identifies 'Research Relevant Novel' (RRN) terms and then categorizes article contents into various RRN categories. 'Maximal Marginal Relevance' (MMR) criteria is used for optimization and reducing redundancies. OSS presents short, condensed, accurate and most relevant summarized contents from multiple relevant research articles for research scholars who are the regular users of innovative authentic information.

A Novel Approach for Efficient Mining and Hiding of Sensitive Association Rule	3RD NIRMA UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING (NUICONE 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd Nirma-University International Conference on Engineering (NUiCONE)	DEC 06-08, 2012	Ahmedabad, INDIA	Nirma Univ, Nirma Univ, Inst Technol		Association rules; confidence; Data mining methods and Algorithm; Minimum Support Threshold (MST); Minimum Confidence Threshold (MCT); Rule hiding		Data mining is the process of analyzing large database to find useful patterns. The term pattern refers to the items which are frequently occurring in set of transaction. The frequent patterns are used to find association between sets of item. The efficiency of mining association rules and confidentiality of association rule is becoming one of important area of knowledge discovery in database. This paper is organized into two sections. In first part of paper an Improved Apriori algorithm is being presented that efficiently generates association rules. These reduces unnecessary database scan at time of forming frequent large itemsets. In second part of this paper we have tried to give contribution to improved apriori algorithm by hiding sensitive association rules which are generated by applying improved Apriori algorithm on supermarket database. In this paper we have used novel approach that strategically modifies few transactions in transaction database to decrease support and confidence of sensitive rule without producing any side effects. Thus in the paper we have efficiently generated frequent itemset sets by applying Improved Apriori algorithm and generated association rules by applying minimum support and minimum confidence and then we went one step further to identify sensitive rules and tried to hide them without any side effects to maintain integrity of data without generating spurious rules.

Existing methods typically require multiple passes over the data, rendering them unsuitable for streaming contexts. We present the first streaming algorithm for mining frequent episodes over a window of recent events in the stream. We derive approximation guarantees for our algorithm in terms of: (i) the separation of frequent episodes from infrequent ones, and (ii) the rate of change of stream characteristics. Our parameterization of the problem provides a new sweet spot in the tradeoff between making distributional assumptions over the stream and algorithmic efficiencies of mining. We illustrate how this yields significant benefits when mining practical streams from neuroscience and telecommunications logs.

The previous methods focused on ARM either from a certain dataset with different type attributes, or from a probabilistic dataset with only Boolean attributes. However, little work on ARM from a probabilistic dataset with coexistence of different type attributes has been mentioned. Such dataset is named Heterogeneous Probabilistic Dataset (HPD), which is prevalent in the real-world applications. This paper develops a generic framework to discover association rules from a HPD. Considering the different type data in the dataset, we first convert a HPD to a probabilistic dataset with fuzzy sets by fuzzification. A novel Shannon-like Entropy is then introduced to measure the information of an item with coexistence of fuzzy uncertainty hidden in different type data and random uncertainty in the transformed dataset. Based on this Shannon-like Entropy, Support and Confidence degrees for such multi-uncertain dataset are defined. Finally, we design an Apriori-like algorithm to mine association rules from a HPD using the above measures. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for HPD is feasible and effective.

Attribute-Based Subsequence Matching and Mining	2012 IEEE 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING (ICDE)	IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	28th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	APR 01-05, 2012	Washington, DC	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Microsoft, Natl Sci Fdn, EMC, Greenplum, HP, IBM Res, Google				Sequence analysis is very important in our daily life. Typically, each sequence is associated with an ordered list of elements. For example, in a movie rental application, a customer's movie rental record containing an ordered list of movies is a sequence example. Most studies about sequence analysis focus on subsequence matching which finds all sequences stored in the database such that a given query sequence is a subsequence of each of these sequences. In many applications, elements are associated with properties or attributes. For example, each movie is associated with some attributes like "Director" and "Actors". Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, all existing studies about sequence analysis do not consider the attributes of elements. In this paper, we propose two problems. The first problem is: given a query sequence and a set of sequences, considering the attributes of elements, we want to find all sequences which are matched by this query sequence. This problem is called attribute-based subsequence matching (ASM). All existing applications for the traditional subsequence matching problem can also be applied to our new problem provided that we are given the attributes of elements. We propose an efficient algorithm for problem ASM. The key idea to the efficiency of this algorithm is to compress each whole sequence with potentially many associated attributes into just a triplet of numbers. By dealing with these very compressed representations, we greatly speed up the attribute-based subsequence matching. The second problem is to find all frequent attribute-based subsequence. We also adapt an existing efficient algorithm for this second problem to show we can use the algorithm developed for the first problem. Empirical studies show that our algorithms are scalable in large datasets. In particular, our algorithms run at least an order of magnitude faster than a straightforward method in most cases. This work can stimulate a number of existing data mining problems which are fundamentally based on subsequence matching such as sequence classification, frequent sequence mining, motif detection and sequence matching in bioinformatics.

These smartphones include a large set of hardware capabilities and sensors which allow to improve the user interaction and content delivery. The sensors allow to gather extra information about the user situation and therefore to create location & context aware mobile apps. However, sensors usage involves energy consumption, which is also one of the smartphone's biggest limitations; in addition, these devices also have storage and memory constraints, and slow processors compared to a conventional computer. Recently, there is an emerging tendency consisting in lessen these limitations by implementing the complex computations and data storage in external entities such as cloud computing. This article presents the fundamentals for developing an energy-aware middleware for the support of context & location aware mobile apps with cloud computing interaction. This middleware can increase up to three times the smartphone battery performance when using the GPS receiver, and in the cloud can perform the extraction of places of interest from a list of GPS fixes uploaded by the smartphone.

The paper aims at developing an appropriate data mining methodology to extract knowledge about the characteristics of diseases by analyzing the images acquired from the field. Since all features are not equally involved in classifying diseases; selection of optimum features is a challenging task to address the problem. The work is performed in three steps. Firstly, thirty six features of different category are extracted from the diseased plant images using image processing techniques. Then, images with respect to each attribute are clustered by k-means algorithm where k is the number of class labels of the diseases. Cluster validity indices are computed using the proposed and existing techniques. Finally, all the computed indices are fused and based on that score of the attributes is calculated. The attributes having scores greater than average score are considered as optimal feature set. With the reduced feature set, classification accuracy is calculated by applying the proposed method on four hundred fifty infected rice plant images and compared with other classifiers demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed model.

First it provides support for the whole data-mining process. Second it pries open the so called algorithm black-box approach where algorithms and work flows also have descriptors. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data-mining work flows we are faced with a problem the nature of which is much more similar to those appearing in recommendation systems. In order to account for the meta-mining specificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our method learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the work flow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All learned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow preference matrix. The latter is constructed from the performance results obtained by the application of workflows to datasets. We demonstrate our method on meta-mining over biological (microarray datasets) problems. The application of our method is not limited to the meta-mining problem, its formulation is general enough so that it can be applied on problems with similar requirements.

Our analysis, inspired by [1] [2], goes beyond conventional Hadoop Job-Tracker analysis by integrating more data and providing web browser visualization tools.

Software reuse has been a solution factor to acquire the existing knowledge from software repository. To extract existing knowledge from software repository data mining can be used. Data mining is the process of extracting useful patterns and analyzing enormous data sets from large data. This paper gives the description of software reuse process, knowledge discovery process and software metrics for object oriented programming language are identified. Software metrics are used as quantitative measure to determine, assess, evaluating the software components. Mapping is done, for different data mining techniques which can be used for software reusability process using different software metrics. We have prepared 167 instances data sets from open source projects. Data mining techniques is used for evaluating the software components. There is gap between the need of useful data from software repository to software project management practices. To bridge this gap we are applying data mining techniques efficiently and effectively to extract useful knowledge from software repository using different software metrics. Finally, this knowledge can be used by project managers for better management of the software projects. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This develops a vast importance in research field for providing better clustering technique. There are several techniques exists for clustering the similar kind of data. But only very few techniques exists for clustering mixed data items. The cluster must be such that the similarity of items within the clusters is increased and the similarity of items from different clusters must be reduced. The existing techniques possess several disadvantages. To overcome those drawbacks, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Extended Attribute-Oriented Induction (EAOI) for clustering mixed data type data can be used. This will take more time for clustering: the usage of SOM has the inability to capture the inherent hierarchical structure of data. To overcome this, a Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM) is proposed in this paper. The experimentation is done by using UCI Adult Data Set.	[Prasad, D.

An Efficient Programming Rule Extraction and Detection of Violations in Software Source Code using Neural networks	2012 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING (ICOAC)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)	DEC 13-15, 2012	Chennai, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE Madras Sect, Anna Univ, P.S.R Engn Coll, Natl Engn Coll, Rajalakshmi Engn Coll, Easwari Engn Coll, GKM Engn Coll, Tagore Engn Coll	Anna Univ, MIT Campus, Dept Comp Technol	Defect Detection; Data Mining; Programming Rule; Neural Networks Association Rules; Decision Trees		The larger size and complexity of software source code builds many challenges in bug detection. Data mining based bug detection methods eliminate the bugs present in software source code effectively. Rule violation and copy paste related defects are the most concerns for bug detection system. Traditional data mining approaches such as frequent Itemset mining and frequent sequence mining are relatively good but they are lacking in accuracy and pattern recognition. Neural networks have emerged as advanced data mining tools in cases where other techniques may not produce satisfactory predictive models. The neural network is trained for possible set of errors that could be present in software source code. From the training data the neural network learns how to predict the correct output. The processing elements of neural networks are associated with weights which are adjusted during the training period.

Performance Evaluation of Semantic Based and Ontology Based Text Document Clustering Techniques	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Dataming; Document clustering; HSTC; Feature Selection; TCFSmethod		The amount of digital information is created and used is steadily growing along with the development of sophisticated hardware and software. This has increased the need for powerful algorithms that can interpret and extract interesting knowledge from these data. Data mining is a technique that has been successfully exploited for this purpose. Text mining, a category of data mining, considers only digital documents or text. Text Clustering is the process of grouping text or documents such that the document in the same cluster are similar and are dissimilar from the one in other clusters. This paper studies the working of two sophisticated algorithms. The first work is a hybrid method that combines pattern recognition process with semantic driven methods for clustering documents, while the second uses an ontology-based approach to cluster documents. Through experiments, the performance of both the selected algorithms is analyzed in terms of clustering efficiency and speed of clustering. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Term Discrimination Values (TDVs) are better measures compared to frequency or term weights to select the keywords. Terms with high TDVs will generate good keywords. Hamdouchi, P. Willet and Carolyn J Crouch have developed various algorithms to generate TDVs. In earlier days frequency or weighted frequency was used to compute TDVs. But these simple or weighted frequencies are not enough for retrieving relevant documents. Here we use some new features, connected with the distribution of terms within the document, called distributional features, to compute the TDVs. Distributional features such as First Appearance, Last Appearance, Compactness on number of parts, distance between first and last occurrence and on variance of positions of term occurrences etc. are pointers to the importance of the term in a document. Experiments have shown that combination of various features give much improved results than individual features in the case of Text Categorization. Through this work we also could prove that it is correct in the case of generating keywords. An additional overhead in storage and time is compensated by this efficient output. This work will add a narrow light towards text document search in education for both teaching and research.	[Pushpalatha, K.

MapReduce not only can be used as an ETL tool, it can do even much more. The technique has been applied to SQL summation, OLAP, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, multimedia data processing, science data processing etc. Basically MapReduce is a general purpose parallel computing framework for large dataset processing. A big data analytics ecosystem built around MapReduce is emerging alongside the traditional one built around RDBMS. The objectives of RDBMS and MapReduce, as well as the ecosystems built around them, overlap much really, in some sense they do the same thing and MapReduce can accomplish more works, such as graph processing, which RDBMS can not handle well. RBDMS enjoys high performance of relational data processing, which MapReduce needs to catch up. The authors envision that the two techniques are fusing into a unified system for big data analytics. With the ongoing endeavor to build up the system, much of the groundwork has been laid while some critical issues are still unresolved, we try to identify some of them. Two of our works as well as experiment results are presented, one is applying a hierarchical encoding to star schema data in Hadoop for high performance of OLAP processing, another is leveraging the natural three copies of HDFS blocks to exploit different data layouts to speed up queries in a OLAP workload, a cost model is used to route user queries to different data layouts.

As a result, the demand of discovering knowledge from the bigdata by using tools such as statistical analysis and data mining become higher. Using MapReduce a software framework introduced by Google in 2004 to implement computations on clusters of commodity computers is an economical solution. However, malicious MapReduce framework or source codes can leak the sensitive data through computation process. Giving user the least privilege on MapReduce-based system can solve the problem. Therefore, in our research, we propose a MapReduce-based computational system limiting the access to system resource by using RBAC and TE. Moreover, noise were added to the output of the Reduce to ensure the computational result can not signal the presence of a sensitive data.

When dealing with interrelated data that does not have any attributes and is represented in the form of nodes and their relationships, this task is also referred to as community mining. There has been a considerable number of approaches proposed in recent years for mining communities in a given network. But little work has been done on how to evaluate community mining results. The common practice is to use an agreement measure to compare the mining result against a ground truth, however, the ground truth is not known in most of the real world applications. In this paper, we investigate relative clustering quality measures defined for evaluation of clustering data points with attributes and propose proper adaptations to make them applicable in the context of social networks. Not only these relative criteria could be used as metrics for evaluating quality of the groupings but also they could be used as objectives for designing new community mining algorithms.

The sensors attached to the robots send multimodal time series data about the disaster environments which can be analyzed to extract useful information about the environment in which the robots are deployed. A set of data mining tasks that effectively cluster various robotic environments have been investigated. The effectiveness of these data mining techniques have been demonstrated using an available robotic dataset.

We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor. To obtain precisely labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns. For generalization, the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies. Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm performs as well as non-expert humans.

This is due to the huge numbers of students required to attend university colleges every year. The proposed HRSPCA system consists of two cascaded hybrid recommenders working together with the help of college predictor, for achieving high performance. The first recommender assigns student's tracks for preparatory year students. While the second recommender assigns the specialized college for students who passed the preparatory year exams successfully. The college predictor algorithm uses historical colleges GPA students admission data for predicting most probable colleges. The system analyzes student academic merits, background, student records, and the college admission criteria. Then, it predicts the likelihood university college that a student may enter. A prototype system is implemented and tested with live data available in the On Demand University Services (OPUS) database resources, at King Abdulaziz University (KAU). In addition to the high prediction accuracy rate, flexibility is an advantage, as the system can predict suitable colleges that match the students' profiles and the suitable track channels through which the students are advised to enter. The system is adaptive, since it can be tuned up with other decision makers attributes performing trusted needed tasks faster and fairly.

Even though a lot of research work is progressing in this area to transform efficient centralized mining models to work on horizontal and vertical partitioned databases there is lack of associative classification model that can perform classification on vertically partitioned databases. In order to overcome such needs this paper proposes an associative classification model on vertically partitioned databases.

Comparative Study of Association Rule Mining and MiSTIC in Extracting Spatio-Temporal Disease Occurrences Patterns	12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING WORKSHOPS (ICDMW 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)	DEC 10-13, 2012	Brussels, BELGIUM	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), FWO, IBM, SAS, Yahoo, NASA, Biside, KNIME, Univ Antwerpen, Univ Libre Bruxelles (ULB)		Association Rule Mining; MiSTIC; Spatio-temporal Mining; Epidemiology; Pattern extraction	DISCOVERY; RISK	Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatio-temporal datasets is more difficult than extracting the corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types and the embedded topologies, spatial and temporal relationships, and spatial autocorrelation. The objective of epidemiology is to identify disease causes and correlating them to spatially explicit disease patterns and variations in health risks. The main issue in traditional mining of association rules in disease surveillance data is that a large number of rules are discovered, but most of them are of limited use in addressing the stated objectives or original questions asked. Moreover, not all of the generated rules are interesting (due to their inability to conclusively mine spatio-temporal prevalence and causative factors of diseases), and some rules may be ignored. These drawbacks result as these methods ignore the inherent spatio-temporal dependency in such data. This paper makes a case for the use of MiSTIC algorithm to address these issues, compare the use of traditional association rule mining in context of Salmonellosis disease management, and share new insights. An illustrative case study presented here suggests that in comparison to traditional association rule mining, even simple spatio-temporal data mining approaches taking into consideration the spatio-temporal interdependencies in disease data, can provide new and valuable scientific insights towards efficient disease surveillance and management.

Data cleansing tasks include imputation of missing values, and identification and correction of incorrect/noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel approach called Co-appearance based Analysis for Incorrect Records and Attribute-values Detection (CAIRAD). For a data set having incorrect/noisy values CAIRAD separates the noisy records from the clean records. It thereby produces two data sets; a clean data set and a data set having all noisy records. It also reports noisy attribute values of each noisy record. We evaluate CAIRAD on four publicly available natural data sets by comparing its performance with the performance of two high quality existing techniques namely RDCL and EDIR. We use various patterns (of noisy values) each having different noise levels. Several evaluation criteria such as error recall (ER), error precision (ER), F-measure, record removal ratio (rRR), and area under a receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) are used. Our experimental results indicate that CAIRAD performs significantly better (based on t-test analysis) than RDCL and EDIR.	[Rahman, Md. Geaur; Islam, Md.

Effective sanitization approaches to hide sensitive utility and frequent itemsets	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Utility and frequent itemset; privacy preserving data mining; utility mining; sanitization	ASSOCIATION RULES; PRIVACY; ALGORITHMS; DISTORTION; DISCOVERY; ANONYMITY; PATTERNS	Privacy preserving data mining is a vibrant area in data mining. The sharing of data between the organizations is found to be beneficial for business growth. However, privacy policies and threats prevent the data owners from sharing the data for mining. The current data sanitization approaches focus on hiding either frequent itemsets or utility itemsets separately. This paper proposes to study the problem of hiding the sensitive utility and frequent itemsets. To resolve this problem, two effective data sanitization algorithms MSMU and MCRSU are presented to hide the sensitive utility and frequent itemsets in the modified database. While hiding the sensitive itemsets, the algorithms sanitize the database with minimum impact on the non-sensitive itemsets. To accomplish this, MSMU is devised to identify the victim items with minimum support and maximum utility whereas MCRSU uses conflict ratio. Results from the computational experiments on the synthetic and real datasets indicate that MCRSU algorithm is more effective than MSMU in minimizing the non-sensitive itemsets affected as well as maintaining data quality in the sanitized database.

The sensitive data is intended to share between only authorized persons, not for all. The collection and sharing of person specific sensitive data for data mining raise serious concerns about the privacy of individuals. Privacy preserving data mining also concentrate on sensitive knowledge pattern that can be exposed when mining the data. Therefore. researchers. for a long time period, have been investigating paths to provide privacy for sensitive data in data mining analysis task process. So, many techniques have been introduced on privacy preserving issues in data mining by using equivalence operator. In this paper we proposed an effective and efficient approach based on Chinease remainder theorem (CRT) that uses congruence operator to provide privacy of sensitive data in the transformation of extracted data mining analysis from servers to clients.

Fuzzy association rule is used to solve the high dimensional problem by allowing partial memberships to each different set. It suffers from exponential growth of search space, when the number of patterns and/or variables becomes high. This increased search space results in high space complexity.

Frequent item set originates from association rule mining that uses to find association rules of items in large transactional database. Many existing algorithm to mine for the frequent itemset from static transaction database that is definite known and precise. In this paper we conducted a study on uncertain data and fuzzy association rule mining approach. The main contribution of this paper is three manifolds. First we presented a review on existing method for finding frequent patterns form uncertain data. Second a new approach is proposed for finding frequent patterns from uncertain data, and third, the experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed approach for uncertain data. In this approach we have used fuzzy concept and originate the frequent patterns. The experimental results from the survey demonstrate that this proposed approach for valuable frequent pattern set the influential uncertain data mining.	[Rajput, D. S.; Thakur, R. S.; Thakur, G.

This research work aims to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning techniques on predicting defective software through data mining algorithms. This paper places emphasis on the performance of classification algorithms in categorizing seven datasets (CM1, JM1, MW1, KC3, PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4) under two classes namely Defective and Normal. In this study, publicly available data sets from different organizations are used. This permitted us to explore the impact of data from different sources on different processes for finding appropriate classification models. We propose a computational framework using data mining techniques to detect the existence of defects in software components. The framework comprises of data pre-processing, data classification and classifier evaluation. In this paper; we report the performance of twenty classification algorithms on seven publicly available datasets from the NASA MDP Repository. Random Tree Classification algorithm produced 100 percent accuracy in classifying the datasets and hence the features selected by this technique were considered to be the most significant features. The results were validated with suitable test data.	[Ramani, R.

Diabetic Retinopathy, a retinal disease is the major cause of blindness. Early detection can help in treatment but regular screening for early detection has been a highly labor - and resource- intensive task. Hence automatic detection of the diseases through computational techniques would be a great social cause. In this paper, the classifiers used for the automatic detection of the disease are evaluated using the data mining methods. The prediction accuracy of all the classifiers, evaluated using various evaluation methods is presented. Our results show that a training accuracy of 100% can be achieved by a few classifiers and a prediction accuracy of 76.67%.	[Ramani, R.

Existing algorithms detects contiguous exact and approximate patterns by restricting the user in pattern length. Though many algorithms have been solved for the related problem with poor scalability, time inefficiency, some algorithms have extracted only non-contiguous exact patterns without noise in adapting to other applications. In this paper, Constraint Frequent Motif Detection (CFMD) an algorithm is used in extracting both contiguous, non-contiguous patterns of short or long sequences of any length in biological database. CFMD combines data mining techniques such as TRIE like Frequent Pattern (FP-Tree) in constructing the patterns in such a way that most commonly occurring patterns from root to leaf node, Constraints to restrict the growth of FP-Tree and to reduce the search space of the FP-Tree. The efficiency of the proposed CFMD is fast, scalable to extract patterns from both contiguous and non-contiguous sequences. The performance of the proposed approach is proved using both real and synthetic datasets.

Recent theoretical results establish the ability of such data models to recover the true underlying low-rank matrix when a large portion of the measured matrix is either missing or arbitrarily corrupted. However, if low rank is not a hypothesis about the true nature of the data, but a device for extracting regularity from it, no current guidelines exist for choosing the rank of the estimated matrix. In this work we address this problem by means of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle - a well established information-theoretic approach to statistical inference - as a guideline for selecting a model for the data at hand. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our formal approach with results for complex background extraction in video sequences.

These methods are intended to be used in a smart grid environment to extract useful knowledge about customer's behaviour. The obtained knowledge can be used to support a decision tool, not only for utilities but also for consumers. Load profiles can be used by the utilities to identify the aspects that cause system load peaks and enable the development of specific contracts with their customers. The framework presented throughout the paper consists in several steps, namely the pre-processing data phase, clustering algorithms application and the evaluation of the quality of the partition, which is supported by cluster validity indices.

In the last decade, World Wide Web emerged as an all encompassing technology that is revolutionizing the way people live. With the passage of time, user behaviors evolve and as such should be the recommendations provided. There exists a wide gap in literature to cater effectively with the issue of temporal evolution of data on the internet. This paper will specifically analyze various ways through which temporal issue can be handled in generating user profile that evolve with time. It will develop a recommendation model to handle the dynamics in user profile. The prime focal point is to examine if recommendation accuracy can be improved by adding temporal dimension. An empirical study is carried out to compare the analysis of the traditional data mining tasks and the proposed method.

SVMs were originally developed for solving binary classification problems, but binary SVMs have also been extended to solve the problem of multi-class pattern classification. There are different techniques employed by SVMs to tackle multi-class problems, namely one-versus-one (OVO), one-versus-all (OVA), and directed acyclic graph (DAG). When dealing with multi-class classification, one needs an appropriate technique to effectively extend these binary classification methods for multi-class classification. We address this issue by extending a novel architecture that we refer to as unbalanced decision tree (UDT). UDT is a binary decision tree arranged in a top-down manner, using the optimal margin classifier at each split to relieve the excessive time in classifying the test data when compared with the DAG-SVMs. The initial version of the UDT required a longer training time in finding the optimal model for each decision node of the tree. In this work, we have drastically reduced the excessive training time by finding the order of classifiers based on their performances during the selection of the root node and fix this order to form the hierarchy of the decision tree. UDT involves fewer classifiers than OVO, OVA and DAG -SVMs, while maintaining accuracy comparable to those standard techniques.

It aims at finding if a partial or full pattern has a cyclic repetition in the considered time series or data sequence. Periodicity is found in large number of datasets including meteorological data, transaction count, computer network traffic, power consumption, sunspots, Electrocardiography (ECG), biological sequences such as DNA and protein [33]. Periodic pattern analysis not only helps in understanding the behavior of the data but also contributes in predicting the future trends of the data. There are several algorithms reported in the literature for periodicity detection in time series and biological sequences [3,34] but none of these algorithms discuss the non-uniformly sampled data. General assumption in the time series and sequence data is that the consecutive data values are sampled at regular or uniform interval of time. But this assumption hardly holds in real datasets; for example the stock market data analyzed in this paper record various features for each working day. This data has a quite a few missing values for weekly and arbitrary holidays. Although handling this issue is not very complex but requires careful handling. In this paper we analyze the stock market data in detail and show how the periodic pattern analysis may provide the understanding of the data to predict the future trends. Our experimental results show that consideration of missing values in stock market data results in much larger number of interesting results than the trivial periodicity detection approach ignoring the missing values.

With advent of cloud computing technologies, firms are able to concentrate on their core activities while outsourcing the entire technology related supporting processes. This approach has been adopted by many firms which have resulted in lowering operational cost without losing focus on customer needs. However, the adoption has not been high among small and medium enterprises. This paper, through preliminary survey, finds out different situations for adopting cloud computing services. It was found that SMEs can benefit the most if they extend the adoption of cloud services for computation intensive jobs like data mining, modeling and simulation. The regular advantages for SMEs have been re-established such as lowering investment in hardware, more efficient use of computing systems in existing data centers, easier scale-up of the applications and services, cost saving on technology infrastructure and faster software upgrades without much expense. The results can be used by SMEs as decision point for adopting cloud services.

By making its public stream available through a set of APIs Twitter has triggered a wave of research initiatives aimed at analysis and knowledge discovery from the data about its users and their messaging activities. While most of the projects and tools are tailored towards solving specific tasks, we pursue a goal of providing an application-independent and universal analytical platform for supporting any kind of analysis and knowledge discovery. We employ the well established data warehousing technology with its underlying multidimensional data model, ETL routine for loading and consolidating data from different sources, OLAP functionality for exploring the data and data mining tools for more sophisticated analysis. In this work we describe the process of transforming the original stream into a set of related multidimensional cubes and demonstrate how the resulting data warehouse can be used for solving a variety of analytical tasks. We expect our proposed approach to be applicable for analyzing the data of other social networks as well.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. In this paper, we have implemented I-Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and I-PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm to detect time interval denial of service (DoS) attack sequences on network traffic data of KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners. The comparison study is done on the number of patterns and on the average length of patterns obtained by varying the time interval of the sequential patterns.

Over the past decade, a lot of research has been reported on Decision Support Systems (DSS) used in many fields. To improve the decision-making ability of an enterprise in construction management, information technology is being applied in each step of construction management. The problem is to organize and analyze the data in construction management to obtain quick analysis and decision support results. Various Data mining techniques have been used for clustering of data by using case examples. In this research we have applied Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to classify projects in one of the given categories and conducted a comparative analysis by using standard algorithm. A number of case examples have been used to verify the results and to obtain a comparison between various methodologies.

Still, most of the existing research has been focused on classification problems. In this paper we address a related problem. There are many relevant domains (e. g. ecological, meteorological, finance) where decisions are based on the forecast of a numeric quantity (i.e. the result of a regression model). The goal of the work on this paper is to present an evaluation framework for applications where the numeric outcome of a regression model may lead to different costs/benefits as a consequence of the actions it entails. The new metric provides a more informed estimate of the utility of any regression model, given the application-specific preference biases, and hence makes more reliable the comparison and selection between alternative regression models. We illustrate the objective of our evaluation methodology on a real-life application and also carry a set of experiments over a subset of our target regression tasks: the prediction of rare and extreme values. Results show the effectiveness of our proposed utility metric for identifying the models that perform better on this type of applications.

It can be used as its own in Data Mining problems or as the core of a classification system based on a Granular Computing approach to represent sequences in a suited embedding space. By adopting an inexact sequence matching procedure, the algorithm is able to extract a symbols alphabet of frequent subsequences to be used as prototypes for the embedding stage. Experimental evaluation over both synthetically generated and biological datasets confirms that the modeling system is able to synthesize effective models when facing even complex and noisy problems defined by frequency-based classification rules.

However, nowadays data is being produced in streaming fashion and distributed locations, turning most classical methods obsolete. This thesis addresses two different clustering problems in ubiquitous and streaming scenarios, presenting evidence of the advantages produced by applying distributed and streaming machine learning algorithms, and proposing new ones to solve the addressed problems.

There is a wide range of imaging, visualization, and graphics systems, ranging from fully automatic systems that extract features algorithmically to interactive systems that allow the analyst to manipulate visual representations directly to discover features. Although automatic feature-extraction algorithms are often directed by human observation, and human pattern recognition is often supported by algorithmic tools, very little work has been done to explore how to capitalize on the interaction between human and machine pattern recognition. This paper introduces a preliminary roadmap for guiding research in this space. One key concept is the explicit consideration of the task, which determines which methods and tools will be most effective. The second is the explicit inclusion of a "human-in-the-loop," who interacts with the data, the algorithms, and representations, to identify meaningful features. The third is the inclusion of a process for creating a mathematical representation of the features that have been "carved out" by the human analyst, for use in comparison, database query or analysis.

The efficiency of application such new tools depends from business rules development technology. The new generation of EIS software requires not only deployment strategy, but also tools for extracting business rules from description of existing practice. Along with manual business rules extraction from mountains of documents there exists the possibility to apply data mining technology based on formal concept analysis. In this paper we are presenting, how supplier and customers data, being accumulated in data base, may be used in CRM system for fitting services and relations to customer and supplier profile.

Many advances and approaches have been introduced in the field of speech quality during the last decade, most of them focusing on the IP networks, where the speech quality is influenced by every single network node through which the communication passes. This paper focuses on the cellular network environment, through perceptual analysis of the speech sample using the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality algorithm we found a bond between the speech quality in GSM networks and current weather conditions. We have obtained both meteorological data and Mean Opinion Score value specifying the current speech quality in the GSM networks and by utilization of highly advanced techniques in data mining and data analysis, our team found out the correlation between current rain density and the speech quality.

IMAGE MINING: A NEW APPROACH FOR DATA MINING BASED ON TEXTURE	2012 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICCCT)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)	NOV 23-25, 2012	Allahabad, INDIA	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Commun Soc, Comp Soc USA, Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol		visiual content; features extraction; Histrogram; similarity measures; TBIR(Texture Based Image Retrieval); energy; entropy; contrast; image database		Image data mining can be done manually by slicing and dicing the data until a pattern becomes obvious. Or, it can be done with programs that analyse the data automatically. Colour, texture and shape of an image have been primitive image descriptors in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system. Primitive features of an image used to identify and retrieve closely matched images from an image database. It is very difficult to extract images manually from image database because they are very large. This paper presents a novel framework for texture information of an image and achieves higher retrieval efficiency than the shape features of an image. There is a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The trade-off decreases as more efficient algorithm is used to solve the problem and increases the computational power and will decreases the cost of the whole system as well.

Thus, ensemble of classifiers has emerged as one of the hot topics in multiclass classification tasks for imbalance problem for data mining and machine learning domain. Ensemble learning is an effective technique that has increasingly been adopted to combine multiple learning algorithms to improve overall prediction accuraciesand may outperform any single sophisticated classifiers. In this paper, an ensemble learner called a Direct Ensemble Classifier for Imbalanced Multiclass Learning (DECIML) that combines simple nearest neighbour and Naive Bayes algorithms is proposed. A combiner method called OR-tree is used to combine the decisions obtained from the ensemble classifiers. The DECIML framework has been tested with several benchmark dataset and shows promising results.

To efficiently detect IBMA, we propose to use clustering social bookmark user accounts according to the similarity with respect to the bookmarked web resources or web sites. Specifically, we cluster users who create bookmarks linking to similar set of web resources or web sites. For this, we propose three similarity measurements over two sets of bookmarks. We experimentally show that the proposed scheme successfully detects IBMA spammers in a real dataset. We also evaluate the accuracy of the proposed scheme with varying the similarity measurements, and characterize them.

Also, we introduce a fusion at classification level between these classifiers to get the most suitable multi-classifier approach for each data set. The experimental results show that in the classification using fusion of MLP and J48 with the PCA is superior to the other classifiers using WBC data set. The PCA is used in WBC dataset as a features reduction transformation method in which combines a set of correlated features. The selected attributes are: Uniformity of Cell Size, Mitoses, Clump thickness, Bare Nuclei, Single Epithelial cell size, Marginal adhesion, Bland Chromatin and Class. In WDBC data set the results show that the classification using SMO only or using fusion of SMO and MLP or SMO and IBK is superior to the other classifiers. In WPBC data set the results show that the classification using fusion of MLP, J48, SMO and IBK is superior to the other classifiers. All experiments are conducted in WEKA data mining tool.

This paper presents a new method for automatic detection of frauds in credit card transactions based on non-linear signal processing. The proposed method consists of the following stages: feature extraction, training and classification, decision fusion, and result presentation. Discriminant-based classifiers and an advanced non-Gaussian mixture classification method are employed to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The posterior probabilities produced by classifiers are fused by means of order statistical digital filters. Results from data mining of a large database of real transactions are presented. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated for several datasets using parameters derived from receiver characteristic operating analysis and key performance indicators of the business.

High Performance CUDA-based Implementation for the 2D Version of the Maximum Subarray Problem (MSP)	2012 CAIRO INTERNATIONAL BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (CIBEC)	Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC)	DEC 20-22, 2012	Cairo, EGYPT			Maximum Subarray; Prefix Sum; GPU Implementation; CUDA; Speedup		The Maximum Subarray Problem (MSP) finds a segment of an array that has the maximum summation over all the other possible combinations. Different applications for this problem exist in various fields like genomic sequence analysis, data mining and computer vision. Several optimum linear-time solutions exist for the 1D version, however, the known upper bounds for the 2D version are cubic or near-cubic time; which makes it a problem of high complexity. In this work, a stage by stage high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based implementation for solving the 2D version of the problem in a linear time relying on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology is presented. It achieves more than 7X of speed-up in performance compared to a single-threaded sequential implementation on the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for an array of size 512(2).

The accuracy (averaged over several benchmarking data sets used in this study) of an approximating (hyper) surface to the data points over a given high-dimensional input space created by a nonlinear multiclass classifier is slightly superior to the solution obtained by regression (hyper) surface. In terms of the CPU time needed for training i.e., for tuning the hyperparameters of the models, the nonlinear classifier shows significant (order of magnitudes for large datasets) advantages too. Here, the support vector machine (SVM) has been solving given regression problems as a classic SVM regressor and as the SVM classifier. In order to transform a regression problem into a classification task two possible discretizations of a continuous output (target) vector y are presented and compared. A very strict double (nested) cross-validation technique has been used for measuring performances of regression and multiclass classification SVMs. A novel approach and the experimental results obtained for five benchmarking regression data sets warrant both further theoretical investigations and broad application in practice.

At the same time, students who have not performed at the highest level at the G. C. E. O'level examination, have performed well at the A'level examination under some other subject streams. Therefore the stream selected for the G. C. E. A'level is a critical factor that determines a student's future. The failure rate for those in the Physical Science stream is the highest amongst the four streams, and at present there is no mechanism available to address this issue. Thus this study focuses on analyzing the factors that contribute to the high failure rate of the Physical Science stream students at the G. C. E. A'level examination using data mining techniques. In addition, a method of identifying the students, suitable to follow the Physical Science stream is presented. This is done by comparing the A'level results with the corresponding O'level results. The analysis reveals the direct impact of a student's performance in Science and Mathematics at the O'level examination on his performance at the A'level examination. The analysis also highlights the fact that a student must obtain the highest grade for both Mathematics and Science in order to succeed at the G. C. E. A'level. It also reveals that a student who wishes to study in the Physical Science stream must also perform well in Religion, Social Studies, First Language and the Technical subject at O'level examination. The impact of the results of O'level subjects to the A'level result under Physical Science has also been prioritized.	[Samaranayake, C.

Temporal association rule mining for the preventive diagnosis of onboard subsystems within floating train data framework	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK				SENSOR DATA; PATTERNS; SEQUENCES	The increasing interest in preventive maintenance strategies for railway transportation systems and the emergence of telecommunication technologies have both led to the development of floating train data (FTD) systems. Commercial trains are being equipped with both positioning and communications systems as well as onboard intelligent sensors monitoring various subsystems all over the train. The sizable collected amounts of real-time spatio-temporal data can be used to leverage the development of innovative diagnosis methodologies based on temporal and sequential data mining. This paper presents a temporal association rule mining approach named T-patterns, applied on highly challenging floating train data. The aim is to discover temporal associations between pairs of timestamped alarms, called events, that can predict the occurrence of severe failures within a complex bursty environment. Experiments carried out on Alstom's TrainTracer (TM) data show promising results.

J	Sang, YP; Shen, H; Tian, H				Sang, Yingpeng; Shen, Hong; Tian, Hui			Effective Reconstruction of Data Perturbed by Random Projections	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; data perturbation; data reconstruction; underdetermined independent component analysis; Maximum A Posteriori; principal component analysis	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; ASSOCIATION RULES; PRIVACY; SPARSE; DECOMPOSITION	Random Projection (RP) has raised great concern among the research community of privacy-preserving data mining, due to its high efficiency and utility, e. g., keeping the euclidean distances among the data points. It was shown in [ 33] that, if the original data set composed of m attributes is multiplied by a mixing matrix of k x m(m > k) which is random and orthogonal on expectation, then the k series of perturbed data can be released for mining purposes. Given the data perturbed by RP and some necessary prior knowledge, to our knowledge, little work has been done in reconstructing the original data to recover some sensitive information. In this paper, we choose several typical scenarios in data mining with different assumptions on prior knowledge. For the cases that an attacker has full or zero knowledge of the mixing matrix R, respectively, we propose reconstruction methods based on Underdetermined Independent Component Analysis (UICA) if the attributes of the original data are mutually independent and sparse, and propose reconstruction methods based on Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) if the attributes of the original data are correlated and nonsparse. Simulation results show that our reconstructions achieve high recovery rates, and outperform the reconstructions based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Successful reconstructions essentially mean the leakage of privacy, so our work identify the possible risks of RP when it is used for data perturbations.

An information table has been presented in this article which consists of various factors like appearance, qualification, experience and communication skills to evaluate a candidate for recruitment. Depending upon the granularity of knowledge obtained from the information table, the concept of rough set has been applied to generate fuzzy decision rules which in turns form the eligibility criteria for the candidates appearing in the interview for recruitment. The experts in the interview committee have stated their opinion about the candidates linguistically. A relationship has been established between the eligibility criteria required for the job and the expert opinions about the candidates appeared in the interview using a fuzzy subset representation. The index of fuzziness of various experts' opinion are measured and compared. A candidate with higher grade of merit has been selected using fuzzy distance approach.

Our system's pipeline begins with the application of a novel heuristic algorithm for extracting variable length, semantically meaningful system call sequences from malware system call behavior logs. Then, based on the occurrence of these semantic sequences, we construct a Boolean vector representation of the malware sample corpus. Finally we compute Jaccard indices pairwise over sample vectors to obtain a sample similarity matrix. Our graphical user interface links two visualizations within an interactive display. Our first view is a map-like visualization of similarity among the samples based on a reduced dimensional projection of our similarity matrix. Our second view provides insight into similarities and differences between selected malware samples in terms of the system call sequences they share. We also provide a set of interactive filters based on malicious behavioral traits. The integration of these views into an interactive, linked display allows users to comprehend the overall similarity structure of a malware corpus, inspect how behavioral traits distribute over the corpus, and to drill in to inspect local similarities and differences between samples.			josh.saxe@invincea.com; david.mentis@invincea.com; chris.greamo@invincea.com					A.-T.

This paper proposes a method of predicting sensor values based on its historical data captured as time series. Main forecasting techniques such as linear regression, moving average, autoregressive integrated moving average; and exponential smoothing were used to predict the value of failed sensors. A comparison of the models based on their mean squared error is presented in order to simplify the selection of forecasting models.

We are paying attention to FISH analysis of chromosomal uploidies - the deviations from chromosomal number. Such analysis is based on evaluation of up to several hundreds of microscopic images. Computer support for this process includes using methods of image processing and data mining. In this paper, we focus on the image processing part in more detail: first, the properties of FISH images are reviewed, then, the processing flow is outlined. Our aim is to find the interphase and metaphase nuclei and the hybridization signals contained in the image. A simple method using the raw and central moments of detected objects as measures to distinguish between the two types of nuclei is proposed.

Since this kind of data recorded by sensors on river basins is highly scarce and hopefully much unbalanced between cases of floods and non-floods, we have adopted the notion of aggregate variables which values are computed as aggregates on raw data. An evolutionary algorithm is involved to allow selecting the best sets - juries of classifiers-of such variables as predictive variables. Two real hydrological data sets are trained and they both show the efficiency of the method compared to traditional solutions for prediction.

One of these is distance learning technologies. Due to limitations of traditional learning-teaching methods in classroom activities and practitioners who intend to conduct training activities in the absence of the possibility of communication and interaction among learners with special education units are prepared and provided a wide range of media center through a certain method of teaching. According to a further recognition of Distance Education, although far away from each other with the student who teaches the same time (synchronous) or different time (asynchronous) communications with a tool as training system established. The aim of this study is to compare the achievements of Computer Engineering Department students in Karabuk University according to criteria such as age, gender, type of high school graduation and whether the students studying in distance education or regular education using data mining techniques. Also discussing the differences of the techniques according to the results and to make suggestions for which technique would be more effective. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biclustering consists in extracting genes that behave similarly under some experimental conditions. As the Biclustering problem is NP-Complete in most of its variants, many heuristics and metaheuristics have been deisgned to solve it. Proposed algorithms in literature allow the extraction of interesting biclusters but are often time consuming. In this work, we propose a new parallel hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic based on the well known multi objective metaheuristic NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), CC (Cheng and Church) heuristic and a multi-objective local search, PLS-1 (Pareto Local Search I). Experimental results on real data sets show that our approach can find significant biclusters of high quality. The speed-up of our algorithm is important with regard to the sequential version.

To measure the acquisition of the knowledge covered by the activity and also to determine the effectiveness of the activity itself. The increasing adoption of new technologies is promoting the use of new types of activities in schools, like educational video games that in some cases are developed by the teachers themselves. In this kind of activity, interactivity increases compared to traditional activities (e. g. reading a document), which can be a powerful source of data to feed learning analytics systems that infer knowledge about the effectiveness of the educational process. In this paper, we discuss how a part of the students' assessment can be achieved semi-automatically by logging the interaction with educational video games. We conclude that even the application of rather simple tracking techniques means an advantage compared to other systems that are fed with less quality data. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Though we can predict certain patterns from our database manually, but as soon as size of data increases (becomes in terabytes) it becomes difficult and tedious to deduce the important information from huge database (or data warehouse). Various data-mining algorithms exist to identify possible patterns in data. 1Rule algorithm is one such algorithm but is capable of classifying rule based on only one attribute. This paper extends 1Rule algorithm by classifying more rules based on multiple attributes, so that more accurate decision or prediction are made thereby improving revenue and reducing costs in a company. 1Rule creates a rule for a data based on one attribute, it chooses the rule that gives the lowest classification error after comparing the error rates from all the attributes.

The network evolution is of major interest to researchers in this area due to discovering patterns of structural changes in the network. In this study, the evolution of UK directors' social network is examined. The study carried out on a systematic analysis of network properties and evolution factors. The network properties include shortest path, number of shared affiliations, cyclic closure and triadic closure property. It is observed that directors who are not connected directly in specific year and have only a single intermediary between them are more likely to form a connection in the future than the directors with two intermediaries. Moreover, the number of mutual friends increases the chances of a connection between the directors in future.

To gain a better knowledge from available information, number of techniques and methods has been developed in the area of data mining so far. On the other hand privacy is one of the most important properties of information that any system should satisfy. The secrecy of the information must be maintained while sharing the information among different un-trusted parties. Thus privacy plays a major role and also an important issue in most of the data mining applications. Best suited Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) algorithm for different levels of mining which minimizes the information loss and improves accuracy of the mined data are identified based on this survey.

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) provides a pro-mising way to explore the organization of white matter fiber tracts in the human brain in a non-invasive way. However, the immense amount of data from millions of voxels of a raw diffusion map prevent an easy way to utilizable knowledge. In this paper, we focus on the question how we can identify disrupted spatial patterns of the human connectome in AD based on a data mining framework. Using diffusion tractography, the human connectomes for each individual subject were constructed based on two diffusion derived attributes: fiber density and fractional anisotropy, to represent the structural brain connectivity patterns. Then, these human connectomes were further mapped into a series of unweighted graphs by discretization. After frequent subgraph mining, the abnormal score was finally defined to identify disrupted subgraph patterns in patients. Experiments demonstrated that our data-driven approach, for the first time, allows identifying selective spatial pattern changes of the human connectome in AD that perfectly matched grey matter changes of the disease. Our findings further bring new insights into how AD propagates and disrupts the regional integrity of large-scale structural brain networks in a fiber connectivity-based way.

As the transition to 45nm and below increases it is becoming difficult to maintain yield and avoid excursions. Generalized and accurate models of process behavior to predict yield can quickly give insight into the cause of yield loss and process excursion. Here we simulate linear and nonlinear models of yield from process data and evaluate the performance of methods like partial least squares, support vector regression, and rules ensemble in predicting these yield models.

While the applications of nanomaterials seem to be limitless, new challenges are also being posed. With regard to the type of one-dimensional nanostructure of Cadmium Selenide (CdSe), there are three possible morphologies presented: nanosaws, nanowires, and nanobelts. Since the synthesis of these morphologies are by trial and error, our goal in this paper is to use statistical and data mining techniques to predict the type of CdSe nanostructure. The methods used for prediction are: a multinomial logistic regression, a support vector machine, and a random forest. The results are compared using two statistical indices: sensitivity and specificity, and the factors that influence the possible nanostructure are identified. Based on the results, data mining techniques showed to be a better fit for prediction comparing to the multinomial logistic regression model. We also identify the levels of these factors that maximize the proportions of nanosaws, nanowires, and nanobelts.

Exploring vast amount of scientograms for scientific data analysis has been of great interest in Information Science. This work emphasizes the application of multiobjective subgraph mining for the scientogram analysis task regarding the extraction of common research areas in the world. For this task, we apply a recently proposed multiobjective Subdue (MOSubdue) algorithm for frequent subgraph mining in graph-based data. The algorithm incorporates several ideas from evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The underlying scientogram structure is a social network, i.e., a graph, MOSubdue can uncover common (or frequent) scientific structures to different scientograms. MOSubdue performs scientogram mining by jointly maximizing two objectives, the support (or frequency) and complexity of the mined scientific structures. Experimental results on five real-world datasets from Elsevier-Scopus scientific database clearly demonstrated the potential of multiobjective subgraph mining in scientogram analysis.

This study investigated whether the issues of data environment and profitability affect BI implementation for the manufacturers that have already adopted enterprise resource planning systems. We individually considered the factors of data warehousing, online analytical processing (OLAP), and data mining for the data environment, while return on assets, return on sales, and return on investment were transformed into a single component of profitability using principal component analysis. Through logistic regression, we determined that OLAP and data warehousing play important roles in the adoption of BI; however, data mining and profitability indicated no such influence.

The object of Web-based education is human-being. Both the uncertainty and virtuality of web behavior make it a hard task to analyze the rules in education with a quantitative scientific approach. This paper presents an approach to extract interested association rules using Apriori algorithm. Based on data pretreatment of website visiting, this approach can generate association rules with the confidence of different interest points of the educatee from the frequent itemsets. Through a ease study of the Web-based education in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), some convincing recommendations for innovations of the Web-based education in universities are also discussed in the end.

However, many methods for finding attribute reducts from large data sets always meet a difficult problem of combination explosion. To overcome the problem and find some attribute reducts with high efficiency, the algorithm CARHS was proposed. The basic idea of CARHS is: 1) transform the problem into an equivalent one that searches paths, from which attribute reducts can be easily derived, from a graph; 2) employ high efficient heuristic rules during the course of depth-first search on the graph. By means of the heuristic rules, those paths that would not derive attribute reducts could be blocked as early as possible, furthermore, for those paths that would derive the same attribute reduct, only one of them could complete the course of search, and the others could be blocked as early as possible. Thus some attribute reducts could be found by CARHS with high efficiency even when dealing with huge data sets. The transformation of the problem, novel concepts, the heuristic search rules, and the algorithm CARHS were illustrated in detail by some examples. At last, The experiment on three classic UCI data sets showed the effect of the heuristic search rules and the efficiency of the algorithm CARHS.

In this paper, a new strategy called Clustering Algorithm Based on Histogram Threshold (HTCA) is proposed to improve the execution time. The HTCA method combines a hierarchical clustering method and Otsu's method. Compared with traditional clustering algorithm, our proposed method would save at least ten several times of execution time without losing the accuracy. From the experiments, we find that the performance with regard to speed up the execution time of the HTCA is much better than traditional methods.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to mine the FCMs on the basis of data resource. First, raw data stored in the databases is preprocessed and converted to a fixed interval. Then, we adopt a novel hybrid optimization algorithm DE-SQP to produce the optimal weight matrix, whose goal is to make the weights fit the historical data best. At last, we apply the proposed method to solve a real-world problem. The experimental results show that the method is effective and efficient to mine the casual relationships hidden in the data resources by using the hybrid algorithm DE-SQP and the construction of FCMs gets rid of the intervention of domain experts, which guarantees the objectivity and completeness of the FCMs.	[Shou, Wenhui; Fan, Wenhui; Liu, Boyuan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China	Shou, WH (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.	sylvia0816@gmail.com					Carvalho JP, 2004, IEEE INT CONF FUZZY, P659; Georgopoulos VC, 2003, ARTIF INTELL MED, V29, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0933-3657(02)00076-3; KOSKO B, 1986, INT J MAN MACH STUD, V24, P65, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7373(86)80040-2; Koulouriotis DE, 2001, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT, P364, DOI 10.1109/CEC.2001.934413; Lee KC, 1998, SIMULATION, V71, P316; Papageorgiou E.I, 2003, BIOMEDICAL SOFT COMP, V9, P25; Parsopoulos KE, 2003, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT, P1440; Petalas YG, 2005, LECT SER COMPUTER CO, V4A-4B, P1420; Shou W.H., 2011, P IEEE ACIS INT C CO, P3; Tan CO, 2006, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V563, P125, DOI 10.1007/s10750-005-1397-5	10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1865-0929	978-3-642-34386-5	COMM COM INF SC			2012	325						37	43				7	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied	Computer Science; Mathematics	BDM09	WOS:000313764900005

These techniques include neural network, regression analysis, rough set theory, Bayesian network, decision trees, and so on. In this research, a novel data mining technique, genetically guided cluster based fuzzy decision tree (GCFDT), is introduced for the mining task. In order to test the efficacy of GCFDT, it is employed for building the predictive process models of reactive ion etching (RIE) with the aid of optical emission spectroscopy (OES) signals. This model endeavors to predict the wafer surface conditions for the new incoming set of process parameters. OES is an efficient tool for monitoring plasma emission intensity. In contrast with the C-fuzzy decision tree where granules are devolved through fuzzy clustering here, granulation is practised through genetically guided fuzzy clustering. The growth of the tree is governed by expanding the node having highest diversity. The results obtained by employing CGFDT in RIE process modeling reveal that it dominates both the traditional C-fuzzy decision trees and C4.5 decision trees in terms of both the accuracy and compactness.

In data summarization, the representation of the multi-instances stored in non-target tables that have many-to-one relationship with record stored in target table influences the descriptive accuracy of the summarized data. If the summarized data is fed into a classifier as one of the input features, the predictive accuracy of the classifier will also be affected. This paper proposes an evolutionary-based feature construction approach namely Fixed-Length Feature Construction with Substitution (FLFCWS) to address the problem by means of optimizing the feature construction for relational data summarization. This approach allows initial features to be used more than once in constructing newly constructed features. This is performed in order to exploit all possible interactions among attributes which involves an application of genetic algorithm to find a relevant set of features. The constructed features will be used to generate relevant patterns that characterize non-target records associated to the target record as an input representation for data summarization process. Several feature scoring measures are used as fitness function to find the best set of constructed features. The experimental results show that there is an improvement of predictive accuracy for classifying data summarized based on FLFCWS approach which indirectly improves the descriptive accuracy of the summarized data. It shows that FLFCWS approach can generate promising set of constructed features to describe the characteristics of non-target records for data summarization.

Exploratory analysis of the interrelations between co-located boolean spatial features using network graphs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						spatial data mining; visual exploration; exploratory analysis; boolean spatial features; network visualisation; modifiable areal unit problem; geovisual analytics	STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; GEOVISUAL ANALYTICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DECISION-SUPPORT; VISUAL ANALYTICS; VISUALIZATION; PATTERNS	Visual data mining of spatial data is a challenging task. As exploratory analysis is fundamental, it is beneficial to explore the data using different potential visualisations. In this article, we propose and analyse network graphs as a useful visualisation tool to mine spatial data. Due to their ability to represent complex systems of relationships in a visually insightful and intuitive way, network graphs offer a rich structure that has been recognised in many fields as a powerful visual representation. However, they have not been sufficiently exploited in spatial data mining, where they have principally been used on data that come with an explicit pre-specified network graph structure. This research presents a methodology with which to infer relationship network graphs for large collections of boolean spatial features. The methodology consists of four principal stages: (1) define a co-location model, (2) select the type of co-association of interest, (3) compute statistical diagnostics for these co-associations and (4) construct and visualise a network graph of the statistic from step (3). We illustrate the potential usefulness of the methodology using an example taken from an ecological setting. Specifically, we use network graphs to understand and analyse the potential interactions between potential vector and reservoir species that enable the propagation of leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted by the bite of sandflies.

Minimum Length Reduct - A Comparative study	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, COMMUNICATION, CONTROL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (C3IT-2012)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)	FEB 25-26, 2012	INDIA				ROUGH SET; PRINCIPLE; SELECTION	Generation of huge volume of data from various projects and business houses throws new challenges to data mining research community. Analysis of such data is utmost important but development of new mechanisms to handling the data lag behind with this massive growth, resulting a tremendous volume of data retained without being studied. In many applications, often it is difficult to know exactly which features are relevant for a particular task. The irrelevant or redundant attributes should be removed which efficiently reduces dimensionality of the system and thereby complexity of the systems. Rough set theory (RST), a new mathematical tool is applied for generating reduced attribute set called reducts, which is not unique. In the paper, two different attribute reduction techniques generating variable length reducts and minimum length reducts have been discussed and compared considering bench mark datasets.

In many real world applications, complex data is not only organized in multiple database tables, but it is also continuously and endlessly arriving in the form of streams. Although there are some algorithms for mining multiple relations, as well as a lot more algorithms to mine data streams, very few combine the multi-relational case with the data streams case. In this paper we describe a new algorithm, Star FP-Strewn, for finding frequent patterns in multi-relational data streams following a star schema. Experiments in the emphAdventureWorks data warehouse show that Star FP-Stream is accurate and performs better than the equivalent algorithm, FP-Streaming, for mining patterns in a single data stream.

In this work, we propose an alternative version of the MEXICO algorithm, with modifications that - as shown by the results obtained for a number of representative scenarios - lead to performance improvements in terms of the computational effort required to reach a certain performance level, especially for an elevated number of sources.

Evolving optimised decision rules for intrusion detection using particle swarm paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						intrusion detection system; decision tree; particle swarm optimisation; knowledge discovery and data mining dataset; machine learning; classification	NEURAL-NETWORK; ANOMALY DETECTION; INFRASTRUCTURES; ALGORITHM; ENSEMBLE	The aim of this article is to construct a practical intrusion detection system (IDS) that properly analyses the statistics of network traffic pattern and classify them as normal or anomalous class. The objective of this article is to prove that the choice of effective network traffic features and a proficient machine-learning paradigm enhances the detection accuracy of IDS. In this article, a rule-based approach with a family of six decision tree classifiers, namely Decision Stump, C4.5, Naive Baye's Tree, Random Forest, Random Tree and Representative Tree model to perform the detection of anomalous network pattern is introduced. In particular, the proposed swarm optimisation-based approach selects instances that compose training set and optimised decision tree operate over this trained set producing classification rules with improved coverage, classification capability and generalisation ability. Experiment with the Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) data set which have information on traffic pattern, during normal and intrusive behaviour shows that the proposed algorithm produces optimised decision rules and outperforms other machine-learning algorithm.

In this paper we have integrated the approach of web caching and pre-fetching using sequential data mining techniques to enhance the proxy server's performance. The web access logs collected at squid proxy servers, can be used derive interesting information regarding user's web navigation pattern which can be utilized in improving the performance of proxy server by integrating the approach of web caching and pre-fetching using sequential data mining techniques. The work presented here uses Pre-order linked position coded Web Access pattern (PLWAP) Algorithm for finding frequent accessed web objects of each user by analyzing the browsing history from the access log files and then compares the results over page replacement algorithms such as, Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), first without using concept of pre-fetching and then by using pre-fetching. The experimental results show that for each data set the pre-fetching improves the performance of proxy server.

In data mining, dimensionality reduction in data preprocessing plays a vital role for improving the performance of the machine learning algorithms. Many techniques have been proposed by researchers to achieve dimensionality reduction. Beside the contribution of feature subset selection in dimensionality reduction gives a significant improvement in accuracy, it reduces the false prediction ratio and reduces the time complexity for building the learning model in machine learning algorithm as the result of removing redundant and irrelevant attributes from the original dataset. This study analyzes the performance of these Cfs, Consistency and Filtered attribute subset evaluators in view of dimensionality reduction with the wide range of test datasets and learning algorithms namely probability-based Naive Bayes, tree-based C4.5(J48) and instance-based IB1.

This is especially important in organizations with large services arms where unplanned departures of key employees can lead to big losses by way of lost productivity, delayed or missed deadlines, and hiring costs of replacements. By proactively identifying top talent at a high risk of voluntarily leaving, an organization can take appropriate action in time to actually affect such employee departures, thereby avoiding financial and knowledge losses. The main retention action we study in this paper is that of proactive salary raises to at-risk employees. Our approach uses data mining for identifying employees at risk of attrition and balances the cost of attrition/replacement of an employee against the cost of retaining that employee (by way of increased salary) to enable the optimal use of limited funds that may be available for this purpose, thereby allowing the action to be targeted towards employees with the highest potential returns on investment. This approach has been used to do a proactive retention action for several thousand employees across several geographies and business units for a large, Fortune 500 multinational company. We discuss this action and discuss the results to date that show a significant reduction in voluntary resignations of the targeted groups.

Numerous methodologies for developing agent-based systems have been proposed in the literature. Though these methodologies are maturing rapidly. they emphasis only on analysis, design and implementation phase of development process. There is no complete and potential testing technique to build, verify and validate agent based system. Customer satisfaction and cost are the most important factors that a development methodology must emphasis on. So in this paper we present a re-engineering based agent oriented software development methodology to build a powerful agent based system. We also present here a Classification and Clustering (CAC) based data mining workflow to test and re-engineer an agent based system such that we achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 89% for meeting quality expectations and an average project budget variation of just 3%. Both figures are ranging far higher than industry standards.	[Sivakumar, N.; Kalimuthu, K.

This paper is one of the stages of interdisciplinary research project investigating a population of Silesian horses. The database contains breeding history of roughly the complete population of Silesian horses bred in Poland over the last 50 years. Tests were conducted with a subset of individuals known to their parents due to the assumption that we try to predict characteristics of offspring, knowing the characteristics of ancestors (parents, grandparents, great grandparents).

Automated measurements of perfusion can be obtained from three-dimensional stress and rest images. The software segments the left ventricle of the heart and compares image intensities to normal subject database. In our research, we aim at reduction and ultimately elimination of human supervision in this process to improve overall reproducibility and accuracy for disease detection. We have developed several methods to this end such as automatic detection of potentially incorrect contours and direct measurement of stress-rest changes. Current state-of-the-art analysis methods demonstrate better reproducibility and similar accuracy when compared with experienced physicians. We aim to further improve the diagnostic accuracy by data mining techniques, combining several extracted image features with clinical information about the patients. Preliminary results show further improvements in accuracy, beyond that achieved by expert observers.

This paper proposes a demand response program for electric vehicle users which provides the network operator with another useful resource that consists in reducing vehicles charging necessities. This demand response program enables vehicle users to get some profit by agreeing to reduce their travel necessities and minimum battery level requirements on a given period. To support network operator actions, the amount of demand response usage can be estimated using data mining techniques applied to a database containing a large set of operation scenarios. The paper includes a case study based on simulated operation scenarios that consider different operation conditions, e.g. available renewable generation, and considering a diversity of distributed resources and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capacity and demand response capacity in a 33 bus distribution network.

K-harmonic means clustering (KHM) is an extension of K-means (KM) and solves the problem of KM initialization using a built-in boosting function. However, it is also suffering from running into local optima. As a stochastic global optimization technique, harmony search (HS) can solve this problem. HS-based KHM, HSKHM not only helps KHM clustering escaping from local optima but also overcomes the shortcoming of slow convergence speed of HS. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid data-clustering algorithm, HSKHM. The experimental results on four real gene expression datasets indicate that HSKHM is superior KHM and HS in most cases. The HSKHM algorithm not only improves the convergence speed of HS but also helps KHM escaping from local optima.

On the one hand, by recording the change of support counts of frequent items during the process of FP-tree construction, dynamic FP-tree pruning is implemented. And the rationality is discussed. On the other hand, by using the concurrency strategy, the construction of FP-tree and the discovery of frequent itemsets can be realized simultaneously. Compared with FP-growth, it is not necessary to mine frequent itemsets after the construction of the whole FP-tree in Dynamic-prune. Experimental results show Dynamic-prune is efficient and scalable.

In the past studies, most algorithms generate high utility itemsets from a set of transactions in horizontal data format. Inspired by the problem of frequent itemset mining, vertical mining may be a promising approach superior to horizontal mining. In this paper, a high utility itemsets mining algorithm based on vertical database layout is proposed. Candidate high utility itemsets are discovered by intersection of covers at first. Then, high utility itemsets are checked within candidates by scanning database once. Thus, the advantages of vertical database layout, such as low storage, and high efficiency, are utilized. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is both efficient and scalable.

Hybrid estimation algorithm and intent inference algorithm are usually used to make long-term probabilistic trajectory prediction. In this paper, data mining algorithms are used to process the historical radar data and to abstract a typical trajectory library. An improved trajectory prediction algorithm is proposed based on the typical trajectory, which is used as the intent information to update the transition probability matrix, and is also used to propagate the nominal trajectory instead of the flight plan path. The prediction performance of the proposed algorithm is tested using real radar data from North China Air Traffic Management Bureau. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm has a better prediction performance and the prediction accuracy is improved by 10% at most.

We present an attack on the privacy of the published data that has been sanitized using data perturbation. The attack employs data mining and fusion to remove some noise from the perturbed sensitive values. Our attack is practical it can be launched by non-expert adversaries having no background knowledge about the perturbed data and no data mining expertise. Moreover, our attack model also allows to consider informed and expert adversaries having background knowledge and/or expertise in data mining and fusion. Extensive experiments were performed on four databases derived from UCI's Adult and IPUMS census-based data sets sanitized with noise addition that satisfies epsilon-differential privacy. The experimental results confirm that our attack presents a significant privacy risk to published perturbed data because the majority of the noise can be effectively removed. The results show that a naive adversary is able to remove around 90% of the noise added during perturbation using general-purpose data miners from the Weka software package, and an informed expert adversary is able to remove 91%-99.93% of the added noise. Interestingly, the higher the aimed privacy, the higher the percentage of noise can be removed. This suggests that adding more noise does not always increase the real privacy.

It is need to act quickly to reduce crime activity and find out the links between various available data sources. The government are continuing to call upon modern geographic information systems to find the more intensive area of crime in order to protect their communities and assets. Real time solutions can provide significant resources and push the capability of law enforcement closer to the pulse of criminal activity. There are 3 algorithms to study the pattern of any point data and for better inferences and interpretation. In this study, Mean Algorithm using Linguistic variable finds the most occurred crime at particular location among different types of crime. Mean algorithm using crime find the location not shown by earlier algorithm where sensitivity of crime is high. Fuzzy associations rule algorithm on point data formulate the rules among the crimes is a novel means for knowledge discovery in the crime domain, supported by experimental results using Mapobject, VB and Google Map.

The rules are evaluated based on objective and subjective metrics. The user must be able to specify the properties of the rules. The rules discovered must have some of these properties to render them useful. These properties may be conflicting. Hence discovery of rules with specific properties is a multi objective optimization problem. Cultural Algorithm (CA) which derives from social structures, and which incorporates evolutionary systems and agents, and uses five knowledge sources (KS's) for the evolution process better suits the need for solving multi objective optimization problem. In the current study a cultural algorithm for classification rule mining is proposed for multi objective optimization of rules. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Machine learning techniques such as Decision tree algorithm are widely used in research fields of bioinformatics, data mining, capturing knowledge in expert systems and so on. The emotions can be deducted from the online chat conversation and tagged. In this proposed work, the given dataset is classified using customized decision tree with respect to the two known classes of data. The main motivation behind this customized approach is to provide a simple, effective, less complex and memory optimized prediction model in deducing the classes of the given dataset. The effectiveness of the approach is then obtained by comparing it with the existing methodologies.

It can be used to obtain accurate information about a location fairly easily using Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled devices. The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS, GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to understand the correlation between users and locations. The goal of this paper is to use both the spatial as well as temporal aspects to group the GPS data. We begin by calculating the stay points and then grouping them temporally and determining the location visited most number of times within a time period.

Given a multimodal GPS trace, we will identify where in the GPS trace the traveller changed transportation modes. For example, where in the GPS trace the traveller alight a bus and boards a train, or where did the client stop running and start walking. Using data mining schemes to understand mobility data, in conjunction with real world observations, we propose an algorithm to identify mobility transfer points automatically. We compared the proposed algorithm against the state of the art that is used in the previously proposed work. Evaluation on real world data collected from GPS enabled mobile phones indicate that the proposed algorithm is accurate, has a good coverage, and a good asymptotic run time complexity.

This approach is based on the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and two types of forecasting models, such as based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The forecasting performance of these models was evaluated using three well-known evaluation criteria: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results show that ANN performs better than ARIMA based forecasting technique for small future time intervals. However, ARIMA models can capture the behavior of the time series and is suitable for long term prediction. We present two applications for wireless networks traffic forecasting, the prediction of the moment when a specified Base Station (BS) will saturate (long term prediction) and the prediction of traffic anomalies (short term prediction).

Based on that, a model where traffic infrastructure is represented by a dynamic network of Hotspots is suggested. Besides the location of Hotspots, information about travel times between these Hotspot-Nodes also comes along with the extracted significant places. This information can be used to improve or enrich traffic management and/or navigation systems by consequently achieving a more precise estimation of travel times compared to current systems.

Smartphone Dual Defense Protection Framework: Detecting malicious applications in Android Markets	2012 EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE AD HOC AND SENSOR NETWORKS (MSN 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	DEC 14-16, 2012	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Univ Elect Sci & Technol China		android security; data mining; system call monitor; network traffic monitor		In this paper, we present a smartphone dual defense protection framework that allows Official and Alternative Android Markets to detect malicious applications among those new applications that are submitted for public release. Our framework consists of servers running on clouds where developers who wish to release their new applications can upload their software for verification purpose. The verification server first uses system call statistics to identify potential malicious applications. After verification, if the software is clean, the application will then be released to the relevant markets. To mitigate against false negative cases, users who run new applications can invoke our network traffic monitoring (NTM) tool which triggers network traffic capture upon detecting some suspicious behaviors e. g. detecting sensitive data being sent to output stream of an open socket. The network traffic will be analyzed to see if it matches network characteristics observed from malware applications. If suspicious network traffic is observed, the relevant Android markets will be notified to remove the application from the repository. We trained our system call and network traffic classifiers using 32 families of known Android malware families and some typical normal applications. Later, we evaluated our framework using other malware and normal applications that used in the training set. Our experimental results using 120 test applications (which consist of 50 malware and 70 normal applications) indicate that we can achieve a 94.2% and 99.2% accuracy with J.48 and Random forest classifier respectively using our framework.

ICTs are technologies which facilitate the management to share knowledge and information. Thus, ICTs have a prominent role on Knowledge Management initiatives. In the current business environment, the implementation of Knowledge Management projects has become easier with the help of technological tools. The value of Knowledge Management is more when made available to the right people at the right time. Thus, knowledge sharing is facilitated through information and communication technologies including computers, telephones, e-mail, databases, data-mining systems, search engines, video-conferencing equipment and many more. The purpose of this study is to identify the significant role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Knowledge Management (KM) initiatives that lead to organizational effectiveness. This paper moves towards an understanding of the overall importance of ICTs to knowledge management that paves way to achieve organizational effectiveness. Finally, an integrated model linking ICTs, Knowledge Management processes and organizational effectiveness is done and thereby the relationship between ICTs and KM processes is conceptualized.

Support and confidence measures which are based on the frequency count of the items enable us to derive the frequent itemsets. The frequency of the items as a single factor does not represent the interestingness of the items. To enhance the process of data mining tasks based on the value of the product, several researches were conducted. It resulted in utility mining which is an emerging field of research in data mining. In the recent years various data mining approaches have been implemented in order to find the high utility itemsets. The main objective of utility mining is to identify the itemsets with highest utilities, by considering the subjectively defined utility values, as set by the user. Existing methods based on utility mining concept focus on centralized systems where the data and associated processing is pertained to a particular location. As a further step ahead we try to implement the utility mining concept in a distributed environment. In this approach we use a sophisticated way of mining high utility itemsets using a Fast Utility Mining (FUM) algorithm.

Polymorphism and metamorphism make the detection even more difficult. Traditional signatures-based anti-virus systems yields excellent detection rates for existing and previously encountered viruses, but they lack the capacity to efficiently detect new unknown variants. In this paper, we study network behavior based mobile virus detection to figure out unknown viruses. We presented a network behavior feature selection method to find out generic features for different types of viruses. Real traffic from the GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) network is analyzed and plenty of tests are conducted to prove the effectiveness. The experiments show that many viruses can be classified into common virus families based on the similarities in network behaviors, and our feature selection method can detect unknown viruses with high possibility.

The algorithm expands FIM algorithm and AIUA algorithm, improves the efficiency and corrects the mistakes of My_IUA algorithm. Moreover, it modifies FIM algorithm with a new argument and presents a new function fim_aiua_gen() that rewrites the function aiua_gen() of AIUA algorithm.

However, Due to the computational demands of these approaches, clustering for large scale data sets such as spatiotemporal data and images have been slow to appear. A novel subtractive clustering method based on NystrOm approximation is proposed. The contribution of proposed is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of subtractive clustering based algorithms, making it feasible to use subtractive clustering to large scale subtractive clustering problems. The proposed method is based on the famous NystrOm method. All potentials of samples could be approximated quickly using only a litter number of samples. The experiment results on color images show efficiency in comparing with conventional subtractive clustering method.

An Algorithm for Mining Outliers in Categorical Data through Ranking	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYBRID INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (HIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)	DEC 04-07, 2012	Pune, INDIA	MIR Labs, IEEE, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc Spain, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc CzechoSlovakia	MITCOE	Data mining; Outlier detection; Categorical data; Data clustering	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; LOCAL OUTLIERS	The rapid growth in the field of data mining has lead to the development of various methods for outlier detection. Though detection of outliers has been well explored in the context of numerical data, dealing with categorical data is still evolving. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm for detecting outliers in categorical data based on a novel definition of outliers. In the first phase, this algorithm explores a clustering of the given data, followed by the ranking phase for determining the set of most likely outliers. The proposed algorithm is expected to perform better as it can identify different types of outliers, employing two independent ranking schemes based on the attribute value frequencies and the inherent clustering structure in the given data. Unlike some existing methods, the computational complexity of this algorithm is not affected by the number of outliers to be detected. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated through experiments on various public domain categorical data sets.	[Suri, N. N. R.

Though traditional methods such as feature ranking and subset selection have been widely used, there has been little consideration given to assuring satisfactory performance of a learning machine in relation to the minimum of features required or the "critical dimension". This critical dimension is unique to a specific dataset, learning machine, and ranking algorithm combination. The empirical methods demonstrate that many datasets show the existence of critical dimension. The dependence of this critical dimension on the learning machines and ranking algorithms could provide newer insights in understanding datasets, machine learning classifiers and ranking algorithms. The preliminary results of analysis show that the critical dimension depends largely on the feature ranking algorithm and that learning machines are less significant in determining the critical dimension.

The effective use of data mining approach can offer e-recruitment companies an improved understanding of customers' patterns and greater insights of purchasing trends. However, prior studies on classifier built by data mining approach provided limited insights into the customer targeting problem of job advertising companies. In this paper we develop a single feature evaluator and propose an approach to select a desired feature subset by setting a threshold. The proposed feature evaluator demonstrates its stability and outstanding performance through empirical experiments in which real-world customer data of an e-recruitment firm are used. Practically, the findings together with the model may help telemarketers to better understand their customers. Theoretically, this paper extends existing research on feature selection for binary classification of imbalanced data.

Such interactions or interdependencies can be dependent on or influenced by user characteristics such as connectivity, centrality, weight, importance, and activity in the networks. As such, some users in the social networks can be considered as highly influential to others. In this paper, we propose a computational model that integrates data mining with social computing to help users to discover influential friends from the social networks.

It has been widely used in pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Many mathematical theories, such as fuzzy sets, lattice and matrix, have been applied to study the issue for constructing more effective reduction algorithms. In this paper, the attribute reduction in the decision system is conducted under matroid theory. The matroid approximation space is proposed to build a bridge between the decision system and the matroid. In this way, a single valued decision system is represented by several matroids directly. By using the circuits of these matroids, the concept of equivalence class is formulated equivalently with the matroidal approach and then the lower and the upper matroidal approximations are established. Furthermore, some basic concepts of attribute reduction in rough sets are redescribed in the context of matroid approximation space. Finally, for any two subsets of condition attributes in a consistent decision system, a sufficient condition is proposed to judge whether the positive regions of them with respect to the decision attribute are equal.

Multimedia Data Mining MDM has become one of the most challenging areas of information decision area, and many effective association rule mining algorithms have been proposed and improved, but the association rules mining methods and models based on image content are so far different from the ordinary rules because of the complexity of the mining target. The characteristic of two images in a resolution level is the same, but in a finer resolution it is different, so we need a method in which resolution is refined step by step. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of progressive association rules mining based on image content named PARM.

Firstly, we use Genetic Algorithm (GA) to implement state simplification and obtain near-optimal state assignment. Then, in the pre-evolution stage, EHW evolves a set of high performing circuits and uses data mining method to find frequently evolved blocks from these circuits. The frequently evolved block would be re-used as function or terminal for evolving better circuits in the re-evolution stage. EHW has a faster convergence so that the circuit with small complexity could be evolved. Auto starting ability of circuits would also be test by the fitness function of EHW. Finally, sequence detectors, modulon counters, and ISCAS'89 circuit are used as the proof for our evolutionary design approach. Simulation results are given, and our evolutionary algorithm is shown to be better than other methods in terms of convergence time, success rate, and maximum fitness across generations.

Analysis of the graph structure of social networks can provide valuable information for revenue generation and social science research, but unfortunately, ensuring this analysis does not violate individual privacy is difficult. Simply anonymizing graphs or even releasing only aggregate results of analysis may not provide sufficient protection. Differential privacy is an alternative privacy model, popular in data-mining over tabular data, which uses noise to obscure individuals' contributions to aggregate results and offers a very strong mathematical guarantee that individuals' presence in the data-set is hidden. Analyses that were previously vulnerable to identification of individuals and extraction of private data may be safely released under differential-privacy guarantees. We review two existing standards for adapting differential privacy to network data and analyse the feasibility of several common social-network analysis techniques under these standards. Additionally, we propose out-link privacy, a novel standard for differential privacy over network data, and introduce two powerful out-link private algorithms for common network analysis techniques that were infeasible to privatize under previous differential privacy standards.

In dealing with such data, we typically need to use methods like Principal Component Analysis and Projection Pursuit, to find interesting lower dimensional directions to project the data and hence reduce their dimensionality in a manageable size. In this work, we propose a new criterion of direction interestingness, which incorporates information from the density of the projected data. Subsequently, we utilize the Differential Evolution algorithm to perform optimization over the space of the projections and hence construct a new hierarchical clustering algorithmic scheme. The new algorithm shows promising performance over a series of real and simulated data.

The goal of our work is to promote computational co-offending network analaysis as an effective means for extracting information about criminal organizations from large real-life crime datasets, specifically police-reported crime data.

Data with poor quality often leads to poor performance in data mining, low efficiency in data analysis, wrong decision which bring great economic loss to users and organizations further. Although many researches have been carried out from various aspects of the extracting, transforming, and loading processes in data mining, most researches pay more attention to analysis automation than to data quality evaluation. To address the data quality evaluation issues, we propose an approach to combine human beings' powerful cognitive abilities in data quality evaluation with the high efficiency ability of computer, and develop a visual analysis method for data quality evaluation based on visual morphology.

Irrelevant attributes can be termed as noisy attributes and such attributes further magnify the challenge of working with data streams. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised outlier detection scheme for streaming data. This scheme is based on clustering as clustering is an unsupervised data mining task and it does not require labeled data. In proposed scheme both density based and partitioning clustering method are combined to take advantage of both density based and distance based outlier detection. Proposed scheme also assigns weights to attributes depending upon their respective relevance in mining task and weights are adaptive in nature. Weighted attributes are helpful to reduce or remove the effect of noisy attributes. Keeping in view the challenges of streaming data, the proposed scheme is incremental and adaptive to concept evolution. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data sets show that our proposed approach outperforms other existing approach (CORM) in terms of outlier detection rate, false alarm rate, and increasing percentages of outliers.

The model is formulated as a two-stage classifier according to the concept of machine learning. The first stage is to determine a set of case diagnostic issues, using a modular Artificial Neural Network (mANN), and the second stage is to determine the relevant legal elements which lead to legal charges identification, using SVM-equipped C4.5. The integrated multi-stage model aims at achieving high accuracy of classification while reserving "arguability". Hypothetically, mANN handles well for digesting complexity in case-level issues analysis with acceptable explanatory power and C4.5 addresses the lesser extent of contingency and provides human-interpretable logic concerning the high-level context of legal codes.

Conventional clustering approaches like K-Means, heuristic biclustering approaches like Greedy Algorithms, meta-heuristic biclustering approaches like Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing or Particle Swarm Optimization may not be specific enough to find correlations between genes in an appropriate manner, as each of the algorithms has its own merits and demerits. In this paper, a hybrid PSO-SA BIClustering algorithm namely PSO-SA-BIC that combines features of binary PSO with Simulated Annealing has been proposed in order to extract biclusters of gene expression data. A novel fitness function, based on ACV has been used to identify shifting pattern and scaling pattern biclusters. Experimental results on bench mark datasets show that PSO-SA-BIC algorithm is outperforming the classical algorithms by providing statistically significant biclusters.

One of key problems of knowledge acquisition in theoretical study of rough sets is attribute reduction. Attribute reduction also called feature selection eliminates superfluous attributes in the information system and improves efficiency of data analysis process. But reducing attributes is a NP-hard problem. Recently, to overcome the technical difficulty, there are a lot of research on new approaches such as maximal tolerance classification (Fang Yang et al. 2010), genetic algorithm (N. Ravi Shankar et al. 2010), topology and measure of significance of attributes (P. G. JansiRani and R. Bhaskaran 2010), soft set (Tutut Herawan et al. 2010), positive approximation (Yuhua Qian et al. 2010), dynamic programming (Walid Moudani et al. 2010). However, there are still some challenging research issues that time consumption is still hard problem in attribute reduction. This paper introduces a new approach with a model presented with definitions, theorems, operations. Set of maximal random prior forms is put forward as an effective way for attribute reduction. The algorithm for seeking maximal random prior set are proposed with linear complexity, contributes to solve absolutely problems in attribute reduction and significantly improve the speed of calculation and data analysis.

Cardiovascular events have an incidence of 20% in the first year of hemodialysis (HD). Real data routinely collected during HD administration were extracted from the Fresenius Medical Care database EuCliD (39 independent variables) and used to develop a random forest predictive model for the forecast of cardiovascular events in the first year of HD treatment. Two feature selection methods were applied. Results of these models in an independent cohort of patients showed a significant predictive ability. Our better result was obtained with a random forest built on 6 variables only (AUC: 77.1% +/- 2.9%; MCE: 31.6% +/- 3.5%), identified by the variable importance out of bag (OOB) estimate.

EnVIE project: A framework to produce urban data at large scale	USAGE, USABILITY, AND UTILITY OF 3D CITY MODELS: EUROPEAN COST ACTION TU0801			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the European COST Action TU0801 - Semantic Enrichment of 3D City Models for Sustainable Urban Development	OCT 29-31, 2012	Nantes, FRANCE	European Sci Fdn, COST, Ambiances, ENSA, CNRS, Univ Nantes Angers Mens, ECN	Grad Sch Architecture			The decision making process related to urban areas synthetizes a lot of data taking into account numerous parameters. The indicators produced from simulations or data mining on 3D city models (3DCM) can be a great help into these decision-making processes. The problem is to acquire and process the 3DCM in order to produce these indicators at city scale. The EnVIE project proposes a framework to perform the acquisition of 3DCM and then to produce 3D or 2D metadata on these models. As several city councils have been interviewed in the scope of the project to describe their real needs, the computed metadata are directly usable into the decision-making process. The main contribution of this framework is to merge existing techniques to build a pipeline allowing to compute lighting and wind simulation, and to extract socioeconomic metadata with data-mining techniques. This on-going work builds a link between indicators at the building scale and 2D indicators at larger scale from GIS, and therefore is a step towards an indicator production process at full-scale range.

Unfortunately, currently marketed software are very limited and don't meet all user needs. This software supports only some classification algorithms and some Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) algorithms that generate a big number of rules which are not understandable by the end user. Moreover, these approaches are applicable only for restricted data type. In this paper, we propose new software of classification and KDD, called Cluster-KDD, which supports a larger set of data type and classification algorithm and offers KDD algorithms that generate comprehensible and exploitable rules by the user.

However, the approaches studied in this area have mainly been oriented at highly structured and precise data. Thus, the problem of exploit these data is often neglected. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach for exploitation of these data. For this, we propose to define an Expert System (ES) allowing the user to easily exploit the large data set. The Knowledge Base (KB) of our ES is defined by introducing a new KDD approach taking in consideration another degree of granularity into the process of knowledge extraction. This set represents a reduced knowledge of the initial data set and allows deducting the semantics of the data. We prove that, this ES can help the user to give semantics for these data and to exploit them in intelligent way.

In general, the traditional IDS relies on the extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been used in the literature. The experiments and evaluations of the proposed intrusion detection system are performed with the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. We will apply different learning algorithms on NSL-KDD data set, to recognize between normal and attack connections and compare their performing in different scenarios-discretization, features selections and algorithm method for classification-using a powerful statistical analysis: ANOVA. In this study, both the accuracy of the configuration of different system and methodologies used, and also the computational time and complexity of the methodologies are analyzed.

The steadily increasing diabetic population and strained health resources call for a more efficient approach to diabetes care. In the past few years, smart phones have become the mainstream communications device, especially for the younger generation. Coupled with the increased ease in developing and deploying mobile applications, there has been a surge in medical and health related mobile programs. These modern smart phones provide a readily available platform for deploying healthcare related services. By employing their computing resources and connectivity, health institutions can easily provide telehealth services to chronically ill patients. In this work, we put forward a mobile framework for providing personalized diabetes telehealth. Through leveraging the power of smart phones and wireless connectivity, better care and improved quality of life can be provided for diabetic patients by this framework.

However, a few failures occasionally breach the entire set of mechanisms. To prevent such scenarios, we rely on failure prediction mechanisms to raise alarms with sufficient warning to allow the at-risk data to be copied to a safe location. A common failure prediction technique monitors the occurrence of soft errors and triggers an alarm when the soft error rate exceeds a specified threshold. This study uses data collected from a population of over 50,000 customer deployed disk drives to examine the relationship between soft errors and failures, in particular failures manifested as hard errors. The data analysis shows that soft errors alone cannot be used as a reliable predictor of hard errors. However, in those cases where soft errors do accurately predict hard errors, sufficient warning time exists for preventive actions.

According to statistics, the disease prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more than 3% of the total population and even up to 25% for 40-aged men. More and more clinical evidences showed that obstructive sleep apnea is highly associated with hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, nocturnal enuresis, and even depression. If we can detect the potential OSA patients early, and offering them appropriate treatments, it is worth not only promoting the quality of patients' life, but also reducing the possible serious complications and medical costs. Mobile phones are now playing an ever more crucial role in people's daily lives. The latest generation of smartphones is increasingly viewed as handheld computers rather than as phones, due to their powerful on-board computing capability, capacious memories, large screens and open operating systems that encourage applications (Apps) development. In this study, an intelligent "OSA prediction App" on Android Smartphone has been developed based on medical decision rules from a clinical large dataset. The proposed application can provide an easy and efficient way to quickly pre-screen high-risk groups of OSA potential patients, aid medical works to achieve early diagnosis and treatment purposes, prevent the occurrence of complications, and thus reach the goal of preventive medicine.

As the available resources become more specialized, there is a growing need for multidisciplinary collaborations between biomedical researchers to address complex research questions. We present an application of a data-mining algorithm to gene-expression data in a collaborative decision-making support environment, as a typical example of how multidisciplinary researchers can collaborate in analyzing and biologically interpreting gene-expression microarray data. Through the proposed approach, researchers can easily decide about which data repositories should be considered, analyze the algorithmic results, discuss the weaknesses of the patterns identified, and set up new iterations of the data mining algorithm by defining other descriptive attributes or integrating other relevant data.

The method consists of the following four steps: first, histories of nursing orders are extracted from hospital information system. Second, orders are classified into several groups by using clustering and multidimensional scaling method. Third, by using the information on groups, feature selection is applied to the data and important features for classification are extracted. Finally, original temporal data are split into several groups and the first step will be repeated. After the grouping results are stable, a new pathway is constructed based on the induced results. The method was applied to a dataset whose patients had an operation of cataracta. The results show that the reuse of stored data will give a powerful tool for maintenance of clinical pathway, which can be viewed as data-oriented management of nursing schedule.

At the same time, many recent efforts have shown the suitability of GPGPUs for batch-typed long-running applications. However, few studies conduct the applicability of GPGPU to stream computing and also our first experiment shows that the performance does not scale as expected if one introduces the GPGPU to stream computing applications. This paper presents the workload characterization of GPGPU-based stream computing. We especially focus on computing SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) with GPGPUs for small-sized matrix since it can be widely applicable to real-time stream-based data mining applications such as real-time anomaly detection. In this paper, we not only show the workload characterization of GPGPU-based stream computing but also propose the optimization approach of SVD for stream computing applications called "GPU task Parallelism" to leverage the sufficient capability of GPGPUs. This optimization offers new levels of scalability for real-time operations with large numbers of sensors. Our experimental results show that GPU task parallelism provides roughly four-fold performance gains against a quad-core CPU for matrixes of 300 (X) 300 to 500 (X) 500 data values. We also implemented a stream-based change-point and anomaly detection system based on the optimized SVD and stream computing system called System S. By porting the optimized version of SVD to the distributed stream computing system, it was easy to exploit multiple GPUs on multiple nodes. The performance results showed performance around 7.6 times faster than CPUs. The scalability of our proposed system was tested up to 1,525 sensors, which were simultaneously handled for change-point detection every 5 seconds.

In a case study we highlight this step by step with a real-world data mining application and present solutions to realize this scenario. Amazon's S3, EC2, RDS, SES, IAM and STS services are utilized in a complex setup in order to realize a completely dynamic cloud layer architecture which is needed to implement the extension. This includes the creation of the infrastructure and the task execution in the cloud as well as its extermination afterwards, which is described besides the data mining application itself. Today's major challenges regarding cloud computing as data security and privacy are taken into account. Additionally, a multi-criteria-optimization across different cloud setups is considered in order to guarantee transparency concerning a runtime-cost tradeoff and to rule out suboptimal setups. The approach is based on benchmarks that have to be performed. The effectiveness of this setup is illustrated by example application instances. The results show, under which circumstances it is beneficial to use the cloud to perform computing tasks.

For these high dimensional data it is known that traditional clustering algorithms fail to detect meaningful patterns. As a solution subspace clustering techniques were introduced. They analyze arbitrary subspace projections of the data to detect clustering structures. In this demonstration, we introduce the first subspace clustering extension for the well-established KNIME data mining framework. While KNIME offers a variety of data mining functionalities, subspace clustering is missing so far. Our novel extension provides a multitude of algorithms, data generators, evaluation measures, and visualization techniques specifically designed for subspace clustering.

Instance-Linked Attribute Tracking and Feedback for Michigan-Style Supervised Learning Classifier Systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOURTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 07-11, 2012	Philadelphia, PA	SIGEVO ACM Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat		LCS; UCS; GBML; supervised learning; tracking; feedback; clustering; visualization; heterogeneity; epistasis	HUMAN-DISEASE; EPISTASIS; ACCURACY; MEMORY; XCS	The application of learning classifier systems (LCSs) to classification and data mining in genetic association studies has been the target of previous work. Recent efforts have focused on: (1) correctly discriminating between predictive and non-predictive attributes, and (2) detecting and characterizing epistasis (attribute interaction) and heterogeneity. While the solutions evolved by Michigan-style LCSs (M-LCSs) are conceptually well suited to address these phenomena, the explicit characterization of heterogeneity remains a particular challenge. In this study we introduce attribute tracking, a mechanism akin to memory, for supervised learning in M-LCSs. Given a finite training set, a vector of accuracy scores is maintained for each instance in the data. Post-training, we apply these scores to characterize patterns of association in the dataset. Additionally we introduce attribute feedback to the mutation and crossover mechanisms, probabilistically directing rule generalization based on an instance's tracking scores. We find that attribute tracking combined with clustering and visualization facilitates the characterization of epistasis and heterogeneity while uniquely linking individual instances in the dataset to etiologically heterogeneous subgroups. Moreover, these analyses demonstrate that attribute feedback significantly improves test accuracy, efficient generalization, run time, and the power to discriminate between predictive and non-predictive attributes in the presence of heterogeneity.

With more understanding and availability of nuclear technologies, and increasing persuasion of nuclear technologies by several new countries, it is increasingly becoming important to monitor the nuclear proliferation activities. For the past three years, we have been developing data mining algorithms to semantically annotate nuclear facilities and identify changes in man made structures using very high resolution images. In this paper, we summarize the recent progress and allude the audience to new opportunities.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors selected a group of companies in two Chinese industries, collected co-word data for the companies, analyzed the data with multidimensional scaling (MDS), and then compared the MDS maps generated from the co-word data with business situations to find out if the co-word method works. Findings - The study found that the Web co-word method could potentially be applied to the Chinese environment. The study also found the advantages and disadvantages of the Web co-word method vs the Web co-link method. Originality/value - Knowing the applicability of the Web co-word method to the Chinese environment contributes to the knowledge of this new Webometrics method. Mining business information from the Web is more valuable when applied to a foreign country where language and culture barriers exist. To use the co-word method, one does not have to be able to read or write in that language. One only needs to have the names of the companies to study, which can be easily obtained without knowledge of the language. The value of business information about countries such as China is obvious given the global nature of contemporary business competition and the significance of the Chinese economy to the world.

As more organizations rely on WWW to conduct business, user behavior analysis becoming difficult in web-based applications. Information about user's interactions with website is stored in server logs and serves as huge electronic survey of website. Web usage mining deals with discovering usage patterns from server logs in order to understand and better serve the needs of web users. The raw information contained in log file represents noisy data. Preprocessing includes cleaning, user identification, sessionization, path completion & structurization and is a prerequisite for improving accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent mining process. This paper emphasizes on an effective web log preprocessing system. Experimental results proved that the proposed system reduces the size of log file down to 12% and improves the performance of preprocessing in identifying users, sessions, path completion and structurization.

In our paper, we employ a data mining approach for classifying DNA repair genes using their various characteristic features. The classification models built were difficult to analyze and interpret due to the curse of dimensionality present in the gene dataset. This difficulty is overcome by adopting Dimensionality Reduction which is a well-known pre-processing technique. The Feature subset selection technique along with various search methods is used to reduce the dataset without affecting the integrity of the original dataset. The reduction in the dataset enabled the use of Multi layer perceptron in the efficient analysis of the dataset. The classifiers showed better performance on the reduced dataset when compared to the original dataset.	[Vidya, A.; Manohar, V.; Shwetha, V. P.; Venugopal, K.

In this paper we point to the existence of problems where the relation among these regions corresponds to repetitive patterns that can be mapped to high-level models. We show how a formalism for the representation of patterns, also known as pattern theory, is instrumental to capture such relations. The idea is to verify patterns using mathematical constructs by combining primitive structures. We illustrate our ideas using parity problems, and show how bridging the gap between traditional supervised learning and pattern theory is a challenge that can bring large benefits to the data mining community.

Using Self-Organizing Maps in Constrained Ensemble Clustering Framework	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS (ISDA)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	NOV 27-29, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	Machine Intelligence Res Labs (MIR Labs), IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Czechoslovakia Chapter, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Spanish Chapter, IEEE, Cochin Univ Sci & Technol		Data mining; Neural Network; Kohonen's self-organizing map; CCE-SOM; spectral clustering; constraint-based cluster ensemble		Clustering is a predominant data mining task which attempts to partition a group of unlabelled data instances into distinct clusters. The clusters so obtained will have maximum intra-cluster similarity and minimum inter-cluster similarity. Several clustering techniques have been proposed in literature, which includes stand-alone as well as ensemble clustering techniques. Most of them lack robustness and suffer from an important drawback that they cannot effectively visualize clustering results to help knowledge discovery and constructive learning. Recently, clustering techniques via visualization of data have been proposed. These rely on building a Self Organizing Map (SOM) originally proposed by Kohonen. Even though Kohonen SOM preserves topology of the input data, it is widely observed that the clustering accuracy achieved by SOM is poor. To perform robust and accurate clustering using SOM, a cluster ensemble framework based on input constraints is proposed in this paper. Cluster ensemble is a set of clustering solutions obtained as a result of individual clustering on subsets of the original high-dimensional data. The final consensus matrix is fed to a neural network which transforms the input data to a lower-dimensional output map. The map clearly depicts the distribution of input data instances into clusters.

The main function of this processing is elimination of secondary and unnecessary information while important data are highlighted to the operator during any failure or malfunction monitored in the electrical system. This processing is composed of four main parts: a rule-editor, an event-classifier, a rule-extractor and a rule-assembling. The two main parts composes a program named FASE, which runs in the control centers. The two last parts composes the program named EASE which produces rules for FASE. Currently the EDP-ESCELSA Power Distribution Company uses for monitoring of your electrical system the platform, named SCATEX, developed by EDP Group in partnership with the EFACEC Group. The SCATEX is a SCADA system, integrating supervision and control of electrical systems. This paper presents de the development of the four main parts of the program, with some practical examples from the ESCELSA database.

Although studies exist on the sharing of specific types of information (photos, posts, etc.), one area that has been less explored is how Facebook profiles can share personality information in a broad, machine-readable fashion. In this study, we apply data-mining and machine learning techniques to predict users' personality traits (specifically, the traits of the Big Five personality model) using only demographic and text-based attributes extracted from their profiles. We then use these predictions to rank individuals in terms of the five traits, predicting which users will appear in the top or bottom 5% or 10% of these traits. Our results show that when using certain models, we can find the top 10% most Open individuals with nearly 75% accuracy, and across all traits and directions, we can predict the top 10% with at least 34.5% accuracy (exceeding 21.8%, which is the best accuracy when using just the best-performing profile attribute). These results have privacy implications in terms of allowing advertisers and other groups to focus on a specific subset of individuals based on their personality traits.

We have looked at three underlying challenges to achieve these goals; an overwhelming flow of low-quality alarms, understanding the structure and quality of the delivered services, and automation of service configuration. This thesis proposes solutions in these areas based on domain-specific languages, data-mining and self-learning. Most of the solutions have been validated based on data from a large service provider. We look at how domain-models can be used to capture explicit knowledge for alarms and services. In addition, we apply datamining and self-learning techniques to capture tacit knowledge. The validation shows that models improve the quality of alarm and service models, and enables automatic rendering of functions like root cause correlation, service and SLA status, as well as service configuration. The data-mining and self-learning solutions show that we can learn from available decisions made by experts and automatically assign alarm priorities.

Thus the comprehensive hailstone forecasting model was formed. Firstly the rules discovered from Apriori algorithm were used to eliminate the interference; Secondly the integrated knowledge database was formed by the combination of the rules obtained from the Rough Set Theory and the FP-tree algorithm for the comprehensive forecast. Certainty factor model was adopted to solve the rule conflict which occurred as the number of the rule increased. The experimental results show that the comprehensive forecast model improved the accuracy of hailstone recognition and good results were achieved in practical operation.

To deal with such a vague return problem, business must improve information transparency about end users' return activities. This research proposed an agent-based architecture for return administration. The intelligent return administration expert system (iRAES) architecture consists of two KDD mechanisms and two intelligent agents that can predict the possibility of the end user will return the product (via return diagnosis agent, RDA) and provide return centre staff with recommendations for return administration (via return recommender agent, RRA). iRAES is implemented successfully and adopts hybrid artificial intelligent algorithms, including the following: data mining is employed to implement the RDA agent, and case-based reasoning is adopted to design the RRA agent. A demonstrated 3C-iShop scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of iRAES architecture. As the experiment results show, iRAES can decrease the 70% effort for return administration evaluation and improve performance with return administration suggestions by 37%. Therefore, return administration and the knowledge management about product return can be accelerated via iRAES.

Experiments show that our MPI/OpenMP mixed mode codes can make the construction of approximate kNN graph faster and make the parallelization and implementation easier.

Several theoretical models have been proposed for solving this problem, such as probability theory, fuzzy sets, rough sets, cloud model, et al. Unfortunately, human deals with uncertain concepts based on words (concept intension), while computer based on sample set (concept extension). Many data mining and machine learning methods have been developed for extracting knowledge from data sets in recent years. These methods are unidirectional cognitive computing models from extension to intension. In this paper, a bidirectional cognitive computing model, cloud model, will be introduced. In the cloud model, forward cloud generator and backward cloud generator are designed for the bidirectional transformations between concept's intension and extension. Some experiment results will be discussed to show the validity and efficiency of cloud model for bidirectional cognitive computing.

Intrusion detection system has become a vital part in network security systems with wide spread use of computer networks. It has been the recent research focus and trend to apply various kinds of data mining techniques in IDS for discovering new types of attacks efficiently, but it is still in its infancy. The most difficult part is their poor performance and accuracy. This paper presents an innovative model, called MID, that counts maximal frequent patterns for detecting intrusions, needless to count all association rules, can significantly improve the accuracy and performance of an IDS. The experimental results show that MID is efficient and accurate for the attacks that occur intensively in a short period of time.

Meanwhile, it has been shown that Bayesian classifiers are competitive with many state-of-the-art classifiers. In this paper we present an approach that provides a good tradeoff for the Bayesian network classifier between the number of classified instances and classification accuracy, based on a measure of relative classification probability (RCP). Experiments on benchmark datasets show good support for our hypothesis. The same classifier could reach much higher accuracy over a subset of the original dataset. For most datasets, classification accuracy of the same classifiers can rise high without excluding many instances. The empirical study shows that this idea works well especially for the multiclass classification case.

In recent years, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning methods to predicting software defects. However, in their studies, the method in which the machine learning models are directly adopted may not be precise enough. Optimizing the machine learning models used in defects prediction will improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, aiming at the characteristics of the metrics mined from the open source software, we proposed three new defect prediction models based on C4.5 model. The new models introduce the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to the basis of choosing root node of the decision tree which makes the models better on defects prediction. In order to verify the effectiveness of the improved models, an experimental scheme is designed. In the experiment, we compared the prediction accuracies of the existing models and the improved models and the result showed that the improved models reduced the size of the decision tree by 49.91% on average and increased the prediction accuracy by 4.58% and 4.87% on two modules used in the experiment.

Intelligence-led counterterrorism framework based on data mining can be divided into four function modules: data storage, data pretreatment, data analysis and data visualization processor. The data mining process of counterterrorism's information analysis includes problem identification of counterterrorism, data preparation, data mining, model assessment and knowledge representation. Bayesian Belief Network is a very useful tool for data mining in intelligence-led counterterrorism. Terrorists more or less will leave the corresponding clues in premeditated, planning and implementing crime. However, it is harder than looking for a needle in a bottle of hay to use the existing technology and method to extract the anti-terrorist information from the clues! Because this kind of terrorism information which is covered in the magnitude of the general information is indefinite and unknown in time series and space. The traditional database retrieval system cannot respond to this inquiry. Artificial identification, mutatis mutandis, monitoring technology and the implementation of known goal detection all need lots of manpower, and it is powerless to search unknown target in voluminous information.

However, memory requirement and computational cost have become the bottleneck of CFI mining algorithms, particularly when confronting with large scale datasets, which herewith makes mining closed frequent itemset from large scale datasets a significant and challenging issue. To address the above issue, a parallelized AFOPT-close algorithm is proposed and implemented in this paper based on the cloud computing framework MapReduce, which is widely used to cope with large scale data. Furthermore, an efficient parallelized method for checking if a frequent itemset is globally closed is also proposed on the MapReduce platform to further improve the mining performance. Experimental results are then provided and analyzed to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods for mining closed frequent itemset.

It solves the short comings of the constrained resources of memory, computing power, and the power energy of the wireless sensor's terminal node in the Internet of Things. RA-AODVjr protocol is designed combining with the RA-Cluster and AODVjr routing protocol. This protocol selects the best neighbor in the terminal node and balances the network traffic when terminal node resource is constrained, using the relevance of the Ad hoc network. The simulation results show that the agreement achieves load balancing of energy constrained nodes to a certain extent. Compared with the original AODVjr protocol, due to the best neighbor node delivery technology, the local network traffic gets a better balance and less time delay means better choice of routing.

Clustering analysis is an important approach to deal with trajectories in data mining technology. However, existing trajectory clustering algorithm barely considers temporal information during clustering procedure. This paper proposes a clustering scheme for trajectories in road network environment. A trajectory on road network is represented by a sequence of interest points that each point indicates a real location on road segment. We define a distance measure to compute the spatial similarity between trajectories. then we propose a clustering algorithm based on DBSCAN and add temporal factor into it at the same time.

These algorithms by data from randomly selected set, select or deletion of swap some noise records of the transactions to make more meaningful rules can be extracted out of the future. We observed that the sample data set is composed of cluster transaction data. Each cluster consists of the similar nature of the information in some of the arguments. Therefore, the removal of outliers should be based on each cluster as a unit without the data set should be based on the entire sample. In order to consider for high-dimensional data encountered curse of dimensionality of the problem.

The relation is usually nonlinear since there are some interactions among the inherent but covert contributions from these previous records towards the final examination. Regarding the score of the final examination as the objective attribute and the previous records as the predictive attributes, the nonlinear multiregression based on the Choquet integral with respect to a nonadditive measure is a proper tool to catch the interaction and, therefore, describe above-mentioned relation well. In this paper, a 2-interactive measure is used as the nonadditive measure to reduce the computational complexity.

In this paper, we will propose a family of entropy-like measures over covers, which are anti monotonic with regard to the partial order defined by refinement relations of covers. In parallel to the entropy theory, we also develop their conditional forms, which in turn lead to a family of semi-metrics on covers. These make it possible to apply entropy-based techniques in data mining or machine learning to problems naturally modelled by covers.

This paper presents an essential improvement for extracting fuzzy association rules from a database. The objective of this paper is to improve the computational time of mining and to prune extracted redundant rules simultaneously for an actual data mining application. In this paper, we define the equivalence redundancy of fuzzy items and related theorems as a new concept for fuzzy data mining. Then, we propose a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing the equivalence redundancy of the fuzzy items based on redundancy concepts of fuzzy association rules. The essential performance of the algorithm is evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data. From the results, the method is found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant-rule pruning.

Testing Phishing Detection Criteria and Methods	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER EDUCATION	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Frontiers in Computer Education (ICFCE 2011)	DEC 01-02, 2011	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA			Security; Privacy; Phishing Detection; Machine Learning		Phishing attacks have increased in the last years despite the use of anti-phishing filters. This is mainly caused by the diversity of phishers trials and the improvement on targeting potential victims on internet. Usually phishers employ social engineering techniques trying to convince users to supply confidential data using the email as the dissemination vehicle. Phishers disguise attacks as trustworthy organizations by cloning websites. According to international monitoring, phishing causes real injury mainly to banks and government institutions. This paper proposes important features to detect phishing attacks employing data mining techniques to evaluate and compare them. In this work we have used public corpora of phishing messages. As a main result we have identified main phishing detection criteria, which have been evaluated and best accurate results were achieved using neural nets and decision trees.

Artificial Neural Networks and Logistic Regression are used to conduct classification and prediction. This study establishes models for vessels of different tonnage and operation purpose, which can provide the enforcers with clearer judgment criteria. The study results show that the application of Artificial Neural Networks to smuggling fishing vessel can get the average precision as high as 76.49%, the application of Logistic Regression to smuggling fishing vessel can get the average precision as high as 61.58%, both of which are of significantly higher efficiency compared with human inspection. The information technology can greatly help to increase the probabilities of seizing smuggling vessels, what's more, it can make better use of the data in the database to increase the probabilities of seizing smuggling crimes.

All of the seemingly small pieces of information added by billions of people result in a enormous rapidly changing dataset. Searching, correlating, and understanding billions of individual posts is a significant technical problem; even the data from a single site such as Twitter can be difficult to manage. In this paper, we present Coalmine a social network data-mining system. We describe the overall architecture of Coalmine including the capture, storage and search components. We also describe our experience with pulling 150-350 GB of Twitter data per day through their REST API. Specifically, we discuss our experience with the evolution of the Twitter data APIs from 2011 to 2012 and present strategies for maximizing the amount of data collected. Finally, we describe our experiences looking for evidence of botnet command and control channels and examining patterns of SPAM in the Twitter dataset.

Yet, the volatility of the stock price movement makes the task of predicting future condition of a stock market difficult to accomplish. One approach known to provide a safe strategy in stock trading is by collecting only those stocks, which are considered as liquid. The Indonesia Stock Exchange market (IDX) publishes this list of liquid stocks every six months (known as the LQ45 list). Having prior knowledge of stocks that will be in the upcoming LQ45 list would then be a great help to assist people who work in the Financial area in planning their future investment and gain profit.

Stock activities forecasting is still a challenging issue which is a high demand for stock actors. Therefore, there is still a need to develop an application that is capable to accurately predict directions of stock price movement. This research proposes a data mining technique to model relationship between company stocks with other company stocks listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange in a form of association rules. It is expected that extracted rules can be of a help to predict future stock prices movements with significant level of accuracy.

For example, consider a distribution p over a population V subset of {0, 1}(n). A noisy sample v' is obtained by choosing v according to p and flipping each coordinate of v with probability say 0.49 independently. The problem is to recover V, p as efficiently as possible from noisy samples. Such problems naturally arise in a variety of contexts in learning, clustering, statistics, computational biology, data mining and database privacy, where loss and error may be introduced by nature, inaccurate measurements, or on purpose. We give fairly efficient algorithms to recover the data under fairly general assumptions. Underlying our algorithms is a new structure we call a partial identification (PID) graph for an arbitrary finite set of vectors over any alphabet. This graph captures the extent to which certain subsets of coordinates in each vector distinguish it from other vectors. PID graphs yield strategies for dimension reductions and re-assembly of statistical information. The quality of our algorithms (sequential and parallel runtime, as well as numerical stability) critically depends on three parameters of PID graphs: width, depth and cost. The combinatorial heart of this work is showing that every set of vectors posses a PID graph in which all three parameters are small (we prove some limitations on their trade-offs as well). We further give an efficient algorithm to find such near-optimal PID graphs for any set of vectors. Our efficient PID graphs imply general algorithms for these recovery problems, even when loss or noise are just below the information-theoretic limit! In the learning/clustering context this gives a new algorithm for learning mixtures of binomial distributions (with known marginals) whose running time depends only quasi-polynomially on the number of clusters. We discuss implications to privacy and coding as well.

It has been suggested in previous work that some bugs are only identified as vulnerabilities long after the bug has been made public. These vulnerabilities are known as hidden impact vulnerabilities. This paper discusses existing bug data mining classifiers and present an analysis of vulnerability databases showing the necessity to mine common publicly available bug databases for hidden impact vulnerabilities. We present a vulnerability analysis from January 2006 to April 2011 for two well known software packages: Linux kernel and MySQL. We show that 32% (Linux) and 62% (MySQL) of vulnerabilities discovered in this time period were hidden impact vulnerabilities. We also show that the percentage of hidden impact vulnerabilities has increased from 25% to 36% in Linux and from 59% to 65% in MySQL in the last two years. We then propose a hidden impact vulnerability identification methodology based on text mining classifier for bug databases. Finally, we discuss potential challenges faced by a development team when using such a classifier.

Visual data mining methods aim at including a human observer in the loop and leveraging human perception for knowledge extraction. However, for large datasets, the rough knowledge gained via visualization is often times not sufficient. Thus, in such cases data summarization can provide a further insight into the problem at hand. Linguistic descriptors such as linguistic summaries and linguistic rules can be used in data summarization to further increase the understandability of datasets. This paper presents a Visual Linguistic Summarization tool (VLS-SOM) that combines the visual data mining capability of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with the understandability of linguistic descriptors. This paper also presents new quality measures for ranking of predictive rules. The presented data mining tool enables users to 1) interactively derive summaries and rules about interesting behaviors of the data visualized though the SOM, 2) visualize linguistic descriptors and visually assess the importance of generated summaries and rules. The data mining tool was tested on two benchmark problems. The tool was helpful in identifying important features of the datasets. The visualization enabled the identification of the most important summaries. For classification, the visualization proved useful in identifying multiple rules that classify the dataset.

Analysis tools that facilitate identifying causal relationships across multiple data sets are sorely needed. 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) has initiated research called Causal-View, a causal data-mining visualization tool, to address this challenge. Causal-View is built on an agent-enabled framework. Much of the processing that Causal-View will do is in the background. When a user requests information, Data Extraction Agents launch to gather information. This initial search is a raw, Monte Carlo type search designed to gather everything available that may have relevance to an individual, location, associations, and more. This data is then processed by Data-Mining Agents. The Data-Mining Agents are driven by user supplied feature parameters. If the analyst is looking to see if the individual frequents a known haven for insurgents he may request information on his last known locations. Or, if the analyst is trying to see if there is a pattern in the individual's contacts, the mining agent can be instructed with the type and relevance of the information fields to look at. The same data is extracted from the database, but the Data Mining Agents customize the feature set to determine causal relationships the user is interested in. At this point, a Hypothesis Generation and Data Reasoning Agents take over to form conditional hypotheses about the data and pare the data, respectively. The newly formed information is then published to the agent communication backbone of Causal-View to be displayed. Causal-View provides causal analysis tools to fill the gaps in the causal chain.

However, systematically assessing these environments remains a significant challenge. Traditional assessments, which focus on learning outcomes, seem incongruent with the process-oriented goals of project-based learning. Multimodal interfaces and multimodal learning analytics hold significant promise for assessing learning in open-ended learning environments. With its rich integration of a multitude of data streams and naturalistic interfaces, this area of research may help usher in a new wave of education reform by supporting alternative modes of learning.

However, they also cause a threat to privacy. In a very large database, there exists sensitive information that must be protected against unauthorized accesses. The confidentiality protection of the information has been a long-term goal pursued by the database security research community and the government statistical agencies. In this paper. we use the branch-and-bound strategies, which is one of the most efficient strategies to solve a large combinatorial problem. For take hidden every sensitiveness rule, hiding cost will be different from sensitiveness rule hidden order. We use the branch-and-bound algorithm to reach the best one hides order and minimum hiding cost. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of our approaches in terms of undesired side effects avoided in the rule hiding process. The results also revealed that in most cases, all the sensitive rules are hidden without generating spurious rules. First, the good scalability of our approach in terms of database sizes was achieved by using an efficient data structure FCET to store only maximal frequent itemsets instead of storing all frequent itemsets. Furthermore, in the framework, we combined the techniques for efficiently hiding sensitive rules with the transaction retrieval engine based on the FCET index tree. In particular, all research capitals before this, there is no order of considering every sensitive with hidden rule, because the interdependent complexity between the sensitive rules, cause the hidden order to influence the result seriously, so use branch-and-bound algorithm will make number of missing rules could be lowered as possible as we can.

Traditional clustering focuses on grouping similar objects, while two-way co-clustering can group dyadic data (objects as well as their attributes) simultaneously. In this research, we apply two-way co-clustering to the analysis of online advertising where both ads and users need to be clustered. However, in addition to the ad-user link matrix that denotes the ads which a user has linked, we also have two additional matrices, which represent extra information about users and ads. In this paper, we proposed a 3-staged clustering method that makes use of the three data matrices to enhance clustering performance. In addition, an Iterative Cross Co-Clustering (ICCC) algorithm is also proposed for two-way co-clustering. The experiment is performed using the advertisement and user data from Morgenstern, a financial social website that focuses on the agency of advertisements. The result shows that iterative cross co-clustering provides better performance than traditional clustering and completes the task more efficiently.

In this paper, Missing Categorical Data Imputation Based on Similarity (MIBOS) is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm defines a similarity model between objects with incomplete data, constructing the similarity matrix of objects and further gets the nearest undifferentiated object sets of each object to impute the missing data iteratively. In the imputing process, the imputed value will be directly applied to the same iteration and the following iterations. Experiments with three UCI benchmark data sets show the improvement of the proposed algorithm from perspectives of complete rate, accuracy and time efficiency.

The preference mining module is the kernel. This paper proposes a group-based user preference pattern mining method, which can be implemented as a preference mining module in this service. When the visiting traces that imply the preference of users are recorded, the method discovers user preference patterns with high representativeness and high discrimination from the historical visiting logs. According to the discovered model, collaborative recommendation can be accomplished, and then the intelligent navigation service can plan personalized touring path based on the recommendation lists. For demonstrating the performance of the proposed method, we engage some experiments, and then indicate the characteristics of the proposed method.

To build SVM model, firstly the trend in time series must be removed, and the target attribute should be normalized, secondly the size of the time window in which include all the lagged values should be determined, thirdly the machine learning method is used to construct SVM prediction model according to the time series data. Comparing with the traditional time series prediction model, SVM prediction models can reveal non-linear, non-stationary and randomness of the time series, and have higher prediction accuracy.

As datasets double in size every year, moving the data repeatedly to distant CPUs brings about high communication cost. In this paper, data cloud is utilized to implement DDM in order to move the data rather than moving computation. MapReduce is a popular programming model for implementing data-centric distributed computing. Firstly, a kind of cloud system architecture for DDM is proposed. Secondly, a modified MapReduce framework called pipelined MapReduce is presented. We select Apriori as a case study and discuss its implementation within MapReduce framework. Several experiments are conducted at last. Experimental results show that with moderate number of map tasks, the execution time of DDM algorithms (i.e., Apriori) can be reduced remarkably. Performance comparison between traditional and our pipelined MapReduce has shown that the map task and reduce task in our pipelined MapReduce can run in a parallel manner, and our pipelined MapReduce greatly decreases the execution time of DDM algorithm. Data cloud is suitable for a multitude of DDM algorithms and can provide significant speedups.

The previous one is best known for its capability of transforming data into high dimension feature space, while the latter one is well known for its natural interpretations and good performance. In this paper, we propose a robust kernel NMF approach using L-2,L-1 norm loss function. Compared with the standard NMF algorithm, the new robust kernel NMF updating algorithm is as elegant and as simple, but with the newly added robustness to handle significantly corrupted datasets because of using L-2,L-1 norm. Experiments on normal and occluded datasets indicate that robust kernel NMF always perform better than k-means and standard NMF.

Gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm is a powerful method in data mining and pattern recognition and it has been widely used in these areas since it was proposed. In this paper, the litho-geochemical data in Ha-da-men valley, Neimeng, China, is taken for a case study to illustrate the application of GEP in lithology identification and classification. Based on a geological conceptual model, geochemical concentration values, TiO2, FeO, MgO, K2O and H2O+ are selected as input variables in the GEP model. It does not only ease to explain the geological significances, but also reduces the number of variables so as to improve the computing speed. The results show that GEP could be a powerful method to effectively identify different lithology and recognize the key variables which could show different lithological characteristics from multivariable that the geochemical concentration values in various lithological rocks. This method may also be extended to remote sensing for various ground objects recognition in mineral exploration and prospecting.

The main contributions of MapCombine are as follows: (1) To avoid re-initialization of the runtime environment, a controller component is plugged into the general MapReduce model to schedule the iterations; (2) To process data without reloading the static subset, we modify the general MapReduce model surrounding combine phase to cache the fixed data and 4e the workload before processing; (3) To make the communication between the controller and the combiners flexible with the consideration of fault tolerance and downtime recovery, we append an interaction layer to the MapReduce implementation architecture. We also show performance comparisons between MapCombine and Mahout for four clustering algorithms, and then conclude that the average speedup ratio provided by MapCombine is 1.14.

For instance, it is generally beneficial to utilize the ambiguous unlabeled documents to learn a more robust classifier for text categorization under the semi-supervised learning setting. To handle general data ambiguities, we present a unified kernel learning framework named Input-Output Kernel Learning (IOKL). Based on our framework, we further propose a novel soft margin group sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation by introducing a group kernel slack variable to each group of base input-output kernels. Moreover, an efficient block-wise coordinate descent algorithm with an analytical solution for the kernel combination coefficients is developed to solve the proposed formulation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets for both semi-supervised learning and multiple instance learning tasks, and also apply our IOKL framework to a computer vision application called text-based image retrieval on the NUS-WIDE dataset. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IOKL framework.

Such data may be mapped into a time-based representation forming very long time series which could be effectively analyzed for valuable knowledge discovery. However, most of the times analyzing these time series has been proven a very complicated task especially when they are very large. This paper tackles the problem by proposing an optimization method for storing very large time series in suffix arrays for further analysis; and repeated pattern detection is proposed as well. Based on this method, the required part of the time series to be stored for repeated pattern detection can be reduced by at least 25%. The method was applied to DNA chains with length up to 100,000,000 characters long and the corresponding results are presented.

This short paper briefly explains our ongoing work on customer churn prediction for telecom services. We are working on data mining methods to accurately predict customers who will change and turn to another provider for the same or similar service. Sample dataset we use for our experiments has been compiled by Orange Telecom from real data. They posted the sample dataset for 2009 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Competition. IBM has scored the highest on this dataset requiring significant amount of computational resources. We are aiming to find alternative methods that can match or improve the recorded highest score with more efficient use of resources. Dataset has very large number of features, examples and incomplete values. As the first step, we employ some methods to preprocess the dataset for its imperfections. Then, we compare and contrast various ensemble and single classifiers. We conclude the paper with future directions for the study.

LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken. During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,, etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge. In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.

Therefore, mining to explore the useful information is necessary. In this paper attribute-oriented induction (AOI) algorithm and dividing hashing and array (DHA) association rule mining algorithm are used to find the useful association rules. The results of them are very similar. But there a few subtle difference. DHA mining results further reflect the relationship between the rules. The application of results shows that it can improve the genetic algorithm initial population fitness effectively.

Continuous auditing (CA), as a pattern of auditing based on the network information-technology, is the direction of the development of intenal auditing in enterprise groups. Technology approaches to continuous auditing can be summarized in two types: using embedded audit and applying separated audit system. Seperated continuous auditing is the mainstream of the study. To implement seperated continuous auditing (CA) in enterprise groups, favourable platform for online computer-assisted audit should be established, different internet connection modes should be adopted by different internal member enterprises, and data acquisition ways should be determined under different internet connection modes. Data processing technologies in continuous auditing (CA) in enterprise groups incloud data collection, data transmission, data storage and data processing. We can use online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining (DM) technologies to analyse the data. Applications of OLAP in continuous auditing mainly embodied in the following aspects: comparative analysis, ratio analysis, trend analysis, etc. The main data mining techniques applicated in continuous auditing include: statistical analysis, association analysis, clustering analysis, etc.	Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Business, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China	Yang, AJ (reprint author), Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Business, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.

While many people still don't know much about the benefit of it, yet the techniques could be applied to one's life by bio-detection and open-software. Cloud-Computing helps provide the best efficiency for human beings, and it presents acquisition (user interface service), business (marketing driven usage), access (internet & intranet), and technology (unlimited, dynamic and flexible). For instance, the heart beat detection can be detected by the portable sensors which typically send the health information though the RFID, gather into the media gateway (mini-computer), and then upload it to the public server system. In a few seconds, the animated heart graphic with the calculated data soon replies back to the mobile computing gateway, displaying the 3D graphics of heart in order to prevent the heart stroke or monitor diseases. All this performance is going through the wireless radio frequency methodology, and its arithmetic process is finished by the remote computing servers that decrease the loading of mobile media devices. The tremendous value is the lowest cost for common users and the capability to provide the best medical care from the integration of the cyber system. Very much of product sense in the "Cloud Computer" will be the trend to compound the Bio- and Openapplications.

Although these sensors can be inexpensive, they are often relatively unreliable when deployed in harsh environments characterized by a vast amount of noisy and uncertain data, such as urban traffic control, earthquake zones, and battlefields. The data gathered by distributed sensors-which serve as the eyes and ears of the system-are delivered to a decision center or a gateway sensor node that interprets situational information from the data streams. Although many other machine learning techniques have been extensively studied, real-time data mining of high-speed and nonstationary data streams represents one of the most promising WSN solutions. This paper proposes a novel stream mining algorithm with a programmable mechanism for handling missing data. Experimental results from both synthetic and real-life data show that the new model is superior to standard algorithms.

As an impact factor of the quality of process mining results, the degree of completeness of the given event log should be necessarily measured. In this paper an approach is proposed in the context of mining control-flow dependencies to evaluate the local completeness of an event log without knowing any information about the original process model. Experiment results show that the proposed approach works robustly and gives better estimation than approaches available.

Although the Inductive logic programming-ILP can flexibly express the multi-relation data,the background knowledge and the complex mode involving multi-relationship in process of relational learning and multi-relationship data mining, but the problems of predicate invention and utility are also difficult to solve and remain open problems in knowledge discovery based on first-order logic. The high-order logic knowledge representation can solve the problem effectively. For the higher-order logic knowledge representation formalism-Escher can express all kinds of complex structured data. It not only can provide strong guidance on the search for frequent patterns with its strong typed syntax but also can resolve the problem of the invention of new predicates with its higher-order characteristic. It is fit for knowledge discovery in complex structured data. This paper will investigate the knowledge discovery in complex structured data by employing Escher as knowledge representation formalism. In the case of algorithms, clustering of complex structured data is studied in it and experimental verification of its effectiveness.

Tensor is a mathematical representation of high-dimensional data (multidimensional array). Tensor decomposition technique can convert the high-dimensional data into the low-dimension data effectively and the more and more applied in the field of data mining, such as Tucker, CP, HOSVD, PARAFAC decomposition method so on. The modularity network analysis method can be used to the spectrum clustering. So we propose a novel link clustering algorithm based on higher order tensor analysis methods and modularity network analysis. Using modularity approach to analysis networks, using multi-dimensional tensor expressed in the form of complex multi-link data. using Tucker tensor decomposition method to reduce the dimensions of the data and the time and space complexity of the algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm is tested in complex network environment and proved that is better than the kindred algorithms.

It has the advantages of high accuracy. high learning speed and the ability of dealing with high dimensional data. The decision model from the training process. however, is non-deterministic because of the sampling process. Although we can calculate correlations between different decision trees to infer the performance. it's not comprehensive to non-specialists. So. the goal of this project is to find a way of visualizing the learning process and the final model using 3D techniques. As a consequence, it can help in model selection by visualizing the patterns of different trees in terms of density. similarity and so on. Moreover, it can help users to understand how rules are learnt and then applied in decision making. Finally, it can provide an interactive interface for manual modifications (e.g. pruning).

Coverings are naturally relevant to topologies. Reduction is one of the most important issues in covering rough set theory. Therefore, there is an endogenous relation between reducts of a covering and topologies. With both theoretical and practical significance, exploring the topological interdependency between coverings and its granular reducts raises the application of topological methods in data mining. In this study we find that the N-reducts of a covering are the minimal subbases of the induced topology. The correlations suggest several simplified granular reduction algorithms in covering rough sets.

Sometimes, the user doesn't need a standard document, but a parameter, a term, a kind of specification or a method. On the other side, sometimes the user needs a series of standards as directives of activities. In general, a standard application system is expected to understand and focus on the user need quickly and exactly. The combination of XML and data mining will make this expectation true. This paper discusses how standards drafting and retrieval benefit from XML and data mining, and proposes a uniform standard model with which a variety of XML schemas can be designed. In the end, a schema for general layer of the structured standard model is proposed and verified.

Many approaches have been proposed for mining frequent patterns by applying the FP-tree structure to improve the efficiency of the FP-Growth algorithm which needs to recursively construct sub-trees. Although these approaches do not need to recursively construct many sub-trees, they also suffer the problem of a large search space, such that the performances for the previous approaches degrade when the database is massive or the threshold for mining frequent patterns is low. In order to reduce the search space and speed up the mining process, we propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent patterns based on frequent pattern tree. Our algorithm generates a sub-tree for each frequent item and then generates candidates in batch from this sub-tree. For each candidate generation, our algorithm only generates a small set of candidates, which can significantly reduce the search space. The experimental results also show that our algorithm outperforms the previous approaches.

J	Yoo, JS; Bow, M				Yoo, Jin Soung; Bow, Mark			Mining spatial colocation patterns: a different framework	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Spatial association patterns; Colocation mining	ITEMSETS	Recently, there has been considerable interest in mining spatial colocation patterns from large spatial datasets. Spatial colocation patterns represent the subsets of spatial events whose instances are often located in close geographic proximity. Most studies of spatial colocation mining require the specification of two parameter constraints to find interesting colocation patterns. One is a minimum prevalent threshold of colocations, and the other is a distance threshold to define spatial neighborhood. However, it is difficult for users to decide appropriate threshold values without prior knowledge of their task-specific spatial data. In this paper, we propose a different framework for spatial colocation pattern mining. To remove the first constraint, we propose the problem of finding N-most prevalent colocated event sets, where N is the desired number of colocated event sets with the highest interest measure values per each pattern size. We developed two alternative algorithms for mining the N-most patterns. They reduce candidate events effectively and use a filter-and-refine strategy for efficiently finding colocation instances from a spatial dataset. We prove the algorithms are correct and complete in finding the N-most prevalent colocation patterns. For the second constraint, a distance threshold for spatial neighborhood determination, we present various methods to estimate appropriate distance bounds from user input data. The result can help an user to set a distance for a conceptualization of spatial neighborhood. Our experimental results with real and synthetic datasets show that our algorithmic design is computationally effective in finding the N-most prevalent colocation patterns. The discovered patterns were different depending on the distance threshold, which shows that it is important to select appropriate neighbor distances.

They collect customer evaluations regarding the quality of content, provided service, or movie, and use the data for the subsequent recommendation of new products and services. When a customer evaluates a specific object with the rating ranging from 1 to 5, it is easy to interpret the extreme values like 1 or 5; however, when the earned rating is 3 - the mid-point value - it is difficult to understand clearly whether it is positive or negative. As the rating 3 refers to the average value as well as the median value, we considered that it is more effective to use the average value instead of the rating 3 because it reflects all ratings evaluated by customers. In this study, combined with the prediction system using the neural network, we obtain improvement in the analysis of commercial data by using the average value compared with unadjusted ambiguous ratings.

In recent several years, a few clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. However these algorithms lack of extensibility or efficiency. In this paper we propose a new evolving data streams system with data fusion. We discuss a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering which is guided by application centered requirements. The system is highly suitable for real-time implementation and is demonstrated through a series of experiments. The experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency.

When there are sufficient data samples and good representations, traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means can work well. But when the number of samples is small and the data representation is bad, direct use of clustering may yield bad results. In this paper we propose a new algorithm TCTC(Topic-Constraint Transfer Clustering), which is an instance of unsupervised transfer learning, to cluster a small number of unlabeled data with the help of sufficient and better represented auxiliary data. First several latent topics are extracted from the clusters of the auxiliary data. Then the affinities between target data samples and topics are discovered to "guide" the disseminated data clustering. Finally semi-supervised clustering algorithm is applied on target data. The experiments demonstrate our method is quite effective to solve the problem of disseminated and ill-presented data clustering.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naive Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as "normal" or "anomalous" to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.

Duration constraint defined the time-stamp difference between the first and last transactions must be longer or shorter than a given integer. But it can not solve the problem that time-stamp difference between the first and last transactions is infinite. In this paper a new constraint called the partial-order constraint is introduced, which can solve the problem of time-stamp difference between the first and last transactions is infinite. The algorithm of simple updating frequent sequential pattern and sequential pattern maintenance algorithm are proposed based on partial-order constraint. The first algorithm is very simple and suits for the case that the constraint does not change the number of customer sequences. The second algorithm makes full use of the information obtained from previous mining processes, and adopts implicit segmentation technique which segments dissatisfy constraint sequences from the existing ones if their customer ids are the same.

Most existing methods for time series clustering rely on distances calculated from the entire raw data using the Euclidean distance or Dynamic Time Warping distance as the distance measure. However, the presence of significant noise, dropouts, or extraneous data can greatly limit the accuracy of clustering in this domain. Moreover, for most real world problems, we cannot expect objects from the same class to be equal in length. As a consequence, most work on time series clustering only considers the clustering of individual time series "behaviors," e. g., individual heart beats or individual gait cycles, and contrives the time series in some way to make them all equal in length. However, contriving the data in such a way is often a harder problem than the clustering itself. In this work, we show that by using only some local patterns and deliberately ignoring the rest of the data, we can mitigate the above problems and cluster time series of different lengths, i.e., cluster one heartbeat with multiple heartbeats. To achieve this we exploit and extend a recently introduced concept in time series data mining called shapelets. Unlike existing work, our work demonstrates for the first time the unintuitive fact that shapelets can be learned from unlabeled time series. We show, with extensive empirical evaluation in diverse domains, that our method is more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, in addition to accurate clustering results, we show that our work also has the potential to give insights into the domains to which it is applied.

The SCECM adopts a differentiated sampling rate algorithm based on an improved Adaboost algorithm and further employs some unique classifier-selection strategy, novel classifier integration approach and original classification decision-making method. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed approach improves performance for the minority class while preserving the ability to recognize examples from the majority classes.

But traditional virtual organization based access control frameworks are not suitable for self-organizing, ad-hoc and opportunistic scientific collaborations, in which scientists can easily set up group-oriented authorization rules across the administrative domains to share their resources by flexible and effective access control. Using the emerging OAuth2.0 protocol and XACML framework, this paper introduces a novel Open Social based access control framework to support ad-hoc team formation and user-controlled resource sharing. To verify the effectiveness of our authorization framework, we develop a infant birth-defect data and data mining resource-sharing application. Our experiences demonstrate that the proposed framework is a very promising approach to resource sharing in cross-domain network environments.

Many works have been conducted to achieve k-anonymity. OLA (Optimal Lattice Anonymization) is an efficient full-domain optimal algorithm among these works. The OLA algorithm uses a binary search to traverse the lattice and marks all the k-anonymous nodes, the process of which is time-consuming. In this paper, an improved algorithm based on OLA algorithm is proposed. We firstly computed the product of degree for each node in the lattice and selected the biggest one to judge whether it was k-anonymous; this changed the traversal sequence of binary search. Then, we introduced the conception of support from data mining, and augmented the structure of generalization hierarchy associated with the information of support. As a result there is no need to scan the entire data table repeatedly and we can find all k-anonymous nodes more efficiently.

To Lay the foundation for fine logging evaluation of igneous reservoir in Songnan gas field, the identification method of igneous rock lithology is researched. Common crossplot method identify lithology with only two logging parameters, its precision is not high. To improve the accuracy of dentification, the data mining software, named as weak, is used, three data mining methods, including Association Rule, Decision Tree, Support vector machine, are applied in lithology identification. The results show that these methods can improve the accuracy of lithology identification, in particular, Decision Tree model has the highest recognition accuracy, while it is relatively easy to understand, so it can be used as auxiliary tools for recognition of igneous rocks. Decision Tree model is used to process logging data of exploratory well, and its computation results are well consistent with the core thin section data.

To launch reliable and trusted vehicular communications, one prerequisite is to ensure peer vehicles' credibility, by means of digital certificate validation from messages that are sent out by other vehicles. However, in vehicular communication systems, certificate validation is more time sensitive than in traditional networks, because each vehicle receives a large number of messages in a short period of time. Another issue that needs to be tackled is the unsuccessful delivery of information between vehicles and other entities on the road due to their high rate of mobility. For these reasons, we need new solutions to speed up the process of certificate validation. In this article, we propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme; this uses the concept of clustering in the realm of data mining, which can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of k-means clustering to boost up the efficiency of certificate validation, thereby enhancing the security of VANETs. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis in terms of security for the scheme is presented; and the analytical results demonstrate that this scheme can effectively improve the validation of a certificate, thus securing the vehicular communication in vehicular networks.

The classical Apriori algorithm is an efficient one for that. Aimed at the performance bottlenecks of multiply scanning the database and generating a large quantity of candidate itemsets in Apriori algorithm, an improved algorithm of mining association rules is presented for the bottleneck problem. Filtering out the transactions unconcerned with mining targets by a presupposed filter, on the one hand, the improved Apriori algorithm can compresses database and reduces scanning times; on another hand, the number of candidate itemsets also decreases with it, so the improvement strategy can greatly improves the whole performance of the algorithm. The application of improved Apriori algorithm in traffic accident data mining also shows that it is very practical and efficient in data mining.

The algorithm in this paper doesn't extract all rules, but a subset of all rules which is called rule-generating set. Consequently, it can be used to get all rules. Due to the fact that number of the rule-generating set is smaller than all rules, the efficiency of mining is increased. This kind of algorithm can not gain confidence as well as support from each rule while other algorithm can. It only gets all rules those support and confidence is larger than threshold that is given by user.

Automatic Data Clustering Analysis of Arbitrary Shape with K-means and Enhanced Ant-based Template Mechanism	2012 IEEE 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (COMPSAC)	Proceedings International Computer Software & Applications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	JUL 16-20, 2012	Izmir, TURKEY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol	Izmir Inst Technol (IZTECH)			With the advancement of miniature sensors, wireless networking and context awareness, the importance of data-intensive computing is on the rise, with practical applications such as web categorization and data mining. One of the critical challenges in data-intensive computing is data clustering, as effective clustering algorithm will enable researchers and automated systems to analyze and organize massive amount of data much more efficiently. Many data clustering algorithms already exist, but most require a priori knowledge on the number of classes to guide the clustering process. We propose Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape, a two-phase algorithm, for automatically forming optimal number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. The first phase uses the hybrid approach of K-means and enhanced Ant-based template mechanism to generate small seed clusters with high purity in each cluster. In the second phase, small clusters are iteratively merged to obtain the final clusters using a merging algorithm. We apply Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape to 8 widely-used datasets, and compare the clustering results with two approaches based on density-based algorithm (DBSCAN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results show that Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape is very effective and thus achieve good clustering results in near optimal number of clusters without knowing the number of classes in advance.

Pawlak rough set theory provides a solid theoretical basis for processing incomplete or inconsistent data described by nominal attributes. However, it fails to deal with real classification tasks, in which most of the sample sets are numerical data Recently, neighborhood covering methods based on rough sets demonstrate promising views in classification rule learning. These methods apply to numerical or complex data. In this paper, we put forward new neighborhood covering rule learning algorithms. We redefine the neighborhood radius to generalize the model, experiments produce good results in reducing the rule number, and more powerful generalization ability is expected. In terms of rule learning strategy, we combine kernel covering method, create an optimization classification hyperplane, and solve quadratic programming problem to train support coverings, like support vectors in SVM. Experiments show good classification performance of our improved algorithm.

J	Zhang, Y; Yeung, DY				Zhang, Yu; Yeung, Dit-Yan			Transfer Metric Learning with Semi-Supervised Extension	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Metric learning; transfer learning; multitask learning; semi-supervised learning	REGULARIZATION; ALGORITHM	Distance metric learning plays a very crucial role in many data mining algorithms because the performance of an algorithm relies heavily on choosing a good metric. However, the labeled data available in many applications is scarce, and hence the metrics learned are often unsatisfactory In this article, we consider a transfer-learning setting in which some related source tasks with labeled data are available to help the learning of the target task. We first propose a convex formulation for multitask metric learning by modeling the task relationships in the form of a task covariance matrix. Then we regard transfer learning as a special case of multitask learning and adapt the formulation of multitask metric learning to the transfer-learning setting for our method, called transfer metric learning (TML). In TML, we learn the metric and the task covariances between the source tasks and the target task under a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem has an efficient solution. Moreover, in many applications, some unlabeled data is also available in the target task, and so we propose a semi-supervised extension of TML called STML to further improve the generalization performance by exploiting the unlabeled data based on the manifold assumption. Experimental results on some commonly used transfer-learning applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we present an automated approach to intrusions detection in order to maintain sufficient performance and reduce dependence on execution environment. We discuss a hidden Markov model strategy for abnormality detection using frequent system call sequences, letting us identify attacks and intrusions automatically and efficiently. We also propose an automated mining algorithm, named AGAS, to generate frequent system call sequences. In our approach, the detection performance is adaptively tuned according to the execution state every period. To improve performance, the period value is also under self-adjustment.

But in many circumstances, the fitting accuracy is not good as the model only considers original features. We often add combination features which are products of the original features to the classifier model to improve the accuracy. Meanwhile, the combination features cause a serious problem. They dramatically increase the number of features, which is called "feature dimension explosion". Traditional algorithms can hardly afford this because they need to input all the features at the beginning of processing. Grafting method provides an incremental way to solve the problem, which only adds one feature at a time. However, Grafting method has very low efficiency when the dimension of the feature space is huge and sparse. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Grafting algorithm and PV filter method to solve the feature dimension explosion problem. Our algorithm significantly improves the computational efficiency by reducing the steps of model optimizing, and reduces the scale of feature space by applying a very simple filter strategy to make the algorithm work effectively. Our experiments on real data show that we can easily generate and select combination features by using the adaptive Grafting algorithm and PV filter method, which significantly raises the fitting accuracy of the model.

They can not only improve the performance of the classifier, but also reduce the space of the storage. Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm is a modified Evolutionary Algorithms, which has some advantages over classical Evolutionary Algorithms such as the fast convergence speed and few parameters need to be tuned. In this paper, we proposed a bottom-up, global, dynamic, and supervised discretization method on the basis of Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively improve the accuracy of classifier.

In addition, the sensor nodes have limited resources and use unstable wireless link for communication, which cause wireless sensor networks various problems in the actual operation. Therefore, the real-time monitoring tools are needed to maintain the operation of wireless sensor networks, which are capable of monitoring network operating conditions, assessing network performance, detecting network failure and optimizing network operation. A network monitoring and packet sniffing tool for wireless sensor networks (NSSN) is presented and implemented in this paper. As a kind of real-time monitoring tools based sniffers, NSSN can capture the radio packets from the normal nodes using NSSNer nodes, so that it can monitor network status, find network problems and optimize network configuration without any interference in the normal operation of wireless sensor networks. The functions which NSSN has implemented include network monitoring, protocol parsing and display, network diagnosis and performance measurement, data mining and statistical analysis. According to the actual deployment, NSSN has been verified good monitoring performance.

Further, information from multiple sources brings up new challenges for information presentation. In this paper, we design and implement a Disaster Situation Reporting System (Disaster SitRep) that is essentially a disaster information collecting, integration, and presentation platform to address three critical tasks that can facilitate information acquisition, integration and presentation by utilizing domain knowledge as well as public and private web resources for major disaster recovery planning and management. Our proposed techniques create a disaster domain-specific search engine and a geographical information presentation and navigation platform using advanced data mining and information retrieval techniques for disaster preparedness and recovery that helps impacted communities better understand the current disaster situation. Specifically, hierarchical clustering with constraints are used to automatically update existing disaster concept hierarchy; taxonomy-based focused crawling component is developed to automatically detect, parse and filter those relevant web resources; a domain-oriented skeleton for each type of disasters is used to extract disaster events from disaster documents by defining the set of structural attributes. Furthermore, the platform can perform not only as a domain-specific search engine but also as an information monitoring and analysis tool for decision support during recovery phase of disasters.

Many data mining and statistical methods have been applied to this field. Extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier as a type of generalized single hidden layer feed-forward networks has been used in many applications and achieve good classification accuracy. Thus, we use ELM (kernel based) as a classification tool to perform the credit risk evaluation in this paper. The simulations are done on two credit risk evaluation datasets with three different kernel functions. Simulation results show that the kernel based ELM is more suitable for credit risk evaluation than the popular used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with consideration of overall, good and bad accuracies.

ISDI integrates traditional meteorological data, remotely sensed indices, and biophysical data, and attempt to describe drought from a more comprehensive perspective. The evaluation results indicated that the construction models for three phases of growth season have very high regression accuracy. The drought condition can be predicted using the independent variables. The practical application of ISDI in mid-eastern china also demonstrated that ISDI has good application accuracy in mid-eastern China. ISDI results were corresponding to the disaster observation records of agro-meteorological sites. It can be potentially extended to nationwide near real time drought monitoring.

It can benefit many P2P applications, such as load balancing analysis, query processing, and data mining. Inspired by the inversion method for random variate generation, in this paper we present a novel model named distribution-free data density estimation for dynamic ring-based P2P networks to achieve high estimation accuracy with low estimation cost regardless of distribution models of the underlying data. It generates random samples for any arbitrary distribution by sampling the global cumulative distribution function and is free from sampling bias. In P2P networks, the key idea for distribution-free estimation is to sample a small subset of peers for estimating the global data distribution over the data domain. Algorithms on computing and sampling the global cumulative distribution function based on which global data distribution is estimated are introduced with detailed theoretical analysis. Our extensive performance study confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in ring-based P2P networks.

In this paper, we show a dense matrix X's low-rank approximation can be rapidly built from its left and right random projections Y-1 = X A(1) and Y-2 = X-T A(2), or bilateral random projection (BRP). We then show power scheme can further improve the precision. The deterministic, average and deviation bounds of the proposed method and its power scheme modification are proved theoretically. The effectiveness and the efficiency of BRP based low-rank approximation is empirically verified on both artificial and real datasets.

Self-training algorithms are among the earliest attempts of using unlabeled data to enhance learning. Traditional self-training algorithms label unlabeled data on which classifiers trained on limited training data have the highest confidence. In this paper, a self-training algorithm that decreases the disagreement region of hypotheses is presented. The algorithm supplements the training set with self-labeled instances. Only instances that greatly reduce the disagreement region of hypotheses are labeled and added to the training set. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed self-training algorithm can effectively improve classification performance.

The main challenge lies in finding a robust learning model that is insensitive to unpredictable malicious data distribution. In this paper, we present a sparse relevance vector machine ensemble for adversarial learning. The novelty of our work is the use of individualized kernel parameters to model potential adversarial attacks during model training. We allow the kernel parameters to drift in the direction that minimizes the likelihood of the positive data. This step is interleaved with learning the weights and the weight priors of a relevance vector machine. Our empirical results demonstrate that an ensemble of such relevance vector machine models is more robust to adversarial attacks.

It, however, can't help us find out the hot topics. Nowadays, there are some researchers working on the comparative analysis about different tools as same as PubMed, and some other ones bend themselves to data mining on one special field. Our research is finding out the hot topics by analyzing the numbers of publications of some keywords. Here we referred to Time Magazine to list 34 keywords, used E-utilities to get the numbers of publications from PubMed automatically. By analyzing these numbers we can then conclude the hot topics in recent years.

In this algorithm, the computing of multi-dimensional frequent items is converted to computing of equivalence class with multi-attributes. So, the number and content of multi-dimensional frequent items and association rules produced by this algorithm are limited by interesting dimensions which are assigned by user. Compared with Apriori algorithm, this algorithm reduces the number of accessing and scanning database. So this algorithm decreases the time of computing association rules and is efficient.

In this paper, as a step forward to analyzing patterns within an event sequence, we propose a novel algorithm FCEMiner (Frequent Closed Episodes Miner) for discovering all frequent closed episodes. To characterise the followed-by-closely relationships over event types well and aviod over-counting the support of long episodes, FCEMiner takes both minimal and non-overlapping occurrences of an episode into consideratin. To perform iterative episode growth without generating any candidate, FCEMiner utilizes the depth-first search strategy with Apriori Property. To save the cost of post-processign on frequent episodes, FCEMiner checks the closures of some episodes during each valid episode growth. A set of performance studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithm is more efficient and effective.

Calculating transient state probability of components in future short time duration is one of the key issues in power system operation risk assessment. In this paper, a novel probability distribution named'log-normal distribution'was presented for component fault repair time. The shape of probability density of log-normal distribution can describe the distribution characteristics of component fault repair times well. When the history data is limited, it can be used to calculate the instantaneous state probability, the method is simple and easy to use. But, if the system has a large amount of historical data, it will be suitable to establish the discrete model of repair time with data mining methods. Based on the information entropy weight allocation method, a real-time discrete model was established in this paper. The model can relatively accurate predict component repair time under various operation conditions. The results of example show that, if historical data is limited, a log-normal distribution can better meet characteristics of probability distribution of the actual sample, the transient state probability will be got accurately. When there is a large amount of historical data, discrete model established by data mining method is accurate and effective, can be very good to meet the field.

While several episode mining approaches have been proposed in the last fifteen years, most of the developed techniques have not been evaluated on a common benchmark data set, limiting the insights gained from experimental evaluations. In particular, it is unclear how well episodes are actually being recovered, leaving an episode mining user without guidelines in the knowledge discovery process. One reason for this can be found in non-disclosure agreements that prevent real life data sets on which approaches have been evaluated from entering the public domain. But even easily accessible real life data sets would not allow to ascertain miners' abilities to identify underlying patterns. A solution to this problem can be seen in generating artificial data, which has the added advantage that patterns can be known, allowing to evaluate the accuracy of mined patterns. Based on insights and experiences stemming from consultations with industrial partners and work with real life data, we propose a data generator for the generation of diverse data sets that reflect realistic data characteristics. We discuss in detail which characteristics real life data can be expected to have and how our generator models them. Finally, we show that we can recreate artificial data that has been used in the literature, contrast it with real life data showing very different characteristics, and show how our generator can be used to create data with realistic characteristics.

By applying an n-gram model to HTTP requests from network logs, feature matrices are formed. GHSOMs are then used to analyze these matrices and detect anomalous requests among new requests received by the web-server. The system proposed is self-adaptive and allows detection of online malicious attacks in the case of continuously updated web-applications. The method is tested with network logs, which include normal and intrusive requests. Almost all anomalous requests from these logs are detected while keeping the false positive rate at a very low level.

WALL emphasizes learner autonomy and provides abundant resources for learner to choose freely, but it lacks the mechanism to provide customized and personalized guidance in accordance with each learner's preferences and characteristics. Through data mining on-line learning traces, we can discover some valuable information about the learners and their habitual use of teaching resources, based on which, some recommendations can be given to each learner by the system. It makes WALL more individualized and intelligent. This paper presents the framework of this extended data mining system on WALL and describes in detail the functions and operations of each module, followed by the description of the basic algorithms of the central module. Finally, it confirms the feasibility and the far-reaching pedagogical implications of this data mining application.

Active tool for human activity data collection	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								Sensor-based human activity data (HAD) collection, used for engineering human activity recognition (HAR) systems, is a cumbersome process. Its success depends on two factors: correct activity labels and correct sensor activation sequence. This is very hard to achieve, as is seen in many previous studies. Therefore, a system for automatically observing HAD collection is introduced, making it a lot easier and less noisy. At the heart of the system sits a novel data mining tool that uses Web activity data to achieve the above goal. The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown using a set of two experiments.

A Novel Pruning Algorithm for Optimizing Feedforward Neural Network of Classification Problems	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Input and hidden neurons pruning; Significant measure; Classification; Backpropagation training algorithm; Multilayer feedforward neural network; Data mining	MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS; CONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM; LOCAL MINIMA; OPTIMIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; NUMBER	Optimizing the structure of neural networks is an essential step for the discovery of knowledge from data. This paper deals with a new approach which determines the insignificant input and hidden neurons to detect the optimum structure of a feedforward neural network. The proposed pruning algorithm, called as neural network pruning by significance (N2PS), is based on a new significant measure which is calculated by the Sigmoidal activation value of the node and all the weights of its outgoing connections. It considers all the nodes with significance value below the threshold as insignificant and eliminates them. The advantages of this approach are illustrated by implementing it on six different real datasets namely iris, breast-cancer, hepatitis, diabetes, ionosphere and wave. The results show that the proposed algorithm is quite efficient in pruning the significant number of neurons on the neural network models without sacrificing the networks performance.

The proposed algorithm is based on association analysis and adopts the antecedent ergodicity and the consequent pruning strategy to ensure the completeness of mined control rules and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, the improved fuzzy support and the fuzzy consequent strength measurements are proposed to ensure the accuracy of mined control rules. The experimental results verify that the performance of our control rules generation algorithm is better and the fuzzy controller, whose control rules are obtained automatically by the proposed algorithm on the real field database of ball mill pulverizing system, has higher control quality. In addition, the proposed fuzzy controller has been put into practice and the field data verify the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller.

In this paper, the similarities between traffic flow objects with spatial temporal characteristics were measured by introducing the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the shortest path analysis method. We proposed a new fuzzy clustering algorithm for road network traffic flow data. So that traffic flow data objects with similar properties and space correlation are clustered into a group, which find the spatial distribution pattern of road traffic flow. The experimental results show that the method was valid and effective. The road network was classified reasonably, and classification results could provide traffic zone division with decision auxiliary support.

The goal of region discovery is to identify interesting regions in geo-referenced datasets based on a domain expert's notion of interestingness. Almost all agglomerative clustering algorithms only focus on the first challenge. The goal of the proposed work is to develop agglomerative clustering frameworks that deal with all four challenges. In particular, we propose a generic agglomerative clustering framework for geo-referenced datasets (GAC-GEO) generalizing agglomerative clustering by allowing for three plug-in components. GAC-GEO agglomerates neighboring clusters maximizing a plug-in fitness function that capture the notion of interestingness of clusters. It enhances typical agglomerative clustering algorithms in two ways: fitness functions support task-specific clustering, whereas generic neighboring relationships increase the number of merging candidates. We also demonstrate that existing agglomerative clustering algorithms can be considered as specific cases of GAC-GEO. We evaluate the proposed framework on an artificial dataset and two real-world applications involving region discovery. The experimental results show that GAC-GEO is capable of identifying arbitrarily shaped hotspots for different data mining tasks.

J	Kim, C; Miao, H; Shim, K				Kim, Chulyun; Miao, Hui; Shim, Kyuseok			CATCH: A detecting algorithm for coalition attacks of hit inflation in internet advertising	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Click fraud; Hit inflation; Coalition attack; Internet advertising; Graph mining; Data mining		As the Internet flourishes, online advertising becomes essential for marketing campaigns for business applications. To perform a marketing campaign, advertisers provide their advertisements to Internet publishers and commissions are paid to the publishers of the advertisements based on the clicks made for the posted advertisements or the purchases of the products of which advertisements posted. Since the payment given to a publisher is proportional to the amount of clicks received for the advertisements posted by the publisher, dishonest publishers are motivated to inflate the number of clicks on the advertisements hosted on their web sites. Since the click frauds are critical for online advertising to be reliable, the online advertisers make the efforts to prevent them effectively. However, the methods used for click frauds are also becoming more complex and sophisticated. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting coalition attacks of click frauds. The coalition attacks of click fraud is one of the latest sophisticated techniques utilized for click frauds because the fraudsters can obtain not only more gain but also less probability of being detected by joining a coalition. We introduce new definitions for the coalition and propose the novel algorithm called CATCH to find such coalitions. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real-life data sets confirm that our notion of coalition allows us to detect coalitions much more effectively than that of previous work.

Hybrid soft computing techniques for feature selection and parameter optimization in power quality data mining	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Support vector machine; Simulated annealing; Genetic algorithm; Power quality; Wavelet transform	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CONTINUOUS-VARIABLES; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Recognition of the presence of any power disturbance and classifying any existing disturbance into a particular type is the first step in combating the power quality problem. In spite of the extensive number of power disturbances classification methods, a research on the selection of useful features from the existing feature set and the parameter optimization for specific classifiers was omitted. The kernel parameters setting for support vector machine (SVM) classifier in training process along with feature selection will significantly impact the classification accuracy. Two novel wrapper based hybrid soft computing techniques are proposed in this paper for feature selection and parameters optimization to classify nine types of power disturbances without degrading the SVM classification accuracy. The feature items were selected from discrete wavelet transform across several decomposition levels of the disturbance signals and from the duration of disturbance occurrence. This analysis selects the more useful feature set and optimized parameters for two types of kernels namely the polynomial kernel and radial basis function kernel for SVM. Compared with the traditional grid algorithm the proposed genetic algorithm and simulated annealing based approach significantly improves the classification accuracy rate by eliminating relatively useless feature items and proper parameter selection for the classifier.

J	Novakova, L; Stepankova, O				Novakova, Lenka; Stepankova, Olga			Visualization of trends using RadViz	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time series; Data visualization; RadViz		Data mining is sometimes treating data consisting of items representing measurements of a single property taken in different time points. In this case data can be understood as a time series of one feature. It is no exception when the clue for evaluation of such data is related to their development trends as observed in several successive time points. From the qualitative point of view one can distinguish three basic types of behaviour between two neighbouring time points: the value of the feature is stable (remains the same), it grows or it falls. This paper is concerned with identification of typical qualitative development patterns as they appear in the windows of given length in the considered time-stamped data and their utilization for specification of interesting subgroups.

Mining emerging patterns remains a challenge, especially with graph data. In this paper, we propose a method to mine the whole set of frequent emerging graph patterns, given a frequency threshold and an emergence threshold. Our results are achieved thanks to a change of the description of the initial problem so that we are able to design a process combining efficient algorithmic and data mining methods. Moreover, we show that the closed graph patterns are a condensed representation of the frequent emerging graph patterns and we propose a new condensed representation based on the representative pruned graph patterns: by providing shorter patterns, it is especially dedicated to represent a set of graph patterns. Experiments on a real-world database composed of chemicals show the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.

J	Sajn, L; Kukar, M				Sajn, Luka; Kukar, Matjaz			Image processing and machine learning for fully automated probabilistic evaluation of medical images	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning; Coronary artery disease; Medical diagnostics; Multi-resolution image parameterization; Association rules; Principal component analysis		The paper presents results of our long-term study on using image processing and data mining methods in a medical imaging. Since evaluation of modern medical images is becoming increasingly complex, advanced analytical and decision support tools are involved in integration of partial diagnostic results. Such partial results, frequently obtained from tests with substantial imperfections, are integrated into ultimate diagnostic conclusion about the probability of disease for a given patient. We study various topics such as improving the predictive power of clinical tests by utilizing pre-test and post-test probabilities, texture representation, multi-resolution feature extraction, feature construction and data mining algorithms that significantly outperform medical practice. Our long-term study reveals three significant milestones. The first improvement was achieved by significantly increasing post-test diagnostic probabilities with respect to expert physicians. The second, even more significant improvement utilizes multi-resolution image parametrization. Machine learning methods in conjunction with the feature subset selection on these parameters significantly improve diagnostic performance. However, further feature construction with the principle component analysis on these features elevates results to an even higher accuracy level that represents the third milestone. With the proposed approach clinical results are significantly improved throughout the study. The most significant result of our study is improvement in the diagnostic power of the whole diagnostic process. Our compound approach aids, but does not replace, the physician's judgment and may assist in decisions on cost effectiveness of tests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sokolova, MV; Fernandez-Caballero, A				Sokolova, Marina V.; Fernandez-Caballero, Antonio			Hybrid models in agent-based environmental decision support	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Hybrid models; Human health; Environmental pollution; Decision support systems; Multi-agent systems; Simulation	IMPACT; SYMPTOMS; SYSTEMS	Providing informational support in decision making is one of the priority directions of research in the sphere of public health management. Modern approaches suggest wide usage of intelligent data mining methods and Web-services, but just a few enable to study a complex system from an interdisciplinary point of view. In this paper an agent-based decision support system (ADSS), which embodies the principles of the interdisciplinary approach and facilitates multi-focal view and examination of the "Environment-Public health" system, is introduced. The detailed design of the system with the emphasis on the roles, scenarios and its implementation is presented. The data mining procedures used for data preparation, modeling and simulation, which include statistics, methods of artificial intelligence and hybrid models in form of cascade committee machines, are described. Then, the advantages of the proposed hybrid models against "singular" modeling methods are demonstrated. Finally, a case study for a selected region is presented and its results are discussed.

To reveal and utilize their high value both in traditional Chinese medicine research and modern clinical practice, we have developed a method of transforming the Qing Court Medical Records (QCMR) into a computer-readable, structured representation, so that statistical analysis and data mining can be accurately performed. The method consists of a frame ontology based medical language, called MedL, for representing QCMR, a parser for compiling MedL frames into a database, and an explorative pattern mining technique. With this method the entire RQCMR volume is transformed into a database and medical patterns may be mined from the database.

How to design and locate guide sign to increase traffic operation efficiency is a key point for traffic engineers. Driving simulator is useful devised to study guide sign in the process and system control. For the purpose of studying guide signs using the tool of driving simulator, guide sign's validity in driving simulator was studied. Results of this experiment are the foundation of further study on guide sign. Simulator calibration procedure for guide sign was set up in this study. Legibility distance as measure of performance was used to evaluate the validity of guide sign in driving simulator. Thirty two participants were recruited. Results indicated legibility distance and speed were inversely related with the method of data mining. Legibility distance and text height of guide sign were positive related. When speed is 20km/h, 30km/h, 40km/h, magnifying power of text height is 4.3, 4.1, 3.8, while guide signs are absolute validity in driving simulator.

J	Zhang, Y; Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD; Bond, JP				Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Xingquan; Wu, Xindong; Bond, Jeffrey P.			Corrective classification: Learning from data imperfections with aggressive and diverse classifier ensembling	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Noisy data; Error correction; Bagging; Bootstrap sampling; Classifier ensemble	NOISY DATA; DATA-ACQUISITION; ATTRIBUTE NOISE; TRAINING DATA; ALGORITHMS; VARIANCE; ACCURACY; BIAS	Learning from imperfect (noisy) information sources is a challenging and reality issue for many data mining applications. Common practices include data quality enhancement by applying data preprocessing techniques or employing robust learning algorithms to avoid developing overly complicated structures that overfit the noise. The essential goal is to reduce noise impact and eventually enhance the learners built from noise-corrupted data. In this paper, we propose a novel corrective classification (C2) design, which incorporates data cleansing, error correction. Bootstrap sampling and classifier ensembling for effective learning from noisy data sources. C2 differs from existing classifier ensembling or robust learning algorithms in two aspects. On one hand, a set of diverse base learners of C2 constituting the ensemble are constructed via a Bootstrap sampling process; on the other hand, C2 further improves each base learner by unifying error detection, correction and data cleansing to reduce noise impact. Being corrective, the classifier ensemble is built from data preprocessed/corrected by the data cleansing and correcting modules. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that C2 is not only more accurate than the learner built from original noisy sources, but also more reliable than Bagging [4] or aggressive classifier ensemble (ACE) [56], which are two degenerated components/variants of C2. The comparisons also indicate that C2 is more stable than Boosting and DECORATE, which are two state-of-the-art ensembling methods. For real-world imperfect information sources (i.e. noisy training and/or test data), C2 is able to deliver more accurate and reliable prediction models than its other peers can offer.

J	Zhao, XL; Xu, WX				Zhao XiuLi; Xu WeiXiang			A New Measurement Method to Calculate Similarity of Moving Object Spatio-Temporal Trajectories by Compact Representation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatio-temporal data mining; moving object trajectories; trajectory similarity degree; similarity measurement formula		A new measurement method is proposed to calculate spatio-temporal trajectory similarity, which can reflect the similar degree between two moving object spatio-temporal trajectories compressed by the Maximal Bounding Boxes (MBB). Firstly, the similarity between two trajectories is replaced by the similarity of MBB sequences in respective trajectories which can dramatically decrease the storage volume of the trajectory data. Secondly, some factors affected the similar degree of MBB sequences are analyzed systematically, such as the time duration of overlap between two MBBs in different trajectories, space distance and the density of data points inside the boxes. And then, a similarity measurement formula is proposed by integrating these factors. Experiments show that the proposed measurement formula can improve the value of clustering index Dunn.

Observations in the same cluster are close together according to the predetermined distance measure, while observations belonging to different clusters are afar. This paper presents an implementation of specific distance measure used to calculate distances between observations which are described by a mixture of variable types. Data mining tool 'Orange' was used for implementation, testing, data processing and result visualization. Finally, a comparison was made between results obtained by using already available widget and the output of newly programmed widget which employs new variable types and new distance measure. The comparison was made on different well-known datasets.

J	Cuzzocrea, A; Bertino, E				Cuzzocrea, Alfredo; Bertino, Elisa			Privacy Preserving OLAP over Distributed XML Data: A Theoretically-Sound Secure-Multiparty-Computation Approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						Privacy preserving OLAP; Secure multiparty computation schemes for OLAP; Secure distributed OLAP aggregations over XML data	DATA CUBES; STATISTICAL DATABASES; FRAMEWORK; PRESERVATION; MODEL	Privacy Preserving Distributed OLAP is becoming a critical challenge for next-generation Business Intelligence (BI) scenarios, due to the "natural suitability" of OLAP in analyzing distributed massive BI repositories in a multidimensional and multi-granularity manner. In particular, in these scenarios XML-formatted BI repositories play a dominant role, due to the well-know amenities of XML in modeling and representing distributed business data. However, while Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining has been widely investigated, the problem of effectively and efficiently supporting privacy preserving OLAP over distributed collections of XML documents, which is relevant in practice, has been neglected so far. In order to fulfill this gap, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)-based privacy preserving OLAP framework for distributed collections of XML documents. The framework has many novel features ranging from nice theoretical properties to an effective and efficient protocol, called Secure Distributed OLAP aggregation protocol (SDO). The efficiency of our approach has been validated by an experimental evaluation over distributed collections of synthetic, benchmark and real-life XML documents. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The focus of this paper is on aircraft deicing, which typically uses a spray of aircraft deicing and anti-icing fluids (ADAF). ADAF has a high concentration of ethylene/propylene/diethylene glycol, which shears off airfoil surfaces during takeoff and drips to the runways during taxiing. A significant portion of the glycol runs off and mixes with the airport's receiving waters during heavy deicing periods, resulting in bacterial growth that causes an increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a subsequent reduction in dissolved oxygen (DO) in the receiving waters. In this study, statistical methods for data mining were employed to evaluate the impact of airport deicing activities on COD and DO in the receiving waters immediately surrounding D/FW Airport. In particular, decision tree models were developed to determine important explanatory variables for predicting levels of COD and DO in the airport's waterways. The decision tree modeling and analysis of COD determined north south wind, glycol usage at a specific deicing pad, and monitoring site to be significant explanatory variables. The impact of glycol usage on DO was apparent as every decision tree at least one group with a median DO below 4.0 mg/l, and these low-DO groups were associated with high glycol usage. These results are crucial to D/FW Airport in their goal to minimize the potential adverse impact of deicing activities on the water quality in waterways proximate to the airport. The advantages of data-driven modeling and analysis are its cost-effectiveness due to its potential to be implemented without making major changes in physical systems, ease of application, and usefulness in making future management decisions.

It is divided into four section: data selection, data preprocessing, descriptive, and predictive data mining. The authors insist on the importance of the knowledge of the particular characteristics of the Power Company customer: the main features available in databases are described. The paper presents two innovative statistical estimators to attach importance to variability and trend analysis of electric consumption and offers a predictive model, based on the Generalized Rule Induction (GRI) model. This predictive analysis discovers association rules in the data and it is supplemented by a binary Quest tree classification method. The quality of this framework is illustrated by a case study considering a real database, supplied by Endesa Company.

J	Li, M; Deng, SB; Feng, SZ; Fan, JP				Li, Min; Deng, ShaoBo; Feng, Shengzhong; Fan, Jianping			An effective discretization based on Class-Attribute Coherence Maximization	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Discretization; CAIM; CACM; Classification; Class-Attribute Independence Redundancy (CAIR)	MIXED-MODE DATA; CHI2 ALGORITHM	Discretization of continuous data is one of the important pre-processing tasks in data mining and knowledge discovery. Generally speaking, discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy of induction algorithms, and the obtained rules are normally shorter and more understandable. In this paper, we present the Class-Attribute Coherence Maximization (CACM) algorithm and the Efficient-CACM algorithm. We have compared the performance of our algorithms with the most relevant discretization algorithm, Fast Class-Attribute Interdependence Maximization (Fast-CAIM) discertization algorithm (Kurgan and Cios, 2003). Empirical evaluation of our algorithms and Fast-CAIM on 12 well-known datasets shows that ours generate the superior discretization scheme, which can significantly improve the classification performance of C4.5 and RBF-SVM classifier. As to the execution time of discretization, ours also prove faster than Fast-CAIM algorithm, with the Efficient-CACM algorithm having the shortest execution time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lin, CW; Hong, TP				Lin, Chun-Wei; Hong, Tzung-Pei			Temporal data mining with up-to-date pattern trees	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Temporal data mining; Up-to-date pattern; UDP-tree; UDP-growth	PERSPECTIVE	Mining interesting and useful frequent patterns from large databases attracts much attention in recent years. Among the mining approaches, finding temporal patterns and regularities is very important due to its practicality. In the past, Hong et al. proposed the up-to-date patterns, which were frequent within their up-to-date lifetime. Formally, an up-to-date pattern is a pair with the itemset and its valid corresponding lifetime in which the user-defined minimum support threshold must be satisfied. They also proposed an Apriori-like approach to find the up-to-date patterns. This paper thus proposes the up-to-date pattern tree (UDP tree) to keep the up-to-date 1-patterns in a tree structure for reducing database scan. It is similar to the FP-tree structure but more complex due to the requirement of up-to-date patterns. The UDP-growth mining approach is also designed to find the up-to-date patterns from the UDP tree.

After reviewing the literature, it is evident that there is considerable room for improvement in the current state of the art. As shown in this paper, improvements are possible if we (a) explore a wide range of learning methods; (b) take care when selecting attributes; (c) assess the efficacy of the learned theory not just by its median performance, but also by the variance in that performance; (d) study the delta of student factors between those who stay and those who are retained. Using these techniques, for the goal of predicting if students will remain for the first three years of an undergraduate degree, the following factors were found to be informative: family background and family's social-economic status, high school GPA and test scores.

A honeypot is a powerful tool for observing and catching malware and virulent activity in Internet traffic. Because botnets use systematic attack methods, the sequences of malware downloaded by honeypots have particular forms of coordinated pattern. This paper aims to discover new frequent sequential attack patterns in malware automatically. One problem is the difficulty in identifying particular patterns from full yearlong logs because the dataset is too large for individual investigations. This paper proposes the use of a data-mining algorithm to overcome this problem. We implement the PrefixSpan algorithm to analyze malware-attack logs and then show some experimental results. Analysis of these results indicates that botnet attacks can be characterized either by the download times or by the source addresses of the hots. Finally, we use entropy analysis to reveal how frequent sequential patterns are involved in coordinated attacks.

J	Wang, SY; Lin, CJ; Wu, CX; Chaovalitwongse, WA				Wang, Shouyi; Lin, Cheng-Jhe; Wu, Changxu; Chaovalitwongse, Wanpracha Art			Early Detection of Numerical Typing Errors Using Data Mining Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Early detection; electroencephalography (EEG) classification; mental state monitoring; typing errors	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ABNORMAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	This paper studies the applications of data mining techniques in early detection of numerical typing errors by human operators through a quantitative analysis of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Three feature extraction techniques were developed to capture temporal, morphological, and time-frequency (wavelet) characteristics of EEG data. Two most commonly used data mining techniques, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), were employed to classify EEG samples associated with correct and erroneous keystrokes. The leave-one-error-pattern-out and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation methods were designed to evaluate the in-and cross-subject classification performances, respectively. For the in-subject classification, the best testing performance had a sensitivity of 62.20% and a specificity of 51.68%, which were achieved by SVM using morphological features. For the cross-subject classification, the best testing performance was achieved by LDA using temporal features, based on which it had a sensitivity of 68.72% and a specificity of 49.45%. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the averaged values of the area under ROC curves of LDA and SVM for the in- and cross-subject classifications were both greater than 0.60 using the EEG 300 ms prior to the keystrokes. The classification results of this study indicated that the EEG patterns of erroneous keystrokes might be different from those of the correct ones. As a result, it may be possible to predict erroneous keystrokes prior to error occurrence. The classification problem addressed in this study is extremely challenging due to the very limited number of erroneous keystrokes made by each subject and the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the EEG data. However, the outcome of this study is quite encouraging, and it is promising to develop a prospective early detection system for erroneous keystrokes based on brain-wave signals.

The methodology is comprised of two steps. In the first one, a C-means-based fuzzy clustering is performed in order to find consumers with similar consumption profiles. Afterwards, a fuzzy classification is performed using a fuzzy membership matrix and the Euclidean distance to the cluster centers. Then, the distance measures are normalized and ordered, yielding a unitary index score, where the potential fraudsters or users with irregular patterns of consumption have the highest scores. The approach was tested and validated on a real database, showing good performance in tasks of fraud and measurement defect detection.

J	Gong, PH; Gai, K; Zhang, CS				Gong, Pinghua; Gai, Kun; Zhang, Changshui			Efficient Euclidean projections via Piecewise Root Finding and its application in gradient projection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Gradient projection; Optimization; Piecewise Root Finding; Euclidean projection; Sparse; Nesterov's method	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; QUADRATIC KNAPSACK-PROBLEM; INVERSE PROBLEMS; ALGORITHMS; SHRINKAGE; SELECTION; ONLINE	Recently, the gradient (subgradient) projection method, especially by incorporating the idea of Nesterov's method, has aroused more and more attention and achieved great successes on constrained optimization problems arising in the field of machine learning, data mining and signal processing. In the gradient projection method, a critical step is how to efficiently project a vector onto a constraint set. In this paper, we propose a unified method called Piecewise Root Finding (PRF) to efficiently calculate Euclidean projections onto three typical constraint sets: epsilon(1)-ball, Elastic Net (EN) and the Intersection of a Hyperplane and a Halfspace (IHH). In our PRF method, we first formulate a Euclidean projection problem as a root finding problem. Then, a Piecewise Root Finding algorithm is applied to find the root and global convergence is guaranteed. Finally, the Euclidean projection result is obtained as a function of the found root in a closed form. Moreover, the sparsity of the projected vector is considered, leading to reduced computational cost for projection onto the epsilon(1)-ball and EN. Empirical studies demonstrate that our PRF algorithm is efficient by comparing it with several state of the art algorithms for Euclidean projections onto the three typical constraint sets mentioned above. Besides, we apply our efficient Euclidean projection algorithm (PRF) to the Gradient Projection with Nesterov's Method (GPNM), which efficiently solves the popular logistic regression problem with the epsilon(1)-ball/EN/IHH constraint. Experimental results on real-world data sets indicate that GPNM has a fast convergence speed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Classification of cancer cell death with spectral dimensionality reduction and generalized eigenvalues	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Spectral clustering; Dimensionality reduction; Generalized eigenvalue classification; Raman spectroscopy; Cancer treatment	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; GENE-EXPRESSION; NORMALIZED CUTS; APOPTOSIS; LINES; A549; HEAT; DISCRIMINATION; TOXICITY	Objective: Accurate cell death discrimination is a time consuming and expensive process that can only be performed in biological laboratories. Nevertheless, it is very useful and arises in many biological and medical applications. Methods and material: Raman spectra are collected for 84 samples of A549 cell line (human lung cancer epithelia cells) that has been exposed to toxins to simulate the necrotic and apoptotic death. The proposed data mining approach for the multiclass cell death discrimination problem uses a multiclass regularized generalized eigenvalue algorithm for classification (multiReGEC), together with a dimensionality reduction algorithm based on spectral clustering. Results: The proposed algorithmic scheme can classify A549 lung cancer cells from three different classes (apoptotic death, necrotic death and control cells) with 97.78% +/- 0.047 accuracy versus 92.22 +/- 0.095 without the proposed feature selection preprocessing. The spectrum areas depicted by the algorithm corresponds to the)C= O bond from the lipids and the lipid bilayer. This chemical structure undergoes different change of state based on cell death type. Further evidence of the validity of the technique is obtained through the successful classification of 7 cell spectra that undergo hyperthermic treatment. Conclusions: In this study we propose a fast and automated way of processing Raman spectra for cell death discrimination, using a feature selection algorithm that not only enhances the classification accuracy, but also gives more insight in the undergoing cell death process.

J	Han, J; Kim, N; Yum, BJ; Jeong, MK				Han, Jeong; Kim, Norman; Yum, Bong-Jin; Jeong, Myong K.			Pattern selection approaches for the logical analysis of data considering the outliers and the coverage of a pattern	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Logical analysis of data; Pattern selection; Set covering problem		The logical analysis of data (LAD) is one of the most promising data mining methods developed to date for extracting knowledge from data. The key feature of the LAD is the capability of detecting hidden patterns in the data. Because patterns are basically combinations of certain attributes, they can be used to build a decision boundary for classification in the LAD by providing important information to distinguish observations in one class from those in the other. The use of patterns may result in a more stable performance in terms of being able to classify both positive and negative classes due to their robustness to measurement errors. The LAD technique, however, tends to choose too many patterns by solving a set covering problem to build a classifier; this is especially the case when outliers exist in the data set. In the set covering problem of the LAD, each observation should be covered by at least one pattern, even though the observation is an outlier. Thus, existing approaches tend to select too many patterns to cover these outliers, resulting in the problem of overfitting. Here, we propose new pattern selection approaches for LAD that take both outliers and the coverage of a pattern into account. The proposed approaches can avoid the problem of overfitting by building a sparse classifier. The performances of the proposed pattern selection approaches are compared with existing LAD approaches using several public data sets. The computational results show that the sparse classifiers built on the patterns selected by the proposed new approaches yield an improved classification performance compared to the existing approaches, especially when outliers exist in the data set.

J	Krishna, B; Kaliaperumal, B				Krishna, Brahmadesam; Kaliaperumal, Baskaran			Efficient Genetic-Wrapper Algorithm Based Data Mining for Feature Subset Selection in a Power Quality Pattern Recognition Application	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; feature selection; genetic algorithm; power quality; disturbance recognition	TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; EVENTS; SYSTEM	Power quality monitors handle and store several gigabytes of data within a week and hence automatic detection, recognition and analysis of power disturbances require robust data mining techniques. Literature reveals that much work has been done to evolve several feature extraction and subsequent classification techniques for accurate power disturbance pattern recognition. However the features extracted have been rarely evaluated for their usefulness. The objective of this work is to emphasize that feature selection is an important issue in power quality disturbance classification and that genetic algorithms, can select good subsets of features. In this paper, a wrapper based approach that integrates multiobjective genetic algorithms and the target learning algorithm is presented in order to evolve optimal subsets of discriminatory features for robust pattern classification. The wavelet transform and the S-transform are utilized to produce representative feature vectors that can accurately capture the unique and salient characteristics of each disturbance. In the training phase the multiobjective genetic algorithms is used to find a subset of relevant attributes that minimizes both classification error rate and size of the classifier discovered by the classification algorithm, using the Pareto dominance approach. Two different classifiers were compared in this study using genetic feature subset selection: decision tree, a feed forward neural network. Moreover two different MOGAs namely elitism-based MOGA and Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm have been employed separately in the training phase. Experimental results reveal that both of these proposed variants of MOGA combined with classifiers namely decision trees /FFNN yield improved classification performance and reduced classification time as compared to standard classifiers namely decision trees decision tree or standard feed -forward networks.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			MHUI-max: An efficient algorithm for discovering high-utility itemsets from data streams	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Data streams; data mining; data stream mining; utility mining; high-utility itemset	MINING FREQUENT ITEMSETS; ONLINE DATA STREAMS	Online mining of utility itemsets from data streams is one of the most interesting research issues in stream data mining. Although a number of relevant approaches have been proposed in recent years, they have the drawback of producing a large number of candidate itemsets for high-utility itemset mining. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, called MHUI-max (Mining High-Utility Itemsets based on LexTree-maxHTU), is proposed for mining high-utility itemsets from data streams with fewer candidates. Based on the framework of the MHUI-max algorithm, an effective representation of item information, called TID-list, and a new lexicographical tree-based data structure, called LexTree-maxHTU, has been developed to improve the efficiency of discovering high-utility itemsets with positive profits from data streams. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, MHUI-max, outperforms the existing approaches, MHUI-TID and THUI-Mine, for mining high-utility itemsets from data streams over transaction-sensitive sliding windows.

State-of-the-art researches prove that the use of users' behavior information helps to improve query recommendation performance. Instead of finding the most similar terms previous users queried, we focus on how to detect users' actual information need based on their search behaviors. The key idea of this paper is that although the clicked documents are not always relevant to users' queries, the snippets which lead them to the click most probably meet their information needs. Based on analysis into large-scale practical search behavior log data, two snippet click behavior models are constructed and corresponding query recommendation algorithms are proposed. Experimental results based on two widely-used commercial search engines' click-through data prove that the proposed algorithms outperform practical recommendation methods of these two search engines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that snippet click models are proposed for query recommendation task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DISCOVERING INDIRECT GENE ASSOCIATIONS BY FILTERING-BASED INDIRECT ASSOCIATION RULE MINING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Data mining; Microarray; Gene expression analysis; Indirect association rule	EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; RESOURCE; DATABASE	Data mining is a popular technology used for microarray analysis. Using this technique, biologists can effectively elucidate gene expression data. In this research, we propose the FIARM (Filtering-Based Indirect Association Rule Mining) algorithm to analyze gene microarray data. The form (X,Y vertical bar M) is used to present the indirect relation of X and Y, which depends on M. This signifies that both gene X and gene M are likely involved in a given biological activity. Furthermore, both gene Y and gene M likely join together to carry out another biological activity. As gene M is the necessary factor in these different biological activities, it can help biologists determine gene relationships in diverse activities. We use semantic similarity of Gene Ontology to verify the accuracy of discovered gene relations. Under experimental evaluation, the proposed method can discover the relationship dissimilated by association rules to effectively assist biologists in complicated genetic research.

FRBC: A Fuzzy Rule-Based Clustering Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; clustering algorithm; fuzzy clustering; fuzzy rule-based classifier	DATA SET; NUMBER; VALIDITY; PERFORMANCE; INDEXES	Fuzzy clustering is superior to crisp clustering when the boundaries among the clusters are vague and ambiguous. However, the main limitation of both fuzzy and crisp clustering algorithms is their sensitivity to the number of potential clusters and/or their initial positions. Moreover, the comprehensibility of obtained clusters is not expertized, whereupon in data-mining applications, the discovered knowledge is not understandable for human users. To overcome these restrictions, a novel fuzzy rule-based clustering algorithm (FRBC) is proposed in this paper. Like fuzzy rule-based classifiers, the FRBC employs a supervised classification approach to do the unsupervised cluster analysis. It tries to automatically explore the potential clusters in the data patterns and identify them with some interpretable fuzzy rules. Simultaneous classification of data patterns with these fuzzy rules can reveal the actual boundaries of the clusters. To illustrate the capability of FRBC to explore the clusters in data, the experimental results on some benchmark datasets are obtained and compared with other fuzzy clustering algorithms. The clusters specified by fuzzy rules are human understandable with acceptable accuracy.

Our method operates on a graph where vertices correspond to frequent items and edges correspond to frequent item sets of size two. We show that partitioning this graph by a vertex separator is sufficient to decide a distribution of the items such that the subdatabases determined by the item distribution can be mined independently. This distribution entails an amount of data replication, which may be reduced by setting appropriate weights to vertices. The data distribution scheme is used in the design of two new parallel frequent item set mining algorithms. Both algorithms replicate the items that correspond to the separator. NoClique replicates the work induced by the separator and NoClique2 computes the same work collectively. Computational load balancing and minimization of redundant or collective work may be achieved by assigning appropriate load estimates to vertices. The experiments show favorable speedups on a system with small-to-medium number of processors for synthetic and real-world databases.

This paper presents MAHATMA-memetic algorithm-based highly adapted tool for motif ascertainment-a system that was conceived to discover features (particular sequences of amino acids, or motifs) that occur very often in proteins of a given family but rarely occur in proteins of other families. These features can be used for the classification of unknown proteins, that is, to predict their function by analyzing their primary structure. Experiments were done with a set of enzymes extracted from the Protein Data Bank. The heuristic method used was based on genetic programming using operators specially tailored for the target problem. The final performance was measured using sensitivity, specificity and hit rate. The best results obtained for the enzyme dataset suggest that the proposed evolutionary computation method is effective in finding predictive features (motifs) for protein classification.

In this work, a tool for searching abstracts submitted to scientific conferences is introduced. It not only searches abstracts by the given keyword(s) but also displays abstracts related to a single or multiple selection. It also displays highly relevant abstracts together with possible keywords to help users refine their search. Analysis of the conditional similarity algorithm proposed here has shown that it does provide better output compared to ordinary cosine similarity, as well as the list of possible keywords reflects results of latent topic analysis. An interface for storing and sorting selected abstracts for future review and/or printing is also provided.

In this paper we present a kernel method based on approximately harmonic projection (AHP), a recently proposed linear manifold learning method that has an excellent performance in clustering. The kernel matrix implicitly maps the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and makes the structure of data more distinct, which distributes on nonlinear manifold. It retains and extends the advantages of its linear version and keeps the sensitive to the connected components. This makes the method particularly suitable for unsupervised clustering. Besides, this method can cover various classes of nonlinearities with different kernels. We experiment the new method on several well-known data sets to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the new algorithm performs a good job and outperforms other classic algorithms on those data sets. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detecting fraud in online games of chance and lotteries	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fraud detection; Data cubes; Money laundering detection; Unsupervised learning; Cluster ensembles; Outlier detector fusion	OUTLIERS; IDENTIFICATION	Fraud detection has been an important topic of research in the data mining community for the past two decades. Supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches to fraud detection have been proposed for the telecommunications, credit, insurance and health-care industries. We describe a novel hybrid system for detecting fraud in the highly growing lotteries and online games of chance sector. While the objectives of fraudsters in this sector are not unique, money laundering and insider attack scenarios are much more prevalent in lotteries than in the previously studied sectors. The lack of labeled data for supervised classifier design, user anonymity, and the size of the data-sets are the other key factors differentiating the problem from previous studies, and are the key drivers behind the design and implementation decisions for the system described. The system employs online algorithms that optimally aggregate statistical information from raw data and applies a number of pre-specified checks against known fraud scenarios as well as novel clustering-based algorithms for outlier detection which are then fused together to produce alerts with high detection rates at acceptable false alarm levels.

The LAD is based on the concepts of combinatorics, optimization, and Boolean functions. The key feature of the LAD is the capability of detecting hidden patterns in the data. Since patterns are basically combinations of certain attributes, they can be used to build a decision boundary for classification in the LAD by providing important information to distinguish observations in one class from those in the other class. The use of patterns may result in a more stable performance in terms of being able to classify both positive and negative classes due to their robustness to measurement errors. The patterns are also interpretable and can serve as an essential tool for understanding the problem. These desirable properties of the patterns generated from the LAD motivate the use of the LAD patterns as input variables to other classification techniques to achieve a more stable and accurate performance. In this paper, the patterns generated from the LAD are used as the input variables to the decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classification methods. The applicability and usefulness of the LAD patterns for classification are investigated experimentally. The classification accuracy and sensitivity of the classification results for different classifiers in the original and pattern spaces are compared using several public data. The experimental results show that classifications in the pattern space can yield better and stable performance than those in the original space in terms of accuracy when the classification accuracy of the LAD is relatively good (i.e., the LAD patterns are of good quality), the ratio of the number of patterns to the total number of attributes is small, or the data set for classification is balanced between two classes.

J	Poernomo, AK; Gopalkrishnan, V				Poernomo, Ardian Kristanto; Gopalkrishnan, Vivekanand			Class description using partial coverage of subspaces	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge management; Class description; Classification		A good description of a class should be (reasonably) accurate and interpretable. Previous works address this class-description problem by either analyzing the correlation of each attribute with the class, or by producing rules as in building a classifier. These solutions suffer from issues in accuracy and interpretability. A sentence is usually defined as a disjunction or conjunction of several terms, each of which specifies a constraint (range/set of values) on an attribute. From the data analysis point of view, a sentence specifies a subspace in the database. In this paper, we create a richer yet interpretable form of a sentence. Here, a sentence describes an object if any k attributes of that object satisfy the specified constraints, or in other words, the object is partially covered by the subspace. Since this simple enhancement subsumes rules used in previous solutions, descriptions based on such sentences are provably better. To that end, we design PUB, an algorithm that produces descriptions with our form of sentences. Theoretically, while constructing a sentence (within the description). PUB finds the optimal range/set of values for each attribute in linear time. Empirically, we show that PUB is efficient, and able to produce more accurate, concise and interpretable descriptions than current approaches on various real datasets. We also perform an illustrative case study on the Glass dataset, providing some useful insights. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By applying data mining techniques to decipher customers' behavior and perform risk analysis, the clustering algorithms divides card users into 9 groups of different levels of contributions and risk profiles, according to their consumption patterns. We generalize a set of clustering rules to identify high risk customer groups in advance. Therefore, the proposed suggestions could tell who was a bad risk and either deny their application or, for those who were already cardholders, start shrinking their available credit and increasing minimum payments to squeeze out as much cash as possible before they defaulted. On the other hand, banks are advised to adjust credit limits in a timely manner for the customer groups whose risks are low and contributions are high, in addition to the provision of value added services, in order to enhance earnings.

J	Van den Bogaerd, M; Aerts, W				Van den Bogaerd, Machteld; Aerts, Walter			Applying machine learning in accounting research	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Text classification; Accounting research; Artificial intelligence	ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES; REPUTATION	Quite often, in order to derive meaningful insights, accounting researchers have to analyze large bodies of text. Usually, this is done manually by several human coders, which makes the process time consuming, expensive, and often neither replicable nor accurate. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, we perform a feasibility study investigating the applicability of computer-aided content analysis techniques onto the domain of accounting research. Krippendorff (1980) defines an algorithm's reliability as its stability, reproducibility and accuracy. Since in computer-aided text classification, which is inherently objective and repeatable, the first two requirements, stability and reproducibility, are not an issue, this paper focuses exclusively on the third requirement, the algorithm's accuracy. It is important to note that, although inaccurate classification results are completely worthless, it is surprising to see how few research papers actually mention the accuracy of the used classification methodology. After a survey of the available techniques, we perform an in depth analysis of the most promising one, LPU (Learning from Positive and Unlabelled), which turns out to have an F-value and accuracy of about 90%, which means that, given a random text, it has a 90% probability of classifying it correctly.

But Dawes and Faust (1989) reported that people usually rely on clinical judgements, especially it is hard for them to distinguish valid decision variables from invalid ones in decision making. Thus, in order to alleviate this problem and provide more objective decision making support about news in financial market, an ontology based framework is proposed, for investigating the actuarial dependence relationships between news and financial instruments trading activities as well as identifying more valid news for trading decision making. This framework is expected to help people in financial market how to consider weight for each kind of news when inputted in trading algorithms/models of certain financial instruments.

Since the clustering problem on numeric data sets can be formulated as a typical combinatorial optimization problem, many researches have addressed the design of heuristic algorithms for finding sub-optimal solutions in a reasonable period of time. However, most of the heuristic clustering algorithms suffer from the problem of being sensitive to the initialization and do not guarantee the high quality results. Recently, Approximate Backbone (AB), i.e., the commonly shared intersection of several sub-optimal solutions, has been proposed to address the sensitivity problem of initialization. In this paper, we aim to introduce the AB into heuristic clustering to overcome the initialization sensitivity of conventional heuristic clustering algorithms. The main advantage of the proposed method is the capability of restricting the initial search space around the optimal result by defining the AB, and in turn, reducing the impact of initialization on clustering, eventually improving the performance of heuristic clustering. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to three conventional heuristic clustering algorithms and three other algorithms with improvement on initialization.

Increasingly, data mining is used to improve an organization's software process quality, e.g. the accuracy of effort estimations. Data is collected from projects, and data miners are used to discover beneficial knowledge. This paper reports a data mining experiment in which we examined 32 software projects to improve effort estimation. We examined three major categories of software project activities, and focused on the activities of the category which has got the least attention in research so far, the non-construction activities. The analysis is based on real software project data supplied by a large European software company. In our data mining experiment, we applied a range of machine learners. We found that the estimated total software project effort is a predictor in modeling and predicting the actual quality management effort of the project.

J	Kim, M; Pavlovic, V				Kim, Minyoung; Pavlovic, Vladimir			Sequence classification via large margin hidden Markov models	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Sequence classification; Hidden Markov models	SPEECH RECOGNITION	We address the sequence classification problem using a probabilistic model based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). In contrast to commonly-used likelihood-based learning methods such as the joint/conditional maximum likelihood estimator, we introduce a discriminative learning algorithm that focuses on class margin maximization. Our approach has two main advantages: (i) As an extension of support vector machines (SVMs) to sequential, non-Euclidean data, the approach inherits benefits of margin-based classifiers, such as the provable generalization error bounds. (ii) Unlike many algorithms based on non-parametric estimation of similarity measures that enforce weak constraints on the data domain, our approach utilizes the HMM's latent Markov structure to regularize the model in the high-dimensional sequence space. We demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance of the proposed method in an extensive set of evaluations on time-series sequence data that frequently appear in data mining and computer vision domains.

J	Li, JZ; Liu, Y; Gao, H				Li, Jianzhong; Liu, Yong; Gao, Hong			Efficient Algorithms for Summarizing Graph Patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; graph mining; pattern summarization		We investigate the problem of summarizing frequent subgraphs by a smaller set of representative patterns. We show that some special graph patterns, called delta-jump patterns in this paper, must be representative patterns. Based on the fact, we devise two algorithms, RP-FP and RP-GD, to mine a representative set that summarizes frequent subgraphs. RP-FP derives a representative set from frequent closed subgraphs, whereas RP-GD mines a representative set from graph databases directly. Three novel heuristic strategies, Last-Succeed-First-Check, Reverse-Path-Trace, and Nephew-Representative-Based-Cover, are proposed to further improve the efficiency of RP-GD. RP-FP can provide a tight ratio bound but has heavy computation cost. RP-GD cannot provide a ratio bound guarantee but is more efficient than RP-FP. We also make use of the similarity between sibling branches in the graph pattern space to devise another much more efficient algorithm, RP-Leap, for mining a representative set that can approximately summarize frequent subgraphs. Our extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets verify the summarization quality and efficiency of our algorithms. To further demonstrate the interestingness of representative patterns, we study an application of representative patterns to classification. We demonstrate that the classification accuracy achieved by representative pattern-based model is no less than that achieved by closed graph pattern-based model.

Analysis by data mining in the emergency medicine triage database at a Taiwanese regional hospital	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Data mining; Emergency medicine; Rough set; Triage	ROUGH SETS	"Emergency medicine" is the front line of medical service a hospital provides; also it is the department people seek medical care from immediately after an emergency happens. The statistics by the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, indicate that over years, the number of people at the emergency department has been increasing. The US has introduced and practiced the triage system in the emergency medicine in 1960, whereby to aid the emergency department in allocating the patients, to give them appropriate medical care by the fast decision of the nurses and doctors in case of the patients' seriousness through their judgment. This study takes on the knowledge contained in the massive data of unknown characteristics in the triage database at a Taiwanese regional hospital, using the cluster analysis and the rough set theory as tools for data mining to extract, with the analysis software ROSE2 (Rough Sets Data Explorer) and through rule induction technique, the imprecise, uncertain and vague information of rules from the massive database, and builds the model that is capable of simplifying massive data while maintaining the accuracy in classifying rules. After analyzing and evaluating the knowledge obtained from relevant mining in the hospitals past medical data for the consumption of emergency medical resources, this thesis proposes suggestions as reference for the hospitals in subsequent elevation of medical quality and decrease in operative costs.

Using and comparing different decision tree classification techniques for mining ICDDR,B Hospital Surveillance data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Medical surveillence; Decision tree; Artificial intelligence; Classification; Data mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; INFECTION-CONTROL; CARE; SYSTEM	In this research we have used decision tree induction algorithm on Hospital Surveillance data to classify admitted patients according to their critical condition. Three class labels, low, medium and high, are used to distinguish the criticality of the admitted patients. Several decision tree models are developed, evaluated, and compared with different performance metrics. Finally an efficient classifier is developed to classify records and make decision/predictions on some input parameters. The models developed in this research could be helpful during epidemic when huge number of patients arrive daily. Due to rush of duty doctors and scarcity of required number of physicians, it is hard to diagnose every patient. Any computer application could be helpful to diagnose and measure the criticality of the newly arrived patient with the help of the historical data kept in the surveillance database. The application would ask few questions on physical condition and on history of disease of the patient and accordingly determines the critical condition of the patient as low, medium or high.

Prediction of test data is a fundamental step in classification that impacts the outputted system accuracy. In this paper, we present three new prediction methods (Dominant Class Label, Highest Average Confidence per Class, Full Match Rule) and one rule pruning procedure (Partial Matching) in AC. Furthermore, we review current prediction methods in AC. Experimental results on large English and Arabic text categorisation data collections (Reuters, SPA) using the proposed prediction methods and other popular classification algorithms (SVM, KNN, NB, BCAR, MCAR, C4.5, etc.), have been conducted. The bases of the comparison in the experiments are classification accuracy and the Break-Even-Point (BEP) evaluation measures. The results reveal that our prediction methods are very competitive with reference to BEP if compared with known AC prediction approaches such as those of 2-PS, ARC-BC and BCAR. Moreover, the proposed prediction methods outperform other existing methods in traditional classification approaches such as decision trees, and probabilistic with regards to accuracy. Finally, the results indicate that using the proposed pruning procedure in AC improved the accuracy of the outputted classifier.

Mining frequent itemsets over distributed data streams by continuously maintaining a global synopsis	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Distributed data streams; Data mining; Frequent itemset; Continuous distributed model; Hash-based approach	PATTERNS; SETS	Mining frequent itemsets over data streams has attracted much research attention in recent years. In the past, we had developed a hash-based approach for mining frequent itemsets over a single data stream. In this paper, we extend that approach to mine global frequent itemsets from a collection of data streams distributed at distinct remote sites. To speed up the mining process, we make the first attempt to address a new problem on continuously maintaining a global synopsis for the union of all the distributed streams. The mining results therefore can be yielded on demand by directly processing the maintained global synopsis. Instead of collecting and processing all the data in a central server, which may waste the computation resources of remote sites, distributed computations over the data streams are performed. A distributed computation framework is proposed in this paper, including two communication strategies and one merging operation. These communication strategies are designed according to an accuracy guarantee of the mining results, determining when and what the remote sites should transmit to the central server (named coordinator). On the other hand, the merging operation is exploited to merge the information received from the remote sites into the global synopsis maintained at the coordinator. By the strategies and operation, the goal of continuously maintaining the global synopsis can be achieved. Rooted in the continuously maintained global synopsis, we propose a mining algorithm for finding global frequent itemsets. Moreover, the correctness guarantees of the communication strategies and merging operation, and the accuracy guarantee analysis of the mining algorithm are provided. Finally, a series of experiments on synthetic datasets and a real dataset are performed to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the distributed computation framework.	[Chen, Arbee L.

J	Huang, BA; Yang, P				Huang, Biao; Yang, Peng			Finding key knowledge attribute subspace of outliers in high-dimensional dataset	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Attribute subspace; High-dimensional dataset; Data mining	ROUGH SETS; REDUCTION	Outlier detection has important applications in many fields in which the data can contain high dimensions. However, finding the intentional knowledge of outliers will become inefficient and even infeasible in high dimensional space. In this paper, we introduced the concept of rough set and used it as the model of outlier detection and analysis system to realize outlying reduction. Furthermore, by defining outlying partition similarity, we can mine the outliers in the key knowledge attribute subspace rather than in the full dimensional attribute space of dataset. An effective method for finding the key knowledge attribute subspace was proposed. It first finds all outliers in the full attribute space and then, calculates KAS for corresponding projection of each outlier. Finally, the key knowledge attribute subspace can be identified by the value of outlying partition similarity. The experimental results show that our method can be efficiently used in high dimensional dataset to identify outlier. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, utility company databases store enormous amounts of information on both installations and customers: consumption, technical information on the measure equipment, documentation, inspections results, commentaries of inspectors, etc. In this paper, an integrated expert system (IES) for the analysis and classification of all the available useful information of the customer is presented. Customer classification identifies the presence of an NTL and the problem type. This IES include several modules: text mining module for analysis of inspector commentaries and extraction of additional information on the customer, data mining module to draw up the rules that determine the customer estimate consumption, and the Rule Based Expert System module to analyze each customer using the results of the text and data mining modules. This IES is used with real data extracted from Endesa company databases. Endesa is the most important power distribution company in Spain, and one of the most significant companies of Europe. This IES is used in the test phase by human experts in the Endesa company.

Identification of spatial outliers is an important task for data mining researchers and geographers. A number of algorithms have been developed to detect spatial anomalies in meteorological images, transportation systems, and contagious disease data. In this paper, we propose a set of graph-based algorithms to identify spatial outliers. Our method first constructs a graph based on k-nearest neighbor relationship in spatial domain, assigns the differences of nonspatial attribute as edge weights, and continuously cuts high-weight edges to identify isolated points or regions that are much dissimilar to their neighboring objects. The proposed algorithms have three major advantages compared with other existing spatial outlier detection methods: accurate in detecting both point and region outliers, capable of avoiding false outliers, and capable of computing the local outlierness of an object within subgraphs. We present time complexity of the algorithms, and show experiments conducted on US housing and Census data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

J	Bhavani, D; Suvarnavani, K; Sinha, S				Bhavani, Durga; Suvarnavani, K.; Sinha, Somdatta			Mining of protein contact maps for protein fold prediction	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; SPACE; PAIRS; SCOP	The three-dimensional structure of proteins is useful to carry out the biophysical and biochemical functions in a cell. Approaches to protein structure/fold prediction typically extract amino acid sequence features, and machine learning approaches are then applied to classification problem. Protein contact maps are two-dimensional representations of the contacts among the amino acid residues in the folded protein structure. This paper highlights the need for a systematic study of these contact networks. Mining of contact maps to derive features pertaining to fold information offers a new mechanism for fold discovery from the protein sequence via the contact maps. These ideas are explored in the structural class of all-alpha proteins to identify structural elements. A simple and computationally inexpensive algorithm based on triangle subdivision method is proposed to extract additional features from the contact map. The method successfully characterizes the off-diagonal interactions in the contact map for predicting specific 'folds'. The decision tree classification results show great promise in developing a new and simple tool for the challenging problem of fold prediction. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This framework uses a technique that structures the pattern space in a way that facilitates the integration of constraints within the mining process. Furthermore, we also introduce a powerful strategy that uses background information on the data to speed-up the mining process. We illustrate our approach on a popular structured data mining problem, the frequent subgraph mining problem, and show, through experiments on synthetic and real-life data, that this general approach has advantages over state-of-the-art pattern mining algorithms.

J	Huang, ZH; Xiang, Y; Zhang, B; Liu, XL				Huang, Zhenhua; Xiang, Yang; Zhang, Bo; Liu, Xiaoling			A clustering based approach for skyline diversity	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						K-means clustering; Skyline query; Diversity; Circinal index; Performance evaluation	R-TREES; ALGORITHM; MODELS	Skyline query processing has recently received a lot of attention in database and data-mining communities. To the best of our knowledge, the existing researches mainly focus on considering how to efficiently return the whole skyline set. However, when the cardinality and dimensionality of input objects increase, the number of skylines grows exponentially, and hence this "huge" skyline set is completely useless to users. On the other hand, in most real applications, the objects are usually clustered, and therefore many objects have similar attribute values. Motivated by the above facts, in this paper, we present a novel type of SkyCluster query to capture the skyline diversity and improve the usefulness of skyline result. The SkyCluster query integrates K-means clustering into skyline computation, and returns K "representative" and "diverse" skyline objects to users. To process such query, a straightforward approach is to simply integrate the existing techniques developed for skyline-only and clustering-only together. But this approach is costly since both skyline computation and K-means clustering are all CPU-sensitive. We propose an efficient evaluation approach which is based on the circinal index to seamlessly integrate subspace skyline computation, K-means clustering and representatives selection. Also, we present a novel optimization heuristic to further improve the query performance. Experimental study shows that our approach is both efficient and effective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The processor can be used for a very fast and energy efficient search of binary and ASCII words in either vast data sets or in high bandwidth datastreams. The matcher is particularly suited for real-time operations because of its outstanding data throughput. Power efficiency is achieved by FPGA utilization. Original Bloom filter [1] was parallelized. A Bloom filter parallelization allowed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The searched words can be located with a one byte resolution. To gain additional processor performance, the processor architecture is thoughtfully parallelized. It allows for simultaneous processing of 16 bytes of input data at each clock cycle. To achieve very high data throughput, the architecture is also pipelined. Moreover, we implemented several processors in a single FPGA structure. As a result, three levels of parallelism are employed. Consequently with a 100 MHz clock frequency, a theoretical throughput of 1.6 GBytes/s is achieved. Although, in practice the throughput was reduced clue to external memory and CPU to FPGA bandwidth. Another distinguishing feature of the presented architecture is its high flexibility. A dictionary of words can be easily changed without FPGA reconfiguration. The next unique feature presented in this paper is an enhancement that allows for configuration of words' length.

J	Last, M; Avrahami, G; Kandel, A				Last, Mark; Avrahami, Gil; Kandel, Abraham			Using Data Mining Techniques for Optimizing Traffic Signal Plans at an Urban Intersection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								A key problem in traffic engineering is the optimization of the flow of vehicles through urban intersections by improving the timing policy of traffic signals. Current methods of signal control policy are based on the junction topography and prespecified static traffic volumes. However, the actual daily traffic volumes can be affected by many time-dependent factors making a static policy hardly optimal. In this paper, we induce nonstationary predictive models of traffic flow by applying novel methods of time-series data mining to the traffic sensors data collected from a signalized intersection in Jerusalem over a period of 3 years. Our methodology for modeling dynamic traffic volumes combines clustering and segmentation algorithms. The results of a case study based on real-world traffic data demonstrate that a dynamic signal policy using the data mining approach can produce a decrease of about 33.7% in the total waiting time of drivers during 1 year, in comparison to the existing static traffic policy. The resulting savings for this junction only would be about 13,800 driving hours, which are worth of about $ 52,000 per annum in terms of Israeli economy. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach to formulate airline service strategies	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Dominance-based Rough Set Approach; Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Data mining; Decision rules; Airlines; Service quality	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; DECISION RULES; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; CRITERIA; SUPPORT	This study differs from previous ones applying multivariate statistical analysis and multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. We use the Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (VC-DRSA) to formulate airline service strategies by generating airline service decision rules that model passenger preferences for airline service quality. Flow graphs are applied to infer decision rules and variables. This combined method considers decision-maker inconsistency. The use of flow graphs to visualize rules makes them more reasonable and understandable than traditional methods. To validate the effectiveness of our model, a large sample is surveyed. Managerial improvements needed for carriers to achieve the aspired-to level of customer satisfaction are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This algorithm has been a pioneer system and source of inspiration for others. Studying the philosophy and experimental behaviour of REGAL, we propose some improvements based principally on a new treatment of counterexamples that promote its underlying goodness in order to achieve better performances in accuracy, interpretability and scalability, so that the new system meets the main requirements for classification rules extraction in data mining. The experimental study carried out shows valuable improvements compared with both REGAL and G-Net distributed genetic algorithms and interesting results compared with some state-of-the-art representative algorithms in this field.

Controlling patterns of geospatial phenomena	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Predictors-response relationship; Association analysis; Mapping predicting relationship; Vegetation density; Data mining	EMERGING PATTERNS; CARTOGRAPHY; DISCOVERY	Modeling spatially distributed phenomena in terms of its controlling factors is a recurring problem in geoscience. Most efforts concentrate on predicting the value of response variable in terms of controlling variables either through a physical model or a regression model. However, many geospatial systems comprises complex, nonlinear, and spatially non-uniform relationships, making it difficult to even formulate a viable model. This paper focuses on spatial partitioning of controlling variables that are attributed to a particular range of a response variable. Thus, the presented method surveys spatially distributed relationships between predictors and response. The method is based on association analysis technique of identifying emerging patterns, which are extended in order to be applied more effectively to geospatial data sets. The outcome of the method is a list of spatial footprints, each characterized by a unique "controlling pattern"aEuro"a list of specific values of predictors that locally correlate with a specified value of response variable. Mapping the controlling footprints reveals geographic regionalization of relationship between predictors and response. The data mining underpinnings of the method are given and its application to a real world problem is demonstrated using an expository example focusing on determining variety of environmental associations of high vegetation density across the continental United States.

J	Vasconcelos, A; Werner, C				Vasconcelos, Aline; Werner, Claudia			Evaluating reuse and program understanding in Arch Mine architecture recovery approach	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Architecture recovery; Dynamic analysis; Data mining; Architecture evaluation; Software reuse; Evaluation studies	SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS	Several architecture recovery approaches have been proposed in the literature with distinct goals. ArchMine, an architecture recovery approach based on dynamic analysis and data mining, aims at assisting in program understanding and software reuse by detecting cohesive classes that implement a set of related functionalities, i.e., architectural elements. It is supported by a tool set integrated into a reuse-based software development environment. In order to better reach the proposed goals. ArchMine is integrated with two other approaches, namely: ArqCheck, an architectural evaluation approach based on inspection, and ArchToDSSA, a domain variability detection approach. ArchMine and its tool set have been detailed in previous works. The contribution of this paper is to describe how ArchMine and its tool set were evaluated and refined through a series of evaluation studies. These evaluations allowed us to gradually refine the approach based on the lessons learned. In the final study, within an industrial context, the integration between ArchMine and ArqCheck is evaluated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hybrid data mining approaches for prevention of drug dispensing errors	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dispensing errors; Classification modeling; Decision tree; Logistic regression; Medical risk management	LOOK-ALIKE; PHARMACIES	Prevention of drug dispensing errors is an importance topic in medical care. In this paper, we propose a risk management approach, namely Hybrid Data Mining (HDM), to prevent the problem of drug dispensing errors. An intelligent drug dispensing errors prevention system based on the proposed approach is then implemented. The proposed approach consists of two main procedures: First, the classification modeling and logistic regression approaches are used to derive decision tree and regression function from the given dispensing errors cases and drug databases. In the second procedure, similar drugs are then gathered together into clusters by combing clustering technique (PoCluster) and the extracted logistic regression function. The drugs that may cause dispensing errors will then be alerted through the clustering results and the decision tree. Through experimental evaluation on real datasets in a medical center, the proposed approach was shown to be capable of discovering the potential dispensing errors effectively. Hence, the proposed approach and implemented system serve as very useful application of data mining techniques for risk management in healthcare fields.

Data Mining Applied to Harmonic Current Sources Identification in Residential Consumers	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Nonlinear Loads; Harmonic Components; Identification of Harmonic Sources; Artificial Neural Networks	NETWORK; SYSTEM; LOAD	This work proposes a method based on both preprocessing and data mining with the objective of identify harmonic current sources in residential consumers. In addition, this methodology can also be applied to identify linear and nonlinear loads. It should be emphasized that the entire database was obtained through laboratory essays, i.e., real data were acquired from residential loads. Thus, the residential system created in laboratory was fed by a configurable power source and in its output were placed the loads and the power quality analyzers (all measurements were stored in a microcomputer). So, the data were submitted to pre-processing, which was based on attribute selection techniques in order to minimize the complexity in identifying the loads. A newer database was generated maintaining only the attributes selected, thus, Artificial Neural Networks were trained to realized the identification of loads. In order to validate the methodology proposed, the loads were fed both under ideal conditions (without harmonics), but also by harmonic voltages within limits pre-established. These limits are in accordance with IEEE Std. 519-1992 and PRODIST (procedures to delivery energy employed by Brazilian's utilities). The results obtained seek to validate the methodology proposed and furnish a method that can serve as alternative to conventional methods.	[Fernandes, R. A. S.; da Silva, I.

Scatter-Gather-Merge: An efficient star-join query processing algorithm for data-parallel frameworks	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data parallel framework; MapReduce; Hadoop; Star-join query		A data-parallel framework is very attractive for large-scale data processing since it enables such an application to easily process a huge amount of data on commodity machines. MapReduce, a popular data-parallel framework, is used in various fields such as web search, data mining and data warehouses; it is proven to be very practical for such a data-parallel application. A star-join query is a popular query in data warehouses that are a current target domain of data-parallel frameworks. This article proposes a new algorithm that efficiently processes star-join queries in data-parallel frameworks such as MapReduce and Dryad. Our star-join algorithm for general data-parallel frameworks is called Scatter-Gather-Merge, and it processes star-join queries in a constant number of computation steps, although the number of participating dimension tables increases. By adopting bloom filters, Scatter-Gather-Merge reduces a non-trivial amount of IO. We also show that Scatter-Gather-Merge can be easily applied to MapReduce. Our experimental results in both cluster and cloud environments show that Scatter-Gather-Merge outperforms existing approaches.

However, most of existing clustering methods have high computational time or are not suitable for discovering clusters with non-convex shape. In this paper, an efficient clustering algorithm CHSMST is proposed, which is based on clustering based on hyper surface (CHS) and minimum spanning tree. In the first step, CHSMST applies CHS to obtain initial clusters immediately. Thereafter, minimum spanning tree is introduced to handle locally dense data which is hard for CHS to deal with. The experiments show that CHSMST can discover clusters with arbitrary shape.

J	Hong, TP; Huang, CM; Horng, SJ				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Huang, Cheng-Ming; Horng, Shi-Jinn			Discovering fuzzy inter- and intra-object associations	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rule; Data mining; Fuzzy set; Object-oriented transaction	MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; INDUCTION; RULES; ATTRIBUTES; SYSTEMS	Data mining is the process of extracting desirable knowledge or interesting patterns from existing databases for specific purposes. Recently, the fuzzy and the object concepts have been very popular and used in a variety of applications, especially for complex data description. This paper thus proposes a new fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting interesting knowledge from quantitative transactions stored as object data. Each item itself is thought of as a class, and each item purchased in a transaction is thought of as an instance. Instances with the same class (item name) may have different quantitative attribute values since they may appear in different transactions. The proposed fuzzy algorithm can be divided into two main phases. The first phase is called the fuzzy intra-object mining phase, in which the linguistic large itemsets associated with the same classes (items) but with different attributes are derived. Each linguistic large itemset found in this phase is thought of as a composite item used in phase 2. The second phase is called the fuzzy inter-object mining phase, in which the large itemsets are derived and used to represent the relationship among different kinds of objects. An example is used to illustrate the algorithm. Experimental results are also given to show the effects of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Given a set of source code files, the mined association rules suggest related code snippets to form the components of object-oriented programs. The mined sequential rules predict likely additional API sequences within a method. After an initial program statement is given, our MACs prototype can correctly predict useful related API code snippets. In our evaluation, we present two studies investigating the usefulness of MACs in software development tasks. One study evaluated the utility of MACs's association pattern recommendations. The other evaluated usefulness of sequential pattern recommendations, and both drew from a sample of eight source code projects from SourceForge.net. Our experimental evaluation shows that MACs has significant potential to assist developers, especially API newcomers, and provides an alternative method for code reuse. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, I; On, BW				Lee, Ingyu; On, Byung-Won			An effective web document clustering algorithm based on bisection and merge	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Clustering; Spectral bisection; Entity resolution; Data mining	GRAPHS	To cluster web documents, all of which have the same name entities, we attempted to use existing clustering algorithms such as K-means and spectral clustering. Unexpectedly, it turned out that these algorithms are not effective to cluster web documents. According to our intensive investigation, we found that clustering such web pages is more complicated because (1) the number of clusters (known as ground truth) is larger than two or three clusters as in general clustering problems and (2) clusters in the data set have extremely skewed distributions of cluster sizes. To overcome the aforementioned problem, in this paper, we propose an effective clustering algorithm to boost up the accuracy of K-means and spectral clustering algorithms. In particular, to deal with skewed distributions of cluster sizes, our algorithm performs both bisection and merge steps based on normalized cuts of the similarity graph G to correctly cluster web documents. Our experimental results show that our algorithm improves the performance by approximately 56% compared to spectral bisection and 36% compared to K-means.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			MEMSA: mining emerging melody structures from music query data	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Multimedia data mining; Music data mining; Melody structure mining; Emerging melody structure mining	NONTRIVIAL REPEATING PATTERNS; DATA STREAMS; DISCOVERY	Effective and efficient mining of music structure patterns from music query data is one of the most interesting issues of multimedia data mining. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of pattern, called emerging melody structure (EMS), for knowledge discovery from music melody streams. EMSs are defined as music data items with melody strings whose support increase significantly from one sliding window to another window from streaming melody sequences. The discovered EMS can be used to predict the future trend of online music style recommendation, to personalize the Web service of music downloading priority, for music composers to compose new music or for service provider to collect more similar music. Therefore, an efficient data mining approach, called MEMSA (Mining Emerging Melody Structure Algorithm), is proposed to discover all EMSs from streaming music query data over sliding windows. In the framework of MEMSA, a prefix tree-based data structure, called EMS-tree (Emerging Melody Structure tree), is constructed for maintaining temporal EMSs effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method MEMSA is an efficient algorithm for mining all EMSs from streaming melody sequences efficiently.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy method to formulate how interesting an association rule may be. It is indicated by the membership values belonging to two fuzzy sets (i.e., the stronger rule set and the weaker rule set), and thus provides much more flexibility than traditional methods to discover some potentially more interesting association rules. Furthermore, revised algorithms based on Apriori algorithm and matrix structure are designed under this framework.

With regard to the nature and amount of the data, data mining methods were selected for the purpose of analyses and experiments. The quality of real data is often insufficient for an immediate analysis. The article presents the data cleaning operations which have been carried out with the aim to improve the input data sample to obtain reliable models. Gradually, by means of properly chosen SW, network models were developed to verify generally valid patterns of network behavior as a bulk service. Furthermore, unlike the commercially available communication networks simulators, the models designed allowed us to capture nonstandard models of network behavior under an increased load, verify the correct sizing of the network to the increased load, and thus test its reliability. Finally, based on previous experience, the models enabled us to predict emergency situations with a reasonable accuracy.

An automatic and robust tool is needed to classify the file samples quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the human immune system, we developed a local concentration based virus detection method, which connects a certain number of two-element local concentration vectors as a feature vector. In contrast to the existing data mining techniques, the new method does not remember exact file content for virus detection, but uses a non-signature paradigm, such that it can detect some previously unknown viruses and overcome the techniques like obfuscation to bypass signatures. This model first extracts the viral tendency of each fragment and identifies a set of statical structural detectors, and then uses an information-theoretic preprocessing to remove redundancy in the detectors' set to generate 'self' and 'nonself' detector libraries. Finally, 'self' and 'nonself' local concentrations are constructed by using the libraries, to form a vector with an array of two elements of local concentrations for detecting viruses efficiently. Several standard data mining classifiers, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM), are leveraged to classify the local concentration vector as the feature of a benign or malicious program and to verify the effectiveness and robustness of this approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only has a much faster speed, but also gives around 98% of accuracy.

Recently, as a nonparametric mathematical programming approach, Data envelopment analysis has been applied in DA area and received great attention. In this paper, we propose a new discriminant approach based upon the relative distance measured by super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA). This approach may generally avoid the drawbacks that usually occur in statistics discriminations of constructing function to determine a DMU's category. On the other hand, this approach may maintain discriminant capabilities by incorporating the non-parametric feature of DEA into DA. At the same time, it can also inherit the advantages of avoiding the process of dealing with different dimensional data in DEA. Our approach can be used to classify a sample's category by the discrimination results, even in the multiple-groups situation. Therefore, it can be applied to the discriminant analysis in various real-life cases.

We propose a more general form for association rule, i.e., the Association Rule with Time-Windows (ARTW), to properly integrate the temporal association rules together with the normal ones. New notions like Frequent Itemset with Time-Windows (FITW) are also defined, and an Apriori-like algorithm, named TW-Apriori, is developed to fast generate the FITWs. Computational experiments are conducted on two datasets - a synthetic dataset and a real database. Both experiments show that large number of ARTWs ignored previously can be discovered under the new framework; many of them are even very strong rules and valuable for market decisions. The efficiency of the proposed TW-Apriori algorithm is also proven feasible since it can finish the calculation within one minute and the length of the calculation time is nearly proportional to the number of ARTWs found.

In this paper, we propose to summarize the set of subspace clusters into k representative clusters to alleviate the problem. Typically, subspace clusters can be clustered further into k groups, and the set of representative clusters can be selected from each group. In such a way, only the most representative subspace clusters will be returned to user. Unfortunately, when the size of the set of representative clusters is specified, the problem of finding the optimal set is NP-hard. To solve this problem efficiently, we present two approximate methods: PCoC and HCoC. The greatest advantage of our methods is that we only need a subset of subspace clusters as the input instead of the complete set of subspace clusters. Precisely, only the clusters in low-dimensional subspaces are computed and assembled into representative clusters in high-dimensional subspaces. The approximate results can be found in polynomial time. Our performance study shows both the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods.

J	Law, YN; Wang, HX; Zaniolo, C				Law, Yan-Nei; Wang, Haixun; Zaniolo, Carlo			Relational Languages and Data Models for Continuous Queries on Sequences and Data Streams	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Design; Theory; Data streams; queries; expressivity	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	Most data stream management systems are based on extensions of the relational data model and query languages, but rigorous analyses of the problems and limitations of this approach, and how to overcome them, are still wanting. In this article, we elucidate the interaction between stream-oriented extensions of the relational model and continuous query language constructs, and show that the resulting expressive power problems are even more serious for data streams than for databases. In particular, we study the loss of expressive power caused by the loss of blocking query operators, and characterize nonblocking queries as monotonic functions on the database. Thus we introduce the notion of NB-completeness to assure that a query language is as suitable for continuous queries as it is for traditional database queries. We show that neither RA nor SQL are NB-complete on unordered sets of tuples, and the problem is even more serious when the datamodel is extended to support order-a sine-qua-non in data stream applications. The new limitations of SQL, compounded with well-known problems in applications such as sequence queries and data mining, motivate our proposal of extending the language with user-defined aggregates (UDAs). These can be natively coded in SQL, according to simple syntactic rules that set nonblocking aggregates apart from blocking ones. We first prove that SQL with UDAs is Turing complete. We then prove that SQL with monotonic UDAs and union operators can express all monotonic set functions computable by a Turing machine (NB-completeness) and finally extend this result to queries on sequences ordered by their timestamps. The proposed approach supports data stream models that are more sophisticated than append-only relations, along with data mining queries, and other complex applications.

The relational databases are multivalued tables, which include any truth tables of logic functions as special cases. In this article, we propose a relational database approach to the decomposition of logic circuits. The relational algebra consists of a set of well-defined algebraic operations that can be performed on multivalued tables. Our approach shows that the functional decomposition of logic circuits is similar to the normalization of relational databases; they are governed by the same concepts of functional dependency (FD) and multivalued dependency (MVD). The completeness of relational algebra demonstrated by our approach to functional decomposition reveals that the relational database is a fundamental computation model, the same as the Boolean logic circuit.

Research on the performance of new ventures increasingly investigates initial resources as determinants of success. Initial resources are said to be important because they imprint the firm at start-up, limit its strategic choices, and continue to impact its performance in the long run. The purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of initial resource bundles, strategy and environment that lead to superior performance in start-ups. To date, interdependencies between resources on the one hand and between resources, strategy and environment on the other hand have been neglected in empirical research. We rely on data mining for the analysis because it accounts for premises of configurational theory, including reversed causality, intradimensional interactions, multidimensional dependencies, and equifinality. We apply advanced data mining techniques, in the form of rule extraction from non-linear support vector machines, to induce accurate and comprehensible configurations of resource bundles, strategy and environment. We base our analysis on an extensive survey among 218 Flemish start-ups. Our experiments indicate the good performance of rule extraction technique ALBA. Finally, for comprehensibility, intuitiveness and implementation reasons, the tree is transformed into a decision table. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This precision can be reached only by exploiting the mass of radar available data or the potential of recently launched satellites: high-resolution (Metric) or polarimetric images. This article presents the main results obtained by the ANR project EFIDIR (Extraction and Fusion of Information for Displacement measurement from Radar imagery, 2008-2012) which gathers specialists of SAR images, information processing and geosciences. A ground based SAR (GB-SAR) and specific processing methods were developed (radar tomography. oversampling of complex images...) to improve the characterization of electromagnetic scattering and EAR data pre-processing. The methods for extracting displacement information from the amplitude (texture tracking) or from the phase (multitemporal interferometry) have been expanded and tested on glacier large displacements or small interseismic deformations. An original data mining approach has also been developed for extracting frequent sequential patterns and successfully applied to the detection of patterns related to the ground deformation hidden by atmospheric artifacts. Finally a new approach to represent uncertainty by the possibility theory was introduced in the inversion step that can reconstruct 3D displacement fields (East, North, Up) or estimate the model parameters of geophysical phenomena at the origin of the observed surface displacements. These studies thus illustrate the major stages of processing chains from SAR data acquisition to geophysical modeling.

J	Wang, LM; Zang, XB				Wang Li-min; Zang Xue-bai			Implementation of a scalable decision forest model based on information theory	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Semantic knowledge; Decision forest; Information theory	TREES	One of the most challenging problems in data mining is to develop scalable algorithms capable of mining massive data sets. A novel decision forest learning algorithm named FDF is proposed in this paper to represent multi-level semantic knowledge of the relationship between the data and information implicated. FDF provides their users with just a single set of rules by redefining information gain of information theory, then each tree in the decision forest is constructed in the down-top learning framework, and the number of trees and stopping criteria can be set automatically. When no existing tree match test samples, FDF will build new logical rules for this and thus realize scalable construction process. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that decision forest has clear advantages with respect to probabilistic performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, Wrappers suffer from the fact that they only use a single classifier. The downside to this is that each classifier will have its own biases and will therefore select very different features. To overcome the biases of individual classifiers, we propose a new data mining method called Wrapper-based Decision Trees (WDT). The WDT method uses multiple classifiers for selecting relevant features and decision trees to visualize relationships among the selected features. We use the WDT to investigate the influences of the levels of computer experience on users' preferences for the design of search engines. The benefit of using WDT lies within the fact that it can uncover the most accurate set of relevant features to help differentiate the preferences of users with diverse levels of computer experience. The results indicate that the users with varied levels of computer experiences have different preferences regarding the following features: the number of icons, the arrangement of search results, and the presentation of error messages. Such findings can be used to develop personalized search engines to accommodate users' different levels of computer experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A condensed polynomial neural network for classification using swarm intelligence	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Polynomial neural network; Classification; Particle swarm optimization; Partial descriptor; Data mining		A novel condensed polynomial neural network using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is proposed for the task of classification in this paper. In solving classification task classical algorithms such as polynomial neural network (PNN) and its variants need more computational time as the partial descriptions (PDs) grow over the training period layer-by-layer and make the network very complex. Unlike PNN the proposed network needs to generate the partial description for a single layer. The discrete PSO (DPSO) is used to select a relevant set of PDs as well as features with a hope to get better accuracy, which are in turn fed to the output neuron. The weights associated with the links from hidden to output neuron is optimized by PSO for continuous domain (CPSO). Performance of this model is compared with the results obtained from PNN.

J	Hong, TP; Wu, CW				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Wu, Chih-Wei			Mining rules from an incomplete dataset with a high missing rate	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rule; Data mining; Missing value; Incomplete data; Support	ASSOCIATION RULES; VALUES	The problem of recovering missing values from a dataset has become an important research issue in the field of data mining and machine learning. In this thesis, we introduce an iterative missing-value completion method based on the RAR (Robust Association Rules) support values to extract useful association rules for inferring missing values in an iterative way. It consists of three phases. The first phase uses the association rules to roughly complete the missing values. The second phase iteratively reduces the minimum support to gather more association rules to complete the rest of missing values. The third phase uses the association rules from the completed dataset to correct the missing values that have been filled in. Experimental results show the proposed approaches have good accuracy and data recovery even when the missing-value rate is high. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hsu, KC; Li, MZ				Hsu, Kevin Chihcheng; Li, Ming-Zhong			Techniques for finding similarity knowledge in OLAP reports	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						OLAP; Data mining; MDS; Clustering; Similarity knowledge		On-line analytical processing (OLAP) is a common solution that modern enterprises use to generate, monitor, share, and administrate their analysis reports. When daily, weekly, and/or monthly reports are generated or published by the OLAP operators, all analyses on the contents of reports are left for the report readers. To discover hidden rules, similar reports, or trend inside the potentially huge amount of reports, the report readers can only rely on their smart eyes to find out any rules of such kinds. Data mining is a well-developed field for finding hidden rules inside the data itself. However, there are few techniques focus on finding hidden rules, similarity, or trend using OLAP reports as the unit of analysis. In this paper, we explore how to use data mining techniques on OLAP reports in order to automatically and effectively find the similarity knowledge of OLAP reports. We also address the appropriate presentation of this similarity knowledge to OLAP users. We compare the difference between traditional data mining and finding similarity knowledge from OLAP reports. We then proposed three methods (called OLAP_MDS, OLAP_CLU, and OLAP_M+C in this paper) to explore the effectiveness of discovering similarity knowledge from OLAP reports. Finally, we compare the pros and cons of the proposed three methods with experiments and conclude that the OLAP_M+C method should be the best in most cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mayo, M; Beretta, L				Mayo, Michael; Beretta, Lorenzo			Modelling epistasis in genetic disease using Petri nets, evolutionary computation and frequent itemset mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Petri net; Genetic algorithm; Frequent itemset mining; Epistasis; Genetic disease	POLYMORPHISMS; ASSOCIATION; SYSTEMS	Petri nets are useful for mathematically modelling disease-causing genetic epistasis. A Petri net model of an interaction has the potential to lead to biological insight into the cause of a genetic disease. However, defining a Petri net by hand for a particular interaction is extremely difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem and degrees of freedom inherent in a Petri net's architecture. We propose therefore a novel method, based on evolutionary computation and data mining, for automatically constructing Petri net models of non-linear gene interactions. The method comprises two main steps. Firstly, an initial partial Petri net is set up with several repeated sub-nets that model individual genes and a set of constraints, comprising relevant common sense and biological knowledge, is also defined. These constraints characterise the class of Petri nets that are desired. Secondly, this initial Petri net structure and the constraints are used as the input to a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm searches for a Petri net architecture that is both a superset of the initial net, and also conforms to all of the given constraints. The genetic algorithm evaluation function that we employ gives equal weighting to both the accuracy of the net and also its parsimony. We demonstrate our method using an epistatic model related to the presence of digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis patients that was recently reported in the literature. Our results show that although individual "perfect" Petri nets can frequently be discovered for this interaction, the true value of this approach lies in generating many different perfect nets, and applying data mining techniques to them in order to elucidate common and statistically significant patterns of interaction.

J	Pan, XY; Jiao, LC				Pan, Xiaoying; Jiao, Licheng			A granular agent evolutionary algorithm for classification	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Granular agent; Assimilation; Exchange; Differentiation	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; PERSPECTIVE; PREDICTION	By inspiration of the granular evolutionary algorithm, a Granular Agent Evolutionary Classification (GAEC) algorithm for the classification task in data mining is proposed. The method uses the granular agent to denote the set of some examples that have similar attributions and the knowledge base guides the evolution of granular agent. Also some granular evolutionary operators are designed for classification problem. Assimilation operator, exchange operator, and differentiation operator reflect the competitive, cooperative and self-learning ability of agent, respectively. Finally, some classification rules are extracted from granular agents by some strategy to forecast the sort of new data. Empirical study contains UCI data sets, KDDCUP99 data sets and remote image recognition. The test results show that the algorithm has a good classification prediction, and only need a small price for the training time. In most UCI data sets, the performance of GAEC is better than G-NET, OCEC and C4.5, which have good performance. At the same time, some Gaussian White Noise attributes are added to these UCI data sets and the results show GACE has some anti-noise abilities. To test the scalability of GAEC, two functions along two dimensions, the number of training examples and the number of attributes are used. Also, GAEC are applied to some real world fields, intrusion detection system and remote sensing image recognition. The experiments for KDDCUP99 verify GAEC has capability to deal with massive data in real world and good predicting capability for unknown type data. At last, the accuracy rate of GAEC is also good for the remote sensing image recognition. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, load monitoring incurs huge costs in terms of installation and maintenance. This paper presents a new model to analyze wherein facilities load under a feeder every 15 min using meter-reading data that can be obtained from a power consumer every 15 min or a month even without setting up any measuring equipment. After the data warehouse is constructed by interfacing the legacy system required for the load calculation, the relationship between the distribution system and the power consumer is established. Once the load pattern is forecasted by applying a clustering and classification algorithm of temporal data-mining techniques for the power customer who is not involved in automatic meter reading, a single-line diagram per feeder is created, and power-flow calculation is executed. The calculation result is analyzed by using various temporal and spatial analysis methods, such as the Internet geographic information system, single-line diagram, and online analytical processing.

In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem using a computationally intensive approach. We apply this approach to a new method for clustering recently introduced in the literature. It is the fuzzy c-means with tolerance. This method permits data to include some error, and this is modeled by moving data in a particular direction within a particular range when clusters are defined. The proper application of this approach needs the correct definition of the parameter.. A value that might be different for each record and corresponds to the maximum shift allowed to the data. In this paper, we review this method and we study the definition of this parameter. when the same value of. is used for all data elements. Our approach is based on the analysis of sets of data with increasing noise and an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of the algorithm with different values of.. The analysis is motivated in privacy preserving data mining. The same approach can be used for parameter selection in other clustering algorithms. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many recent approaches detect outliers according to reasonable, pre-defined concepts of an outlier (e.g., distance-based, density-based, etc.). However, the definition of an outlier differs between users or even datasets. This paper presents a solution to this problem by including input from the users. Our OBE (Outlier By Example) system is the first that allows users to provide examples of outliers in low-dimensional datasets. By incorporating a small number of such examples, OBE can successfully develop an algorithm by which to identify further outliers based on their outlierness. Several algorithmic challenges and engineering decisions must be addressed in building such a system. We describe the key design decisions and algorithms in this paper. In order to interact with users having different degrees of domain knowledge, we develop two detection schemes: OBE-Fraction and OBE-RF. Our experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that OBE can discover values that a user would consider outliers.

It is accepted that the ensemble methods can be divided into static and dynamic ones. Dynamic ensemble methods explore the use of different classifiers for different samples and therefore may get better generalization ability than static ensemble methods. However, for most of dynamic approaches based on KNN rule, additional part of training samples should be taken out for estimating "local classification performance" of each base classifier. When the number of training samples is not sufficient enough, it would lead to the lower accuracy of the training model and the unreliableness for estimating local performances of base classifiers, so further hurt the integrated performance. This paper presents a new dynamic ensemble model that introduces cross-validation technique in the process of local performances' evaluation and then dynamically assigns a weight to each component classifier.

J	Alqadah, F; Bhatnagar, R				Alqadah, Faris; Bhatnagar, Raj			Similarity measures in formal concept analysis	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Cluster similarity; Formal concept analysis		Formal concept analysis (FCA) has been applied successively in diverse fields such as data mining, conceptual modeling, social networks, software engineering, and the semantic web. One shortcoming of FCA, however, is the large number of concepts that typically arise in dense datasets hindering typical tasks such as rule generation and visualization. To overcome this shortcoming, it is important to develop formalisms and methods to segment, categorize and cluster formal concepts. The first step in achieving these aims is to define suitable similarity and dissimilarity measures of formal concepts. In this paper we propose three similarity measures based on existent set-based measures in addition to developing the completely novel zeros-induced measure. Moreover, we formally prove that all the measures proposed are indeed similarity measures and investigate the computational complexity of computing them. Finally, an extensive empirical evaluation on real-world data is presented in which the utility and character of each similarity measure is tested and evaluated.

We first select a subset of features of all the cases, and then cluster the cases into disjoint groups, where each group of cases forms the case-base of one of the member classifiers. Finally, in each case-base, a subset of features is 'locally' selected individually. To predict the label of an unseen case, each classifier in the ensemble provides a prediction, and the aggregation component of E4CBR combines the predictions by weighing each classifier using a CBR approach-a classifier with more cases similar to the test case receives a higher weight. We evaluated E4CBR on four publicly available biological data sets, and also compared the classification error of E4CBR with a single CBR classifier. In our experiments, we use TA3-a computational framework for CBR systems. Our results show that E4CBR reduces the classification error of our CBR classifier. On the basis of empirical results, our aggregation method outperforms the existing CBR aggregation methods. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In recent years, a number of methods for attack intention recognition have been proposed. However, most of these techniques mainly focus on the alerts of an intrusion detection system and use algorithms of low efficiency that mine frequent attack patterns without reconstructing attack paths. In this paper, a novel and effective method is proposed, which integrates several techniques to identify attack intentions. Using this method, a Bayesian-based attack scenario is constructed, where frequent attack patterns are identified using an efficient data-mining algorithm based on frequent patterns. Subsequently, attack paths are rebuilt by re-correlating frequent attack patterns mined in the scenario. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of our method in rebuilding attack paths, recognizing attack intentions as well as in saving system resources. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to correlate complementary intrusion evidence with frequent pattern mining techniques based on the FP-Growth algorithm to rebuild attack paths and to recognize attack intentions.

J	Chandra, B; Bhaskar, S				Chandra, B.; Bhaskar, Shalini			A new approach for generating efficient sample from market basket data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sampling; Synopsis; Threshold; Scalability		Classical data mining algorithms require expensive passes over the entire database to generate frequent items and hence to generate association rules. With the increase in the size of database, it is becoming very difficult to handle large amount of data for computation. One of the solutions to this problem is to generate sample from the database that acts as representative of the entire database for finding association rules in such a way that the distance of the sample from the complete database is minimal. Choosing correct sample that could represent data is not an easy task. Many algorithms have been proposed in the past. Some of them are computationally fast while others give better accuracy. In this paper, we present an algorithm for generating a sample from the database that can replace the entire database for generating association rules and is aimed at keeping a balance between accuracy and speed. The algorithm that is proposed takes into account the average number of small, medium and large 1-itemset in the database and average weight of the transactions to define threshold condition for the transactions. Set of transactions that satisfy the threshold condition is chosen as the representative for the entire database. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested over several runs of database generated by IBM synthetic data generator. A vivid comparative performance evaluation of the proposed technique with the existing sampling techniques for comparing the accuracy and speed has also been carried out. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, when A, B or C is the newly marketed product, A > B boolean OR C shall be a very useful rule in some cases. Since the consequent item of this kind of rule is formed by a disjunctive composite item, we call this type of rules as the disjunctive consequent association rules. Therefore, we propose a simple but efficient algorithm to discover this type of rules. Moreover, when we apply our algorithm to insurance policy for cross selling, the useful results have been proven by the insurance company. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The research work summarized by this paper discusses two different case studies in the field of portals for collaborative research communities, in particular VectorBase and BGA-Space. VectorBase at its core is a scientific database that focuses on search, data mining and offers multiple integrated bioinformatics tools for analyzing and browsing genomic and related data. BGA-Space focuses on capturing semantics from scientists during processing of scientific experiments as well as preserving the full life cycle of scientific data to enable their reuse. The two case studies involve heavy research and the application of theories, concepts, and knowledge commonly discussed in the targeted field. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Seeking new revenue opportunities from application development has created a gold rush. However, free or very cheap applications constitute a great bulk of the application downloads putting great pricing pressure on the developers. Furthermore, usage statistics suggest that most of the applications have been either one-trick applications or are downright useless, meriting no attention from the user beyond the first day. This is not surprising since cheap prices will dissuade developers from investing large sums of money to continue to develop more sophisticated, high quality applications. Developers have been complaining about the lack of visibility of their applications in stores that are beginning to resemble a high volume warehouse. It is clear that enhancing application discovery and building better marketing tools will be essential for the continued success of the mobile application marketplace and application stores. This paper proposes and investigates techniques for effective discovery of applications by matching user interests with application characteristics, with a special focus on adapting classical data mining techniques to user ratings of the applications. The user ratings are leveraged to make recommendations on potential applications of interest. (C) 2011 Alcatel-Lucent.

Mining large medical claims database to identify high-risk patients: the case of antidepressant utilization	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							DISCOVERY; DIAGNOSIS; CLUSTERS; PATTERNS	Data mining techniques have been applied to discover knowledge from large observational data sets. In this paper, we focus on mining large medical claims databases to identify high-risk patients. Patient selection, feature extraction, and feature selection are three important processing steps before popular data mining techniques are successfully applied. Both patient selection and feature extraction require domain knowledge. The episode treatment group methodology is a useful tool for organizing medical claims data. It is used for patient selection and feature extraction in this paper. The specific goal of the study is to identify patients with major depression who have a high risk of receiving inadequate antidepressant medication. A nationwide medical claims database covering a 5-year period is used for this study. The records of 31,721 high-risk patients and 50,022 comparison patients were examined for 18 features that include patient demographics, episode factors, and comorbidity factors. After supervised feature selection, three features were selected and analyzed using the classification and regression tree method. The result showed that it is possible to use two of the features (number of non-antidepressant medications used and average number of claims during an episode of major depression) to identify a group of high-risk patients. These patients are 2.67 times more likely to have inadequate antidepressant medication than the comparison patients. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Reducing Database Scans for On-shelf Utility Mining	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Data mining; High-utility itemsets; On-shelf data; Utility mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; ITEMSET UTILITIES; DISCOVERY	Utility mining has recently been an emerging topic in the field of data mining. It finds out high-utility itemsets by considering both the profits and quantities of items in transactions. In real applications, however, utility mining may have a bias if items are not always on shelf. On-shelf utility mining is then proposed, which considers not only individual profit and quantity of each item in a transaction but also common on-shelf time periods of a product combination. In the past, a two-phase on-shelf utility mining was proposed to discover the desired patterns in on-shelf utility mining. It, however, adopted the level-wise mining way to find the patterns. To speed up the execution efficiency, a three-scan mining approach is thus proposed in the paper to efficiently discover high on-shelf utility itemsets. The proposed approach utilizes an itemset-generation mechanism to prune redundant candidates early and to systematically check the itemsets from transactions. At last, the experimental results on synthetic datasets show the proposed approach has a better performance than the previous one.

Like any other development activity it is not without risks. This work is about the empirical study of risks of requirements by applying machine learning techniques, specifically Bayesian networks classifiers. We have defined several models to predict the risk level for a given requirement using three dataset that collect metrics taken from the requirement specifications of different projects. The classification accuracy of the Bayesian models obtained is evaluated and compared using several classification performance measures. The results of the experiments show that the Bayesians networks allow obtaining valid predictors. Specifically, a tree augmented network structure shows a competitive experimental performance in all datasets. Besides, the relations established between the variables collected to determine the level of risk in a requirement, match with those set by requirement engineers. We show that Bayesian networks are valid tools for the automation of risks assessment in requirement engineering.

Special use is, for example, tariff design under market environment. In this paper new framework is developed for tariff design. This framework uses k-means algorithm for clustering samples of measured load profiles and makes classification by using decision trees for data from questionnaires which were filled by household customers. This way it is possible to maximize combined use of historic load measurements and simple information about various household customers.

One crucial part in web automation applications is for them to easily generate and reproduce navigation sequences. This problem is specially complicated in the case of the new breed of AJAX-based websites. Although recently some tools have also addressed the problem, they show some limitations either in usability or their ability to deal with complex websites. In this paper, we propose a set of new techniques to build an automatic web navigation system able to deal with these complexities. Our main contributions are: a new method for recording navigation sequences able to scale to a wider range of events, an algorithm to identify in a change-resilient manner the target element of a user action, and a novel method to detect when the effects caused by a user action (including the effects of scripting code and AJAX requests) have finished.

J	Oatley, G; Ewart, B				Oatley, Giles; Ewart, Brian			Data mining and crime analysis	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							INTELLIGENCE; BURGLARY; FRAUD	An essential component of criminal investigation involves the interrogation of large databases of information held by police and other criminal justice agencies. Data mining and decision support systems have an important role to play in assisting human inference in this forensic domain that creates one of the most challenging decision-making environments. Technologies range widely and include social network analysis, geographical information systems, and data mining technologies for clustering crimes, finding links between crime and profiling offenders, identifying criminal networks, matching crimes, generating suspects, and predicting criminal activity. This paper does not intend to cover the gamut of techniques available to the investigator of crime as this has been presented elsewhere (Oatley GC, Ewart BW, Zeleznikow J. Decision support systems for police: lessons from the application of data mining techniques to 'soft' forensic evidence. Artif Intell Law 2006, 14: 35-100). Rather, the objective is to highlight issues of implementation and interpretation of the techniques available to the crime analyst. To this end, the authors draw from their experiences of working with real-world crime databases (Oatley GC, Belem B, Fernandes K, Hoggarth E, Holland B, Lewis C, Meier P, Morgan K, Santhanam J, et al.

This pattern is useful for grouping highly interrelated users in one-way communications such as e-mail, SMS, etc., especially when the communications include many spam users. Also, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering IUSPs from massive one-way communication logs containing only the following information: senders, receivers, and dates and times. Even though there is a difficulty in that our new sequential pattern violates the Apriori property, the proposed algorithm shows excellent processing performance and low storage cost in experiments on a real dataset.

Although much computational effort is devoted for their training and statistical evaluation, model deployment can also represent a scientific problem, when several data mining models have to be used together, constraints appear on their application, or they have to be included in decision processes based on different rules, equations and constraints. In this paper we address the problem of combining several data mining models for objects and individuals in a common scenario, where not only we can affect decisions as the result of a change in one or more data mining models, but we have to solve several optimisation problems, such as choosing one or more inputs to get the best overall result, or readjusting probabilities after a failure. We illustrate the point in the area of customer relationship management (CRM), where we deal with the general problem of prescription between products and customers. We introduce the concept of negotiable feature, which leads to an extended taxonomy of CRM problems of greater complexity, since each new negotiable feature implies a new degree of freedom. In this context, we introduce several new problems and techniques, such as data mining model inversion (by ranging on the inputs or by changing classification problems into regression problems by function inversion), expected profit estimation and curves, global optimisation through a Monte Carlo method, and several negotiation strategies in order to solve this maximisation problem.

Privacy-Preserving Outlier Detection Through Random Nonlinear Data Distortion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Data mining; non-linear; perturbation; privacy-preserving	ALGORITHMS	Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private or sensitive data and wants a data miner to access them for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy-preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to their release to the data miners. Previous works only considered the case of linear data perturbations-additive, multiplicative, or a combination of both-for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. The experiments conducted on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

To represent knowledge discovered from data tables, a decision logic (DL) is proposed in rough set theory. DL, is an instance of propositional logic, but we can use other logical formalisms to describe data tables. In this paper, we propose two descriptions of data tables based on first-order data logic (FOUL) and attribute value-sorted logic (AVSL) respectively. In the context of FODL, we show that explicit, definability and implicit definability in classical logic implies the notion of definability in rough set theory. We also show that AVSL is particularly useful for the representation of properties of many-valued data tables.

The reason is that typical data mining tasks, such as clustering, cannot produce high quality results when applied on high-dimensional and/or large (in terms of cardinality) datasets. Data preprocessing and in particular dimensionality reduction constitute promising tools to deal with this problem. However, most of the existing dimensionality reduction algorithms share also the same disadvantages with data mining algorithms, when applied on large datasets of high dimensionality. In this article, we propose a fast and efficient dimensionality reduction algorithm (FEDRA), which is particularly scalable and therefore suitable for challenging datasets. FEDRA follows the landmark-based paradigm for embedding data objects in a low-dimensional projection space. By means of a theoretical analysis, we prove that FEDRA is efficient, while we demonstrate the achieved quality of results through experiments on datasets of higher cardinality and dimensionality than those employed in the evaluation of competitive algorithms. The obtained results prove that FEDRA manages to retain or ameliorate clustering quality while projecting in less than 10% of the initial dimensionality. Moreover, our algorithm produces embeddings that enable the faster convergence of clustering algorithms. Therefore, FEDRA emerges as a powerful and generic tool for data pre-processing, which can be integrated in other data mining algorithms, thus enhancing their performance.

FINDING REPRESENTATIVE WEB PAGES BASED ON A SOM AND A REVERSE CLUSTER ANALYSIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Web text mining; web usage mining; self organizing neural networks; clustering; post-processing	DIRECTIONS	Enhancing the content and structure of a web site is a very important task which can help to maintain people visiting a web site and gain new visits (or customers). Web mining area helps to enhance a web site organization and contents using data mining algorithms. In particular we may perform Web Mining using a Self Organizing Feature Map (SOFM or SOM) it is always needed an analysis phase by experts. To help analysts to perform this phase after SOFMs' training, many post-processing techniques have been developed (component planes, labels, etc.); however, none of these techniques are useful when working in web mining for off-line enhancements of a web site. In this paper an algorithm called Reverse Cluster Analysis (RCA) will be provided. It aims to identify important web pages based on a self organizing feature map (SOFM) when performing web text mining (WTM) and web usage mining (WUM). We successfully applied this technique in a real web site to show its effectiveness. We have extended previous work performing a comparison with another unsupervised technique, administrators survey and an extended survey.

AN INTELLIGENT AND EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR MENTAL DISORDER TREATMENT BY USING BIOFEEDBACK ANALYSIS AND WEB TECHNOLOGIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biofeedback analysis; online mental therapy; mental disorder treatment; intelligent healthcare; data mining	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; PANIC DISORDER; SELF-HELP; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; INTERNET; DRINKING; EFFICACY; ANXIETY; CBT	In the medical science field, the treatment of mental disorders has been an important issue. Recently, the treatment of mental disorders through biofeedback therapy is emerging as an important topic. A number of studies on the integration of mental healthcare and the Internet have also been proposed, since the Internet plays a more and more crucial role in various healthcare applications. By performing biofeedback therapy via the Internet, the treatment time can be highly reduced and the medical costs can also be significantly cut down. In view of this, this research aims at developing an intelligent treatment system for the patients with mental disorders by integrating biofeedback therapy and web technology. The system provides not only a convenient mechanism for the patients to perform biofeedback therapy at home but also an effective communication channel for patients and medical professionals. Moreover, the functions which enable the therapists to manage their patients more conveniently are proposed. The results of this research are expected to bring a pivotal impact on the healthcare industry with increased and enhanced levels of technology and services.

In digital mammography, data mining techniques are used to detect and characterize abnormalities in images and clinical reports. In the existing approaches, the mammogram image classification is done in either clinical data or statistical features of an image using neural networks and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This paper is proposed to evaluate the Application of Feature Extraction by means of combining the clinical and image features for clustering and classification in mammogram images. Initially, mammogram dataset is divided into training and test set. For the training and test sets, preprocessing techniques like noise removal and background removal are done to the images and Region of Interest (ROI) is identified. The statistical features are extracted from the ROI and the clinical data are obtained from the dataset. The feature set is clustered using k-means algorithm followed by SVM classification to classify the image as benign or malignant. The accuracy obtained from the proposed approach of clustering followed by classification is 86.11% which is higher than the direct classification approach where the accuracy is 80.0%. From the above results, the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy is justified.

With its massive amount of information that includes billions of web pages, information for just about any topic is a click-of-finger away. Analyzing the massive content of the web has many important aspects such as information discovering, efficient search engines and social and political patterns. Web mining techniques such as text classification and categorization are being used to provide an "under-the-microscope" picture of the web. The Arabic web represents an important portion of the web. With Arabic as the 5th most spoken language in the world and with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users at exponential rates, it is becoming important to analyze the Arabic web content and study its trends. This paper presents a close look at the content of the Arabic web. It presents the percentiles of the contents of the web in five categories, namely, politics, culture, sports, economics and religion. We used two different text classification algorithms and compared their results. We have also compared between the two text classification techniques in terms of precision and recall. The classifiers shown that the economics and politics are the highest percentiles (65% combined) while the culture and religion categories scored the lowest percentiles (about 10% combined)	[Abdeen, M.; Elsehemy, A.; Nazmy, T.] Ain Shams Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Cairo, Egypt	Abdeen, M (reprint author), Ain Shams Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Cairo, Egypt.

The aim of chance discovery is discover something, but chance discovery is rather different from data mining. In 2007 Taleb introduced a concept "Black Swan." Taleb uses this rare black swan metaphor to explain how usual person tend to ignore rare or novel events and the importance of being aware of such rare or novel events. The main concept of Black Swan seems coincide with that of chance discovery. Thus, in this paper, I compare a chance with Black Swan and present the future feather of chance discovery.

Stolfo et al. propose the intrusion detection system based on data mining technology. It solves the problem that self-adaptability of the system is poor, and the conditions of misreport or omission are also further improved. However, as far as mass data are concerned, more and more resources need to be consumed in the intrusion detection system based on data mining technology, and the detection speed gets slower and slower. In the article, the multi-grade intrusion detection model based on data mining technology is proposed, and the objective to improve the detection speed is reached.

For a certain set of jobs, soft skills are often considered more crucial than the hard skills or technical skills, in order to perform the job effectively. However, it is not a trivial task to identify the appropriate soft skills for each job. In this light, this study proposed a solution to assist employers when preparing advertisement via identification of suitable soft skills together with its relevancy to that particular job title. Bayesian network is employed to solve this problem because it is suitable for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The proposed Bayesian Network is trained using a dataset collected via extracting information from advertisements and also through interview sessions with a few identified experts.

In this study we compare three different approaches for handling both class imbalance and high dimensionality simultaneously. The first approach consists of sampling followed by feature selection, with the training data being built using the selected features and the original (unsampled) data. The second approach is similar, except that it uses the sampled data (and selected features) to build the training data. In the third approach, feature selection takes place before sampling, and the training data is based on the sampled data. To compare these three approaches, we use seven groups of datasets covering different application domains, employ nine feature rankers from three different families, and generate artificial class noise to better simulate real-world datasets. The results differ from an earlier work and show that the first and third approaches perform, on average, better than the second approach.

For this reason, novel approaches are necessary to obtain suitable learning solutions able to generate efficient, personalized and flexible learning experiences. From this point of view, the use of different cooperative intelligent agents can be exploited to analyze learner's preferences and generate high quality learning presentations which provide attractive learning solutions. In particular, to achieve this goal this paper exploits an ontological representation of the learning environment and an adaptive memetic algorithm based on a cooperative multi-agent framework. In this framework different agents analyze the e-learning instance and solve it in a parallel way, cooperating among them. This cooperation is performed by jointly exploiting data mining, via fuzzy decision trees, together with a decision making framework exploiting fuzzy methodologies. As will be shown in the experimental results section, this multi-agent strategy is capable of speeding up the convergence to high-quality personalized e-learning experiences.

Among the different art disciplines, music is one of the arts that most benefited from the use of computers. There are many works which demonstrate the great synergy between these two fields. In this paper we will focus on a specific music composition problem: the figured bass problem, in which we have to automatically generate a 4 voice piece of music, starting from an input the bass line. To solve this problem we use a hybrid strategy, in which different metaheuristics cooperate to find high quality solutions. The cooperation is controlled by means of the combination of fuzzy control and knowledge obtained through Data Mining. As will be shown in the experimental results section, this hybrid strategy is capable of finding musical solutions with an acceptable quality and never discordant which, according to experts, are sound and adhere to scholastic rule.

Unfortunately, experts predict that global temperatures will increase even more during the next years; thus, to decide how to assist possibly affected people, experts require tools that help them to discover potential risky regions based on their weather conditions. We address this problem and propose a tool able to support experts in the discovery of these risky areas. We present CAREY, a federated tool built on top of a weather database, that implements a semi-supervised data mining approach to discover regions with similar weather observations which may characterize micro-climate zones. Additionally, Top-k Skyline techniques have been developed to rank micro-climate areas according to how close they are to a given weather condition of risk. We conducted an initial experimental study as a proof-of-concepts, and the preliminary results suggest that CAREY may provide an effective support for the visualization of potential risky areas.

The data required to detect attacks as they occur (on-line analysis of live data) and predict future threats (forensic analysis/data mining) is not only large, but is growing at a staggering rate. Data such as network traffic logs, emails, and social networking posts, SMS message, and cell phone call logs are, by nature, continuous and growing. The problem addressed in this research is that current systems are not designed to handle either the scope or nature of the analysis or the data itself. For example, distributed data processing systems like Google's Map-Reduce provide the ability to process large data sets, but they are not designed to easily support processing of changing data sets or data-mining algorithms. In light of this, Google has itself recently stopped using MapReduce for building its web-index, opting instead for a custom mechanism that can more quickly respond to and process new content. Non-traditional databases, like vertically-partitioned/column-store databases, can efficiently support analysis algorithms on large quantities of data, but they are not designed to support continuously changing data sets. The goal of this research is to explore and design new data management system that can handle large quantities of incrementally growing data as well as direct support for data mining and analysis algorithms. Specifically, this research proposes a new distributed data processing system that exploits the parallel and distributed resources/computation of cloud computing infrastructures. It makes use of summary data structures that can be updated incrementally and continuous queries to support analysis and data mining algorithms natively. This approach allows for larger-scale and more robust analysis on continuously growing data that can help detect, predict and respond to cyber-warfare threats.

The numbers of obese people are increasing every year. There are evidences that childhood obesity persists into adulthood. Predicting obesity at an early age is both useful and important because preventive measures and proper interventions can be applied if the children indicated a high risk of obesity. However, the prediction of childhood obesity is a difficult task. Many ways and techniques such as assessment of body composition, data mining techniques, and logistic regression have been applied to predict childhood obesity, but only a few managed to produce accurate results. The numbers of efforts on childhood obesity prediction need to be increased and the techniques used should be improvised. The initial stage of this study involves collecting data from primary sources: parents, children and caretaker.

Out of the large number of data mining approaches, association rule mining is the most popular. In this paper. the conventional association rule mining technique has been improved to be able to extract better data from the large pool of data. A strategy has been proposed for selection of association rules that will result into extraction of more relevant and useful data from the data set. It is observed that the proposed method gives more precise results and thus is more efficient as compared to the commonly used rule mining technique. The method is more useful since more relevant information becomes available to the analysts and businesses.

Textbooks have a direct bearing on the quality of education imparted to the students as they are the primary conduits for delivering content knowledge [9]. They are also indispensable for fostering teacher learning and constitute a key component of the ongoing professional development of the teachers [5,8]. Many textbooks, particularly from emerging countries, lack clear and adequate coverage of important concepts [7]. In this talk, we present our early explorations into developing a data mining based approach for enhancing the quality of textbooks. We discuss techniques for algorithmically augmenting different sections of a book with links to selective content mined from the Web. For finding authoritative articles, we first identify the set of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web (Wikipedia) articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and augment the section with links to them [4]. We also describe a framework for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respectingglobal relevancy to the entire chapter to which the section belongs. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textbook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [2].			ragrawal@acm.org					Agrawal R., 2011, WWW; Agrawal R., 2010, 1 ANN ACM S COMP DEV; Agrawal R., 2011, ENRICHING TXB WEB IM; Gillies J., 2008, EQUIP2 USAID ED QUAL; Hanushek E.

Such portals become an indispensable platform for members especially for a Special Interest Groups (SIG) to share knowledge and expertise in their respective fields. Finding expertise over the e-community portal will help interested people and researchers to identify other experts, working in the same area. However, it is quite a cumbersome task to search such expertise in the portal. In order to find an expert, expertise data mining could be a solution to ease the search of experts. Performing effective data mining technique will help to analyze and measure expertise level accurately in a SIG portal. This paper proposes a method called Expertise Data Mining (EDM) that comprises a few techniques for expertise search in a SIG portal. It expects to improve the finding of experts among the members of a SIG e-community.

Therefore such network is an important target for imposters who can disrupt the internet services by attacking the network core, thereby causing significant revenue losses to mobile operators. GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the primary protocol used between the 30 core network nodes. In this paper, we present; the design of a multi-layer framework to detect fuzzing attacks targeted to GTP control (GTP-C) packets. The framework analyzes each type of GTP-C packet separately for feature extraction, by implementing a Markov state space model at the G(n), interface of the 30 core network. The Multi-layered architecture utilizes standard data mining algorithms for classification. Our analysis is based on real world network traffic collected at the Gn interface. The analysis results show that for only 5% fuzzing introduced in a packet with average size of 85 bytes, the framework detects fuzzing in GTP-C packets with 99.9% detection accuracy and 0.01% false alarm rate.
