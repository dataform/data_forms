The aim is to enable root-cause identification from a mixed event stream and to offer aggregated information for holistic problem solving. This end-to-end investigation spans feature selection and similarity assessment, clustering on heterogeneous feature maps, and evaluation of results. We compare feature values based on network information, user-defined similarity matrices, and textual analysis, and capture aspects of feature correlation in the event similarity function. Spectral clustering partitions the stream and serves to learn a more general similarity metric from a reference partitioning. Finally, we introduce two novel result visualization techniques and make a case study on one identified root-cause for which this framework outperforms both a time-pressured human operator and baseline clustering algorithms.

Traditionally focused on workflows, they usually assume that process tasks are clearly specified, and referred to in the logs. This limits however their application to many real-life BPM environments (e.g. issue tracking systems) where the traced events do not match any predefined task, but yet keep lots of context data. In order to make the usage of predictive process mining to such logs more effective and easier, we devise a new approach, combining the discovery of different execution scenarios with the automatic abstraction of log events. The approach has been integrated in a prototype system, supporting the discovery, evaluation and reuse of predictive process models. Tests on real-life data show that the approach achieves compelling prediction accuracy w.r.t. state-of-the-art methods, and finds interesting activities' and process variants' descriptions.

Ongoing research in this domain must address the challenges of modeling complex patterns of association, systems biology (i.e. the integration of different data types to achieve a more holistic perspective), and 'big data' (i.e. scalability in large-scale analysis). With this in mind, we introduce ExSTraCS (Extended Supervised Tracking and Classifying System), as a promising platform to address these challenges using supervised learning and a Michigan-Style LCS architecture. ExSTraCS integrates several successful LCS advancements including attribute tracking/feedback, expert knowledge covering (with four built-in attribute weighting algorithms), a flexible and efficient rule representation (handling datasets with both discrete and continuous attributes), and rapid non-destructive rule compaction. A few novel mechanisms, such as adaptive data management, have been included to enhance ease of use, flexibility, performance, and provide groundwork for ongoing development.

We use a data mining technique called sequential pattern mining to identify problematic sequences of concurrent read and write accesses to the shared memory of a multi-threaded program. Our technique does not rely on any characteristics specific to one type of concurrency bug, thus providing a general framework for concurrency bug explanation. In our method, given a set of concurrent execution traces, we first mine sequences that frequently occur in failing traces and then rank them based on the number of their occurrences in passing traces. We consider the highly ranked sequences of events that occur frequently only in failing traces an explanation of the system failure, as they can reveal its causes in the execution traces. Since the scalability of sequential pattern mining is limited by the length of the traces, we present an abstraction technique which shortens the traces at the cost of introducing spurious explanations. Spurious as well as misleading explanations are then eliminated by a subsequent filtering step, helping the programmer to focus on likely causes of the failure. We validate our approach using a number of case studies, including synthetic as well as real-world bugs.

To accurately predict these characteristics, it is necessary to create models that can replicate thermomechanical state of material and its evolution during processing. This paper presents development of a hybrid model that uses mills setting and real time plant data such as chemical composition; forces and temperatures; and integrates them with empirical relationships of material evolution to predict quality attributes. This information is combined with non-linear statistical data mining models to create online tool that predicts properties of individual coil.

Trip Recommendation with Multiple User Constraints by Integrating Point-of-Interests and Travel Packages	2014 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE DATA MANAGEMENT (MDM), VOL 1	IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (IEEE MDM)	JUL 14-18, 2014	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, CSIRO, Univ Queensland, Univ Pittsburgh, IEEE Tech Comm Data Engn, IBM Res Labs, Australia, IBM Res Labs, Austin, IEEE Comp Soc		Trip Recommendation; Point-of-Interest; Travel Package; Location-Based Social Network; Data Mining		With the advances of mobile communication techniques in recent years, numerous kinds of Location-Based Services (LBSs) have been developed and one popular application of LBSs is trip recommendation. Although there exist already a number of studies on this topic in literatures, most of them focused on combining a set of point-of-interests (POIs, or say attractions) as a trip based on user-specific constraints. In another way, some few works discussed making recommendation in terms of travel packages, which have the benefits of lower cost and higher convenience. However, no prior work explores to integrate attractions and travel packages simultaneously for trip recommendation. In fact, such a hybrid-style recommender can provide higher benefits for users although there exist critical challenges here like the efficiency issue in such kind of real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Package-Attraction-based Trip Recommender (PATR) to efficiently recommend the personalized trips satisfying multiple constraints by effectively combining attractions and packages. In PATR, a Score Inference Model is proposed to infer the scores of attractions and packages by taking user-based preference and temporal-based properties into account. Then, the Hybrid Trip-Mine algorithm is proposed to efficiently discover the optimal trip which satisfies the multiple user-specific constraints with both of attractions and packages considered simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose two pruning strategies based on Hybrid Trip-Mine, named Score Estimation (SE) and Score Bound Tightening (SBT), to further improve the execution efficiency and memory utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on travel recommendation that considers attractions and packages simultaneously. Through extensive experimental evaluations, our proposed approaches were shown to deliver excellent performance.

However, since the data collected by sensors and RFID readers are usually noisy, it is necessary and meaningful to clean up the noise, including missing detection events and cross detection events, so as to provide high quality data for various applications using trajectory data. Cleaning up the trajectory events should take into account of uncertainty of location and unreliability of event detection at the same time. In the paper, we first discuss the rules to distinguish between normal detection events and false detection events in the trajectories, using constraints on continuous motion between adjacent detection regions and direct moving time between neighboring physical regions. Then, as a unified cleaning framework, we establish a probabilistic region connection graph to represent region detection features, region connection relationships, and region transition probabilities of neighboring physical regions. Focusing on interpolating missing events, we suggest two path-based probabilistic interpolating strategies, namely, the Most Likely Path (MLP) strategy and the Highest Weighting Probability Path (HWPP) strategy. Also, we discuss pruning rules of candidate paths for reducing computational cost. Finally, we conduct experiments over simulation data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

Therefore, analyzing the increasing amount of spatio-temporal data emerges as an important topic. Most studies on geographic data mining focus on exploring static mobility patterns. As the amount of incoming data streams increases, revealing the temporal aspect of user mobility patterns is worth investigating. This paper targets on mining user mobility patterns over time (referred to as mobility evolution) from streams of check-in records. Intuitively, at each time slot, a mobility pattern indicates spatial regions where users stay. Therefore, given a set of time slots, mobility evolution refers a sequence of spatial regions at each time slot. Note that nearby time slots may have similar spatial region distribution. Thus, given check-in datasets, we use the idea of data compression to obtain a sequence of representative segments, where each representative segment captures spatial region distribution at the corresponding time interval. To measure the quality of a segmentation result, we propose a representation cost function based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. In addition, because deriving the sequence of segments incurs expensive computational cost, we propose a family of greedy algorithms for segmentation to serve diverse requirements: efficient compression, informative compression, and cost-effective compression. Besides, to handle the massive amount of incoming check-in data, we also propose an incremental compression approach to incrementally update the mobility evolution. We conduct experiments on Foursquare datasets to demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Travel smart cards, which record users' public transporting histories, capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. This provides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. In recent years, research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lot of attention in applications such as recommendation systems, crowd behavior analysis applications, and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper, our goal is to estimate the similarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core of our proposal is a novel user similarity measurement, namely, Travel Spatial-Temporal Similarity (TST), which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users. Moreover, we also propose a hybrid index structure, which integrates inverted files and cluster-based partitioning, to allow for efficient retrieval of the top-K most similar users. Through experimental evaluation, our proposed approach is shown to deliver scalable performance.

By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, RouteMiner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, RouteMiner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed RouteMiner. In the future, RouteMiner is going to serve as the phototype for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.

The location data is modeled as a grid with cell transitions, which not only helps in mining and retrieving the similarity pattern between users, but also reduces the complexity for storage of such location information which is normally modeled as trajectories in moving object databases. The system also showcases an interactive browser-based visualization component that demonstrates the results of each step - modeling the grid, extraction of cell transition sequence and user similarity mining.

Data pre-processing has a significant impact on the performance of any machine learning algorithm. In this context, we focus our research paper on investigating the data pre-processing phase of a recent evolutionary algorithm named the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). We aim at reviewing the data pre-processing phase of the DCA while making a comparative study of the used data reduction techniques within the DCA. This is needed to clarify the differences, the advantages and the characteristics of the previously proposed techniques with the DCA. The output of the comparison will facilitate the task of the developer to select the most useful technique to be adopted and integrated in the DCA data pre-processing module.

The major issues with survey-based study are the potentially low response rates, time consuming and costly. Nevertheless, a large number of datasets that could inform the questions that students are explicitly asked in surveys is commonly available in the external open datasets. This paper describes a new student predictive model that uses commonly available external open data instead of traditional questionnaires/surveys to spot 'at-risk' students. Considering the promising behavior of neural networks led us to develop student predictive models to predict 'at-risk' students. The results of empirical study for undergraduate students in their first year of study shows that this model can perform as well as or even out-perform traditional survey-based ones. The prediction performance of this study was also compared with that of logistic regression approach. The results shows that neural network slightly improved the overall model accuracy however, according to the model sensitivity, it is suggested that logistic regression performs better for identifying 'at-risk' students in their programme of study.

The optimization concerns particularly the selection of more appropriate characteristic features coupled with measurement conditions in order to minimize both the measurement time and the gas sensor drifts. First, a promising and fast feature corresponding to the maximum of the derivative curve of the sensor time-response is explored. The performance of this feature is demonstrated by comparison with a conventional steady-state feature, especially regarding its occurrence time, stability and sensitivity. Then the optimization of the measurement time (delay between two successive detections) has been illustrated and discussed. Optimized operating conditions and feature were finally validated by using non-supervised and supervised data mining analyses which show robust concentration discrimination. This optimization work constitutes an important step in real time applications for E-nose users.

While businesses have been struggling in making financial decision to hedge their risk against possible future price fluctuation, governmental bodies and policy makers often caught in the midst of severe volatility. This paper presents a standard deviation approach with dynamic data sampling to forecast the price volatility cluster of a commodity futures index in Malaysia derivative market. Data sampling to derive the mean of standard deviation is taken dynamically based on the last price reversal mined from the historical data. Experiment was conducted on historical price data for the period of twenty seven years to assess the competency of this standard deviation approach with mean values through dynamic data sampling in comparison to static mean values through fixed data sampling. The outcome of the experiment reveals a promising performance demonstrating the relevancy of the proposed approach. This study constitutes a novel approach using standard deviation to quantify price equilibrium, and subsequently forecasting possible future price volatility to allow better decision making with a more reliable analysis.

In recent years, real-time analytics on stream data has formed into a new research field, which aims to answer queries about "what-is-happening-now" with a negligible delay. The real challenge with real-time stream data processing is that it is impossible to store instances of data, and therefore online analytical algorithms are utilized. To perform real-time analytics, pre-processing of data should be performed in a way that only a short summary of stream is stored in main memory. In addition, due to high speed of arrival, average processing time for each instance of data should be in such a way that incoming instances are not lost without being captured. Lastly, the learner needs to provide high analytical accuracy measures. Sentinel is a distributed system written in Java that aims to solve this challenge by enforcing both the processing and learning process to be done in distributed form. Sentinel is built on top of Apache Storm, a distributed computing platform. Sentinel's learner, Vertical Hoeffding Tree, is a parallel decision tree-learning algorithm based on the VFDT, with ability of enabling parallel classification in distributed environments. Sentinel also uses SpaceSaving to keep a summary of the data stream and stores its summary in a synopsis data structure. Application of Sentinel on Twitter Public Stream API is shown and the results are discussed.

First, the framework of the DMDP based on Hadoop 2.0 is presented. Then, the demand of mass, multisource and heterogeneous data, such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, for power systems disaster preventing is analyzed. The functions for disaster mitigating could be divided in three stages: prior to the disaster, DMDP performs big data mining based on history database, dispatches human resources and materials and formulates preventive measures for contingencies. During the disaster process, DMDP monitors conditions of the equipment, system and environment. Once a major contingency occurs, DMDP can alarm, identify and give corrective actions. After the disaster, the failure will be investigated and the efficiency of disaster preventing will be assessed. The proposed DMDP could serve as a useful decision-making tool for the operators.

The daily load profile can often give great insight into the types of customers connected to the substation and can assist with developing a long-term forecast. The literature in this area often uses data mining and clustering techniques to determine a load diagram representative for a subset of customers or substations. The type of technique used can often lead to representative load diagrams of unique shapes with differing numbers of customers belonging to each group. This paper analyses clustering techniques on representative load diagrams for primary substations at the distribution level. In particular, this paper will analyse clustering techniques in terms of their performance and effect on load profile groupings. The results show that K-means clustering showed the best performance in generating unique, well-populated cluster groups. This gives a greater understanding of the divisions between substations which can be used for future forecasting.

This tends to bring huge stresses to the operators, and it's also difficult to ensure the correctness of their judgment and treatment for the alarms. This paper introduces a patrol and maintenance center control cabin (operation and management system), which boasts alarm information processing and faulty equipment location functions. After the data of all the master stations is collected to the real-time database of integrated information platform at patrol and maintenance center, the fault features and its association with the equipment are extracted by using big data storage and data mining technology, and then in conjunction with the information of nearby substations, online real-time analysis and reasoning is made in respect of the operation status of the substation which initiates alarms. Finally, the specific equipment in fault or in danger and fault causes are identified by using decision tree to assist the operators to analyze and treat the incidents timely.

MT is a very efficient method and has been applied to a wide range of disciplines so far. However, its feature selection phase, which uses experimental designs (orthogonal arrays), is susceptible to improvement. In this paper, we propose a methodology that incorporates MT and a Genetic Algorithm (MT-GA), with the latter being used both for optimizing the feature selection step of MT and for determining the most suitable training set. As an application domain for testing the proposed methodology, we utilized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). IDS play an increasingly important role in network security technology nowadays and more and more research is being directed towards building effective diagnostic models. We test the effectiveness of MT-GA by applying it to a well-known intrusion detection dataset and by comparing its performance to that of the typical MT strategy and of other classifiers. The results indicate the benefits of using MT-GA.

Selecting an appropriate cloud service from amongst a lot of commonly featured available services has become very difficult particularly for non-IT users i.e. it is cumbersome for users to select a cloud service that is best suited to their requirements. Quality of service (QOS) is considered as one of the main criterion in the selection process. This paper focuses on cloud service selection method allowing users to specify their perception of quality criteria. Our approach is based on the data mining technique clustering which is an unsupervised learning technique. Developed algorithm classifies the cloud services into different number of groups based on selected quality attributes and ranks them accordingly. The research aims to assist every type of users for choosing a cloud service without engaging into any financial contract. In order to validate our approach of best service selection, we test our system with cloud vendors like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.	[Zain, T.; Aslam, M.; Imran, M.

The dependencies among the attributes, their significance, and evaluation can easily be performed using intelligent data analysis tool viz., rough set theory. The objective of this article is to modify the existing stock market predictive model based on rough set approach by A.E Hassanien et al. and to construct a data model that would generate fewer number of decision rules. Moreover the results obtained from the proposed data model are compared with well-known software tool Rough set Exploration system 2.2 popularly known as RSES 2.2. It is shown that the proposed model has a higher overall accuracy rate and generates more compact and fewer rules than RSES 2.2. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the predicted classification performances.

For such kind of scenario, data mining becomes an essential part of computer science. Data mining is a sub-field, which computationally processes the data collected data and is able to help the analyst for proposing the ideas for some betterment of the company. The user access is recorded in log files. The web server logs provide important information. In the field of web mining the analysis of the web logs is done to identify the user search patterns. In the usual approaches of finding the patterns, pattern tree is created and then the analysis is done, but in this proposed algorithm there is no need of tree creation and the analysis is done based on the website architecture, which will increase the efficiency of the other pattern matching algorithms and needs only one database scan.

Traditional data storage and processing techniques are ineffective in handling such huge data [10]. Many real life applications require iterative computations in general and in particular used in most of machine learning and data mining algorithms over large datasets, such as web link structures and social network graphs. MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process large amount of data (multi-terabyte) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware. However, because of batch oriented processing of MapReduce we are unable to utilize the benefits of MapReduce in iterative computations. Our proposed work is mainly focused on optimizing three factors resulting in performance improvement of iterative algorithms in MapReduce environment. In this paper, we address the key issues based on execution of tasks, the unnecessary creation of new task in each iteration and excessive shuffling of data in each iteration. Our preliminary experiments have shown promising results over the basic MapReduce framework. The comparative study with existing solutions based on MapReduce framework like HaLoop, has also shown better performance w.r.t algorithm run time and amount of data traffic over Hadoop Cluster.

Although a lot of job recommender systems exist that uses different strategies, here efforts have been put to make the job recommendations on the basis of candidate's profile matching as well as preserving candidate's job behavior or preferences. Firstly, rules predicting the general preferences of the different user groups are mined. Then the job recommendations to the target candidate are made on the basis of content based matching as well as candidate preferences, which are preserved either in the form of mined rules or obtained by candidate's own applied jobs history. Through this technique a significant level of accuracy has been achieved over other basic methods of job recommendations.

The first sub-module captures and categorizes the image for preprocessing. These preprocessed images are vectored and a cluster is computed based on thea) degree of entropy in the vectors. Therefore, these bunch of clusters represent themselves with the degree of entropy, type of cluster by choosing a cluster head.

The personal information of an individual is private and sensitive which has to be secured from data mining algorithm which an adversary may apply to get access to the private information. In this paper we have consider the problem of securing these private and sensitive information when used in random forest classifier in the framework of differential privacy. We have incorporated the concept of differential privacy to the classical random forest algorithm. Experimental results shows that quality functions such as information gain, max operator and gini index gives almost equal accuracy regardless of their sensitivity towards the noise. Also the accuracy of the classical random forest and the differential private random forest is almost equal for different size of datasets. The proposed algorithm works for datasets with categorical as well as continuous attributes.

Different classical data mining techniques have their advantages and disadvantages so a single technique cannot be applied on different business data. Serial Multi-method Combined Mining (SMCM) is an approach where different mining techniques are used to get the patterns and finally the resultant patterns or rules are actionable. The actionable patterns are descriptive and assist us to finalize business decision. In SMCM, different mining methods are applied in predetermined sequential pattern. The resultant patterns of the previous method are also considered as a part of the input for the next method to be executed. SMCM helps to get advantages of different classical mining techniques to generate combined patterns but it needs the domain knowledge of business data for selection of different methods. The SMCM for credit card data by combining clustering and association techniques is demonstrated and experimental results are taken.

Nowadays, products often consist of adaptive design variants of an existing product. Taking this into account, the new product development approach called technical inheritance is developed analogous to biological inheritance. This approach considers the intergenerational evolution of design characteristics. Enhanced smart products are developed within the Collaborate Research Center (CRC) 653 called "Gentelligent Components in Their Lifecycle". These features the capabilities to sense, collect and transfer life cycle data inherently by using genetic product properties and artificial intelligence. By using technical inheritance optimization strategies are currently investigated and the design of gentelligent components is researched. During the technical inheritance various monitoring concepts are applied to realize a targeted algorithmic feedback of lifecycle information from smart products. For a targeted algorithmic feedback of product life cycle information methods of data mining are applied. These include the objectives of data beneficiation as well as information detection. The boundaries of the investigations are determined through the gentelligent components. Therefore highly mechanical loaded systems are in focus. It follows that the physical aspects and specific life cycle incidents are major objects for the monitoring concept of the product life cycle. The approach aims at the integration of an evolutionary algorithm to identify the component specific critical loads as well as the optimal allocation of loads cases. The results of this concept are exemplified by a wheel suspension which is part of the demonstrator of collaborate research center. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, a new approach for the assessment of manufacturing quality based on process signals from the machine tool is proposed, which provides current tool state and surface roughness information for every manufacturing process. In order to reuse and evaluate this data for knowledge-based process planning, an approach to manufacturing data collection and evaluation using data mining methods was developed. The advantages of the proposed data mining approach for process planning is demonstrated by an exemplary testing case. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The most common goal is automatic diagnosis, where those techniques have been used with success. When dealing with prognosis, however the results are much less successful. In this paper, we argue that the reason for this dissimilarity is the inability of the techniques used to consider the inherent temporal dependencies present in the data. Moreover, we propose an alternative approach where we turn the problem of prognosis into to a diagnosis problem. We do this by using the temporal sequence values of every feature, to estimate their future values and performing diagnosis on those. We end this paper by discussing the results obtained by estimating the values through the use of both tabular classifiers and Hidden Markov Models.

It also has the significant responsibility to identify the production capabilities, in order to see if they meet the market requirements. As the demands can vary as the times passes, the production plan must be able to face those variations. In this paper we focus on the mining of the time series formed by all the past results using an artificial neural network based simulation system that is able to identify an appropriate production forecast. For the simulation of the production planning system is presented an approach based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique adapted to job shop scheduling problem. The results of the production simulations are used as historical data in order to forecast the future demands and the amount of time needed to satisfy them. The time series forecast results show that data mining can be used in this domain in order to extract patterns that can be used to optimize the production process.

Many different features influencing the next day prediction of the pollution may be generated on the basis of the measured meteorological data. This set should undergo the process of analysis and selection of the most important prognostic features. In this paper we propose and investigate many methods of feature selection: Fisher discriminant measure, forward and backward elimination technique, ReliefF algorithm, linear SVM network and Breiman random forest. The sets of features generated by different methods will be used in the next step as the input information for four types of predictors: the multilayer perceptron, Elman network, support vector machine and the random forest of decision trees. We combine them in an ensemble responsible for generation of the final prognosis.

Data collection was done by questionnaire survey on a sample of over 400 respondents (parents of minor children) in the Central Slovakia (Banska Bystrica region). Data were analysed by data mining methods (frequency and cross tables, decision trees) in SPSS. We tested the dependence of responses to questions about working and family live and about institutional support for parents and families from the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents and their working characteristics. We searched for the factors that influence the decision-making and behaviour in organising of work and of family life, their mutual interconnection and alignment. The research results confirm that despite the existing legislative framework, the practice of application of flexible forms of work and work organization (particularly positive flexible, which is a compromise between the demands of workers and for employers) in Slovakia is insufficient. One of the reasons - on the supply side of labour market - is the conservative attitude of workers (parents of minor children) ftowards flexibility, stereotypical gender roles as well as roles in raising children and in meeting other family responsibilities (home care, the sick, the old members of the extended family ect.). Other causes of insufficient application of labour market flexibility can be seen on the labour demand (employers), in their ignorance, indifference on the issue. This is the cause of ignorance of the benefits which flexibility brings to the business entity and the economy as a whole. The last reason is the institutional setting - social policy, policies to promote job creation and business support. Finally, important actors in process of work flexibilisation support are own workers/employees, insufficiently knowing their own rights and actively defending and promoting them. It is a complex of factors of influence operating parallel and having synergistic effects.

Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.

However, with the continuous expansion of the system, several problems that traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm (CF) faced such as speedup, and scalability are worsen. In order to address these issues, a parallel collaborative filtering recommendation model based on expand-vector (PCF-EV) is proposed. Firstly, the eigenvector is expanded reasonably to get the expand-vector based on the expand-vector model. Then, based on the expand-vectors, a series of similarity calculations are expressed. Finally the nearest neighbor item is found and a more accurate recommendation to the target user is given based on the calculation results. On the basis of these, the further optimization makes it applied to the parallel computing framework successfully. Using the MovieLens dataset, the performance of PCF-EV is compared with that of others from both sides of recommendation precision and the speedup ratio. Through experimental results, which are compared with CF, PCF-EV overcomes the problem of cold startup which the CF encounters. Moreover, the accuracy and recall ratio has been doubled. Compared with the serial implementation on the high-end dual-core CPU, the parallel implementation on the low and middle-end GPU reaches nearly 170 times speedup in optimal conditions.

An updated novel Internet video-mining method is addressed. An automatic graph model generator is addressed as well as the weight assignment for concepts-relationship learning based on known ontology and an automated video source discovery method in concepts detection from the massive Internet videos is proposed.

Image classification is one of the most important tasks that must be dealt with in image DB as an intermediate stage prior to further image retrieval. The issue we address is an evolution from the simplest to more complicated classifiers. Firstly, there is the most intuitive one based on a comparison of the features of a classified object with a class pattern. Next, the paper presents decision trees and Naive Bayes as another option in a great number of classifying methods. Lastly, to assign the most ambiguous objects we have built fuzzy rule-based classifiers. We propose how to find the ranges of membership functions for linguistic values for fuzzy rule-based classifiers according to crisp attributes. Experiments demonstrate the precision of each classifier for the crisp image data in our CBIR. Furthermore, these results are used to describe a spatial object location in the image and to construct a search engine taking into account data mining.

In this area, most of the previous studies require us to provide a support threshold to accomplish the mining. However, in reality providing an appropriate threshold is very difficult if we did not acquaint with some background information relevant to the data. In addition, there exist many useless sequential patterns when the least support is too low. An alternative task is proposed to solve the above problems: mining top-k frequent closed sequences with the least length constraint, that is, mining k most frequent closed sequences whose length are equal or more than min len. However, most of the previous algorithms are based on the framework of candidate and generation, thus leading too much space usage and running time. To this end, in this paper, we propose a very efficient algorithm named BI-TSP(Mining top-k closed sequential patterns with BI-Directional checking scheme) without candidate and generation for mining top-k frequent closed sequences with the least length. Specifically, we adopt BI-Directional Extension for frequent closed sequential patterns enumeration. Based on BI-Directional Extension, we can directly use the closure checking scheme and effectively raise the minimum support threshold without candidate maintenance. In addition, we also propose two novel pruning strategies by exploiting the properties of minimum length constraint. Our extensive performance test with synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that BI-TSP outperforms the baselines in both memory and running time.

Recently, biologists hope to find deep OPSMs with long patterns and comparatively few support rows, which are not only useful on the interpretation of gene regulatory networks but also have essential biological significance. Unfortunately, the traditional exact mining algorithms based on Apriori principle could not deal with the deep OPSM problem, since they often take a large minimum support threshold for pattern pruning, and inevitably miss some significant deep OPSMs. Therefore, this paper proposes a new exact algorithm for mining deep OPSMs, which obtain all the deep OPSMs by finding the common subsequences shared by every two rows. Experiments have been done in both real and synthetic data sets, and the results show that our algorithm is suitable for the full mining of deep OPSMs with a small support, which could even find all the deep OPSMs with a minimum support threshold of 2. Compared with the traditional sequential pattern mining algorithms which depend on relatively large support threshold, our algorithm is an effective one to solve the deep OPSM problem.

There is abundant digital image information in the image acquisition equipment, the image database or the Internet. Facing the large scale image information with rich semantics, it is difficult to obtain accurate information as soon as possible. Therefore, it is essential for us to study efficient image clustering algorithms, in which how to measure the correlation among the samples is key issue, and will directly affect the results of clustering. In this paper, a new image clustering function based on SIFT-Affinity propagation is proposed. First, we extract image features based on Scale-invariant feature transform(SIFT), which are changeless to image zooming, translation, and gyration, and partially changeless to brightness changes and affine. Then the modelling of correlation is established and quantitatively analyzed. Finally, we utilize affinity propagation (AP) to fuse different SIFT correlations among images and obtain clustering results. Our method considers all image data as likely clustering center.

Online bidding has become popular. This work will come out with a model of online bidding system (OBS). This paper propose a new model to deal with online bidding, we deal with auction with Cournot Bidding Data Mining (CBDM). CBDM framework based on Cournot model is designed for K-means clustering. The input auction space is partitioned into groups of similar auctions by K-means clustering algorithm. The problem of finding the value of k in K-means algorithm is solved by method using Cournot competition. Cournot bidding is employed to obtain the optimal bidding strategies for the current auction. The clustering algorithm has been deployed successfully into online bidding, yielding significant improvement in performance over the existing OBS.

Recent works have achieved great success. In this paper, given a binary relation, we generated the fuzzy concept lattice. In order to make decision-making much easier, reducing the number of attributes without a large amount of information loss was preferred, a method of computing the similarity matrix was represented as well. We proposed an algorithm for attribute reduction and discussed the time complexity with comparison to the other algorithms afterwards. In the end, the method of computing choice value during decision-making was provided.

The existing space-time regions events mining algorithms usually based on clustering analysis, which is difficult to detect irregularly shaped events when they evolve by time. Meanwhile parameter-setting is also a difficult problem for most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic event mining algorithm--Gtem. Combined with Minimum Length Description (MDL) principle, Gtem can optimize parameter-setting; detect event regions of different evolutions according to the spatial-temporal correlations of objects and find outliers as well. We conduct experiments on daily-weather datasets of Hunan province from 2004-2008 and the experimental results show that the proposed Gtem could find high-temperature space-time regions efficiently.

For the data of students obtained employment, we further discover association rules from students' achievement and concrete occupations by data mining. Moreover, for a new or not obtained employment student, we recommend appropriate occupation for him (her) based on above association rules.

Hadoop is the most popular open-source implementation of the MapReduce programming model. In Hadoop, input files are divided into many data blocks and these blocks are distributed over several nodes in cluster. To efficiently process the data blocks, Hadoop should provide an efficient scheduling mechanism for enhancing the performance of the system in a shared cluster environment. In Hadoop scheduling mainly caused by data locality issues due to limited network bandwidth. By introducing the scheduling issues with regarding to the data locality, this paper review different data locality aware scheduling algorithms that handling the data locality issues. In addition, this paper also evaluating their features, strength, weakness and provided some guidelines on how to improve further these scheduling algorithms.

However, building a large dedicated cluster for MapReduce is not cost effective if the system is underutilized. To speedup the MapReduce computation with low cost, the computing resources donated from idle desktop/notebook computers in an organization become true potential. The MapReduce framework is then implemented into Volunteer Computing environment to allow such data processing tasks to be carried out on the unused computers. Virtualization technology is deployed to resolve the security and heterogeneity problem in Volunteer Computing so that the MapReduce jobs can always run under a unified runtime and isolated environment. This paper presents a Hadoop cluster that can be scaled into virtualized Volunteer Computing environment. The system consists of a small fixed set of dedicate nodes plus a variable number of volatile volunteer nodes which give additional computing power to the cluster. To this end, we consolidate Apache Hadoop, the most popular MapReduce implementation, with the virtualized BOINC platform. We evaluate the proposed system on our testbed with MapReduce benchmark that represents different workload patterns. The performance of the Hadoop cluster is measured when its computing capability is expanded with volunteer nodes. The results show that the system can be scaled preferably for CPU-intensive jobs, as opposed to data-intensive jobs which their scalability is more restricted.

Based on graph-theoretic concept of a cluster, dominant sets clustering can be accomplished with a game dynamics efficiently while being able to determine the number of clusters automatically. However, we have observed that the definition of dominant set overweights the importance of high intra-cluster similarity. Consequently, dominant sets clustering is found to be sensitive to similarity parameters and show the tendency to generate over-segmented clustering results. In order to solve these problems, in this paper we present a cluster extension algorithm by making use of the relationship of intra-cluster and inter-cluster similarity. In experiments on eight datasets, our algorithm performs evidently better than the original dominant sets algorithm, and comparably to other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

Starting from different segmentations of the video frames (dynamic and non dynamic ones), we extract frequent subgraph patterns to create spatio-temporal patterns that may correspond to interesting objects to track. We then cluster the obtained spatio-temporal patterns to get longer and more robust tracks along the video. We compare our tracking method called TRAP to two state-of-the-art tracking ones and show on four synthetic and real videos that our method is effective in this difficult context.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical approach for transforming data of multivariate nature into its constituent components (sources) which are considered to be statistically independent of each other. ICA-PCA is applied in the domain of marine controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM), called seabed logging (SBL) sensing method used for the detection of hydrocarbons based reservoirs in SBL application. ICA-PCA has not been applied before in SBL application, and therefore may reduce exploration costs in deep sea areas. The task is to identify the air waves and to filter them out, hence, the ICA-PCA algorithm is carried out for airwave filtration, at varying seawater depth from 100 m to 3000 m. It is observed that the results are favorable upto 2500 m depth. Upon increasing seawater depth, the component representing the presence of hydrocarbon becomes more dispersed, vague and indistinguishable.	[Ansari, Adeel; Said, Abas B.

A data mining engine which can handle 10M transactions per second is the main component of the monitor. Although the data mining engine have to analyze over 2000 byte data in theory, a memory management strategy named LessFU removes non-essential data to realize efficient processing. Our past experiments which use real Internet traffic shows the advantage of our approach. However, there exits no method to evaluate the cache hit rate of LessFU. Since the cache hit rate results in serious consequences on the data mining results, this paper proposes a method to estimate the cache hit rate of LessFU. The experimental results which show the advantage of the proposed method are also reported in this paper. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Feature selection has been the motivation for many researchers. In medical datasets, relevant attributes are often unknown a priori. Feature selection provides the features that contribute most to the classification task per si, which should therefore be used by any classifier to produce a classification model. However, the dimension of the feature space may not allow the application of feature selection algorithms, due time and space complexity. In this work, we are concerned on the application of an efficient feature ranking algorithm for a given breast cancer dataset, that overcome the dimensionality of the data.

However, they are limited in the scalability of both the size and the number of data owners (sources). Most of these techniques are primarily designed to work with two data owners and extensions to handle multiple owners are either expensive or infeasible. In addition, for large datasets, they incur substantial communication/computation overhead due to the use of cryptographic techniques. In this paper, we propose a scalable privacy-preserving protocol that approximates global itemset support, without employing any cryptographic mechanism. We also present some emperical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

An important aspect of this repertoire is the unique availability of rare motifs that have been used by a master bagana teacher in Ethiopia. The method is applied to find antipatterns: patterns that are surprisingly rare in a corpus of bagana songs. In contrast to previous work, this is performed without an explicit set of background pieces. The results of this study show that data mining methods can reveal with high significance these antipatterns of interest based on the computational analysis of a small corpus of bagana songs.

While a lot of work has already gone into finding structural patterns in graph datasets, we focus on relaxing the structural requirements in order to find items that often occur near each other in the input graph. By doing this, we significantly reduce the search space and simplify the output. We look for itemsets that are both frequent and cohesive, which enables us to use the anti-monotonicity property of the frequency measure to speed up our algorithm. We experimentally demonstrate that our method can handle larger and more complex datasets than the existing methods that either run out of memory or take too long.

Most modern equipment has logging systems that allow us to collect a diversity of data regarding their operation and health. Using data mining models for novelty detection enables us to explore those datasets, building classification systems that can detect and issue an alert when a failure starts evolving, avoiding the unknown development up to breakdown. In the present case we use a failure detection system to predict train doors breakdowns before they happen using data from their logging system. We study three methods for failure detection: outlier detection, novelty detection and a supervised SVM. Given the problem's features, namely the possibility of a passenger interrupting the movement of a door, the three predictors are prone to false alarms. The main contribution of this work is the use of a low-pass filter to process the output of the predictors leading to a strong reduction in the false alarm rate.

This information plays as basis for operation and management strategies for a reliable and economical integration into the power grid. A precise forecast needs to overcome problems of variable energy production caused by fluctuating weather conditions. In this paper, we define a data mining approach, in order to process a past set of the wind power measurements of a wind turbine and extract a robust prediction model. We resort to a time series clustering algorithm, in order to extract a compact, informative representation of the time series of wind power measurements in the past set. We use cluster prototypes for predicting upcoming wind powers of the turbine. We illustrate a case study with real data collected from a wind turbine installed in the Apulia region.

While there are many cases where hierarchic relations between features exist, most existing feature selection approaches are not capable of exploiting those relations. In this paper, we introduce a method for feature selection in hierarchical feature spaces. The method first eliminates redundant features along paths in the hierarchy, and further prunes the resulting feature set based on the features' relevance. We show that our method yields a good trade-off between feature space compression and classification accuracy, and outperforms both standard approaches as well as other approaches which also exploit hierarchies.

In this paper, an agent based model is built to simulate the households' dynamic adoption process of solar energy. With varying purchase price, scenario analysis is taken to investigate the relevant market share changes. Random forest is used to measure the effect of purchase price by data collected from the model changes. The results show that impacts of purchase price differ with different types of energy using by households. By energy subsidy, product with higher purchase price can still attract market share of solar energy effectively. Thus, promotion strategies should be variable according to local using conditions of solar energy in residential consumer market.

These challenges include accessing and reforming existing lexicons into interoperable data, recruiting language specialists and citizen linguists, and obtaining large volumes of quality input from the crowd. We introduce our crowdsourcing model, specifically (1) motivating participation using a "play to pay" system, games, social rewards, and material prizes; (2) steering the crowd to contribute structured and reliable data via targeted questions; and (3) evaluating participants' input through crowd validation and statistical analysis to ensure that only trustworthy material is incorporated into Kamusi's master database. We discuss the mobile application Kamusi has developed for crowd participation that elicits high-quality structured data directly from each language's speakers through narrow questions that can be answered with a minimum of time and effort. Through the integration of existing lexicons, expert input, and innovative methods of acquiring knowledge from the crowd, an accurate and reliable multilingual dictionary with a focus on LRLs will grow and become available as a free public resource.

They can be used to allow speech synthesis on digital devices, using only few sentences of input by the user. However, the adaptation algorithms of such weakly trained models suffer from the high dimensionality of the feature space. Because creating new voices is easy with the SSS approach, thousands of voices can be trained and a Nearest-Neighbor (NN) algorithm can be used to obtain better speaker similarity in those limited-data cases. NN methods require good distance measures that correlate well with human perception. This paper investigates the problem of finding good low-cost metrics, i.e. simple functions of feature values that map with objective signal quality metrics. We show this is a ill-posed problem, and study its conversion to a tractable form. Tentative solutions are found using statistical analyzes. With a performance index improved by 36% w.r.t. a naive solution, while using only 0.77% of the respective amount of features, our results are promising. Deeper insights in our results are then unveiled using visual methods, namely high-dimensional data visualization and dimensionality reduction techniques. Perspectives on new adaptation algorithms, and tighter integration of data mining and visualization principles are eventually given.

The language addressed is Modern Greek, one of the not widely spoken and not-richly-equipped-with-resources languages. The population of the ontology is achieved through collaborative crowdsourcing, i.e. players annotate ad video content through a multi-player videogame, implemented especially for this purpose. The provided annotations concern the ad content, its production values, its impact, and they constitute the ontology terms and concepts. Dependencies, correlations, statistical information and knowledge governing the ontology terms and concepts are to be revealed through data mining and machine learning techniques. The extracted knowledge constitutes the core of a support tool, i.e. a semantic thesaurus, which will help ad designers in the brainstorming process of creating a new ad campaign. Unlike existing creativity support models, that are static and depend on expert knowledge, thereby hurting creativity, the proposed support tool is generic in nature (as it is based on a collaborative crowdsourcing-based semantic thesaurus), dynamic and minimally restricting the brainstorming process.

The focus is on selected scientific disciplines at the boundaries to computer science (computational linguistics, bioinformatics, digital construction, microelectronics). The data basis is the English Scientific Text Corpus (SCITEX) which covers a time range of roughly thirty years (1970/80s to early 2000s) (Degaetano-Ortlieb et al., 2013; Teich and Fankhauser, 2010). In particular, we investigate the diversification of scientific registers over time.

Nevertheless, interesting legal stumbling blocks exist, both with respect to the data collection and data sharing phases, due to the strict rules of copyright and database law. Conflicts are particularly likely when content is extracted from commercial databases, and when texts that have a minimal level of creativity are stored in a permanent way. In all circumstances, even with non-commercial research, license agreements and website terms of use can impose further restrictions. Accordingly, only for some delineated areas (very old texts for which copyright expired, legal statutes, texts in the public domain) strong legal certainty can be obtained without case-by-case assessments. As a result, while prior permission is certainly not required in all cases, many researchers tend to err on the side of caution, and seek permission from publishers, institutions and individual authors before including texts in their corpora, although this process can be difficult and very time-consuming. In the United States, the legal assessment is very different, due to the open-ended nature and flexibility offered by the "fair use" doctrine.

Users are tending to find information through their friends on social network such as Facebook, and this behavior leads to a new search paradigm called social search. However, the traditional search engine like Google cannot handle this kind of search. The data cannot be indexed because of the membership privacy setting and social network relationships. Under this situation, it is harder and harder for users to search information related to their social network. In this paper, we therefore proposed a system architecture which can deal with this issue and using the data from Facebook as example. An algorithm is also proposed which is the core technique of the system which is called Topic Participation Algorithm (TPA). Furthermore, we will propose a novel implemented social search engine which is developed based on the concept of social network analysis, data mining techniques and searching techniques.

Most research handles the static database in batch mode to discover the desired sequential patterns. Transactions or customer sequences are, however, dynamically changed in real-world applications. In the past, the FUSP tree was designed to maintain and update the discovered information based on Fast UPdated (FUP) approach with sequence insertion and sequence deletion. The original customer sequences is still required to be rescanned if it is necessary. In this paper, the prelarge concept is adopted to maintain and update the built FUSP tree with sequence deletion. When the number of deleted customers is smaller than the safety bound of the prelarge concept, the original database is unnecessary to be rescanned but the sequential patterns can still be actually maintained and updated. Experiments are also conducted to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and number of tree nodes.

This necessitates the use of other data sources. In the mid-1980s the (then) New Zealand Department of Valuation digitized its valuation records. This permitted the first analysis of an entire country's non-domestic buildings. A very long-tail probability density function was identified, with the largest 5% of buildings containing more than 40% of the floor space. This knowledge informed the development of research for understanding non-domestic buildings as well as underpinning the 1996 revision of the NZ Building Code Clause H1 Energy Efficiency. More recently an analysis of valuation data has provided the Building Energy End-use Study (BEES) with a national sampling frame to examine energy and water end-uses in non-domestic buildings. The development of processes for collecting and analyzing data is described. Considerable changes in understanding of valuation data have occurred for documenting the non-domestic building stock. New online and geographic information sources can validate and improve building data. The use of such a database supports improved understanding of the changing nature of the building stock and potential intervention points, as well as harnessing regulatory and market forces.

One challenge in information retrieval is text classification. Current practices rely heavily on the classical naive Bayes algorithm due to its simplicity and robustness. However, results from this algorithm are not always satisfactory. In this article, the limitations of the naive Bayes algorithm are discussed, and it is found that the assumption on the independence of terms is the main reason for an unsatisfactory classification in many real-world applications. To overcome the limitations, the dependent factors are considered by integrating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting algorithm in the naive Bayes classification. Moreover, the TF-IDF algorithm itself is improved so that both frequencies and distribution information are taken into consideration. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two simulation experiments were conducted, and the comparisons with other classification methods have shown that the proposed method has outperformed other existing algorithms in terms of precision and index recall rate.

ANALYZING MASSIVE DATA SETS: AN ADAPTIVE FUZZY NEURAL APPROACH FOR PREDICTION, WITH A REAL ESTATE ILLUSTRATION	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						mass appraisal; prediction of real estate property value; ANFIS; multiple regression analysis	INFERENCE SYSTEM; APPRAISAL; NETWORK; REGRESSION; PRICES; ANFIS	Drawing useful predictions from vast accumulations of data is becoming critical to the success of an enterprise. Organizations' databases grow exponentially from transactions with external stakeholders in addition to their own internal activities. An important organizational computing issue is that, as they grow, the databases become potentially more valuable and also more difficult to analyze. One example is predicting the value of residential real estate based on past comparable sales transactions. This is critical to several important sectors of the US economy including the mortgage finance industry and local governments that collect property taxes. The common methodology for dealing with such property valuation is based on multiple regression, although this methodology has been found to be deficient. Data mining methods have been proposed and tested as an alternative, but the results are very mixed. This article introduces a novel approach for improving predictions using an adaptive, neuro-fuzzy inference model, and illustrates its application to real estate property price prediction through the use of comparable properties. Although neuro-fuzzy-based approaches have been found to be effective for classification and estimation in many fields, there is very little existing work that investigates their potential in a real estate context. In addition, this article addresses several common problems in existing studies, such as small sample size, lack of rigorous data sampling, and poor model validation and testing. Our model is tested with real sales data from the assessment office in a large US city. The results show that the neuro-fuzzy model is superior in all of the test scenarios. The article also discusses and refines a unique technique to defining comparable properties to improve accuracy. Test results show very promising potential for this technique in mass appraisal in real estate and similar contexts when used with the neuro-fuzzy model.

In this paper, we propose a new data structure with a Tail Pointer Table and a corresponding mining algorithm; we also propose a algorithm COFI2, a revised version of the frequent itemsets mining algorithm COFI (Co-Occurrence Frequent-Item), to reduce the temporal and memory requirements. Further, theoretical analysis and experiments are carried out to prove their effectiveness.

J	Benites, F; Simon, S; Sapozhnikova, E				Benites, Fernando; Simon, Svenja; Sapozhnikova, Elena			Mining Rare Associations between Biological Ontologies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; FUNCTION PREDICTION; G-PROTEIN; RULES; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; RECEPTORS; SYSTEM	The constantly increasing volume and complexity of available biological data requires new methods for their management and analysis. An important challenge is the integration of information from different sources in order to discover possible hidden relations between already known data. In this paper we introduce a data mining approach which relates biological ontologies by mining cross and intra-ontology pairwise generalized association rules. Its advantage is sensitivity to rare associations, for these are important for biologists. We propose a new class of interestingness measures designed for hierarchically organized rules. These measures allow one to select the most important rules and to take into account rare cases. They favor rules with an actual interestingness value that exceeds the expected value. The latter is calculated taking into account the parent rule. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to the analysis of data from Gene Ontology and GPCR databases. Our objective is to discover interesting relations between two different ontologies or parts of a single ontology. The association rules that are thus discovered can provide the user with new knowledge about underlying biological processes or help improve annotation consistency. The obtained results show that produced rules represent meaningful and quite reliable associations.

Nausea and the quest for the perfect anti-emetic	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Animal model; Anti-emetic; Prokinetic; Nausea; Vasopressin; Vomiting	CISPLATIN-INDUCED EMESIS; CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA; ANTICANCER AGENT CISPLATIN; MOTILIN RECEPTOR AGONIST; INDUCED DELAYED NAUSEA; MOTION-SICKNESS; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR; SUNCUS-MURINUS; DIABETIC GASTROPARESIS; ARGININE-VASOPRESSIN	The discovery of anti-emetic agents is reviewed to illustrate the large database (>129,000 papers in PubMed) available for potential data mining and to provide a background to the shift in interest to nausea from vomiting. Research on nausea extends to identification of biomarkers for diagnosis/clinical trials and to understanding why nausea is such a common dose-limiting toxicity of diverse therapeutic agents. The lessons learned for translation from animals to humans, from the discovery of the anti-vomiting effects of 5-HT3 and NK1 receptor antagonists, is discussed in terms of the similarities between the emetic pathways and their pharmacology, and also in terms of the limitations of rodent models of "nausea" (pica, conditioned taste aversion, conditioned gaping and disgust). The review focuses on the established view that anti-emetics are more efficacious against vomiting than nausea in particular we examine studies of 5-HT3, NK1 and D-2 receptor antagonists, gabapentin and various receptor agonists. The potential for targeting anti-nausea agents is then considered, by targeting mechanisms which correct delayed gastric emptying (prokinetics), the rise in plasma vasopressin (AVP) and/or act at central targets revealed by the growing knowledge of cortical regions activated/inhibited in subjects reporting nausea. Modulation of the projections from the brainstem to the cortical areas responsible for the genesis of the sensation of nausea provides the most likely approach to a target at which an anti nausea drug could be targeted with the expectation that it would affect nausea from multiple causes.

Recent studies are discussed that have further refined our understanding of activity cliffs and suggested different ways of exploiting activity cliff information. These include alternative approaches to define and classify activity cliffs in two and three dimensions, data mining investigations to systematically detect all possible activity cliffs, the introduction of computational methods to predict activity cliffs, and studies designed to explore activity cliff progression in medicinal chemistry. The discussion of these studies is complemented with new findings revealing the frequency of activity cliff formation when different molecular representations are used and the distribution of activity cliffs across different targets. Taken together, the results have a number of implications for the practice of medicinal chemistry.

J	Luo, L; Li, L				Luo, Le; Li, Li			Defining and Evaluating Classification Algorithm for High-Dimensional Data Based on Latent Topics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Automatic text categorization is one of the key techniques in information retrieval and the data mining field. The classification is usually time-consuming when the training dataset is large and high-dimensional. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but few can achieve satisfactory efficiency. In this paper, we present a method which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). LDA is first used to generate reduced dimensional representation of topics as feature in VSM. It is able to reduce features dramatically but keeps the necessary semantic information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then employed to classify the data based on the generated features. We evaluate the algorithm on 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that the classification based on our proposed LDA+SVM model achieves high performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 measure. Further, it can achieve this within a much shorter time-frame. Our process improves greatly upon the previous work in this field and displays strong potential to achieve a streamlined classification process for a wide range of applications.

Results: By exploiting expression data publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we developed a new bioinformatics tool aimed at the identification of genes whose expression appeared simultaneously altered in different experimental conditions, thus suggesting co-regulation or coordinated action in the same biological process. To accomplish this task, we used the 978 human GEO Curated DataSets and we manually performed the selection of 2,109 pair-wise comparisons based on their biological rationale. The lists of differentially expressed genes, obtained from the selected comparisons, were stored in a PostgreSQL database and used as data source for the CorrelaGenes tool. Our application uses a customized Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorithm to identify sets of genes showing expression profiles correlated with a gene of interest. The significance of the correlation is measured coupling the Lift, a well-known standard ARM index, and the chi(2) p value. The manually curated selection of the comparisons and the developed algorithm constitute a new approach in the field of gene expression profiling studies. Simulation performed on 100 randomly selected target genes allowed us to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure and to obtain preliminary data demonstrating the consistency of the results. Conclusions: The preliminary results of the simulation showed how CorrelaGenes could contribute to the characterization of molecular pathways and biological processes integrating data obtained from other applications and available in public repositories.

A proper community is usually defined as a subgraph with a higher internal density and a lower crossing density with others subgraphs. Hierarchical clustering algorithms produce a set of nested clusters, sometimes called dense subgraphs, organized as a hierarchical system and the output is always referred as a dendrogram. However, determining which of clusters in the dendrogram will be selected to form communities in the final output is a difficult problem. Most implementations of data mining algorithms require expert guidance in the implementation of the algorithm in order to establish the appropriate selection of such communities, and ultimately the output may not be optimized as with fixed height tree-cutting algorithms. In this paper, a novel algorithm for community selection is proposed. The intuition of our approach is based on drops of densities between each pair of parent and child nodes on the dendrogram - the higher the drop in density, the higher probability the child should form an independent community. Based on the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem, we propose a novel algorithm which can output an optimal set of local communities automatically. In addition, a faster algorithm running in linear time is also presented for the case that the dendrogram is a tree. Finally, we validate this approach through a variety of data sets ranging from synthetic graphs to real world benchmark data sets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A feature subset that possesses the same classification power as that of the whole feature set is expected to be found prior to performing a classification task. For this purpose, many rough set algorithms for feature selection have been developed and applied to incomplete decision systems. When they address large data, however, their undesirable efficiencies could be intolerable. This paper proposes a boundary region-based feature selection algorithm (BRFS), which has the ability to efficiently find a feature subset from a large incomplete decision system. BRFS captures an inconsistent block family to construct a rough set boundary region and designs a positive stepwise mechanism for the construction of boundary regions with respect to multiple attribute subsets, making the acquisition of boundary regions highly efficient. The boundary regions are used to build significance measures as heuristics to determine the optimal search path and establish an evaluation criterion for rules to identify feature subsets. These arrangements make BRFS capable of locating a reduct more efficiently than other available algorithms; this finding is supported by experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Further, it is very usual that this assignment is defined according to a local and temporary criterion, i.e. the models are trained and tested using data of the same station. Based on this procedure, the performance of the models outside the training location cannot be inferred. The present work evaluates the performance of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) based models for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) according to temporal and spatial criteria and data set scanning procedures in coastal environments of Iran. The accuracy differences between the local and the external performance depend on the specific climatic trends of the test stations, as well as on the input combination used to feed the models. When relying on a suitable input selection, externally trained models might be a valid alternative to locally trained ones, which would be a crucial advantage in places where only limited climatic variables are available. K-fold testing is a good choice to prevent partially valid conclusions derived from model assessments based on a simple data set assignment. Further, calibration of the GEP model may not be needed, if enough climatic data are available at other stations for external model application. The performance of the GEP model fluctuates chronologically and spatially. A suitable assessment of the model should consider a complete local and/or external scan of the data set used.

J	Torii, M; Wagholikar, K; Liu, HF				Torii, Manabu; Wagholikar, Kavishwar; Liu, Hongfang			Detecting concept mentions in biomedical text using hidden Markov model: multiple concept types at once or one at a time?	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Information storage and retrieval; Data mining; Electronic health records	CLINICAL TEXT; INFORMATION; EXTRACTION	Background: Identifying phrases that refer to particular concept types is a critical step in extracting information from documents. Provided with annotated documents as training data, supervised machine learning can automate this process. When building a machine learning model for this task, the model may be built to detect all types simultaneously (all-types-at-once) or it may be built for one or a few selected types at a time (one-type-or a-few-types-at-a-time). It is of interest to investigate which strategy yields better detection performance. Results: Hidden Markov models using the different strategies were evaluated on a clinical corpus annotated with three concept types (i2b2/VA corpus) and a biology literature corpus annotated with five concept types (JNLPBA corpus). Ten-fold cross-validation tests were conducted and the experimental results showed that models trained for multiple concept types consistently yielded better performance than those trained for a single concept type. F-scores observed for the former strategies were higher than those observed for the latter by 0.9 to 2.6% on the i2b2/VA corpus and 1.4 to 10.1% on the JNLPBA corpus, depending on the target concept types. Improved boundary detection and reduced type confusion were observed for the all-types-at-once strategy. Conclusions: The current results suggest that detection of concept phrases could be improved by simultaneously tackling multiple concept types. This also suggests that we should annotate multiple concept types in developing a new corpus for machine learning models. Further investigation is expected to gain insights in the underlying mechanism to achieve good performance when multiple concept types are considered.

However, the original records stored in those repositories cannot be released to the data miners as they frequently contain sensitive information. The emerging field of Privacy Preserving Data Publishing (PPDP) deals with this important challenge. In this paper, we present NSVDist (Non-homogeneous generalization with Sensitive Value Distributions)-a new anonymization algorithm that, given minimal anonymity and diversity parameters along with an information loss measure, issues corresponding non-homogeneous anonymizations where the sensitive attribute is published as frequency distributions over the sensitive domain rather than in the usual form of exact sensitive values. In our experiments with eight datasets and four different classification algorithms, we show that classifiers induced from data generalized by NSVDist tend to be more accurate than classifiers induced using state-of-the-art anonymization algorithms.

Therefore, comprehensive analytical methods such as integrated data analysis, combining several data measurements, are required. In this study, we describe a method of data preprocessing that can perform comprehensively integrated analysis based on a variety of multimeasurement of organic and inorganic chemical data from Sargassum fusiforme and explore the concealed biological information by statistical analyses with integrated data. Chemical components including polar and semipolar metabolites, minerals, major elemental and isotopic ratio, and thermal decompositional data were measured as environmentally responsive biological data in the seasonal variation. The obtained spectral data of complex chemical components were preprocessed to isolate pure peaks by removing noise and separating overlapping signals using the multivariate curve resolution alternating least-squares method before integrated analyses. By the input of these preprocessed multimeasurement chemical data, principal component analysis and self-organizing maps of integrated data showed changes in the chemical compositions during the mature stage and identified trends in seasonal variation. Correlation network analysis revealed multiple relationships between organic and inorganic components. Moreover, in terms of the relationship between metal group and metabolites, the results of structural equation modeling suggest that the structure of alginic acid changes during the growth of S. fusiforme, which affects its metal binding ability. This integrated analytical approach using a variety of chemical data can be developed for practical applications to obtain new biochemical knowledge including genetic and environmental information.

Here, we present an interdisciplinary study of the role of silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) in disturbing the neural behaviours of zebrafish and a possible physiological mechanism for this phenomenon. We used adult zebrafish as an animal model to evaluate the roles of size (15-nm and 50-nm) and concentration (300 mg/mL and 1000 mg/mL) in SiO2-NP neurotoxicity via behavioural and physiological analyses. With the aid of video tracking and data mining, we detected changes in behavioural phenotypes. We found that compared with 50-nm nanosilica, 15-nm SiO2-NPs produced greater significant changes in advanced cognitive neurobehavioural patterns (colour preference) and caused potentially Parkinson's disease-like behaviour. Analyses at the tissue, cell and molecular levels corroborated the behavioural results, demonstrating that nanosilica acted on the retina and dopaminergic (DA) neurons to change colour preference and to cause potentially Parkinson's disease-like behaviour.

Furthermore, no studies on the association of hypotension with anthropometric indices have been reported. The objectives of the present study were to determine the best predictors of hypertension and hypotension among various anthropometric indices and to assess the use of combined indices as a method of improving the predictive power in adult Korean women and men. Methods: For 12789 subjects 21-85 years of age, we assessed 41 anthropometric indices using statistical analyses and data mining techniques to determine their ability to discriminate between hypertension and normotension as well as between hypotension and normotension. We evaluated the predictive power of combined indices using two machine learning algorithms and two variable subset selection techniques. Results: The best indicator for predicting hypertension was rib circumference in both women (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.813; AUC = 0.669) and men (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.601; AUC = 0.627); for hypotension, the strongest predictor was chest circumference in women (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.541; AUC = 0.657) and neck circumference in men (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.522; AUC = 0.672). In experiments using combined indices, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the prediction of hypertension risk in women and men were 0.721 and 0.652, respectively, according to the logistic regression with wrapper-based variable selection; for hypotension, the corresponding values were 0.675 in women and 0.737 in men, according to the naive Bayes with wrapper-based variable selection. Conclusions: The best indicators of the risk of hypertension and the risk of hypotension may differ. The use of combined indices seems to slightly improve the predictive power for both hypertension and hypotension.

J	Lu, XQ; Yuan, Y				Lu, Xiaoqiang; Yuan, Yuan			Hybrid structure for robust dimensionality reduction	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Pattern recognition; Manifold learning; Unsupervised learning; Face recognition	TANGENT-SPACE ALIGNMENT; FACE-RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK	In recent years, dimensionality reduction has attracted a great deal of attention in the communities of machine learning and data mining. The basic goal of dimensionality reduction is to discover the low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional space. Although some existing manifold learning algorithms (ISOMAP, LE, LLE, LTSA, etc.) can capture the local structure of data manifold, they have poor performance in some recognition tasks. This is mainly because that they cannot handle well with the "out of sample" problem. Moreover, these algorithms are sensitive to the choice of nearest neighbors, which is crucial in classification. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Robust Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm With Local and Global Structure (RLGS) based on a novel adaptive weighting mechanism. Hybrid structure of local and global structures is studied. By using the adaptive weight, RLGS has the capacity of adaptively exploiting non-linear structure of data manifold and is robust to parameters. Experiments demonstrate that RLGS performs better on public face databases compared with other reported algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The applicability of the relaxed linear separability (RLS) method of feature subset selection was checked for high-dimensional and mixed type (genetic and phenotypic) clinical data of patients with end-stage renal disease. The RLS method allowed for substantial reduction of the dimensionality through omitting redundant features while maintaining the linear separability of data sets of patients with high and low levels of an inflammatory biomarker. The synergy between genetic and phenotypic features in differentiation between these two subgroups was demonstrated.

The essential idea of the method is a process consisting of sparse regressions and cross-validation for analyzing calculated data of the materials. The method allows us to demonstrate that the exchange coupling between Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions can be predicted from the electronegativities of constituent ligands and the structural features of the molecule by a linear regression model with high accuracy. The relations between the structural features and magnetic properties of the materials are quantitatively and consistently evaluated and presented by a graph. We also discuss the properties of the materials and guide the material design basing on the obtained results. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

J	Loock, C				Loock, Coert			Using examination and assessment scores as an aspect of instructional leadership in the school	EDUCATION AS CHANGE			English	Article						instructional leadership; data-mining; improving performance; data-wise; standardisation; teaching and learning		The purpose of this article is to pursue the idea that part of the dilemma school managers, as instructional leaders and teachers, experience in improving teaching and learning in the school is the inability to interpret examinations and assessment results in a meaningful way. The researcher is of the opinion that instructional leadership in the school is closely linked to the analysis and meaningful interpretation of examination and assessment results at school and provincial level on a continuous basis. The term data' in this context refers to the broad array of information on student skills and knowledge typically available to schools and often (typically) not administered, not analysed and not seen as benchmarks to gauge students' readiness for high stakes exams, especially at the exit (Grade 12) level. The researcher did a comprehensive document analysis from a purposeful sample of the systemic processes followed during the resulting of the National Senior Certificate (Grade 12) examinations with specific reference to the extraction of and reporting on data typically drawn from one subject in a large-scale national examination and its possible meaningfulness to improve instructional leadership. This data sample was then provided to a specimen school, randomly selected from a group of schools in Gauteng performing below 40% in Grade 12 over the past three years. The purpose was to establish the extent to which school managers, as instructional leaders in these schools, understand the value of analysing examination and assessment scores as a means to improve teaching and learning in the school. These observations and responses were encapsulated in the discussion and informed the recommendations. The Grade 12 examination process provides comprehensive statistical data to individual schools on their performance in relation to the various subjects and how it compares with other schools in the same province. However, such data must be presented in a useful format that encourages teachers to engage with the educational messages in the data. This data only becomes useful information, which can truly inform improvements in teaching and learning, when it encourages and supports professional reflection on practice. I am of the opinion that by making instructional leaders and teachers more data-wise' as Bialecki, Johnson and Thorpe (2002:11) advocate, the use of examination and assessment scores (data) as an aspect of instructional leadership in the school will not only improve teaching and learning in the school but will also ensure equity of standards across schools and districts in the province.

Identification and Validation of Oncologic miRNA Biomarkers for Luminal A-like Breast Cancer	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLOOD-BASED MARKERS; CIRCULATING MICRORNAS; COLORECTAL-CANCER; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; POOR-PROGNOSIS; EXPRESSION; ANTIGEN; STAGE; PROFILES; CELLS	Introduction: Breast cancer is a common disease with distinct tumor subtypes phenotypically characterized by ER and HER2/neu receptor status. MiRNAs play regulatory roles in tumor initiation and progression, and altered miRNA expression has been demonstrated in a variety of cancer states presenting the potential for exploitation as cancer biomarkers. Blood provides an excellent medium for biomarker discovery. This study investigated systemic miRNAs differentially expressed in Luminal A-like (ER+PR+HER2/neu-) breast cancer and their effectiveness as oncologic biomarkers in the clinical setting. Methods: Blood samples were prospectively collected from patients with Luminal A-like breast cancer (n = 54) and controls (n = 56). RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and subjected to microarray analysis (n = 10 Luminal A-like; n = 10 Control). Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by artificial neural network (ANN) data-mining algorithms. Expression of specific miRNAs was validated by RQ-PCR (n = 44 Luminal A; n = 46 Control) and potential relationships between circulating miRNA levels and clinicopathological features of breast cancer were investigated. Results: Microarray analysis identified 76 differentially expressed miRNAs. ANN revealed 10 miRNAs for further analysis (miR-19b, miR-29a, miR-93, miR-181a, miR-182, miR-223, miR-301a, miR-423-5p, miR-486-5 and miR-652). The biomarker potential of 4 miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-181a, miR-223 and miR-652) was confirmed by RQ-PCR, with significantly reduced expression in blood of women with Luminal A-like breast tumors compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001, 0.004, 0.009 and 0.004 respectively). Binary logistic regression confirmed that combination of 3 of these miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-181a and miR-652) could reliably differentiate between cancers and controls with an AUC of 0.80. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the underlying molecular portrait of Luminal A-like breast cancer subtype. From an initial 76 miRNAs, 4 were validated with altered expression in the blood of women with Luminal A-like breast cancer. The expression profiles of these 3 miRNAs, in combination with mammography, has potential to facilitate accurate subtype-specific breast tumor detection.

J	Shelokar, P; Quirin, A; Cordon, O				Shelokar, Prakash; Quirin, Arnaud; Cordon, Oscar			Three-objective subgraph mining using multiobjective evolutionary programming	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						Graph-based data mining; Frequent subgraph mining; Multiobjective optimization; Multiobjective graph mining; Multiobjective evolutionary programming; Subdue	DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM; GRAPHS; DATABASES; NETWORKS	The existing methods for graph-based data mining (GBDM) follow the basic approach of applying a single-objective search with a user-defined threshold to discover interesting subgraphs. This obliges the user to deal with simple thresholds and impedes her/him from evaluating the mined subgraphs by defining different "goodness" (i.e., multiobjective) criteria regarding the characteristics of the subgraphs. In previous papers, we defined a multiobjective GBDM framework to perform bi-objective graph mining in terms of sub-graph support and size maximization. Two different search methods were considered with this aim, a multiobjective beam search and a multiobjective evolutionary programming (MOEP). In this contribution, we extend the latter formulation to a three-objective framework by incorporating another classical graph mining objective, the subgraph diameter. The proposed MOEP method for multiobjective GBDM is tested on five synthetic and real-world datasets and its performance is compared against single and multiobjective subgraph mining approaches based on the classical Subdue technique in GBDM.

J	Ortigosa, A; Carro, RM; Quiroga, JI				Ortigosa, Alvaro; Carro, Rosa M.; Quiroga, Jose Ignacio			Predicting user personality by mining social interactions in Facebook	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining in social networks; User modeling; Personality inference	ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE	Adaptive applications may benefit from having models of users' personality to adapt their behavior accordingly. There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the users' personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The reconstruction of gene association networks from gene expression profiles is a relevant task and several statistical techniques have been proposed to build them. The problem lies in the process to discover which genes are more relevant and to identify the direct regulatory relationships among them. We developed a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for mining quantitative association rules to deal with this problem. We applied our methodology named GarNet to a well-known microarray data of yeast cell cycle. The performance analysis of GarNet was organized in three steps similarly to the study performed by Gallo et al. GarNet outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases in terms of quality metrics of the networks, such as accuracy and precision, which were measured using YeastNet database as true network. Furthermore, the results were consistent with previous biological knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Martinez-Ballesteros, M.; Nepomuceno-Chamorro, I. A.; Riquelme, J.

This article adapts standard data mining techniques, combined with a foundational ontology of causation, with the objective of helping domain experts identify candidate causal relationships between movement patterns and their environmental context. In addition to data about movement and its dynamic environmental context, our approach requires as input definitions of the states and events of interest. The technique outputs causal and causal-like relationships of potential interest, along with associated measures of support and confidence. As a validation of our approach, the analysis is applied to real data about fish movement in the Murray River in Australia. The results demonstrate that the technique is capable of identifying statistically significant patterns of movement indicative of causal and causal-like relationships.

J	Hong, TP; Lee, YC; Wu, MT				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Lee, Yeong-Chyi; Wu, Min-Thai			An effective parallel approach for genetic-fuzzy data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy set; Genetic algorithm; Parallel processing; Association rule	ASSOCIATION RULES; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; TRADE-OFF; ALGORITHMS; INDUCTION; NUMBER; MODEL	Data mining is most commonly used in attempts to induce association rules from transaction data. In the past, we used the fuzzy and GA concepts to discover both useful fuzzy association rules and suitable membership functions from quantitative values. The evaluation for fitness values was, however, quite time-consuming. Due to dramatic increases in available computing power and concomitant decreases in computing costs over the last decade, learning or mining by applying parallel processing techniques has become a feasible way to overcome the slow-learning problem. In this paper, we thus propose a parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm based on the master-slave architecture to extract both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. The master processor uses a single population as a simple genetic algorithm does, and distributes the tasks of fitness evaluation to slave processors. The evolutionary processes, such as crossover, mutation and production are performed by the master processor. It is very natural and efficient to run the proposed algorithm on the master-slave architecture. The time complexities for both sequential and parallel genetic-fuzzy mining algorithms have also been analyzed, with results showing the good effect of the proposed one. When the number of generations is large, the speed-up can be nearly linear. The experimental results also show this point. Applying the master-slave parallel architecture to speed up the genetic-fuzzy data mining algorithm is thus a feasible way to overcome the low-speed fitness evaluation problem of the original algorithm.

To overcome this problem, data mining researchers have studied methods which can conduct more efficient and immediate mining tasks by scanning databases only once. Thereafter, the sliding window model, which can perform mining operations focusing on recently accumulated parts over data streams, was proposed, and a variety of mining approaches related to this have been suggested. However, it is hard to mine all of the frequent patterns in the data stream environment since generated patterns are remarkably increased as data streams are continuously extended. Thus, methods for efficiently compressing generated patterns are needed in order to solve that problem. In addition, since not only support conditions but also weight constraints expressing items' importance are one of the important factors in the pattern mining, we need to consider them in mining process. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel algorithm, weighted maximal frequent pattern mining over data streams based on sliding window model (WMFP-SW) to obtain weighted maximal frequent patterns reflecting recent information over data streams. Performance experiments report that MWFP-SW outperforms previous algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1: How Genetic Variability of the Core Protein Affects the Response to Pegylated-Interferon and Ribavirin Therapy	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY			English	Article						hepatitis C virus; genotype 1; PEG-IFN; RBV therapy; sustained virological response; Saudi Arabia	HIGH VIRAL LOAD; COMBINATION THERAPY; PLUS RIBAVIRIN; VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE; SEQUENCE DIVERSITY; INITIAL TREATMENT; READING FRAME; INFECTION; PEGINTERFERON; REGION	Hepatitis C virus subgenotypes 1a and 1b are found worldwide and cause 60% of all hepatitis C cases. It has been reported recently that viral genetic variations have a critical impact on the patient treatment outcome. In particular, polymorphisms of the HCV core protein have been linked to poor treatment response. However, most of these studies were conducted on Asian populations, Japanese in particular who are infected with HCV subgenotype 1b. Hence, we aimed in this study to examine the core protein polymorphisms in Saudi patients who are infected with chronic HCV genotype 1 (1a and 1b subtypes) and its association with treatment outcome. Direct sequencing of full-length core protein and data mining analyses were utilized. Results have shown that the response to treatment is dependent on subgenotypes. Indeed, HCV-1b showed different point mutations that are associated with treatment outcome where the point mutations at positions 70 (Arg(70)Gln) and 75 (Thr(75)Ala) in HCV-1b are significantly associated with PEG-IFN/RBV treatment response. In contrast, HCV-1a showed no significant association between core protein mutations and response to treatment. In addition, analyses of HCV-1a core protein sequences revealed a highly conserved region especially in the responder group. This study provides a new insight in the genetic variability of full-length core protein in HCV genotype 1 in Saudi infected patients. J. Med. Virol. 86:224-234, 2014.

All cells do age individually causing a spread in cell performance. We will show that not only the local operating conditions, but also variances from within the cell manufacturing process influence the variation of aging trends. By an experiment with 48 cells from a mass production line it can be found that the aging spread cannot be neglected. Using data mining algorithms a dependency between initial cell performance and cycle lifetime is identified. The resulting linear regression model can predict the lifetime and can therefore be used to classify cells into different batches before battery pack production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Herzing, DL				Herzing, Denise L.			Profiling nonhuman intelligence: An exercise in developing unbiased tools for describing other "types" of intelligence on earth	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	63rd International Astronautical Congress (IAC)	OCT 01-05, 2012	Naples, ITALY	Int Astronaut Federat		Intelligence; Exobiology; Nonhumans; Signatures; Astrobiology	BRAINS	Intelligence has historically been studied by comparing nonhuman cognitive and language abilities with human abilities. Primate-like species, which show human-like anatomy and share evolutionary lineage, have been the most studied. However, when comparing animals of non-primate origins our abilities to profile the potential for intelligence remains inadequate. Historically our measures for nonhuman intelligence have included a variety of tools: (1) physical measurements - brain to body ratio, brain structure/convolution/neural density, presence of artifacts and physical tools, (2) observational and sensory measurements - sensory signals, complexity of signals, cross-modal abilities, social complexity, (3) data mining information theory, signal/noise, pattern recognition, (4) experimentation - memory, cognition, language comprehension/use, theory of mind, (5) direct interfaces - one way and two way interfaces with primates, dolphins, birds and (6) accidental interactions - human/animal symbiosis, cross-species enculturation. Because humans tend to focus on "human-like" attributes and measures and scientists are often unwilling to consider other "types" of intelligence that may not be human equated, our abilities to profile "types" of intelligence that differ on a variety of scales is weak. Just as biologists stretch their definitions of life to look at extremophiles in unusual conditions, so must we stretch our descriptions of types of minds and begin profiling, rather than equating, other life forms we may encounter. COMPLEX (COmplexity of Markers for Profiling Life in EXobiology) offers a new approach to profile a variety of organisms along multiple dimensions including EQ - Encephalization Quotient, CS - Communication Signal complexity, IC - Individual Complexity, SC- Social Complexity and II - Interspecies Interaction. Because Earth species are found along a variety of continuums, defining an intelligence profile along these different trajectories rather than comparing them only to human intelligence, may give us insight into a potential tool for quicldy assessing unknown species. The application of profiling nonhuman species, out of world, will be both observational and potentially interactive in some way. Using profiles and indicators gleaned from Earth species to help us develop profiles and using pattern recognition, modeling and other data mining techniques could help jump start our understanding of other organisms and their potential for certain "types" of intelligence.

Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley-Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100 m DEM. RFs m(try), parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized RF resulted in a kappa index of 89.6% when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5% when validated with field data. Variable reduction and m(try) optimization resulted in minimal improvements in RF predictions.

An ensemble data mining approach involving Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) and Elastic Net/Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) regression methods coupled to Rough Set (RS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods was used to develop robust quantitative structure - activity relationship (QSAR) type models for bandgap prediction. The output of the regression analyses is the predicted bandgap for new compounds based on a model using the descriptors most related to bandgap. Feature ranking algorithms were then employed to: (i) assess the connection between bandgap and the chemical descriptors used in the predictive models; and (ii) understand the cause of outliers in the predictions. This paper provides a descriptor guided selection strategy for identifying new potential chalcopyrite chemistries materials for solar cell applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

However, most engineering-based evacuation models treat evacuees as independent and separate entities, and overlook the interactions among household members during an evacuation (i.e., gathering children/spouses or uniting with other family members at home). The omission of these behaviors leads to imprecise modeling of evacuation situations. Additionally, transportation mode choice in a no-notice evacuation has been seldom investigated. We present a framework to incorporate both household-gathering behavior and mode choice in an emergency into an evacuation model to examine the effects of these two issues on evacuation efficiency and network performance. The framework was tested in the Chicago metropolitan region for two hypothetical incidents with evacuation radii 5 and 25 miles. Models that omit gathering behavior yield dangerously optimistic evacuation times and network congestion levels compared to models that include family interactions. These optimistic estimates are significant for a large-scale evacuationthe reduction in the number of evacuees who can reach safe zones in a certain time threshold is nearly 50% between the gathering and no-gathering models. Gathering behavior could also cause distinct effects on network performance for inner and outer areas, the break point of which may be where severe bottlenecks are located. In this study, average travel speed increases on the overall network within 15 miles of the incident location (where downtown Chicago is located), but decreases outside the 15-mile radius. These results would be completely overlooked without incorporating the gathering behavior yet are critical for evacuation management.

J	Lopez, V; Fernandez, A; Herrera, F				Lopez, Victoria; Fernandez, Alberto; Herrera, Francisco			On the importance of the validation technique for classification with imbalanced datasets: Addressing covariate shift when data is skewed	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Classification; Imbalanced dataset; Covariate shift; Dataset shift; Validation technique; Partitioning	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CROSS-VALIDATION; SOFTWARE TOOL; DATA SETS; SYSTEMS; ACCURACY; INTERPRETABILITY; SELECTION; NETWORKS; KEEL	In the field of Data Mining, the estimation of the quality of the learned models is a key step in order to select the most appropriate tool for the problem to be solved. Traditionally, a k-fold validation technique has been carried out so that there is a certain degree of independency among the results for the different partitions. In this way, the highest average performance will be obtained by the most robust approach. However, applying a "random" division of the instances over the folds may result in a problem known as dataset shift, which consists in having a different data distribution between the training and test folds. In classification with imbalanced datasets, in which the number of instances of one class is much lower than the other class, this problem is more severe. The misclassification of minority class instances due to an incorrect learning of the real boundaries caused by a not well fitted data distribution, truly affects the measures of performance in this scenario. Regarding this fact, we propose the use of a specific validation technique for the partitioning of the data, known as "Distribution optimally balanced stratified cross-validation" to avoid this harmful situation in the presence of imbalance. This methodology makes the decision of placing close-by samples on different folds, so that each partition will end up with enough representatives of every region. We have selected a wide number of imbalanced datasets from KEEL dataset repository for our study, using several learning techniques from different paradigms, thus making the conclusions extracted to be independent of the underlying classifier. The analysis of the results has been carried out by means of the proper statistical study, which shows the goodness of this approach for dealing with imbalanced data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm uses r hash functions to estimate the density values of stream data items. To emphasize the importance of recent data items, a time fading factor is' used. For a given error bound, our algorithm can detect approximate frequent items under a certain probability using limited number of memory space. The memory requirement only depends on the number of different data items and the number of hash functions used. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets show that our algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory requirement, and processing speed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It can only deal with attributes of a specific type in the information system by using a specific binary relation. However, there may be attributes of multiple different types in information systems in real-life applications. Such information systems are called as composite information systems in this paper. A composite relation is proposed to process attributes of multiple different types simultaneously in composite information systems. Then, an extended rough set model, called as composite rough sets, is presented. We also redefine lower and upper approximations, positive, boundary and negative regions in composite rough sets. Through introducing the concepts of the relation matrix, the decision matrix and the basic matrix, we propose matrix-based methods for computing the approximations, positive, boundary and negative regions in composite information systems, which is crucial for feature selection and knowledge discovery. Moreover, combined with the incremental learning technique, a novel matrix-based method for fast updating approximations is proposed in dynamic composite information systems. Extensive experiments on different data sets from UCI and user-defined data sets show that the proposed incremental method can process large data sets efficiently. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Much research has been conducted on the factors that influence service use in this population, but the methods generally used cannot easily identify the complex interactions that are thought to exist. In this paper, we examine predictors of subsequent service use among respondents to a population health survey who met criteria for a past-year mood, anxiety or substance-related disorder. METHODS To determine service use, we use an administrative database including all physician consultations in the period of interest. To identify predictors, we use classification tree (CART) analysis, a data mining technique with the ability to identify unsuspected interactions. We compare results to those from logistic regression models. RESULTS We identify 1213 individuals with past-year disorder. In the year after the survey, 24% (n=312) of these had a mental health-related physician consultation. Logistic regression revealed that age, sex and marital status predicted service use. CART analysis yielded a set of rules based on age, sex, marital status and income adequacy, with marital status playing a role among men and by income adequacy important among women. CART analysis proved moderately effective overall, with agreement of 60%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 53%. CONCLUSION Results highlight the potential of data-mining techniques to uncover complex interactions, and offer support to the view that the intersection of multiple statuses influence health and behaviour in ways that are difficult to identify with conventional statistics. The disadvantages of these methods are also discussed.

J	Liang, GH; Zhu, XQ; Zhang, CQ				Liang, Guohua; Zhu, Xingquan; Zhang, Chengqi			The effect of varying levels of class distribution on bagging for different algorithms: An empirical study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Imbalanced class distribution; AUC performance; Bagging	OVER-SAMPLING TECHNIQUE; IMBALANCED DATA SETS; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; SMOTE; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; PREDICTORS	Many real world applications involve highly imbalanced class distribution. Research into learning from imbalanced class distribution is considered to be one of ten challenging problems in data mining research, and it has increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. In this work, we study the effects of different levels of imbalanced class distribution on bagging predictors by using under-sampling techniques. Despite the popularity of bagging in many real-world applications, some questions have not been clearly answered in the existing research, such as the effect of varying the levels of class distribution on different bagging predictors, e.g., whether bagging is superior to single learners when the levels of class distribution change. Most classification learning algorithms are designed to maximize the overall accuracy rate and assume that training instances are uniformly distributed; however, the overall accuracy does not represent correct prediction on the minority class, which is the class of interest to users. The overall accuracy metric is therefore ineffective for evaluating the performance of classifiers in extremely imbalanced data. This study investigates the effect of varying levels of class distribution on different bagging predictors based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) as a performance metric, using an under-sampling technique on 14 data-sets with imbalanced class distributions. Our experimental results indicate that Decision Table (DTable) and RepTree are the learning algorithms with the best bagging AUC performance. The AUC performances of bagging predictors are statistically superior to single learners, with the exception of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Stump (DStump).

It is expected that not only can smart grid reduce electricity consumption, but it can also provide a more reliable and versatile service than the traditional power grid can. Although the infrastructure of smart grid all over the world is far from complete yet, there is no doubt that our daily life will benefit a lot from smart grid. Hence, many researches are aimed to point out the challenges and needs of future smart grid. The question is, how do we use the massive data captured by smart meters to provide services that are as "smart'' as possible instead of just automatically reading information from the meters. This paper begins with a discussion of the smart grid before we move on to the basic computational awareness for smart grid. A brief review of data mining and machine learning technologies for smart grid, which are often used for computational awareness, is then given to further explain their potentials. Finally, challenges, potentials, open issues, and future trends of smart grid are addressed.

J	Wu, XM; Wang, JM				Wu, Xinmiao; Wang, Jianmin			Micro-blog in China: identify influential users and automatically classify posts on Sina micro-blog	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Micro-blog; Social network; Ranking; Classification; Data mining		Sina micro-blog (Weibo) is the first micro-blogging service in China and is growing fast in recent two years. This paper first studies the characteristics of Sina online social network and then focuses on the problem of indentifying influential users and automatic micro-blog classification. In a dataset prepared for this study, we find an approximate power-law follower distribution and a non-power-law friend distribution, a log correlation between follower number and tweet number, etc. In order to find the most popular users, we propose our algorithm called XinRank and compare it with the other two algorithms. The result shows that XinRank is different and it offers a new perspective for people to find influential users. In addition, our algorithm is dynamic and stability, which is special and better than the other two algorithms. We attempt to automatically classify a single Chinese micro-blog post into a set of high-level categories using a naive Bayes classifier. Our research indicates that even though an average micro-blogging post in Chinese is only 28 words in length, they can be categorized into one of eight categories with an average performance up to 84.2 %, using our proposed process. We try to address the automatic user interest discovery problem at the end of this paper. And finally, we combine XinRank and our micro-blog classifier to propose an interest-based influence ranking model.

The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans, goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do. In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible goal achievement's defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property of activity recognition.

J	Rana, C; Jain, SK				Rana, Chhavi; Jain, Sanjay Kumar			An evolutionary clustering algorithm based on temporal features for dynamic recommender systems	SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Evolutionary; Clustering; Algorithm; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering; Data mining		The use of internet and Web services is changing the way we use resources and communicate since the last decade. Although, this usage has made life easier in many respects still the problem of finding relevant information persists. A naive user faces the problem of information overload and continuous flow of new information makes the problem more complex. Furthermore, user's interests also keeps on changing with time. Several techniques deal with this problem and data mining is widely used among them. Recommender Systems (RSs) assist users in finding relevant information on the web and are mostly based on data mining algorithms. This paper addresses the problem of user requirements changing over a period of time in seeking information on web and how RSs deal with them. We propose a Dynamic Recommender system (DRS) based on evolutionary clustering algorithm. This clustering algorithm makes clusters of similar users and evolves them depicting accurate and relevant user preferences over time. The proposed approach performs an optimization of conflicting parameters instead of using the traditional evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been empirically tested and compared with standard recommendation algorithms and it shows considerable improvement in terms of quality of recommendations and computation time.

As the size of datasets is extremely large nowadays, parallel processing of complex data analysis such as DBSCAN becomes indispensable. However, there are three major drawbacks in the existing parallel DBSCAN algorithms. First, they fail to properly balance the load among parallel tasks, especially when data are heavily skewed. Second, the scalability of these algorithms is limited because not all the critical sub-procedures are parallelized. Third, most of them are not primarily designed for shared-nothing environments, which makes them less portable to emerging parallel processing paradigms. In this paper, we present MR-DBSCAN, a scalable DBSCAN algorithm using MapReduce. In our algorithm, all the critical sub-procedures are fully parallelized. As such, there is no performance bottleneck caused by sequential processing. Most importantly, we propose a novel data partitioning method based on computation cost estimation. The objective is to achieve desirable load balancing even in the context of heavily skewed data. Besides, We conduct our evaluation using real large datasets with up to 1.2 billion points. The experiment results well confirm the efficiency and scalability of MR-DBSCAN.

Higher-level dataflow languages are used on top of parallel and distributed dataflow systems to enable faster data-intensive workflow programs development, their easier optimization, and more maintainable code. In this paper, we present the rationales, design, and application of the needed advanced support for modeling and optimizing data flows for data mining and integration processes. The optimization research and development is based on dataflow pre-execution modeling and extending the registry of process activities by advanced annotations. Additionally, the overall process from a dynamic model to a static model as input for the optimization algorithms is described. This novel approach is implemented within an advanced graphical user interface, called the Process Designer, in order to support semi-automatic optimization as well as within a dataflow execution platform, called the Gateway. It can be adapted to any dataflow language implementation. The Process Designer architecture based on modern (meta-)modeling concepts naturally supports validated transformations between external textual and internal graphical representations of the targeted dataflow language, and in this way significantly increases the productivity and robustness of the implementation processes.

Data stream mining for predicting software build outcomes using source code metrics	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data stream mining; Concept drift detection; Hoeffding tree; Jazz; Software metrics; Software repositories	REPOSITORIES; VALIDATION; MODEL	Context: Software development projects involve the use of a wide range of tools to produce a software artifact. Software repositories such as source control systems have become a focus for emergent research because they are a source of rich information regarding software development projects. The mining of such repositories is becoming increasingly common with a view to gaining a deeper understanding of the development process. Objective: This paper explores the concepts of representing a software development project as a process that results in the creation of a data stream. It also describes the extraction of metrics from the jazz repository and the application of data stream mining techniques to identify useful metrics for predicting build success or failure. Method: This research is a systematic study using the Hoeffding Tree classification method used in conjunction with the Adaptive Sliding Window (ADWIN) method for detecting concept drift by applying the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) tool. Results: The results indicate that only a relatively small number of the available measures considered have any significance for predicting the outcome of a build over time. These significant measures are identified and the implication of the results discussed, particularly the relative difficulty of being able to predict failed builds. The Hoeffding Tree approach is shown to produce a more stable and robust model than traditional data mining approaches. Conclusion: Overall prediction accuracies of 75% have been achieved through the use of the Hoeffding Tree classification method. Despite this high overall accuracy, there is greater difficulty in predicting failure than success. The emergence of a stable classification tree is limited by the lack of data but overall the approach shows promise in terms of informing software development activities in order to minimize the chance of failure.

So, these images are converted in to useful information using data mining techniques. In existing all the research papers using kmeans and fuzzy k means with euclidean distance for image clustering. Here, each cluster needs its own centric for cluster calculation and the euclidean distance calculate the distance between the points. In clustering this process of distance calculation did not give efficient result. For make this in to efficient, this research paper proposes the non Euclidean distance measures for distance calculation. Here, the logical points are used to find the cluster. The result shows that image clustering based on the modified non Euclidean distance and the performance shows the efficiency of non euclidean distance measures.

Screening and Characterization of Reactive Compounds with In Vitro Peptide-Trapping and Liquid Chromatography/High-Resolution Accurate Mass Spectrometry	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						reactive compounds; peptide-trapping; liquid chromatography; high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)	METABOLITES; THROUGHPUT; HEPATOTOXICITY; BIOANALYSIS; HYBRID; AGENT; ASSAY	The present study describes a novel methodology for the detection of reactive compounds using in vitro peptide-trapping and liquid chromatography-high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Compounds that contain electrophilic groups can covalently bind to nucleophilic moieties in proteins and form adducts. Such adducts are thought to be associated with drug-mediated toxicity and therefore represent potential liabilities in drug discovery programs. In addition, reactive compounds identified in biological screening can be associated with data that can be misinterpreted if the reactive nature of the compound is not appreciated. In this work, to facilitate the triage of hits from high-throughput screening (HTS), a novel assay was developed to monitor the formation of covalent peptide adducts by compounds suspected to be chemically reactive. The assay consists of in vitro incubations of test compounds (under conditions of physiological pH) with synthetically prepared peptides presenting a variety of nucleophilic moieties such as cysteine, lysine, histidine, arginine, serine, and tyrosine. Reaction mixtures were analyzed using full-scan LC-HRMS, the data were interrogated using postacquisition data mining, and modified amino acids were identified by subsequent LC-HRMS/mass spectrometry. The study demonstrated that in vitro nucleophilic peptide trapping followed by LC-HRMS analysis is a useful approach for screening of intrinsically reactive compounds identified from HTS exercises, which are then removed from follow-up processes, thus obviating the generation of data from biochemical activity assays.

Mortality prediction of nonalcoholic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding using data mining	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; mortality; nonalcoholic; predictors; upper gastrointestinal bleeding	HOSPITAL ADMISSION; HEMORRHAGE	Background and aimPatients with acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding commonly present with hematemesis and/or melena. More studies are needed to confirm the ability to predict mortality, length of stay, and cost. Alcohol abuse may worsen variceal bleeding or portal hypertensive gastropathy in a patient with a history of liver disease. Coexisting alcoholism may influence patient management in the setting of peptic ulceration or existing malignancy. Consequently, the overall morbidities and mortalities may differ in alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups accordingly. Mortality prediction using data mining programs is helpful for detection of significant mortality-related factors.Patients and methodsWe retrospectively reviewed 152 files of patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, because of nonalcoholic causes, 100 males and 52 females aged 16-77 years old. Causes of upper GI bleeding were esophageal and/or gastric varices (51), portal hypertensive congestive gastropathy (6), gastric and/or duodenal ulcers (39), gastroesophageal reflux disease (20), gastritis and duodenitis (19), cancer (8), gastric polyps (3), blood diseases (2), Dieulafoy's lesion (2), and no aberrant cause of bleeding in two patients.ResultsThe overall mortality was 29 patients (19.07%). The use of a descriptive model of the data mining program yielded the most significant mortality predictors. The overall accuracy was 92.08%.ConclusionChronic hepatitis C virus infection and NSAID-associated splenomegaly because of portal hypertension are significant predictors of mortality in nonalcoholic patients presenting with upper GI bleeding.

In this article, we share our experiences in a randomised controlled study, the Hypertension Adherence Program in Pharmacy trial, evaluating a community pharmacy-based intervention for improving adherence to antihypertensive medication. Several objective and subjective measures of adherence (Morisky score, TABS score, MedsIndex, Medicines Possession Ratio) were used, but produced varying results, limiting confidence in the conclusions that could be drawn. Despite using a specifically designed data mining software program to identify potentially nonadherent patients from dispensing records, many participants were found to be adherent by the self reported Morisky scale. A lesson to be learned when targeting people for interventions to improve adherence is that information from dispensing records should be supplemented by other methods in order to identify patients most in need of assistance.

The appropriate selection (prediction) of M&A targets for a given bidder company constitutes a critical first step for an effective technology M&A activity. Yet existing studies only employ financial and managerial indicators when constructing M&A prediction models, and select candidate target companies without considering the profile of the bidder company or its technological compatibility with candidate target companies. Such limitations greatly restrict the applicability of existing studies to supporting technology M&A predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a technology M&A prediction technique that encompasses technological indicators as independent variables and accounts for the technological profiles of both bidder and candidate target companies. Forty-three technological indicators are derived from patent documents and an ensemble learning method is developed for our proposed technology M&A prediction technique. Our evaluation results, on the basis of the M&A cases between January 1997 and May 2008 that involve companies in Japan and Taiwan, confirm the viability and applicability of the proposed technology M&A prediction technique. In addition, our evaluation also suggests that the incorporation of the technological profiles and compatibility of both bidder and candidate target companies as predictors significantly improves the effectiveness of relevant predictions.

This article uses data from regional snowball samplingthe only practically feasible network sampling methodto identify groups with significantly different churn ratios for customers with different network topological properties. Clear evidence indicates that individual network characteristics (node-level metrics) have considerable impact on churn probabilities. The inclusion of network-related measures in the churn model allows a longer-term projection of churners and improves the predictive power of the model. With no possibility to carry out repeated sampling, sample stability was checked through simulation results. On the one hand, this article highlights the importance and effectiveness of the provider's tailored marketing campaigns by showing that customers targeted by direct marketing campaigns are less threatened by churn than nontargeted customers. On the other, this article shows that social embeddedness blocks the impact of the very same marketing efforts. This article forwards the idea that social embeddedness, also prevalent in vendor switching, can be extended to understanding the development of professional societies threatened by membership churn.

This study presents a new zoning method by determining and categorizing the risk characteristics using the k-means clustering data mining technology. The study constructs indices and develops index quantification models for environmental risk zoning by analyzing the mechanism of environmental risk occurrence. We calculate the source risk index, air risk field index, water risk field index, and target vulnerability of the study area with Nanjing Chemical Industrial Park using a 100 m x 100 m mesh grid as the basic zoning unit, and then use k-means clustering to analyze the environmental risk in the area. We obtain the optimal clustering number with the largest average silhouette coefficient by calculating the average silhouette coefficients of clustering at different k-values. The clustering result with the optimal clustering number is then used for the environmental risk zoning, and the zoning result is mapped using the geographic information system. The study area is divided into five sub-areas. The common environmental risk characteristics within the same sub-area, as well as the differences between subareas, are presented. The zoning is helpful in risk management and is convenient for decision makers to distribute limited resources to different sub-areas in the design of risk reducing intervention.

We propose a new local dimension reduction algorithm TotalPLS that operates in a unified partial least squares (PLS) framework and implement an information fusion of PLSbased feature selection and feature extraction. This paper focuses on extracting the potential structure hidden in high-dimensional multicategory microarray data, and interpreting and understanding the results provided by the potential structure information. First, we propose using PLS-based recursive feature elimination (PLSRFE) in multicategory problems. Then, we perform feature importance analysis based on PLSRFE for high-dimensional microarray data to determine the information feature (biomarkers) subset, which relates to the studied tumor subtypes problem. Finally, PLS-based supervised feature extraction is conducted on the selected specific genes subset to extract comprehensive features that best reflect the nature of classification to have a discriminating ability. The proposed algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art methods using multiple high-dimensional multicategory microarray datasets. Our comparison is performed in terms of recognition accuracy, relevance, and redundancy. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed by us can improve the recognition rate and computational efficiency. Furthermore, mining potential structure information improves the interpretability and understandability of recognition results. The proposed algorithm can be effectively applied tomicroarray data analysis for the discovery of gene coexpression and coregulation.

However, lack of a clear conceptual and methodological framework has prevented the development of such approaches within the field of conservation biology. Our objective was to illustrate how Google Trends, a freely accessible web-crawling engine, can be used to track changes in timing of biological processes, spatial distribution of invasive species, and level of public awareness about key conservation issues. Google Trends returns the number of internet searches that were made for a keyword in a given region of the world over a defined period. Using data retrieved online for 13 countries, we exemplify how Google Trends can be used to study the timing of biological processes, such as the seasonal recurrence of pollen release or mosquito outbreaks across a latitudinal gradient. We mapped the spatial extent of results from Google Trends for 5 invasive species in the United States and found geographic patterns in invasions that are consistent with their coarse-grained distribution at state levels. From 2004 through 2012, Google Trends showed that the level of public interest and awareness about conservation issues related to ecosystem services, biodiversity, and climate change increased, decreased, and followed both trends, respectively. Finally, to further the development of research approaches at the interface of conservation biology, collective knowledge, and environmental management, we developed an algorithm that allows the rapid retrieval of Google Trends data.

Using data mining synergies for evaluating criteria at pre-qualification stage of supplier selection	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Supply chain management (SCM); Supplier selection; Supplier's pre-qualification; Data mining; i-PM algorithm	FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; CHAIN	A company must purchase a lot of diverse components and raw material from different upstream suppliers to manufacture or assemble its products. Under this situation the supplier selection has become a critical issue for the purchasing department.The selection of suppliers depends on number of criteria and the challenge is to optimize selection process based on critical criteria and select the best supplier(s). During supplier selection process initial screening of potential suppliers from a large set is vital and the determination of prospective supplier is largely dependent on the criteria chosen of such pre-qualification. In the literature, many judgments based methods are proposed and derived criteria selection from the opinion of either the customers or the experts. All these techniques use the knowledge and experience of the decision makers. These methods inherit certain degree of uncertainty due to complex supply chain structure. The extraction of hidden knowledge is one of the most important tools to address such uncertainty and data mining is one such concept to account for such uncertainty and it has been found applicable in many scenarios. The proposed research aims to introduce a data mining approach, to discover the hidden relationships among the supplier's pre-qualification data with the overall supplier rating that have been derived after observation of previously executed work for a period of time. It provides an overview that how supplier's initial strength influence its final work performance.	[Jain, Rajeev] Kalaniketan Polytech Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Jabalpur 482001, India; [Singh, A.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of hypoglycemia due to OHA use by using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. To this end, reports of hypoglycemia events included in the JADER database between 2004 and 2012 were analyzed by calculating the reporting odds ratio (OR). The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory. Activities Preferred Terms was used to identify hypoglycemia; 254392 reports were found in the JADER database, of which 13269 were excluded because the age and sex of the patient were not reported. Finally, 241123 reports were analyzed. Among OHAs, sulfonylureas showed the highest adjusted OR (adjusted OR, 10.13; 95% confidence interval, 9.08-11.26). The adjusted ORs for meglitinides, biguanide, thiazolidinedione, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were significantly lower than that of sulfonylureas. The adjusted OR of meglitinides (3.17; 95% confidence interval, 2.23-4.36) was significantly higher than that of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinedione. We observed no difference between the adjusted ORs for biguanide, thiazolidinedione, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Data mining of the JADER database was useful for analyzing OHA-associated hypoglycemia events. The results of our study suggested a low risk of hypoglycemia associated with biguanide, thiazolidinedione, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in clinical practice.

Adaptive and multi-mining versions of the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						Hybrid metaheuristic; GRASP; Data mining; Reliable multicast	RELIABLE MULTICAST; SEARCH PROCEDURES; LOCAL RECOVERY; ASSIGNMENT	Metaheuristics represent an important class of techniques to solve, approximately, hard combinatorial optimization problems for which the use of exact methods is impractical. Some researches have been combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristics to adaptively guide and improve the search for near optimal solutions. An example of such development is the DM-GRASP, a hybrid version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedures (GRASP) metaheuristic which incorporates a data mining process. In this hybrid proposal, after executing half of the total number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of sub-optimal solutions for the optimization problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following half GRASP iterations in the search through the solution space. In this work, we explore new versions of the DM-GRASP metaheuristic to experiment, not a single activation, but multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process during the metaheuristic execution. We also applied the data mining technique into a reactive GRASP to show that a more sophisticated and not memoryless GRASP approach can also benefit from the use of this technique. In order to evaluate these new proposals, we adopted the server replication for reliable multicast problem since the best known results for this problem were obtained by GRASP and DM-GRASP implementations. The computational experiments, comparing traditional GRASP, DM-GRASP, and the new proposals, showed that multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process can improve the results obtained by the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic-the new proposals were able to find better results in less computational time for the reliable multicast problem.

J	Chen, H				Chen, Hui			Mining top-k frequent patterns over data streams sliding window	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data stream mining; Top-k frequent pattern; Sliding window; Chernoff bound	TRANSACTIONAL DATA STREAMS; ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM; ELEMENTS	Frequent pattern mining in data streams is an important research topic in the data mining community. In previous studies, a minimum support threshold was assumed to be available for mining frequent patterns. However, setting such a threshold is typically difficult. Hence, it is more reasonable to ask users to set a bound on the result size. The present study considers mining top-k frequent patterns from data streams using a sliding window technique. A single-pass algorithm, called MSWTP, is developed for the generation of top-k frequent patterns without a threshold. In the method, the content of the transactions in the sliding window is incrementally maintained in a summary data structure, named SWTP-tree, by scanning the stream only once. To make the mining operation efficient, insignificant patterns are distinguished from others by applying the Chernoff bound. Two kinds of obsolete pattern and one kind of insignificant pattern are periodically pruned from the pattern tree. Whenever necessary, the k most frequent patterns can be selected from SWTP-tree in order of their descending frequency. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated via simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed method is both efficient and scalable, and that it outperforms comparable algorithms.

J	Chen, S; Janeja, VP				Chen, Song; Janeja, Vandana P.			Human perspective to anomaly detection for cybersecurity	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cybersecurity; Human factors; Data mining; Pattern discovery		Traditionally signature-based network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) rely on inputs from domain experts and can only identify the attacks if they occur as individual event. IDS generate large number of alerts and it becomes very difficult for human users to go through each message. Previous researches have proposed analytics based approaches to analyze IDS alert patterns based on anomaly detection models, multi-steps models or probabilistic approaches. However, due to the complexities of network intrusions, it is impossible to develop all possible attack patterns or to avoid false positives. With the advance in technologies and popularity of networks in our daily life, it is becoming more and more difficult to detect network intrusions. However, no matter how rapid the technologies change, the human behaviors behind the cyber attacks stay relatively constant. This provides us an opportunity to develop an improved system to detect the unusual cyber attacks. In this paper, we developed four network intrusion models based on consideration of human factors. We then tested these models on ITOC Cyber Defense Competition (CDX) 2009 data. Our results are encouraging. These Models are not only able to recognize most network attacks identified by SNORT log alerts, they are also able to distinguish the non-attack network traffic that was potentially missed by SNORT as indicated by ground truth validation of the data.

Thus, the huge number of this "tiny" data sources leads to the generation of massive data streams of geo-referenced data. As a matter of fact, the effective analysis of such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams management poses new challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the overall process harder than for classical point data. In particular, we are interested in solving the problem of effective trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with sequential data that have to be properly managed due to their ordering. We propose a framework that allow data pre-elaboration in order to make the mining step more effective. As for every data mining tool, the experimental evaluation is crucial, thus we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Internet provides a lot of valuable information to the users and the amount of web contents is progressively increasing. This makes it very difficult to identify potentially dangerous documents. Simply extracting keywords from documents is not enough to classify the contents. To build automated document classification systems, many techniques have been studied so far, but they are mostly statistical and knowledge-based approaches. These methods, however, do not yield satisfactory results because of complexity of natural languages. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a method to use word similarity based on WordNet hierarchy and n-gram data frequency. This method was tested with the sampled New York Times articles by querying four distinct words from four different areas. Experimental results show our proposed method effectively extracts context words from the text and identifies terrorism-related documents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Process Simulation and Control Optimization of a Blast Furnace Using Classical Thermodynamics Combined to a Direct Search Algorithm	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE EQUILIBRIA; AMORPHOUS-CARBON; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; NEURAL-NETWORK; MELTING-POINT; GRAPHITE; CRYSTALLIZATION; HEAT; DIAMOND; COKES	Several numerical approaches have been proposed in the literature to simulate the behavior of modern blast furnaces: finite volume methods, data-mining models, heat and mass balance models, and classical thermodynamic simulations. Despite this, there is actually no efficient method for evaluating quickly optimal operating parameters of a blast furnace as a function of the iron ore composition, which takes into account all potential chemical reactions that could occur in the system. In the current study, we propose a global simulation strategy of a blast furnace, the 5-unit process simulation. It is based on classical thermodynamic calculations coupled to a direct search algorithm to optimize process parameters. These parameters include the minimum required metallurgical coke consumption as well as the optimal blast chemical composition and the total charge that simultaneously satisfy the overall heat and mass balances of the system. Moreover, a Gibbs free energy function for metallurgical coke is parameterized in the current study and used to fine-tune the simulation of the blast furnace. Optimal operating conditions and predicted output stream properties calculated by the proposed thermodynamic simulation strategy are compared with reference data found in the literature and have proven the validity and high precision of this simulation.

SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Academic writing; Textual design; Tables; Graphs; Gender studies	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; MATHEMATICS; PSYCHOLOGY	In psychological research there is huge literature on differences between the sexes. Typically it used to be thought that women were more verbally and men more spatially oriented. These differences now seem to be waning. In this article we present three studies on sex differences in the use of tables and graphs in academic articles. These studies are based on data mining from approximately 2,000 articles published in over 200 peer-reviewed journals in the sciences and social sciences. In Study 1 we found that, in the sciences, men used 26 % more graphs and figures than women, but that there were no significant differences between them in their use of tables. In Study 2 we found no significant differences between men and women in their use of graphs and figures or tables in social science articles. In Study 3 we found no significant differences between men and women in their use of what we termed 'data' and 'text' tables in social science articles. It is possible that these findings indicate that academic writing is now becoming a genre that is equally undertaken by men and women.

Many algorithms have thus been proposed for mining association rules based on items with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, also commonly seen in real-world applications. The fuzzy frequent-pattern tree (FP tree) algorithm has been proposed for extracting fuzzy frequent itemsets from quantitative transactions. Only the term with the maximum cardinality in later processes is used, making the number of fuzzy regions processed equal to the number of original items, which reduces the processing time. In real world applications, however, multiple fuzzy regions of an item produce better fuzzy association rules than those obtained using a single region. In this paper, the multiple fuzzy FP tree (MFFP tree) algorithm is proposed for mining fuzzy frequent itemsets from transactions with quantitative values. When extending the FP-tree structure to handle fuzzy data, the processing becomes much more complex than that for the original FP-tree structure since the fuzzy intersection in each transaction has to be handled. The MFFP-tree construction algorithm is designed and the MFFP-growth mining approach is proposed for mining the fuzzy frequent itemsets from the tree structure. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

EU-ADR Consortium	Signal Detection of Potentially Drug-Induced Acute Liver Injury in Children Using a Multi-Country Healthcare Database Network	DRUG SAFETY			English	Article							EU-ADR PROJECT; INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; SAFETY; PATIENT; IDENTIFICATION; DEFINITIONS; ASSOCIATION; CETIRIZINE; EXPERIENCE	Background Data mining in spontaneous reporting databases has shown that drug-induced liver injury is infrequently reported in children. Objectives Our objectives were to (i) identify drugs potentially associated with acute liver injury (ALI) in children and adolescents using electronic healthcare record (EHR) data; and (ii) to evaluate the significance and novelty of these associations. Methods We identified potential cases of ALI during exposure to any prescribed/dispensed drug for individuals <18 years old from the EU-ADR network, which includes seven databases from three countries, covering the years 1996-2010. Several new methods for signal detection were applied to identify all statistically significant associations between drugs and ALI. A drug was considered statistically significantly associated with ALI, using all other time as a reference category, if the 95 % CI lower band of the relative risk was >1 and in the presence of at least three exposed cases of ALI. Potentially new signals were distinguished from already known associations concerning ALI (whether in adults and/or in the paediatric population) through manual review of published literature and drug product labels. Results The study population comprised 4,838,146 individuals aged < 18 years, who contributed an overall 25,575,132 person-years of follow-up. Within this population, we identified 1,015 potential cases of ALI. Overall, 20 positive drug-ALI associations were detected. The associations between ALI and domperidone, flunisolide and human insulin were considered as potentially new signals. Citalopram and cetirizine have been previously described as hepatotoxic in adults but not in children, while all remaining associations were already known in both adults and children. Conclusions Data mining of multiple EHR databases for signal detection confirmed known associations between ALI and several drugs, and identified some potentially new signals in children that require further investigation through formal epidemiologic studies. This study shows that EHRs may complement traditional spontaneous reporting systems for signal detection and strengthening.	[Ferrajolo, Carmen; Coloma, Preciosa M.; Verhamme, Katia M.

Applications of evolutionary algorithms have been found to be particularly useful for automatic processing of large quantities of raw noisy data for optimal parameter setting and to discover significant and meaningful information. Many real-life data mining problems involve multiple conflicting measures of performance, or objectives, which need to be optimized simultaneously. Under this context, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are gradually finding more and more applications in the domain of data mining since the beginning of the last decade. In this two-part paper, we have made a comprehensive survey on the recent developments of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for data mining problems. In this paper, Part I, some basic concepts related to multiobjective optimization and data mining are provided. Subsequently, various multiobjective evolutionary approaches for two major data mining tasks, namely feature selection and classification, are surveyed. In Part II of this paper, we have surveyed different multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for clustering, association rule mining, and several other data mining tasks, and provided a general discussion on the scopes for future research in this domain.

Their capabilities allow them to find better solutions than with conventional clustering algorithms if the suitable individual representation is selected. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the three most relevant and useful representations-prototype-based, label-based, and graph-based-through a wide set of synthetic data sets. Moreover, they are also compared to relevant conventional clustering algorithms. Experiments show that multiobjective evolutionary clustering is competitive with regard to other clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the best scenario for each representation is also presented.

J	Martin, D; Rosete, A; Alcala-Fdez, J; Herrera, F				Martin, Diana; Rosete, Alejandro; Alcala-Fdez, Jesus; Herrera, Francisco			A New Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm for Mining a Reduced Set of Interesting Positive and Negative Quantitative Association Rules	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Data mining; MOEA/D-DE; multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; negative association rules; quantitative association rules	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SOFTWARE TOOL; DISCRETIZATION; KEEL	Most of the algorithms for mining quantitative association rules focus on positive dependencies without paying particular attention to negative dependencies. The latter may be worth taking into account, however, as they relate the presence of certain items to the absence of others. The algorithms used to extract such rules usually consider only one evaluation criterion in measuring the quality of generated rules. Recently, some researchers have framed the process of extracting association rules as a multiobjective problem, allowing us to jointly optimize several measures that can present different degrees of trade-off depending on the dataset used. In this paper, we propose MOPNAR, a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, in order to mine a reduced set of positive and negative quantitative association rules with low computational cost. To accomplish this, our proposal extends a recent multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition to perform an evolutionary learning of the intervals of the attributes and a condition selection for each rule, while introducing an external population and a restarting process to store all the nondominated rules found and to improve the diversity of the rule set obtained. Moreover, this proposal maximizes three objectives-comprehensibility, interestingness, and performance-in order to obtain rules that are interesting, easy to understand, and provide good coverage of the dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated over several real-world datasets.

However, real-world data of fire evacuation is often noisy, incomplete, and inconsistent, and the response time of population classification is very limited. In this paper, we propose an effective multiobjective particle swarm optimization method for population classification in fire evacuation operations, which simultaneously optimizes the precision and recall measures of the classification rules. We design an effective approach for encoding classification rules, and use a comprehensive learning strategy for evolving particles and maintaining diversity of the swarm. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method performs better than some state-of-the-art methods for classification rule mining, especially on the real-world fire evacuation dataset. This paper also reports a successful application of our method in a real-world fire evacuation operation that recently occurred in China. The method can be easily extended to many other multiobjective rule mining problems.

Two well-known spectrum-based fault localization techniques, Tarantula and Ochiai, measure how likely a program element is a root cause of failures based on profiles of correct and failed program executions. These techniques are conceptually similar to association measures that have been proposed in statistics, data mining, and have been utilized to quantify the relationship strength between two variables of interest (e.g., the use of a medicine and the cure rate of a disease). In this paper, we view fault localization as a measurement of the relationship strength between the execution of program elements and program failures. We investigate the effectiveness of 40 association measures from the literature on locating bugs. Our empirical evaluations involve single-bug and multiple-bug programs. We find there is no best single measure for all cases. Klosgen and Ochiai outperform other measures for localizing single-bug programs. Although localizing multiple-bug programs, Added Value could localize the bugs with on average smallest percentage of inspected code, whereas a number of other measures have similar performance. The accuracies of the measures in localizing multi-bug programs are lower than single-bug programs, which provokes future research. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Since a large variety of classification algorithms are proposed in literature, non-experts do not know which method should be used in order to obtain good classification results on their data. Meta-learning tries to address this problem by recommending promising classifiers based on meta-features computed from a given dataset. In this paper, we empirically evaluate five different categories of state-of-the-art meta-features for their suitability in predicting classification accuracies of several widely used classifiers (including Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression). Based on the evaluation results, we have developed the first open source meta-learning system that is capable of accurately predicting accuracies of target classifiers. The user provides a dataset as input and gets an automatically created high-performance ready-to-use pattern recognition system in a few simple steps. A user study of the system with non-experts showed that the users were able to develop more accurate pattern recognition systems in significantly less development time when using our system as compared to using a state-of-the-art data mining software.

The proposed evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression splines (EMARS) model is a hybrid of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and artificial bee colony (ABC). In EMARS, MARS addresses learning and curve fitting and ABC implements optimization to determine the optimal parameter settings with minimal estimation errors. The proposed model was constructed using 106 experimental datasets from the literature. EMARS performance was compared with three other data-mining techniques, including back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM). EMARS estimation accuracy was benchmarked against four prevalent mathematical methods, including ACI-318 (2011), CSA, CEB-FIP MC90, and Tang's Method. Benchmark results identified EMARS as the best model and, thus, an efficient alternative approach to estimating RC deep beam shear strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Die cost is significantly influenced by wafer productivity that is determined by yield rate and the number of gross dies per wafer. However, little research has been done on design for manufacturing and productivity enhancement through increasing the gross die number per wafer and decreasing the required shot number for exposure. This paper aims to propose a novel approach to improve overall wafer effectiveness via data mining to generate the optimal IC feature designs that can bridge the gap between integrated circuit (IC) design and wafer fabrication by providing chip designer with the optimal IC feature size in the design phase to increase gross dies and reduce the required shots. An empirical study was conducted in a leading semiconductor company for validation. The results have shown that the proposed approach can effectively enhance wafer productivity. Indeed, the developed solution has been implemented in the company to provide desired IC features to IC designers to enhance overall wafer effectiveness.

While data mining and statistical analysis play a key role in the quality control of wafers, the existence of outliers adversely affects the applications benefiting from PTD analysis. Due to the complexities of PTD and the resultant outlier patterns, this paper proposes a unified outlier detection framework which takes advantages of data complexity reduction using entropy and abrupt change detection using cumulative sum (CUSUM) method. To meet the practical needs of PTD analysis, a two-step algorithm taking into account of the related domain knowledge is developed, and its effectiveness is validated by using real PTD sets and a production example. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the Fast Greedy Algorithm (FGA) and the Grubb's test, two commonly used outlier detection techniques for univariate data.

Some parts of the information are related to the others, making dimensionality reduction desirable, and losing less information as much as possible, in order to decrease computational times and complexity when applying any ensuing data mining technique. Genetic algorithms offer the possibility of selecting which variables contain the most relevant information to represent all the original ones. The traditional genetic operators seem to be too general, leading to results that could be improved by means of designed genetic operators that employ some available problem-specific information. Especially, when dealing with calibration by means of near-infrared spectral data, which use to contain thousands of variables, it is known that not isolated wavelengths but wavebands allow a more robust model design. This aspect should be taken into account when crossing individuals. We propose three crossover operators specifically designed for calibration with near-infrared spectral data, based on a pseudo-random two-point crossover, where the first point is chosen randomly, and the selection of the second point is guided by problem-specific information. We compare their performance with that of state-of-the-art operators. We combine these new genetic algorithm-based variable selection designs with partial least squares regression and fuzzy systems based calibration.Our benchmark consists of two real-world high-dimensional data sets, corresponding to polyetheracrylat, where hydroxyl number, viscosity, and acidity are on-line monitored; and melamine resin production, where the chilling point (CP) is considered in order to regulate the condensation. We show that designed operators promote wavebands selection, achieve better-quality solutions, and converge faster and smoother than state-of-the-art operators.

This study was carried out in the Mashhad region of Iran during cropping years 2010 and 2011 to evaluate the performances of two data mining methods, decision tree and neural network, for deriving PFs of spring wheat under simultaneous drought and salinity stress compared with four well known regression-based PFs. The four well known PFs were: Jensen-PF (Jensen, 1968), Minhas-PF (Minhas et al., 1974), modified Stewart-PF (Stewart et al., 1977; Stegman et al., 1980), and Nairizi-PF (Nairizi and Rydzewski, 1977). Heading and flowering were the most sensitive growth stages followed by the stem elongation and booting. Salinity stress also affected grain yield and therefore was an important parameter for deriving PFs. In general, all the PFs were in agreement concerning the sensitivity of spring wheat to water stress. The neural network-based PF performed the best with a root mean square error equal to 44.27 g m(-2) while the decision tree-based PF ranked fourth out of six in terms of accuracy. The most important advantage of the neural network-based PF was the flexible number of input parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

State-of-the-art methods are capable of preserving the temporal order of events as well as the temporal intervals in between. The temporal characteristics of the events themselves, however, can likely lead to numerous uninteresting patterns found by current approaches. We present a new definition of the temporal characteristics of events and enhance related work for pattern finding by utilizing temporal relations, like meets, starts, or during, instead of just intervals between events. These prerequisites result in MEMuRY, a new procedure for Temporal Data Mining that preserves and mines additional time-oriented information. Our procedure is supported by SAPPERLOT, an interactive visual interface for exploring the patterns. Furthermore, we illustrate the efficiency of our procedure presenting a benchmark of the procedure's run-time behavior. A usage scenario shows how the procedure can provide new insights.

Visual analytics (VA) aims at enabling the exploration and the understanding of large and complex data sets by intertwining interactive visualization, data analysis, human-computer interaction, as well as cognitive and perceptual science. We propose a design triangle, which considers three main aspects to ease the design: (1) the characteristics of the data, (2) the users, and (3) the users' tasks. Addressing the particular characteristics of time and time-oriented data focuses the VA methods, but turns the design space into a more complex and challenging one. We demonstrate the applicability of the design triangle by three use cases tackling the time-oriented aspects explicitly. Our design triangle provides a high-level framework, which is simple and very effective for the design process as well as easily applicable for both, researchers and practitioners.

Models of distributed data clustering in peer-to-peer environments	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distributed data clustering; Peer-to-peer data mining	DOCUMENT; CATEGORIZATION; ALGORITHM	Distributed data mining applies techniques to mine distributed data sources by avoiding the need to first collect the data into a central site. This has a significant appeal when issues of communication cost and privacy put a restriction on traditional centralized methods. Although there has been development on many fronts in distributed data mining, we are still lacking models that abstract the process by showing similarities and contrasts between the different methods. In this paper, we introduce two abstract models for distributed clustering in peer-to-peer environments with different goals. The first is the Locally optimized Distributed Clustering (LDC) model, which aims toward achieving better local clusters at each node, and is facilitated by collaboration through sharing of summarized cluster information. The second is the Globally optimized Distributed Clustering (GDC) model, which aims toward achieving one global clustering solution that is an approximation of centralized clustering. We also report on concrete realizations of the two models that show their benefits, through application in text mining. The LDC model is realized through the Collaborative P2P Clustering algorithm, while the GDC model is realized through the Hierarchically distributed P2P Clustering algorithm. In the former, we show that peer collaboration results in significant increase in local clustering quality. The process utilizes cluster summarization to exchange information between peers. In the latter, we target scalability by structuring the P2P network hierarchically and devise a distributed variant of the k-means algorithm to compute one set of clusters across the hierarchy. We demonstrate through experimental results the effectiveness of both methods and make recommendation on when to use each method.

However, it is more useful to present ratings of product features (such as price, battery, screen, and lens of digital cameras) to help customers make effective purchase decisions. Unfortunately, only a very few web sites have collected feature ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accurately estimate feature ratings of products. This approach selects user reviews that extensively discuss specific features of the products (called specialized reviews), using information distance of reviews on the features. Experiments on both annotated and real data show that overall ratings of the specialized reviews can be used to represent their feature ratings. The average of these overall ratings can be used by recommender systems to provide feature-specific recommendations that can better help users make purchasing decisions.

Spatial rule extraction from spatial data with uncertainty is an important issue in spatial data mining. Rough set theory is an effective tool for rule extraction from data with roughness. In our previous studies, Rough set method has been successfully used in the analysis of social and environmental causes of neural tube birth defects. However, both roughness and fuzziness may co-exist in spatial data because of the complexity of the object and the subjective limitation of human knowledge. The situation of fuzzy decisions, which is often encountered in spatial data, is beyond the capability of classical rough set theory. This paper presents a model based on rough fuzzy sets to extract spatial fuzzy decision rules from spatial data that simultaneously have two types of uncertainties, roughness and fuzziness. Fuzzy entropy and fuzzy cross entropy are used to measure accuracies of the fuzzy decisions on unseen objects using the rules extracted. An example of neural tube birth defects is given in this paper. The identification result from rough fuzzy sets based model was compared with those from two classical rule extraction methods and three commonly used fuzzy set based rule extraction models. The comparison results support that the rule extraction model established is effective in dealing with spatial data which have roughness and fuzziness simultaneously. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Through data mining from published transcriptomic database with further bioinformatic validation, fibronectin (FN1) was identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which implicates the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype (EMT) and promotes metastasis. Given the roles of fibronectin in risk stratification and in the frontline therapeutics of common carcinomas, such as renal cell cancer, we explored fibronectin immunoexpression status and its associations with clinicopathological variables and survival in a well-defined cohort of NPC patients. Fibronectin immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score for 124 biopsy specimens from NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score higher than the median value were regarded as fibronectin overexpression. The findings were correlated with clinicopathological variables, EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) expression, disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Fibronectin overexpression was significantly associated with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages III-IV (p = 0.019) and LMP1 expression (p = 0.004), and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS, DMFS, and LRFS (all p < 0.0001). In the multivariate comparison, fibronectin overexpression still remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.958), DMFS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.728), and LRFS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.411) together with advanced AJCC stages III-IV. Fibronectin is upregulated in a subset of NPCs, and its increased immunoexpression significantly correlated with advanced features, justifying the potentiality of fibronectin as a theragnostic biomaker of NPC.

We have previously observed that in common carp (Cyprinus carpio), administration of P-glucan (MacroGard (R)) as feed additive leads to a lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that this immunostimulant may be preventing an acute and potentially dangerous response to infection, particularly in the gut. However, in general, mechanisms to detect and eliminate pathogens must also be induced in order to achieve an efficient clearance of the infection. Protection against viral diseases acquired through beta-glucan-supplemented feed has been extensively reported for several experimental models in fish but the underlining mechanisms are still unknown. Thus, in order to better characterize the antiviral action induced by beta-glucans in fish, MacroGard was administered daily to common carp in the form of supplemented commercial food pellets. Carp were fed for a period of 25 days prior to intraperitoneal injection with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a well-known double-stranded RNA mimic that triggers a type-I interferon (IFN) response. Subsequently, a set of immune related genes, including mx, were analysed by real-time PCR on liver, spleen, head kidney and mid gut tissues. Results obtained confirmed that treatment with beta-glucan alone generally down-regulated the mRNA expression of selected cytokines when compared to untreated fish, while mx gene expression remained stable or was slightly up-regulated. Injection with poly(I:C) induced a similar down-regulated gene expression pattern for cytokines in samples from beta-glucan fed fish. In contrast, poly(I:C) injection markedly increased mx gene expression in samples from beta-glucan fed fish but hardly in samples from fish fed control feed. In an attempt to explain the high induction of mx, we studied Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene expression in these carp. TLR3 is a prototypical pattern recognition receptor considered important for the binding of viral double-stranded RNA and triggering of a type-I IFN response. Through genome data mining, two sequences for carp tlr3 were retrieved (tlr3.1 and tlr3.2) and characterized. Constitutive gene expression of both tlr3.1 and tlr3.2 was detected by real-time PCR in cDNA of all analysed carp organs. Strikingly, 25 days after beta-glucan feeding, very high levels of tlr3.1 gene expression were observed in all analysed organs, with the exception of the liver. Our data suggest that beta-glucan-mediated protection against viral diseases could be due to an increased TIr3-mediated recognition of ligands, resulting in an increased antiviral activity of Mx.

Protein and gene targets and associated pathways were obtained by data-mining of public databases including the MMDB, PubChem BioAssay, GEO DataSets, and the BioSystems databases. Entrez E-Utilities were applied, and in-house Ruby scripts were developed for data retrieval and pathway analysis to identify and evaluate relevant pathways common to the retrieved drug targets. Pathways pertinent to clinical uses or MOAs were obtained for most drugs. Interestingly, some drugs identified pathways responsible for other diseases than their current therapeutic uses, and these pathways were verified retrospectively by in vitro tests, in vivo tests, or clinical trials. The pathway enrichment analysis based on drug target information from public databases could provide a novel approach for elucidating drug MOAs and repositioning, therefore benefiting the discovery of new therapeutic treatments for diseases.

The prediction of QSAR models in these domains is reliable, and potential subsequent investigations of such compounds would find that the predictions closely match the experimental values. Standard approaches in QSAR assume that predictions are more reliable for compounds that are "similar" to those in subspaces with denser experimental data. Here, we report on a study of an alternative set of techniques recently proposed in the machine learning community. These methods quantify prediction confidence through estimation of the prediction error at the point of interest. Our study includes 20 public QSAR data sets with continuous response and assesses the quality of 10 reliability scoring methods by observing their correlation with prediction error. We show that these new alternative approaches can outperform standard reliability scores that rely only on similarity to compounds in the training set. The results also indicate that the quality of reliability scoring methods in sensitive to data set characteristics and to the regression method used in QSAR. We demonstrate that at the cost of increased computational complexity these dependencies can be leveraged by integration of scores from various reliability estimation approaches. The reliability estimation techniques described in this paper have been implemented in an open source add-on package (https://bitbucket.org/biolab/orange-reliability) to the Orange data mining suite.

C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions in proteins: prevalence, pattern of occurrence, residue propensities, location, and contribution to protein stability	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING			English	Article						C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interaction; Secondary structure elements; Stability; PDB data mining; Solvent accessible surface area (SASA); Adjacency	AMINO-ACID SUBSTITUTIONS; CH/PI HYDROGEN-BOND; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MOLECULAR SIMULATION; BENZENE COMPLEXES; BINDING PROTEINS; DATA-BANK; SPECIFICITY; ENERGETICS; PEPTIDES	C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are a class of non-covalent interactions found in different molecular systems including organic crystals, proteins and nucleic acids. High-resolution protein structures have been analyzed in the present study to delineate various aspects of C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. Additionally, to determine the extent to which redundancy of a database biases the outcome, two datasets differing from each other in the level of redundancy have been analyzed. On average, only one out of six {with C-H(Aro) group} or eight {with C-H(Ali) group} residues in a protein participate as C-H group donors. Neither the frequency of occurrence in proteins nor the number of C-H groups present in it is correlated to the propensity of an amino acid to participate in C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. Most of the residues that participate in C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are solvent-shielded. Solvent shielded nature of most of the C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions and prevalence of intra- as well as inter-secondary structural element C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions suggest that the contribution of these interactions to the enthalpy of folded form will be significant. The separation in the primary structure between donor and acceptor residues is found to be correlated to secondary structure type. Other insights obtained from this study include the presence of networks of C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions spanning multiple secondary structural elements. To our knowledge this has not been reported so far. A substantial number of residues involved in C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are found in catalytic and ligand binding sites suggesting their possible role in maintaining active site geometry. No significant differences of CH center dot center dot center dot pi interactions in the two datasets are found for any of the parameters/features analyzed.

LINEAR DECAYING WEIGHTS FOR TIME SERIES SMOOTHING: AN ANALYSIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aggregation operators; smoothing techniques; time series; data mining	FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; MODELS	In this paper, we investigate the use of weighted averaging aggregation operators as techniques for time series smoothing. We analyze the moving average, exponential smoothing methods, and a new class of smoothing operators based on linearly decaying weights from the perspective of ordered weights averaging to estimate a constant model. We examine two important features associated with the smoothing processes: the average age of the data and the expected variance, both defined in terms of the associated weights. We show that there exists a fundamental conflict between keeping the variance small while using the freshest data. We illustrate the flexibility of the smoothing methods with real datasets; that is, we evaluate the aggregation operators with respect to their minimal attainable variance versus average age. We also examine the efficiency of the smoothed models in time series smoothing, considering real datasets. Good smoothing generally depends upon the underlying method's ability to select appropriate weights to satisfy the criteria of both small variance and recent data.

These records contain abundant knowledge and reflect the clinical experience of TCM doctors. In recent years, with the modernization of TCM clinical practice, these clinical records have begun to be digitized. Data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) methods provide an opportunity for researchers to discover TCM regularities buried in the large volume of clinical records. There has been some work on this problem. Existing methods have been validated on a limited amount of manually well-structured data. However, the contents of most fields in the clinical records are unstructured. As a result, the previous methods verified on the well-structured data will not work effectively on the free-text clinical records (FCRs), and the FCRs are, consequently, required to be structured in advance. Manually structuring the large volume of TCM FCRs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the development of automatic methods for the structuring task is at an early stage. Therefore, in this paper, symptom name recognition (SNR) in the chief complaints, which is one of the important tasks to structure the FCRs of TCM, is carefully studied. The SNR task is reasonably treated as a sequence labeling problem, and several fundamental and practical problems in the SNR task are studied, such as how to adapt a general sequence labeling strategy for the SNR task according to the domain-specific characteristics of the chief complaints and which sequence classifier is more appropriate to solve the SNR task. To answer these questions, a series of elaborate experiments were performed, and the results are explained in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Compass: A hybrid method for clinical and biobank data mining	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data mining; Clinical data; Rule extraction; Self-Organizing Map; Association mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; MEN	We describe a new method for identification of confident associations within large clinical data sets. The method is a hybrid of two existing methods; Self-Organizing Maps and Association Mining. We utilize Self-Organizing Maps as the initial step to reduce the search space, and then apply Association Mining in order to find association rules. We demonstrate that this procedure has a number of advantages compared to traditional Association Mining; it allows for handling numerical variables without a priori binning and is able to generate variable groups which act as "hotspots" for statistically significant associations. We showcase the method on infertility-related data from Danish military conscripts. The clinical data we analyzed contained both categorical type questionnaire data and continuous variables generated from biological measurements, including missing values. From this data set, we successfully generated a number of interesting association rules, which relate an observation with a specific consequence and the p-value for that finding. Additionally, we demonstrate that the method can be used on non-clinical data containing chemical-disease associations in order to find associations between different phenotypes, such as prostate cancer and breast cancer.

Currently, cardiovascular safety represents both a challenging issue for drug developers, regulators, researchers, and clinicians and a concern for patients. While FDA drug labels have captured many of these events, spontaneous reporting systems are a main source for post-marketing drug safety surveillance in 'real-world' (outside of clinical trials) cancer patients. In this study, we present approaches to extracting, prioritizing, filtering, and confirming cardiovascular events associated with targeted cancer drugs from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Data and methods: The dataset includes records of 4,285,097 patients from FAERS. We first extracted drug-cardiovascular event (drug-CV) pairs from FAERS through named entity recognition and mapping processes. We then compared six ranking algorithms in prioritizing true positive signals among extracted pairs using known drug-CV pairs derived from FDA drug labels. We also developed three filtering algorithms to further improve precision. Finally, we manually validated extracted drug-CV pairs using 21 million published MEDLINE records. Results: We extracted a total of 11,173 drug-CV pairs from FAERS. We showed that ranking by frequency is significantly more effective than by the five standard signal detection methods (246% improvement in precision for top-ranked pairs). The filtering algorithm we developed further improved overall precision by 91.3%. By manual curation using literature evidence, we show that about 51.9% of the 617 drug-CV pairs that appeared in both FAERS and MEDLINE sentences are true positives. In addition, 80.6% of these positive pairs have not been captured by FDA drug labeling. Conclusions: The unique drug-CV association dataset that we created based on FAERS could facilitate our understanding and prediction of cardiotoxic events associated with targeted cancer drugs.

In recent years, many studies in data mining and pattern recognition have demonstrated that a learned metric can significantly improve the performance in classification, clustering and retrieval tasks. The paper describes application of the metric learning approach to in silico assessment of chemical liabilities. Chemical liabilities, such as adverse effects and toxicity, play a significant role in drug discovery process, in silico assessment of chemical liabilities is an important step aimed to reduce costs and animal testing by complementing or replacing in vitro and in vivo experiments. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, a distance-based metric learning procedures have been applied for in silico assessment of chemical liabilities, the impact of metric learning on structure-activity landscapes and predictive performance of developed models has been analyzed, the learned metric was used in support vector machines. The metric learning results have been illustrated using linear and non-linear data visualization techniques in order to indicate how the change of metrics affected nearest neighbors relations and descriptor space.

Gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining classifier for medical diagnostic interface	SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						Feature selection; gain ratio; ranking based weight; medical data mining; fuzzy weighted support and confidence; UCI repository		The health care environment still needs knowledge based discovery for handling wealth of data. Extraction of the potential causes of the diseases is the most important factor for medical data mining. Fuzzy association rule mining is well-performed better than traditional classifiers but it suffers from the exponential growth of the rules produced. In the past, we have proposed an information gain based fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and member-ship functions of medical data to reduce the rules. It used a ranking based weight value to identify the potential attribute. When we take a large number of distinct values, the computation of information gain value is not feasible. In this paper, an enhanced approach, called gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining, is thus proposed for distinct diseases and also increase the learning time of the previous one. Experimental results show that there is a marginal improvement in the attribute selection process and also improvement in the classifier accuracy. The system has been implemented in Java platform and verified by using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository.	[Nithya, N.

Mining knowledge from text repositories using information extraction: A review	SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Review						Information extraction (IE); text mining; text repositories; knowledge discovery from database (KDD)		There are two approaches to mining text form online repositories. First, when the knowledge to be discovered is expressed directly in the documents to be mined, Information Extraction (IE) alone can serve as an effective tool for such text mining. Second, when the documents contain concrete data in unstructured form rather than abstract knowledge, Information Extraction (IE) can be used to first transform the unstructured data in the document corpus into a structured database, and then use some state-of-the-art data mining algorithms/tools to identify abstract patterns in this extracted data. This paper presents the review of several methods related to these two approaches.

We present an ML-based methodology for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks, implemented as an R package called machine learning-based differential network analysis (mlDNA) and apply this method to reanalyze a set of abiotic stress expression data in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mlDNA first used a ML-based filtering process to remove nonexpressed, constitutively expressed, or non-stress-responsive "noninformative" genes prior to network construction, through learning the patterns of 32 expression characteristics of known stress-related genes. The retained "informative" genes were subsequently analyzed by ML-based network comparison to predict candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network differences between control and stress networks, based on 33 network topological characteristics. Comparative evaluation of the network-centric and gene-centric analytic methods showed that mlDNA substantially outperformed traditional statistical testing-based differential expression analysis at identifying stress-related genes, with markedly improved prediction accuracy. To experimentally validate the mlDNA predictions, we selected 89 candidates out of the 1784 predicted salt stress-related genes with available SALK T-DNA mutagenesis lines for phenotypic screening and identified two previously unreported genes, mutants of which showed salt-sensitive phenotypes.

Due to its special format, MSE acquisition files cannot be independently analyzed with most widely used open-source proteomic software specialized for processing data-dependent acquisition files. In this study, we established a workflow integrating Skyline, a popular and versatile peptide-centric quantitation program, and a statistical tool DiffProt to fulfill MSE-based proteomic quantitation. Comparison with the vendor software package for analyzing targeted phosphopeptides and global proteomic datasets reveals distinct advantages of Skyline in MSE data mining, including sensitive peak detection, flexible peptide filtering, and transparent step-by-step workflow. Moreover, we developed a new procedure such that Skyline MS1 filtering was extended to small molecule quantitation for the first time. This new utility of Skyline was examined in a protein-ligand interaction experiment to identify multiple chemical compounds specifically bound to NDM-1 (where NDM is New Delhi metallo--lactamase 1), an antibiotics-resistance target. Further improvement of the current weaknesses in Skyline MS1 filtering is expected to enhance the reliability of this powerful program in full scan-based quantitation of both peptides and small molecules.

A bicluster reflects a strong association between a subset of objects and a subset of attributes in a numerical object/attribute data-table. So-called biclusters of similar values can be thought as maximal sub-tables with close values. Only few methods address a complete, correct and non-redundant enumeration of such patterns, a well-known intractable problem, while no formal framework exists. We introduce important links between biclustering and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Indeed, FCA is known to be, among others, a methodology for biclustering binary data. Handling numerical data is not direct, and we argue that Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA), the extension of FCA to ternary relations, provides a powerful mathematical and algorithmic framework for biclustering numerical data. We discuss hence both theoretical and computational aspects on biclustering numerical data with triadic concept analysis. These results also scale to n-dimensional numerical datasets.

This study was to determine the associations of combined lifestyle and other factors with CVD mortality among the elderly (n = 3,257), in Beijing, China, through data mining of the Beijing Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). BLSA is a representative cohort study from 1992 to 2009, hosted by Xuan Wu Hospital. Competing risk survival analysis was conducted to explore the association between risk factors and CVD mortality. The factors focused mainly on lifestyle, physical condition, and the model was adjusted for age and gender. There were 273 of the 1,068 recorded deaths caused by CVD among the 2010 participants. Living in a suburban area (HR = 0.614, 95% CI: 0.410-0.921) was associated with lower CVD mortality. Increasing age (66-75: HR = 1.511, 95% CI: 1.111-2.055; = 76: HR = 1.847, 95% CI: 1.256-2.717), high blood pressure (HR = 1.407, 95% CI: 1.031-1.920), frequent consumption of meat (HR = 1.559, 95% CI: 1.079-2.254) and physical inactivity (p = 0.046) were associated with higher CVD mortality. The study provides an instructional foundation for the control and prevention of CVD in Beijing, China.

Various Ca2+ transporters actively participate to maintain this delicate balance especially during abiotic stresses and developmental events in plants. In this study, we present a genome- wide account, detailing expression profiles, subcellular localization and functional analysis of rice Ca2+ transport elements. Exhaustive in silico data mining and analysis resulted in the identification of 81 Ca2+ transport element genes, which belong to various groups such as Ca2+-ATPases (pumps), exchangers, channels, glutamate receptor homologs and annexins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that different Ca2+ transporters are evolutionarily conserved across different plant species. Comprehensive expression analysis by gene chip microarray and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that a substantial proportion of Ca2+ transporter genes were expressed differentially under abiotic stresses (salt, cold and drought) and reproductive developmental stages (panicle and seed) in rice. These findings suggest a possible role of rice Ca2+ transporters in abiotic stress and development triggered signaling pathways. Subcellular localization of Ca2+ transporters from different groups in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed their variable localization to different compartments, which could be their possible sites of action. Complementation of Ca2+ transport activity of K616 yeast mutant by Ca2+-ATPase OsACA7 and involvement in salt tolerance verified its functional behavior. This study will encourage detailed characterization of potential candidate Ca2+ transporters for their functional role in planta.

One can say that it is not yet well understood how privacy concerns and trust influence social interactions between consumers within social networking sites. That is why, this article presents an exploratory study of perceptions of trust and privacy concern, along with willingness to share information and develop new relationships within two of the most popular social networking sites in Romania, Facebook and LinkedIn. The research shows that organizations must assume greater responsibility in ensuring consumers' safety who sometime neglect protecting their personal information, otherwise confidential. In this respect, the application of ISO 26000 standard recommendations by organizations would allow them to pass from just good intentions towards consumers to good actions, so that they are truly protected. The information was gathered with the help of an online questionnaire, administered to people over 18 years old. It is a very useful and needed tool for Romanian companies, as it presents the users' point of view, allowing them to find the best and most ethical way to do social data mining or use consumers' private information, disclosed on such sites. It is our strong belief that sometimes companies have to play an active part in helping users protect themselves from actually disclosing too much personal information on social networking sites. The paper begins with a summary of relevant research related to social networking sites. Then, the online survey methodology is described and the results presented, followed by limitations and conclusions.

Impact of Uncertainty in Estimation of Shale-Gas-Reservoir and Completion Properties on EUR Forecast and Optimal Development Planning: A Marcellus Case Study	SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING			English	Article								The use of multistage-fractured horizontal wells has made production from shale-gas plays feasible. The production history from these wells is characterized by long linear transient flow. The key reservoir (nature) and completion (nurture) properties that affect flow behavior of the well are permeability, original hydrocarbon in place (OHIP), number of hydraulic fractures, fracture area, and fracture spacing. Understanding the interrelationship between these parameters is critical for optimal development of shale-gas-resource plays. The proposed shale-gas workflow uses a hybrid analytical model. An analytics-based diagnostic process analyzes well performance history, and a numerical model validates the feasible history-match models for representative forecasts. The model results allow the user to capture the range of uncertainty in estimating individual reservoir or completion properties, such as permeability, fracture area, and fracture spacing. The diagnostic process provides the relationship between key factors dictating well performance, such as OHIP, effective fracture area, effective reservoir permeability, effective fracture spacing, and well spacing. In this paper, wells from the Marcellus play in Pennsylvania, USA, are evaluated by use of the proposed shale-gas workflow. Surveillance is an integral part of this workflow. The paper shows how surveillance can be used for resource management and exception management. Along with data mining, the workflow accelerates the learning curve to evaluate the effectiveness of current field practices. The results help with understanding the effectiveness of proppant pumped, the potential number of contributing clusters, and production issues. Continued surveillance reduces the uncertainty surrounding all parameters. This knowledge base can then be used to optimize the asset-development strategy, maximizing the return on investment.

It is widely recognized that this is mainly the result of underreporting in commercially available databases and in databases maintained by national authorities. A factor further signifying this underuse is the evident improper reporting because most data are maintained as textual information requiring significant amounts of time and effort to distill and use the essential characteristics of accidents. Compounded with improved accessibility to an ever increasing amount of historical records, there is a need to develop the means that all the available information from marine accident/incidents is fully used in decision-making during development of new regulations, design, and operation. This article elaborates on the underlying causes for the current unsatisfactory state of affairs and details the description of the structures adopted for the development of appropriate marine accident databases using Bayesian Belief Networks as the platform for translating the information contained in the databases to probabilistic risk-based knowledge-intensive models. The article further explains the use of these models within a risk-based ship design framework, concluding with an example case study of application for fire safety onboard passenger ships.

Five different environmental data sources were considered to develop and test the proposed knowledge recommendation framework called Intelligent Environmental Knowledgebase (i-EKbase); including Bureau of Meteorology SILO, Australian Water Availability Project, Australian Soil Resource Information System, Australian National Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Monitoring Facility, and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Unsupervised clustering techniques based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) and Self-organizing map (SOM) were used to create a 2D colour knowledge map representing the dynamics of the i-EKbase to provide "prior knowledge" about the integrated knowledgebase. Prior availability of recommendations from the knowledge base could potentially optimize the accessibility and usability issues related to big data sets and minimize the overall application costs. RDF representation has made i-EKbase flexible enough to publish and integrate on the Linked Open Data cloud. This newly developed system was evaluated as an expert agricultural decision support for sustainable water resource management case study in Australia at Tasmania with promising results.

J	Evans, MS				Evans, Michael S.			A Computational Approach to Qualitative Analysis in Large Textual Datasets	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BOUNDARY-WORK; SCIENCE; REPRESENTATION; MODELS; TOPICS	In this paper I introduce computational techniques to extend qualitative analysis into the study of large textual datasets. I demonstrate these techniques by using probabilistic topic modeling to analyze a broad sample of 14,952 documents published in major American newspapers from 1980 through 2012. I show how computational data mining techniques can identify and evaluate the significance of qualitatively distinct subjects of discussion across a wide range of public discourse. I also show how examining large textual datasets with computational methods can overcome methodological limitations of conventional qualitative methods, such as how to measure the impact of particular cases on broader discourse, how to validate substantive inferences from small samples of textual data, and how to determine if identified cases are part of a consistent temporal pattern.

J	Tinoco, J; Correia, AG; Cortez, P				Tinoco, Joaquim; Correia, A. Gomes; Cortez, Paulo			A novel approach to predicting Young's modulus of jet grouting laboratory formulations over time using data mining techniques	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Soilcrete; Jet grouting; Young's modulus; Data mining; Support vector machines; Sensitivity analysis	UNIAXIAL COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS	Many geotechnical projects today have demonstrated a need for improved soil foundation properties, namely physical and mechanical properties. There are currently several soil improvement methods available for this task, including jet grouting (JG) technology. In this method, a slurry grout is injected into the subsoil at high pressure and velocity to destroy the soil structure. The injected slurry (normally cement) and the fragmented soil together create an improved soil mass with better strength, deformability and permeability characteristics. However, due to the inherent geological complexity and high number of parameters involved in this improvement process, the design of its physical and mechanical properties is a very complex task, especially in the initial project stages and in small-scale geotechnical projects, when information is scarce. Consequently, the economics and quality of the improvement can be adversely affected, and it would be beneficial to develop an accurate model to simulate the effects of the different parameters involved in the JG process. In many geotechnical structures, advanced design incorporates the ultimate limit state and the serviceability limit state design criteria, for which the uniaxial compressive strength and deformability properties of the improved soils are needed. A previous study by the author proposed some regression models based on data mining (DM) techniques to predict the uniaxial compressive strength of JG laboratory formulations (JGLF) over time. In the present study, similar tools such as multiple regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and functional networks are trained to predict the deformability modulus of JGLF over time. Additionally, the mathematical expressions proposed by the Eurocode 2 and Model Code 1990 that are currently used to estimate concrete stiffness over time are adapted to the JG material. The results show that the novel soft computing model is more accurate and capable of learning the complex relationships between JGLF deformability and its contributing factors. A novel visualisation approach is also applied to the work based on a sensitivity analysis method. Such an approach enables the identification of the most important input parameters and their average influence on deformability predictions for JGLF. Moreover, through the application of DM techniques, a novel approach capable to predict JGLF stiffness based on its unconfined compressive strength and three other variables related to soil and mix properties is proposed.

Even with the emergence of metagenomics, complete circular sequences are rarely identified, and have required manual curation. We propose a robust in silico procedure for identifying complete small plasmids in metagenomic datasets from whole genome shotgun sequencing. From one very pure and exhaustively sequenced metamobilome from rat cecum, we identified a total of 616 circular sequences, 160 of which were carrying a gene with plasmid replication domain. Further homology analyses indicated that the majority of these plasmid sequences are novel. We confirmed the circularity of the complete plasmid candidates using an inverse-type PCR approach on a subset of sequences with 95% success, confirming the existence and length of discrete sequences. The implication of these findings is a broadened understanding of the traits of circular elements in nature and the possibility of massive data mining in existing metagenomic datasets to discover novel pools of complete plasmids thus vastly expanding the current plasmid database.

J	Lee, WC				Lee, Wen-Chung			Detecting and correcting the bias of unmeasured factors using perturbation analysis: a data-mining approach	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Epidemiologic methods; Confounding; Data mining; Effect modification; Bias; Standardization	GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; HIGH-DIMENSION; CONFOUNDER; SIGN	Background: The randomized controlled study is the gold-standard research method in biomedicine. In contrast, the validity of a (nonrandomized) observational study is often questioned because of unknown/unmeasured factors, which may have confounding and/or effect-modifying potential. Methods: In this paper, the author proposes a perturbation test to detect the bias of unmeasured factors and a perturbation adjustment to correct for such bias. The proposed method circumvents the problem of measuring unknowns by collecting the perturbations of unmeasured factors instead. Specifically, a perturbation is a variable that is readily available (or can be measured easily) and is potentially associated, though perhaps only very weakly, with unmeasured factors. The author conducted extensive computer simulations to provide a proof of concept. Results: Computer simulations show that, as the number of perturbation variables increases from data mining, the power of the perturbation test increased progressively, up to nearly 100%. In addition, after the perturbation adjustment, the bias decreased progressively, down to nearly 0%. Conclusions: The data-mining perturbation analysis described here is recommended for use in detecting and correcting the bias of unmeasured factors in observational studies.

Key to the approach is the distinction between what is unexpected from the perspective of the computational data mining process and what is surprising to the domain experts and interesting relative to their needs. We demonstrate the potential of the approach for discovering patterns and generating rich explanations in a clinical domain. Discovering interesting facts in clinical data is a grand challenge, because medical practitioners and clinicians generally have exceptional knowledge in the problem domain in which they work, however, this knowledge is typically difficult to isolate computationally. To identify the desired surprising patterns, we formally record user knowledge and use that knowledge to filter and constrain the output from an objective data mining technique, with the user making the final judgement about whether a rule is surprising. Specifically, we introduce an unexpectedness algorithm based on association rule mining and Bayesian Networks and a E-explanations technique for explanation generation to identify unexpected patterns. An implemented prototype is successfully demonstrated using a large clinical database recording incidence, prevalance, and outcome of dialysis and kidney transplant patients.

QAR-CIP-NSGA-II: A new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to mine quantitative association rules	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Quantitative association rule; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; NSGA-II	GENETIC ALGORITHM; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; SOFTWARE TOOL; DISCRETIZATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; OPTIMIZATION; KEEL; SETS	Some researchers have framed the extraction of association rules as a multi-objective problem, jointly optimizing several measures to obtain a set with more interesting and accurate rules. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective evolutionary model which maximizes the comprehensibility, interestingness and performance of the objectives in order to mine a set of quantitative association rules with a good trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. To accomplish this, the model extends the well-known Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to perform an evolutionary learning of the intervals of the attributes and a condition selection for each rule. Moreover, this proposal introduces an external population and a restarting process to the evolutionary model in order to store all the nondominated rules found and improve the diversity of the rule set obtained. The results obtained over real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we propose a method based on the concept of data mining. We demonstrate that the proposed method can more accurately detect small erroneous deviations in reconstructed density matrices, which contain intrinsic fluctuations due to the limited number of samples, than a naive method of checking the trace distance from the average of the given density matrices. This method has the potential to be a key tool in broad areas of physics where the detection of small deviations of quantum states reconstructed using a limited number of samples is essential.

J	Cohen, R; Aviram, I; Elhadad, M; Elhadad, N				Cohen, Raphael; Aviram, Iddo; Elhadad, Michael; Elhadad, Noemie			Redundancy-Aware Topic Modeling for Patient Record Notes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; FDA DRUG LABELS; PASTE; COPY	The clinical notes in a given patient record contain much redundancy, in large part due to clinicians' documentation habit of copying from previous notes in the record and pasting into a new note. Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, Red-LDA, which takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of Red-LDA, we experiment with three baselines and our novel redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection of patient records, (i) apply vanilla LDA to all documents in all input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing a single representative document for each record as input to LDA; (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to LDA; and (iv) apply Red-LDA to all documents in all input records. Both quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and qualitative assessement of topics carried out by physicians show that Red-LDA produces superior models to all three baseline strategies. This research contributes to the emerging field of understanding the characteristics of the electronic health record and how to account for them in the framework of data mining. The code for the two redundancy-elimination baselines and Red-LDA is made publicly available to the community.

We also analyzed the relationship between symptoms, drugs and therapies with data-excavating technology to aid management. METHODS: After retrieving relevant clinical articles, we set up a database, used Microsoft Structured Query Language Server 2005 Analysis Services as a data-excavating tool, and applied the association rule to study the relationship between the symptoms, drugs and therapies of intestinal diseases. RESULTS: The key symptoms of dyschesia, constipation, abdominal fullness, fatigue and pale tongue could be treated with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis) to invigorate Qi and moisten the intestine. Among these agents, Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) was used most frequently. Clearing Fu-organs was the most prevalent therapy for abdominal fullness, dyschesia, constipation and red tongue. Clearing Fu-organs could be achieved with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), whereas Qi could be invigorated using Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Baizhu (Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). Moistening the intestine was possible with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huomaren (Fructus Cannabis) and Jiegeng (Radix Platycodi). Also, moistening the lungs was done with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), ventilating the lungs with Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) and Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), and nourishing the lungs with Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) and Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum). These data demonstrated that Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum) was a key agent. CONCLUSION: Our analyses of the literature showed clear relationships between symptoms (constipation, dyschesia, abdominal fullness), drugs [Gualou (Fructus et Semen Trichosanthis), Kuxingren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Huangqi (Radix Astragali Mongolici)] and therapies (moistening the intestine, clearing Fu-organs, invigorating Qi, ventilating the lungs).

J	Vihinen, M				Vihinen, Mauno			Variation ontology: annotator guide	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article						Variation ontology; Annotation instructions; Systematics; Variation effects; Mutation; Ontology	MUTATION DATABASES; PROTEIN; TOOL	Background: Systematic representation of information related to genetic and non-genetic variations is required to allow large scale studies, data mining and data integration, and to make it possible to reveal novel relationships between genotype and phenotype. Although lots of variation data is available it is often difficult to use due to lack of systematics. Results: A novel ontology, Variation Ontology (VariO http://variationontology.org), was developed for annotation of effects, consequences and mechanisms of variations. In this article instructions are provided on how VariO annotations are made. The major levels for description are the three molecules, namely DNA, RNA and protein. They are further divided to four major sublevels: variation type, function, structure, and property, and further up to eight sublevels. VariO annotation summarizes existing knowledge about a variation and its effects and formalizes it so that computational analyses are efficient. The annotations should be made on as many levels as possible. VariO annotations are made in reference to normal states, which vary for each data item including e. g. reference sequences, wild type properties, and activities. Conclusions: Detailed instructions together with examples are provided to indicate how VariO can be used for annotation of variations and their effects. A dedicated tool has been developed for annotation and will be further developed to cover also evidence for the annotations. VariO is suitable for annotation of data in many types of databases. As several different kinds of databases are in a process of adapting VariO annotations it is important to have guidelines to guarantee consistent annotation.

In order to uncover the molecular nature of the emergent properties of a cell, it is essential to measure multiple-cell components simultaneously in the same cell. In turn, cell heterogeneity requires multiple-cells to be measured in order to understand health and disease in the organism. This review summarizes current efforts towards a data-driven framework that leverages single-cell technologies to build robust signatures of healthy and diseased phenotypes. While some approaches focus on multicolor flow cytometry data and other methods are designed to analyze high-content image-based screens, we emphasize the so-called Supercell/SVM paradigm (recently developed by the authors of this review and collaborators) as a unified framework that captures mesoscopic-scale emergence to build reliable phenotypes. Beyond their specific contributions to basic and translational biomedical research, these efforts illustrate, from a larger perspective, the powerful synergy that might be achieved from bringing together methods and ideas from statistical physics, data mining, and mathematics to solve the most pressing problems currently facing the life sciences.

Automated Detection of Off-Label Drug Use	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; GENE-EXPRESSION OMNIBUS; CLINICAL TEXT; DOUBLE-BLIND; PPAR-GAMMA; SAFETY; EFFICACY; TRIAL; DISEASE; PHASE	Off-label drug use, defined as use of a drug in a manner that deviates from its approved use defined by the drug's FDA label, is problematic because such uses have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy. Studies estimate that 21% of prescriptions are off-label, and only 27% of those have evidence of safety and efficacy. We describe a data-mining approach for systematically identifying off-label usages using features derived from free text clinical notes and features extracted from two databases on known usage (Medi-Span and DrugBank). We trained a highly accurate predictive model that detects novel off-label uses among 1,602 unique drugs and 1,472 unique indications. We validated 403 predicted uses across independent data sources. Finally, we prioritize well-supported novel usages for further investigation on the basis of drug safety and cost.

We also predict battery reliability using cluster analysis. A strategy for enhancing the reliability of lithium iron phosphate batteries is proposed based on a statistical analysis and study of the macromechanism of product failures. We show in practice that the average life cycle of a battery is increased by 45.5% after adopting a new strategy that we suggest. The strategy is effective for mass-producing reliable lithium iron phosphate batteries and instructive for improving the industry of lithium iron phosphate battery production, as well as the quality of its products.

Significance analysis applied to manufacturing process parameters can be a useful tool in fault diagnosis for various types of manufacturing processes. It can also be applied to building models that are used in process control. The relative significances of input variables can be determined by various data mining methods, including relatively simple statistical procedures as well as more advanced machine learning systems. Several methodologies suitable for carrying out classification tasks which are characteristic of fault diagnosis were evaluated and compared from the viewpoint of their accuracy, robustness of results and applicability. Two types of testing data were used: synthetic data with assumed dependencies and real data obtained from the foundry industry. The simple statistical method based on contingency tables revealed the best overall performance, whereas advanced machine learning models, such as ANNs and SVMs, appeared to be of less value.

In doing so, an organization's limited resources can be intelligently allocated with the goal of detecting and correcting the greatest number of faults. However, there are two characteristics of software quality datasets that can negatively impact the effectiveness of these models: class imbalance and class noise. Software quality datasets are, by their nature, imbalanced. That is, most of a software system's faults can be found in a small percentage of software modules. Therefore, the number of fault-prone, fp, examples (program modules) in a software project dataset is much smaller than the number of not fault-prone, nfp, examples. Data sampling techniques attempt to alleviate the problem of class imbalance by altering a training dataset's distribution. A program module contains class noise if it is incorrectly labeled. While several studies have been performed to evaluate data sampling methods, the impact of class noise on these techniques has not been adequately addressed. This work presents a systematic set of experiments designed to investigate the impact of both class. noise and class imbalance on classification models constructed to identify fault-prone program modules. We analyze the impact of class noise and class imbalance on 11 different learning algorithms (learners) as well as 7 different data sampling techniques. We identify which learners and which data sampling techniques are most robust when confronted with noisy and imbalanced data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A new tool to squeeze data from separation techniques-mass spectrometry couplings	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Symposium on Electro- and Liquid Phase-Separation Techniques (ITP)	OCT 06-09, 2013	Puerto de la Cruz, SPAIN			Centergram; Chemometry; Data mining; Improved efficiency; Representation	OVERLAPPED CHROMATOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; CAPILLARY-ZONE-ELECTROPHORESIS; PEAK DETECTION; AUTOMATIC PROGRAM; MS; DECONVOLUTION; NORMALIZATION; ALGORITHMS	In separation techniques hyphenated to mass spectrometry (MS) the bulk from the separation step is continuously flowing into the mass spectrometer where the compounds, arriving at each separation time, are ionized and further separated based on their m/z ratio. An MS detector is recognized as being a universal detector, although it can also be a very selective instrument. In spite of these advantages, classical two dimensional representations from these hyphenated systems, such as those based on the base peak of electropherogram/chromatogram or on the total ion of electropherogram/chromatogram, usually hide a large number of features that if correctly assessed will show the presence of co-migrating species and/or the low abundant ones. The uses of peak picking algorithms to detect and measure as many peaks as possible from a dataset allow extracting much more information. However, a single migrating compound usually produces a multiplicity of ions, making difficult to differentiate peaks generated by the same compound from other peaks due e.g., to closely co-migrating/eluting species. In this work, a new representation is proposed and its usefulness demonstrated with experimental data from capillary electrophoresis-hyphenated to a time of flight mass spectrometer via an electrospray interface. This representation, called centergram, is obtained after using a peak picking methodology that detects electrophoretic peaks of single ions and measure their positions. The centergram is the histogram (i.e. the count of the number of observations that fall into each one of the intervals, known as bins, as determined by the user) of the measured positions. The intensity of the bars in this histogram will indicate the amount of peaks in the whole dataset whose centers are within each interval. As a compound that has been separated and has entered the MS instrument will produce multiple images at the same position along the m/z dimension, the centergram will exhibit a series of intense bars around the migration time. Those bars will allow defining a centergram peak whose area will be proportional to the number of different types of ions that have been generated in the ionization chamber, the position will be equal to the migration/retention time of the parent compounds and the width will depend on the precision in the measurement of the peak positions. The efficiency of this peak is determined to be up to thirty times higher than the equivalent peak in the classical base peak electropherogram allowing detecting easily co-migrating peaks or the presence of compounds at very low abundance. The number of peaks detected by using this new tool called centergram was increased by more than a factor of 3 compared to the standard representations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motivated by the importance of these themes which are generally interrelated, we propose a statistical framework for simultaneous online clustering and feature selection using finite generalized Dirichlet mixture model. The proposed framework allows to control overfitting by, dynamically and simultaneously, adjusting the mixture model's parameters, number of components and the features weights. We describe a principled variational approach for learning the parameters of the proposed statistical model. Results on both synthetic data and real applications involving online documents and images clustering show the merits of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Iterative weighting of multiblock data in the orthogonal partial least squares framework	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Data fusion; Multiblock analysis; Iterative weighting; Common components and specific weights analysis; Orthogonal partial least squares	DATA FUSION; PLS REGRESSION; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; BINDING-SITES; PROJECTIONS; FLAVONOIDS; COMPONENTS; MODELS; OPLS	The integration of multiple data sources has emerged as a pivotal aspect to assess complex systems comprehensively. This new paradigm requires the ability to separate common and redundant from specific and complementary information during the joint analysis of several data blocks. However, inherent problems encountered when analysing single tables are amplified with the generation of multiblock datasets. Finding the relationships between data layers of increasing complexity constitutes therefore a challenging task. In the present work, an algorithm is proposed for the supervised analysis of multiblock data structures. It associates the advantages of interpretability from the orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) framework and the ability of common component and specific weights analysis (CCSWA) to weight each data table individually in order to grasp its specificities and handle efficiently the different sources of Y-orthogonal variation. Three applications are proposed for illustration purposes. A first example refers to a quantitative structure-activity relationship study aiming to predict the binding affinity of flavonoids toward the P-glycoprotein based on physicochemical properties. A second application concerns the integration of several groups of sensory attributes for overall quality assessment of a series of red wines. A third case study highlights the ability of the method to combine very large heterogeneous data blocks from Omics experiments in systems biology. Results were compared to the reference multiblock partial least squares (MBPLS) method to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of predictive ability and model interpretability. In all cases, ComDim-OPLS was demonstrated as a relevant data mining strategy for the simultaneous analysis of multiblock structures by accounting for specific variation sources in each dataset and providing a balance between predictive and descriptive purpose.

J	Song, IK				Song, In Kuk			Emerging Internet Technology & Service toward Korean Government 3.0	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Government 3.0; e-Government; Social Media; Big Data; Emerging Technology; Internet Applications; ICT Policy		Recently a new government has announced an action plan known as the government 3.0, which aims to provide customized services for individual people, generate more jobs and support creative economy. Leading on from previous similar initiatives, the new scheme seeks to focus on open, share, communicate, and collaborate. In promoting Government 3.0, the crucial factor might be how to align the core services and policies of Government 3.0 with correspoding technologies. The paper describes the concepts and features of Government 3.0, identifies emerging Internet-based technologies and services toward the initiative, and finally provides improvement plans for Government 3.0. As a result, 10 issues to be brought together include: Smart Phone Applications and Service, Mobile Internet Computing and Application, Wireless and Sensor Network, Security & Privacy in Internet, Energy-efficient Computing & Smart Grid, Multimedia & Image Processing, Data Mining and Big Data, Software Engineering, Internet Business related Policy, and Management of Internet Application.

Extracting and tracking the various attitudes and concerns that people express through social media could enable us to categorize brands and decipher individuals' cognitive decision-making structure in their choice of brands. We investigate the cognitive network structure of consumers by building an inter-category map through the mining of big data. In so doing, we create an improved online recommendation model. Building on economic sociology theory, we suggest a framework for revealing collective preference by analyzing the patterns of brand names that users frequently mention in the online public sphere. We expect that our study will be useful for those conducting theoretical research on digital marketing strategies and doing practical work on branding strategies.

Statistical classification methods, however, are affected by the characteristics of the data under study. Statistical classification can be further complicated by initial misclassification of the observed groups. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of initial training data misclassification on several statistical classification and data mining techniques. Misclassification conditions in the three group case will be simulated and results will be presented in terms of overall as well as subgroup classification accuracy. Results show decreased classification accuracy as sample size, group separation and group size ratio decrease and as misclassification percentage increases with random forests demonstrating the highest accuracy across conditions.

In this article, we propose a dynamically growing contrast pattern tree (DGCP-tree) structure to store grown patterns and their path codes arrays with 1-bit counts, which are from the constructed bit string compression tree. A method of mining SJEPs based on DGCP-tree is developed. In order to reduce the pattern search space, we introduce a novel pattern pruning method, which dramatically reduces non-minimal jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) during the mining process. Experiments are performed on three real cancer datasets and three datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine-learning repository. Compared with the well-known CP-tree method, the results show that the proposed method is substantially faster, able to handle higher-dimensional datasets and to prune more non-minimal JEPs.

The method is able to consistently select and estimate the main effects even when strong correlations are present. In addition, the potential pitfall of time-dependent covariates is clarified. Both asymptotic theory and simulation results reveal the effectiveness of penalization as a data mining tool for longitudinal data, especially when a large number of variables is present. The method is illustrated by mining for the main determinants of life expectancy in Europe. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The focus of this work is different: we aim at detecting noisy instances for improved data understanding, data cleaning and outlier identification. The paper is composed of three parts. The first part presents an ensemble-based noise ranking methodology for explicit noise and outlier identification, named Noise- Rank, which was successfully applied to a real-life medical problem as proven in domain expert evaluation. The second part is concerned with quantitative performance evaluation of noise detection algorithms on data with randomly injected noise. A methodology for visual performance evaluation of noise detection algorithms in the precision-recall space, named Viper, is presented and compared to standard evaluation practice. The third part presents the implementation of the NoiseRank and Viper methodologies in a web-based platform for composition and execution of data mining workflows. This implementation allows public accessibility of the developed approaches, repeatability and sharing of the presented experiments as well as the inclusion of web services enabling to incorporate new noise detection algorithms into the proposed noise detection and performance evaluation workflows.

J	Kim, M				Kim, Minyoung			Conditional ordinal random fields for structured ordinal-valued label prediction	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Conditional random fields; Structured label prediction; Ordinal regression; Probabilistic models	FACIAL EXPRESSION; REGRESSION	Predicting labels of structured data such as sequences or images is a very important problem in statistical machine learning and data mining. The conditional random field (CRF) is perhaps one of the most successful approaches for structured label prediction via conditional probabilistic modeling. In such models, it is traditionally assumed that each label is a random variable from a nominal category set (e.g., class categories) where all categories are symmetric and unrelated from one another. In this paper we consider a different situation of ordinal-valued labels where each label category bears a particular meaning of preference or order. This setup fits many interesting problems/datasets for which one is interested in predicting labels that represent certain degrees of intensity or relevance. We propose a fairly intuitive and principled CRF-like model that can effectively deal with the ordinal-scale labels within an underlying correlation structure. Unlike standard log-linear CRFs, learning the proposed model incurs non-convex optimization. However, the new model can be learned accurately using efficient gradient search. We demonstrate the improved prediction performance achieved by the proposed model on several intriguing sequence/image label prediction tasks.

This problem has been recently reconsidered as a new task in data mining, renamed quantification when the estimation is performed as an aggregation (and possible adjustment) of a single-instance supervised model (e.g., a classifier). However, the study of quantification has been limited to classification, while it is clear that this problem also appears, perhaps even more frequently, with other predictive problems, such as regression. In this case, the goal is to determine a distribution or an aggregated indicator of the output variable for a new unlabelled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive new taxonomy of quantification tasks, distinguishing between the estimation of the whole distribution and the estimation of some indicators (summary statistics), for both classification and regression. This distinction is especially useful for regression, since predictions are numerical values that can be aggregated in many different ways, as in multi-dimensional hierarchical data warehouses. We focus on aggregative quantification for regression and see that the approaches borrowed from classification do not work. We present several techniques based on segmentation which are able to produce accurate estimations of the expected value and the distribution of the output variable. We show experimentally that these methods especially excel for the relevant scenarios where training and test distributions dramatically differ.

In this paper, we propose a new mining algorithm, NTK, to mining Top-Rank-k frequent patterns. The NTK algorithm employs a data structure, Node-list, to represent patterns. The Node-list structure makes the mining process much efficient. We have experimentally evaluated our algorithm against two representative algorithms on four real datasets. The experimental results show that the NTK algorithm is efficient and is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the FAE algorithm and also remarkably faster than the VTK algorithm, the recently reported state-of-the-art algorithm for mining Top-Rank-k frequent patterns.

Rafiqul; Lachiche, Nicolas			Mining frequent correlated graphs with a new measure	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Correlated patterns; Graph mining	DATA STREAMS; DATABASES; PATTERNS; SUBGRAPHS; ALGORITHM; SEARCH	Correlation mining is recognized as one of the most important data mining tasks for its capability to identify underlying dependencies between objects. On the other hand, graph-based data mining techniques are increasingly applied to handle large datasets due to their capability of modeling various non-traditional domains representing real-life complex scenarios such as social/computer networks, map/spatial databases, chemical-informatics domain, bio-informatics, image processing and machine learning. To extract useful knowledge from large amount of spurious patterns, correlation measures are used. Nonetheless, existing graph based correlation mining approaches are unable to capture effective correlations in graph databases. Hence, we have concentrated on graph correlation mining and proposed a new graph correlation measure, gConfidence, to discover more useful graph patterns. Moreover, we have developed an efficient algorithm, CGM (Correlated Graph Mining), to find the correlated graphs in graph databases. The performance of our scheme was extensively analyzed in several real-life and synthetic databases based on runtime and memory consumption, then compared with existing graph correlation mining algorithms, which proved that CGM is scalable with respect to required processing time and memory consumption and outperforms existing approaches by a factor of two in speed of mining correlations.

A.; Strachan, Rebecca			Hybrid decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers for multi-class classification tasks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Hybrid; Decision tree; Naive Bayes classifier	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION	In this paper, we introduce two independent hybrid mining algorithms to improve the classification accuracy rates of decision tree (DT) and nave Bayes (NB) classifiers for the classification of multi-class problems. Both DT and NB classifiers are useful, efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease, in our first proposed hybrid DT algorithm, we employ a nave Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the DT induction. Moreover, it is extremely computationally expensive for a NB classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes. Thus, in the second proposed hybrid NB classifier, we employ a DT induction to select a comparatively more important subset of attributes for the production of nave assumption of class conditional independence. We tested the performances of the two proposed hybrid algorithms against those of the existing DT and NB classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods have produced impressive results in the classification of real life challenging multi-class problems. They are also able to automatically extract the most valuable training datasets and identify the most effective attributes for the description of instances from noisy complex training databases with large dimensions of attributes.

This algorithm is based on the following basic hypothesis: the high-dimensional input feature space can be preliminarily restricted to only the important features. In this preliminary restriction, fast algorithms for feature ranking and earlier experience are used. Additionally, enhancements are made in the creation of the initial population, as well as by introducing an incremental stage in the genetic algorithm. The performances of the proposed HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using a real-world credit dataset that is collected at a Croatian bank, and the findings are further validated on another real-world credit dataset that is selected in a UCI database. The classification accuracy is compared with that presented in the literature. Experimental results that were achieved using the proposed novel HGA-NN classifier are promising for feature selection and classification in retail credit risk assessment and indicate that the HGA-NN classifier is a promising addition to existing data mining techniques.

Disjunctive emerging patterns are sets of features that are very frequent among samples of a target class, cases in a case-control study, for example, and are very rare among all other samples. We, for the very first time, demonstrate that this problem can be solved using minimal transversals in a hypergraph. We propose a new divide-and-conquer algorithm that enables us to efficiently compute disjunctive emerging patterns in parallel and distributed environments. We conducted experiments using real-world microarray gene expression datasets to assess the performance of our approach. Our results show that our approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art solution available in the literature. In this sense, we contribute to the area of bioinformatics and data mining by providing another useful alternative to identify patterns distinguishing samples with different class labels, such as those in case-control studies, for example.

J	Ouchi, K; Nakamura, A; Kudo, M				Ouchi, Koji; Nakamura, Atsuyoshi; Kudo, Mineichi			An efficient construction and application usefulness of rectangle greedy covers	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Greedy cover; Axis-parallel hyperrectangle; Classification; Data mining	ALGORITHM	We develop efficient construction methods of a rectangle greedy cover (RGC), and evaluate its usefulness in applications. An RGC is a greedy cover of the set of given positive instances by exclusive axis-parallel hyperrectangles, namely, axis-parallel hyperrectangles that exclude all the given negative instances. An RGC is expected to be a compact classification rule with high readability because the number of its component rectangles is expected to be small and it can be seen as a disjunctive normal form, which is one of the most readable representations for us. We propose two approaches of RGC construction: enumeration approach and direct approach. In enumeration approach, the maximal exclusive positive subsets (MEPSs) are enumerated first and then an ordinary greedy set covering is done using the enumerated MEPSs. We make clear the relation between enumeration of the maximal frequent itemsets and enumeration of the MEPSs, and convert an efficient enumeration algorithm LCMmax [1] of maximal frequent itemsets to an enumeration algorithm LCMmax.R-naive of MEPSs. We also develop a more efficient version of LCMmax.R-naive, or LCMmax.R, by incorporating effective dynamic reordering of instances using excluded frequency and bit-parallel exclusiveness check. In direct approach, each component MEPS of an RGC is searched not from enumerated MEPSs but directly from the dataset that consists of the remaining uncovered positive instances and the whole negative instances. We developed an algorithm called MRF that efficiently finds an maximum-sized MEPS for given positive and negative instances. MRF is made from LCMmax.R by modifying it so as to find a maximum-sized MEPS only. An RGC is constructed by MRF repetition, that is, by repeatedly executing MRF using the remaining uncovered positive instances. According to our experimental evaluation using UCI-repository datasets, LCMmax.R was about 5-11 times faster than LCMmax.Rnaive, which indicates effectiveness of the introduced two improvements. MRF repetition, however, was significantly faster than LCMmax.R, and it was fast enough for practical usage. The experimental results using UCI-repository datasets also showed that accuracy of a nearest rectangle classifier using an RGC is close to that using the hyperrectangles output by the randomized subclass method (RSM) [2] though the number of component rectangles of an RGC is significantly smaller than the number of the hyperrectangles output by RSM. The performance of RGC was also shown to be comparable to that of the six popular classifiers including logistic regression and support vector machine. The disjunctive normal form representation of the classification rules obtained by RGC was demonstrated to be simpler and more readable for us than that obtained by RSM and C4.5.

Ensemble methods for advanced skier days prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ensemble learning; Data mining; Forecasting; Skier days	NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME-SERIES; STACKED GENERALIZATION; TOURISM; WEATHER	The tourism industry has long utilized statistical and time series analysis, as well as machine learning techniques to forecast leisure activity demand. However, there has been limited research and application of ensemble methods with respect to leisure demand prediction. The research presented in this paper appears to be the first to compare the predictive power of ensemble models developed from multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN), utilizing local, regional, and national data to model skier days. This research also concentrates on skier days prediction at a micro as opposed to a macro level where most of the tourism applications of machine learning techniques have occurred. While the ANN model accuracy improvements over the MLR and CART models were expected, the significant accuracy improvements attained by the ensemble models are notable. This research extends and generalizes previous ensemble methods research by developing new models for skier days prediction using data from a ski resort in the state of Utah, United States.

Based on similarities between the process of extracting reservoirs operating rules and the self-adaptive learning behavior of antibody to antigens in the human immune system, a novel reservoir operating rule extraction architecture is proposed. By using the established co-evolution artificial immune system model (Co-EAISM), a case study of a single water-supply reservoir to provide water consumption for municipals, industries and agricultural irrigation is also presented. Twenty four rules are obtained eventually via Co-EAISM after 500 generations. It is demonstrated that they can identify 92.5% of the training samples and 84.4% of the testing samples, while obtaining the shortage index 2.23(10(14) m(6)) between the predicted and practical release during the testing, which are beyond those by using Radius Basis Function (RBF) as a data mining technology for extracting water-supply reservoir operating rules. Three aspects of operating rule diversity, generality and non-linear division are discussed, considering behaviors, performances and impact factors of the Co-EAISM over the evolution. Through the modeling data and the presented case study, the proposed model has some benefits: (a) it is feasible and effective for self-adaptively extracting the reservoir operating rules to provide a novel route for reservoir operation management; (b) it can self-adaptively track the rules, adjust the population of the rules in corresponding to complex operation environment, and make reasonable release decisions; (c) it drives the rules diversity emergence to capture many niches composed of the operating samples with similar operating attributes, to achieve the non-linear division of the operating samples in the binary space, which helps to acquire the spatial distributions of samples and gain the reservoir operation experience; (d) it can also explore the binary space to deal with subsequent complex changes of the operation environment via the character "#" in the schemas of the rules, and furthermore provide sufficient decision-making information in view of the physical meanings of the gene schemas contained in the rules.

In recent years, clustering all companies in the stock markets based on their similarities in the shape of the stock market has increasingly become a common scheme. However, existing approaches are impractical because the stock price data are high-dimensional data and the changes in the stock price usually occur with shift, which makes the categorization more complex. Moreover, no stock market categorization method that can cluster companies down to the sub-cluster level, which are very meaningful to end users, has been developed. Therefore, in this paper, a novel three-phase clustering model is proposed to categorize companies based on the similarity in the shape of their stock markets. First, low-resolution time series data are used to approximately categorize companies. Then, in the second phase, pre-clustered companies are split into some pure sub-clusters. Finally, sub-clusters are merged in the third phase. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using various published data sets in different domains. We show that this approach has good performance in efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing conventional clustering algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By exploiting a taxonomy, patterns are usually extracted at any level of abstraction. However, some misleading high-level patterns could be included in the mined set. This paper proposes a novel generalized itemset type, namely the Misleading Generalized Itemset (MGI). Each MGI, denoted as X (sic) epsilon, represents a frequent generalized itemset X and its set epsilon of low-level frequent descendants for which the correlation type is in contrast to the one of X. To allow experts to analyze the misleading high-level data correlations separately and exploit such knowledge by making different decisions, MGIs are extracted only if the low-level descendant itemsets that represent contrasting correlations cover almost the same portion of data as the high-level (misleading) ancestor. An algorithm to mine MGIs at the top of traditional generalized itemsets is also proposed. The experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, as result of the selection and analysis of 240 EDM works, an EDM work profile was compiled to describe 222 EDM approaches and 18 tools. A profile of the EDM works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of EDM approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict EDM approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the EDM approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed EDM works, and provides an analysis of the EDM strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled.

Filtering all the pertinent feature information to support the clinical disease diagnosis is a challenging and time consuming task. The objective of this research is to diagnose breast cancer based on the extracted tumor features. Feature extraction and selection are critical to the quality of classifiers founded through data mining methods. To extract useful information and diagnose the tumor, a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine (K-SVM) algorithms is developed. The K-means algorithm is utilized to recognize the hidden patterns of the benign and malignant tumors separately. The membership of each tumor to these patterns is calculated and treated as a new feature in the training model. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to obtain the new classifier to differentiate the incoming tumors. Based on 10-fold cross validation, the proposed methodology improves the accuracy to 97.38%, when tested on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set from the University of California - Irvine machine learning repository. Six abstract tumor features are extracted from the 32 original features for the training phase. The results not only illustrate the capability of the proposed approach on breast cancer diagnosis, but also shows time savings during the training phase. Physicians can also benefit from the mined abstract tumor features by better understanding the properties of different types of tumors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We analyze the logs from a game-based learning system used in a massively multiplayer online tournament. Students had to detect an input-output pattern across 20 rounds. For each round, they received an input and had 2 minutes to predict the output by selecting a binary option (2 points if correct, -1 otherwise), or writing a model (4 points if model prediction was correct, -4 otherwise), or refraining (1 point). Thousands of 3rd to 10th grade students from hundreds of schools simultaneously played together on the web. We identified different types of players using cluster analysis. From 5th grade onwards, we found a cluster of students that wrote models with correct predictions. Half of the 7th to 10th grade students that detected patterns were able to express them with models. The analysis also shows diffusion within the teams of modeling strategies for simple patterns.

These components offer specific functionalities such as image recognition, time series analysis, and forecasting but may not satisfy the non-functional constraints of the software products. It is difficult to identify suitable learning algorithms for a particular task and software product because the non-functional requirements of the product affect algorithm suitability. A particular suitability evaluation may thus require the assessment of multiple criteria to analyse trade-offs between functional and non-functional requirements. For this purpose, we present a method for APPlication-Oriented Validation and Evaluation (APPrOVE). This method comprises four sequential steps that address the stated evaluation problem. The method provides a common ground for different stakeholders and enables a multi-expert and multi-criteria evaluation of machine learning algorithms prior to inclusion in software products. Essentially, the problem addressed in this article concerns how to choose the appropriate machine learning component for a particular software product.

Non face-to-face educational models, like e-learning (electronic learning), evolved in order to offer such flexibility. E-learning systems have major strengths but also pose major challenges to the educational community. One such challenge is the large spatial and temporal gap between the teacher and student, which is an obstacle to student follow-up by teachers. The information generated by virtual learning systems sometimes overwhelms instructors who are unable to process the data without the support of special-purpose techniques and tools that are useful for analysing large dataflows.

The expression of CKS1B protein and its clinicopathological associations in patients with NPC were further evaluated. Immunoexpression of CKS1B was retrospectively assessed in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and treated with consistent guidelines. The correlations between CKS1B immunoexpression levels and clinicopathological features, as well as patient survivals, were analyzed. High CKS1B expression (49.2%) was correlated with the 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p=0.014). In multivariate analyses, high CKS1B expression emerged as an independent prognostic factor for worse disease-specific survival (p<0.001), metastasis-free survival (p<0.001), and local recurrence-free survival (p=0.001). High expression of CKS1B is common and associated with adverse prognostic factors and might confer tumor aggressiveness through dysregulation of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (intrinsic regulatory activity) during cell cycle progression.

J	Ahmad, I				Ahmad, Iftikhar			Enhancing MLP Performance in Intrusion Detection using Optimal Feature Subset Selection based on Genetic Principal Components	APPLIED MATHEMATICS & INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); Principal Component Analysis (PCA); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Genetic Principal Component (GPC); Detection Rate (DR); False Positive (FP); False Negative (FN); True Negative (TN); True Positive (TP) and Dataset	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PCA	Computer and network systems nowadays are facing many security issues, one of which considered important is intrusion. To prevent such intrusion, a mechanism for optimal intrusion detection is deemed necessary. A number of tools and techniques are available, yet most of them still face a main problem that is on performance. The performance, in essence, can be increased by reducing false positives and increasing accurate detection rate. What has made the performance terrible in the existing intrusion detection approaches is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy and leads the classifier to be confused. To overcome this issue, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to project a number of raw features on principal feature space and to select the features based on their sensitivity determined by the magnitude of eigenvalues. Here, only the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues are selected; the remaining features, by contrast, are ignored. Due to the ignorance of many important and sensitive features for the classifier for their lowest eigenvalues, this method comes to be not optimal. Therefore, a suitable method is necessary to select a subset of features, which, in turn, can enhance the classifier performance. The focus of this research is to observe a space of principal features to find a subset of sensitive features to the classifier, which can optimize the detection accuracy. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been applied to solve an optimization problem. The raw features have, afterwards, been transformed through PCA into principal features space. GA, in this case, was used to search this features space to obtain principal components called genetic principal components (GPC). The feature set obtained through this process was, in turn, presented to the classifier. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), meanwhile, was used for classification considering its proven ability. Additionally, Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) cup dataset was used for the validation of the proposed approach, which is considered as a benchmark to evaluate the intrusion detection approaches. The performance of this approach has been analyzed and compared with a number of existing approaches. The results then show that proposed method outperforms the existing approaches. Not only does it significantly reduce the dimension of the feature space but also improves the detection accuracy.

This problem belongs to the open questions of the contemporary emerging discipline Educational Data Mining. We are concerned with the access probabilities to the individual parts of e-learning course content. For the purpose of modelling of the stakeholders' behaviour dependence on time, we use multinominal logit model which is a special case of Generalized Linear Model. We pay attention to data preparation issues. Data about using e-learning courses are stored in databases. We assume that these data represent time data. Surprisingly, modelling of stakeholders' behaviour dependence on time is missing in Educational Data Mining discipline. The time variable, mostly stored in database in "unixtime" form, integrating date and time, is partially used by sequence rules extraction, where it is only used for the tracking of visited e-learning course parts during each session. Therefore, we describe the applied multinominal logit model and methodology of the modelling in detail. We deal with parameter estimations. Finally, we figure that the multinomial logit model finds its application mainly in the process of restructuring the existing e-learning courses. We discuss about its possible contribution to the improvement of the interactive learning environment as well as in the personalization of the course content and structure.

The algorithms for mining association rules are used to reveal biologically relevant associations between different genes under different experimental samples. This paper presents a new column-enumeration based method algorithm (abbreviated by MCR-Miner) for mining maximal high confidence association rules for up/down-expressed genes. MCR-Miner algorithm uses an efficient maximal association rules tree data structure (abbreviated by MAR-Tree). MAR-tree enumerates (lists) all genes with their binary representations, the binary representation of a gene saves the status (normal, up, and down-expressed) of a gene in all experiments. The binary representation has many advantages, scan the dataset only once, the measurements of confidences for association rules are made in one step, and it makes MCR-Miner algorithm easily finds all maximal high confidence association rules. In the experimental results on a real microarray datasets, MCR-Miner algorithm attained very promising results and outperformed other counterparts.

In this paper, we identify a cloud computing application scenario that requires simultaneously performing secure watermark detection and privacy preserving multimedia data storage. We then propose a compressive sensing (CS)-based framework using secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols to address such a requirement. In our framework, the multimedia data and secret watermark pattern are presented to the cloud for secure watermark detection in a CS domain to protect the privacy. During CS transformation, the privacy of the CS matrix and the watermark pattern is protected by the MPC protocols under the semi-honest security model. We derive the expected watermark detection performance in the CS domain, given the target image, watermark pattern, and the size of the CS matrix (but without the CS matrix itself). The correctness of the derived performance has been validated by our experiments. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that secure watermark detection in the CS domain is feasible. Our framework can also be extended to other collaborative secure signal processing and data-mining applications in the cloud.

In such domains, the information related to each object under analysis may be composed of a very broad set of interrelated data instead of being represented by a simple attribute table. This further complicates their analysis. Objective: It is becoming more and more necessary to model data before analysis in order to assure that they are properly understood, stored and later processed. On this ground, we have proposed a UML extension that is able to represent any set of structurally complex hierarchically ordered data. Conceptually modelled data are human comprehensible and constitute the starting point for automating other data analysis tasks, such as comparing items or generating reference models. Method: The proposed notation has been applied to structurally complex data from the stabilometry field. Stabilometry is a medical discipline concerned with human balance. We have organized the model data through an implementation based on XML syntax. Results: We have applied data mining techniques to the resulting structured data for knowledge discovery. The sound results of modelling a domain with such complex and wide-ranging data confirm the utility of the approach. Conclusion: The conceptual modelling and the analysis of non-conventional data are important challenges. We have proposed a UML profile that has been tested on data from a medical domain, obtaining very satisfactory results. The notation is useful for understanding domain data and automating knowledge discovery tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We assume that the scoring function for the classification problem is known. We use DEA to identify difficult to classify cases from a database and present them to the decision-maker one at a time. The decision-maker assigns a class to the presented case and based on the decision-maker class assignment, a tradeoff cutting plane is drawn using the scoring function and decision-maker's input. The procedure continues for finite number of iterations and terminates with the final discriminant function. We also show how a hybrid DEA and mathematical programming approach can be used when user interaction is not desired.

Utility mining was thus proposed to measure the utility values of purchased items for revealing high utility itemsets from a quantitative database. In the past, a two-phase high utility mining algorithm was thus proposed for efficiently discovering high utility itemsets from a quantitative database. In dynamic data mining, transactions may be inserted, deleted, or modified from a database. In this case, a batch mining procedure must rescan the whole updated database to maintain the up-to-date information. Designing an efficient approach for handling dynamic databases is thus a critical research issue in utility mining. In this paper, an incremental mining algorithm is proposed for efficiently maintaining discovered high utility itemsets based on pre-large concepts. Itemsets are first partitioned into three parts according to whether they have large (high), pre-large, or small transaction-weighted utilization in the original database and in inserted transactions. Individual procedures are then executed for each part. Experimental results show that the proposed incremental high utility mining algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

Methods: The study was based on the OECD database from the period 2000 to 2006. The data of thirty countries were constructed to allow comparisons over time and across these countries. Panel data analysis was used to estimate the relationship of national education, as defined as school years, with life expectancy. The control factors considered were numbers of practicing physicians, practicing nurses, hospital beds, and GDP. Results: We used fixed effects of both country and time through linear regression, the coefficient of school years in relation to life expectancy was statistically significant but negative. This finding is not in accord with the hypothesis that investing in human capital through education stimulates better health outcomes. Conclusion: Within developing countries, educational attainment is no longer keeping the same pace with life expectancy as before. Therefore, we suggest that an effective education policy should cover diverse topics, for example, balancing economic growth and mental hygiene, to improve national life expectancy.

Technically, the paradigm of anytime-anywhere connectivity raises previously unthinkable challenges, including the management of million of mobile customers, their profiles, the profiles-based selective information dissemination, and server-side computing infrastructure design issues to support such a large pool of users automatically and intelligently. In this paper, we propose a data mining technique for discovering frequent behavioral patterns from a collection of trajectories gathered by Global Positioning System. Although the search space for spatiotemporal knowledge is extremely challenging, imposing spatial and temporal constraints on spatiotemporal sequences makes the computation feasible. Specifically, the mined patterns are incorporated with synthetic constraints, namely spatiotemporal sequence length restriction, minimum and maximum timing gap between events, time window of occurrence of the whole pattern, inclusion or exclusion event constraints, and frequent movement patterns predictive of one ore more classes. The algorithm for mining all frequent constrained patterns is named cAllMOP. Moreover, to control the density of pattern regions a clustering algorithm is exploited. The proposed method is efficient and scalable. Its efficiency is better than that of the previous algorithms AllMOP and GSP with respect to the compactness of discovered knowledge, execution time, and memory requirement.

This necessity has led to the development of privacy preserving distributed data mining. Several protocols exist which deal with data mining methods in a distributed scenario but most of these methods handle a single data mining task. Therefore, if the participating parties are interested in more than one classification methods they will have to go through a series of distributed protocols every time, thus increasing the overhead substantially. A second significant drawback with existing methods is that they are often quite expensive due to the use of encryption operations. In this paper a method has been proposed that addresses both these issues and provides a generic approach to efficient privacy preserving classification analysis in a distributed setting with a worst-case privacy guarantee. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

First, a weights-of-evidence model was used to rank the importance of each evidential map and determine the optimal buffer distance. Second, a classification technique that uses a C4.5 decision tree in data mining was used to construct a decision tree classifier for the grid dataset. Finally, an m-branch smoothing technique was used as a predictor, which transformed the decision tree into a probability evaluation tree. The method makes no conditional independence assumption and can be applied for class imbalanced datasets like those collected during mineral exploration for prospectivity mapping of an area. The traits of comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency were derived from the C4.5 decision tree. In addition, a case study for iron prospectivity mapping was performed in the eastern Kunlun Mountains, China. Sixty-two Skarn iron deposits and eight evidential maps related to iron mineralization were studied. On the final map, areas of low, moderate and high potential for iron deposit occurrence covered areas of 71,491, 14,298, and 9,532 km(2), respectively. For the goodness-of-fit test, 91.94 % of the total 62 iron deposits were within a high-potential area, 8.06 % were within a moderate-potential area and 0 % were within a low-potential area. For ten-fold cross-validation, 82.26 % were within a high-potential area, 14.52 % were within a moderate-potential area and 3.22 % were within a low-potential area. To evaluate the predictive accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) were employed. The accuracy of the goodness-of-fit test reached 97.07 %, and the accuracy of the ten-fold cross-validation was 95.10 %. The majority of the iron deposits were within high-potential and moderate-potential areas, which covered a small proportion of the study area.

Characterization of acid mine drainage sources in the Iberian Pyrite Belt: base methodology for quantifying affected areas and for environmental management	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						AMD; Iberian Pyrite Belt; Sources; Affected areas	DATA-MINING TECHNIQUES; SW SPAIN; SOUTHWESTERN SPAIN; METAL POLLUTION; HUELVA-SPAIN; FUZZY-LOGIC; ODIEL RIVER; TINTO RIVER; WATER; RIA	The present work aims to propose a methodology for quantifying the sources of acid mine drainage (AMD) and to characterize the magnitude of the affected areas in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain). Such an approach allows the creation of a support tool for managing land and natural resources valorization, which may be easily applied in similar mining regions. The motivation and usefulness of this work can be realized by focusing on two main emerging strategic issues: (1) water resources management, with the example of Alcolea dam that will receive water from affected areas in the Iberian Pyrite Belt; and (2) mineral resources valorization, especially, regarding copper exploration due to increasing market prices. The used methodology included the following general steps: it started with an inventory of the mines in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, followed by field cartography campaigns and finally the quantification of affected areas and contaminant discharges. The results of the present work serve to confirm and quantify the magnitude of the AMD pollution in the Pyrite Belt. A total affected area of about 4,847 ha was estimated. Taking into account this figure and combining it with the annual average precipitation (650 L/m(2)) results in an estimation of 31,503,680 m(3)/year of discharging water affected by the presence of sulphides. In this scenario, a total annual contribution of 260,056 tonnes/year was obtained for sulphates, which means more than 712 tonnes a day. In the case of arsenic, a toxic element, the total annual contribution is more than 20 tonnes, or close to 55 kg/day. Regarding copper, this economically interesting metal translates into total contributions of 10,364 tonnes/year in the generating medium. This gave more than 28 tonnes/day, which today sits at 8,200 dollars/tonne. This result suggests that solutions aimed at recovering this resource should be searched. It may represent a financial return at the same time that it would mean overcome environmental liabilities.	[Grande, J. A.; Valente, T.; de la Torre, M. L.; Santisteban, M.; Ceron, J.

It uses both statistical and data mining techniques. As a result, it is possible to simulate solar spectral irradiance distribution using some astronomical parameters and the meteorological parameters solar irradiance, temperature and humidity. With these parameters, the average photon energy and the normalization factor, which characterise the solar spectra, are estimated. First, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is used to analyse and compare all measured spectra. The k-means data mining technique is subsequently used to cluster all measurements. We found that three clusters are enough to characterise all observed spectra. Finally, an artificial neural network and a multivariate linear regression are estimated to simulate the solar spectral distribution matching certain meteorological parameters. The results obtained show that over 99.98% of cumulative probability distribution functions of measured spectra are the same as simulated ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, mobile phones with Global Positioning System technology have been used to collect daily trajectories of the individuals with higher temporal resolution and a trajectory data mining, and geo-spatial analysis algorithm was developed and implemented within a Geographical Information System to obtain time-activity patterns. These data were combined with air pollutant concentrations estimated for several microenvironments. In addition to outdoor, pollutant concentrations in distinct indoor microenvironments are characterised using a probabilistic approach. An example of the application for PM2.5 is presented and discussed. The results obtained for daily average individual exposure correspond to a mean value of 10.6 and 6.0-16.4 mu g m(-3) in terms of 5th-95th percentiles. Analysis of the results shows that the use of point air quality measurements for exposure assessment will not explain the intra- and inter-variability of individuals' exposure levels. The methodology developed and implemented in this work provides time-sequence of the exposure events thus making possible association of the exposure with the individual activities and delivers main statistics on individual's air pollution exposure with high spatio-temporal resolution.

These techniques include non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR), a regression tree, a transformed linear model and a two-stage model combining a linear regression with SVR. We compare these models with an ordinary least squares linear regression. In addition, we incorporate several variants of 11 macroeconomic indicators to estimate the influence of the economic state on loan losses. The out-of-time set-up is complemented with an out-of-sample set-up to mitigate the limited number of credit crisis observations available in credit risk data sets. The two-stage/transformed model outperforms the other techniques when forecasting out-of-time for the home equity/corporate data set, while the non-parametric regression tree is the best performer when forecasting out-of-sample. The incorporation of macroeconomic variables significantly improves the prediction performance. The downturn impact ranges up to 5% depending on the data set and the macroeconomic conditions defining the downturn. These conclusions can help financial institutions when estimating LGD under the internal ratings-based approach of the Basel Accords in order to estimate the downturn LGD needed to calculate the capital requirements. Banks are also required as part of stress test exercises to assess the impact of stressed macroeconomic scenarios on their Profit and Loss (P&L) and banking book, which favours the accurate identification of relevant macroeconomic variables driving LGD evolutions.

J	Liao, VCC; Chen, MS				Liao, Vance Chiang-Chi; Chen, Ming-Syan			DFSP: a Depth-First SPelling algorithm for sequential pattern mining of biological sequences	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sequential patterns; Pattern mining; Data mining; Bioinformatics	DATABASE; GROWTH; ALIGNMENT	Scientific progress in recent years has led to the generation of huge amounts of biological data, most of which remains unanalyzed. Mining the data may provide insights into various realms of biology, such as finding co-occurring biosequences, which are essential for biological data mining and analysis. Data mining techniques like sequential pattern mining may reveal implicitly meaningful patterns among the DNA or protein sequences. If biologists hope to unlock the potential of sequential pattern mining in their field, it is necessary to move away from traditional sequential pattern mining algorithms, because they have difficulty handling a small number of items and long sequences in biological data, such as gene and protein sequences. To address the problem, we propose an approach called Depth-First SPelling (DFSP) algorithm for mining sequential patterns in biological sequences. The algorithm's processing speed is faster than that of PrefixSpan, its leading competitor, and it is superior to other sequential pattern mining algorithms for biological sequences.

In this paper, a new Universum-regularized multiple-criteria linear programming (called -RMCLP) was proposed and firstly applied to railway safety field, which is useful extension of RMCLP. Experiments in public datasets show that -RMCLP can get better results than its original model. Furthermore, experiment results in the trouble of moving freight car detection system (TFDS) datasets indicate that the accuracy of -RMCLP has been up to 91 %, which will provide great help for TFDS system.

J	La, L; Guo, Q; Cao, QM; Wang, YL				La, Lei; Guo, Qiao; Cao, Qimin; Wang, Yongliang			Transfer learning with reasonable boosting strategy	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text categorization; Transfer learning; Boosting; Lack of labeled data; Weighting strategy	CLASSIFICATION	The lack of labeled data is a serious problem which greatly hinders the application of text classification in new domains. In this era of information explosion, dependence of labeled data in traditional classification methods becomes ineffective in emerged new domains. The ideology of transfer learning makes it possible to use labeled identical distribution data of old domains for data mining in new domains. However, previous algorithms and practical application systems did not reach the perfect state. This paper presents a novel complete method for text categorization (TC) in new domains where the labeled data are insufficient. We first present an improved weighting strategy of boosting algorithms family to ensure training data can be used more efficiently. We then introduce boosting ideology with the novel weighting strategy into transfer learning, and a novel text classification algorithm is proposed which has the ability to use labeled data of old domains for new domain classification with a high performance. After the mathematical discussion of the proposed algorithm, we finally deploy a real-world system based on it to evaluate the novel method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to achieve both ideal accuracy and efficiency in TC when dealing with cross-domain problems.

Obviously, the computation resource can be used to improve the execution efficiency of not only graphing applications but other time consuming applications like data mining. The Clustering Affinity Search Technique is a famous clustering algorithm, which is widely used in clustering the biological data. In this paper, we will propose an algorithm that can utilize the GPU and the individual memory of graphics card to accelerate the execution. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can deliver excellent performance in terms of execution time and is scalable to very large databases.

People use natural languages like English to talk about "common sense" concepts, but the brain processes that produce them are described in a highly technical vocabulary. BrainSpace tries to relate technical concepts in anatomy and chemistry to a general body of common sense knowledge, Open Mind Common Sense. It uses the novel inference technique of Blending, to perform joint inference between technical neuroscience knowledge and common sense knowledge, and vice versa. The current paper reports preliminary results showing that BrainSpace's inference organizes concepts such as the "visual brain," "dynamic brain," and deep brain stimulation in an intuitively plausible manner, indicating that it can serve as a foundation for interpreting more specific experimental and medical data.

J	Otto, A; Otto, C				Otto, Alena; Otto, Christian			How to design effective priority rules: Example of simple assembly line balancing	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Heuristics; Priority rules; Assembly line balancing; Combinatorial optimization; Manufacturing	SCHEDULING RULES; ALGORITHMS; GENERATION; SEARCH; TIMES	Priority rule-based methods (PRBMs) rely on problem-specific knowledge to construct good solutions in a very short time. They can be used as stand-alone procedures or can be integrated into (partial) enumeration procedures, like branch and bound or dynamic programming, and heuristic solution methods. PRBMs are especially important for solving NP-hard optimization problems. In this paper, we formulate general design principles on how to construct good-performing PRBMs, based on a thorough computational investigation. Our principles allow to construct effective PRBMs already ad hoc, i.e. without time-consuming data mining algorithms. We conduct our analysis on the example of the NP-hard Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem (SALBP), on which with small modifications most situations in the planning of assembly lines are based. We also provide a cross-validation of our results and illustrate the application of the formulated principles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A review of approaches to identifying patient phenotype cohorts using electronic health records	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Review						Review; Electronic Health Records; Cohort Identification; Phenotyping	X-RAY REPORTS; MEDICAL-RECORDS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; HEART-FAILURE; DECISION-MAKING; CANCER-RISK; EHR DATA; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Objective To summarize literature describing approaches aimed at automatically identifying patients with a common phenotype. Materials and methods We performed a review of studies describing systems or reporting techniques developed for identifying cohorts of patients with specific phenotypes. Every full text article published in (1) Journal of American Medical Informatics Association, (2) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, (3) Proceedings of the Annual American Medical Informatics Association Symposium, and (4) Proceedings of Clinical Research Informatics Conference within the past 3years was assessed for inclusion in the review. Only articles using automated techniques were included. Results Ninety-seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Forty-six used natural language processing (NLP)-based techniques, 24 described rule-based systems, 41 used statistical analyses, data mining, or machine learning techniques, while 22 described hybrid systems. Nine articles described the architecture of large-scale systems developed for determining cohort eligibility of patients. Discussion We observe that there is a rise in the number of studies associated with cohort identification using electronic medical records. Statistical analyses or machine learning, followed by NLP techniques, are gaining popularity over the years in comparison with rule-based systems. Conclusions There are a variety of approaches for classifying patients into a particular phenotype. Different techniques and data sources are used, and good performance is reported on datasets at respective institutions. However, no system makes comprehensive use of electronic medical records addressing all of their known weaknesses.

Mining clinical text for signals of adverse drug-drug interactions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Electronic Health Records; Pharmacovigilance; Drug Interaction; Adverse Reactions; Data Mining; Ontology	SPONTANEOUS REPORTS DATABASE; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; REPORTING SYSTEM; EVENTS; FDA; SURVEILLANCE; ASSOCIATIONS; ALGORITHMS; SOFTWARE; ACCURACY	Background and objective Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly being used to complement the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and to enable active pharmacovigilance. Over 30% of all adverse drug reactions are caused by drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and result in significant morbidity every year, making their early identification vital. We present an approach for identifying DDI signals directly from the textual portion of EHRs. Methods We recognize mentions of drug and event concepts from over 50 million clinical notes from two sites to create a timeline of concept mentions for each patient. We then use adjusted disproportionality ratios to identify significant drug-drug-event associations among 1165 drugs and 14 adverse events. To validate our results, we evaluate our performance on a gold standard of 1698 DDIs curated from existing knowledge bases, as well as with signaling DDI associations directly from FAERS using established methods. Results Our method achieves good performance, as measured by our gold standard (area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve >80%), on two independent EHR datasets and the performance is comparable to that of signaling DDIs from FAERS. We demonstrate the utility of our method for early detection of DDIs and for identifying alternatives for risky drug combinations. Finally, we publish a first of its kind database of population event rates among patients on drug combinations based on an EHR corpus. Conclusions It is feasible to identify DDI signals and estimate the rate of adverse events among patients on drug combinations, directly from clinical text; this could have utility in prioritizing drug interaction surveillance as well as in clinical decision support.

POLYCOMB-GROUP PROTEINS; HISTONE H3; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; LYSINE 27; ARABIDOPSIS; METHYLATION; EXPRESSION; DNA; METHYLTRANSFERASES; CLASSIFICATION	Histone lysine methylation plays a pivotal role in a variety of developmental and physiological processes through modifying chromatin structure and thereby regulating eukaryotic gene transcription. The SET domain proteins represent putative candidates for lysine methyltransferases containing the evolutionarily-conserved SET domain, and important epigenetic regulators present in eukaryotes. In recent years, increasing evidence reveals that SET domain proteins are encoded by a large multigene family in plants and investigation of the SET domain gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Although the SET domain gene family has been thoroughly characterized in multiple plant species including two model plant systems, Arabidopsis and rice, through their sequenced genomes, analysis of the entire SET domain gene family in maize was not completed following maize (B73) genome sequencing project. Here, we performed a genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis of maize SET domain genes from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. A complete set of 43 SET domain genes (Zmset1-43) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools and categorized into seven classes (Class I-VII) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on all ten chromosomes with seven segmental duplication events, suggesting that segmental duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize SET domain gene family. EST expression data mining revealed that these newly identified genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and suggested that many maize SET domain genes play functional developmental roles in multiple tissues. Furthermore, the transcripts of the 18 genes (the Class V subfamily) were detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The data demonstrated that these genes exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments. Overall, our study will serve to better understand the complexity of the maize SET domain gene family and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants.

We start the review with a concise background of data stream processing, presenting the building blocks for mining data streams. In a wide range of applications, data streams are required to be processed on small ubiquitous devices like smartphones and sensor devices. Mobile and ubiquitous data mining target these applications with tailored techniques and approaches addressing scarcity of resources and mobility issues. Two categories can be identified for mobile and ubiquitous mining of streaming data: single-node and distributed. This survey will cover both categories. Mining mobile and ubiquitous data require algorithms with the ability to monitor and adapt the working conditions to the available computational resources. We identify the key characteristics of these algorithms and present illustrative applications. Distributed data stream mining in the mobile environment is then discussed, presenting the Pocket Data Mining framework. Mobility of users stimulates the adoption of context-awareness in this area of research. Context-awareness and collaboration are discussed in the Collaborative Data Stream Mining, where agents share knowledge to learn adaptive accurate models.

J	Mueen, A				Mueen, Abdullah			Time series motif discovery: dimensions and applications	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article								Time series motifs are repeated segments in a long time series that, if exist, carry precise information about the underlying source of the time series. Motif discovery in time series data has received significant attention in the data mining community since its inception, principally because, motif discovery is meaningful and more likely to succeed when the data is large. Algorithms for motif discovery generally deal with three aspects the definition of the motifs, domain based preprocessing, and finally, the algorithmic steps. Typical definitions of motifs signify the similarity or the support of the motifs. Domains impose preprocessing requirements to meaningful motif finding such as data alignment, interpolation, and transformation. Motif discovery algorithms vary based on exact or approximate evaluation of the definition. In addition, algorithms require different representations [Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), DFT etc.] and similarity measures [correlation, dynamic time warping (DTW) distance etc.] for time series segments. In this paper, we discuss these three facets in detail with examples taken from the literature. We briefly describe a set of applications of time series motif in various domains and elaborate on a certain application in entomology to analyze insect behavior.

The soft faults such as the sensor biases are difficult to discover in the real buildings. A robust diagnostics tool is presented to improve the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of buildings through removing various faults. The combined neural networks, integrating the basic neural network and auxiliary neural network, are developed to detect the abnormities in the air handling unit that is the widely used in commercial buildings. As a data mining technology, clustering analysis is used to classify the various faulty conditions adaptively in the buildings in this paper. Through subtractive clustering analysis, the different faults can be separated into different space zones in the data space. Besides the known faults in the library, the new unknown faults can be recognized and complemented into the faults library adaptively. The fixed biases, drifting biases and complete failure of the sensors and chilled water valve faults commonly occurred in the buildings are validated in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this article is to develop a concurrent group decision-making framework for the selection of a data warehouse business intelligence-based architecture. In this framework, in order to translate higher level needs into lower level requirements, we develop a four-level concurrent decision-making model to turn (1) critical success factors of business intelligence implementation into key data mining factors at the first level, (2) the key data mining factors into key ontology factors at the second level, and (3) the key ontology factors into key data resource management factors at the third level. Then, these factors are utilized to select the business intelligence data warehouse architecture at the fourth level of the four-level concurrent decision-making model. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the concurrent group decision-making framework.

J	Zhang, JB; Wong, JS; Li, TR; Pan, Y				Zhang, Junbo; Wong, Jian-Syuan; Li, Tianrui; Pan, Yi			A comparison of parallel large-scale knowledge acquisition using rough set theory on different MapReduce runtime systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Rough sets; Knowledge acquisition; MapReduce; Large-scale	ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; RULES; APPROXIMATION; GRANULATION; DATABASES; MODEL	Nowadays, with the volume of data growing at an unprecedented rate, large-scale data mining and knowledge discovery have become a new challenge. Rough set theory for knowledge acquisition has been successfully applied in data mining. The recently introduced MapReduce technique has received much attention from both scientific community and industry for its applicability in big data analysis. To mine knowledge from big data, we present parallel large-scale rough set based methods for knowledge acquisition using MapReduce in this paper. We implemented them on several representative MapReduce runtime systems: Hadoop, Phoenix and Twister. Performance comparisons on these runtime systems are reported in this paper. The experimental results show that (1) The computational time is mostly minimum on Twister while employing the same cores; (2) Hadoop has the best speedup for larger data sets; (3) Phoenix has the best speedup for smaller data sets. The excellent speedups also demonstrate that the proposed parallel methods can effectively process very large data on different runtime systems. Pitfalls and advantages of these runtime systems are also illustrated through our experiments, which are helpful for users to decide which runtime system should be used in their applications.

While it is critical to process this data efficiently (in a fast and accurate manner) and cost-effectively, in a large-scale application of the above technologies, it is not possible to do so manually by specialized human resources. This paper proposes a methodology for automatic real-time screening of heart sound signals (one of the most widely acquired signals from the human body for diagnostic purposes) and identification of those that are abnormal and require some action to be taken, which can be applied to many other similar types of bio-signals generated in assistive environments. It is based on a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Inference approach, which estimates conditional probability distributions in structures obtained from a Tree-Augmented Na < ve Bayes algorithm. It has been applied and validated in a highly 'difficult' heterogeneous dataset of 198 heart sound signals, which comes from both healthy medical cases and unhealthy ones having aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis. The proposed methodology achieved high classification performance in this difficult screening problem. It performs higher than other widely used classifiers, showing great potential for contributing to a cost-effective large-scale application of ICT-based assistive environment technologies.

This includes scientific articles as well as clinical management reviews, and even records from health institutions with patient data. However, traditional instruments, both individual and institutional, are of little use for selecting the most appropriate information in each case, either in the clinical or research field. So-called text or data mining enables this huge amount of information to be managed, extracting it from various sources using processing systems (filtration and curation), integrating it and permitting the generation of new knowledge. This review aims to provide an overview of text and data mining, and of the potential usefulness of this bioinformatic technique in the exercise of care in respiratory medicine and in research in the same field.

In this work, we used a data mining technique to analyze the glycan array data of influenza viruses to find novel glycan structures other than SA that may be involved in viral infection. Results: In addition to SA structures noted previously, we noted the sulfated structures in the mining results. For verification, we overexpressed the sulfotransferase that is involved in synthesizing these structures, and we performed a viral infection experiment to assess changes in infection in these cells. In our results, we found that there is a 70-fold increase in these cells compared with the control. Thus, we have found a novel pattern in glycan structures that may be involved in viral infection.

Typically, conventional statistical methods are used for the development of outcome prediction models and risk scores. However, these analyses carry inherent properties limiting their ability to cope with large data sets with multiple variables and samples. Machine learning (ML), a field stemming from artificial intelligence, is part of a wider approach for data analysis termed data mining (DM). It enables prediction in complex data scenarios, familiar to practitioners and researchers. Technological and commercial applications are all around us, gradually entering clinical research. In the following review, we would like to expose hematologists and stem cell transplanters to the concepts, clinical applications, strengths and limitations of such methods and discuss current research in HSCT. The aim of this review is to encourage utilization of the ML and DM techniques in the field of HSCT, including prediction of transplantation outcome and donor selection.

Harmonization of pathology quality assurance procedures for biobank accessions has lagged behind other avenues of biospecimen research and biobank development. Comprehension of the cellular content of biorepository specimens is important for discovery of tissue-specific clinically relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. While rapidly emerging technologies in molecular analyses and data mining create focus on appropriate measures for minimizing pre-analytic artifact-inducing variables, less attention gets paid to annotating the constituent makeup of biospecimens for more effective specimen selection by biobank clients. Both pre-analytic tissue processing and specimen composition influence acquisition of relevant macromolecules for downstream assays. Pathologist review of biorepository submissions, particularly tissues as part of quality assurance procedures, helps to ensure that the intended target cells are present and in sufficient quantity in accessioned specimens. This manual procedure can be tedious and subjective. Incorporating digital pathology into biobank quality assurance procedures, using automated pattern recognition morphometric image analysis to quantify tissue feature areas in digital whole slide images of tissue sections, can minimize variability and subjectivity associated with routine pathologic evaluations in biorepositories. Whole-slide images and pathologist-reviewed morphometric analyses can be provided to researchers to guide specimen selection.

Its phenology - the time of sexual reproduction - is certainly a key trait for the local adaptation of the processionary moth to climatic conditions. Moreover, an exceptional case of allochronic differentiation was discovered ca. 15 years ago in this species. A population with a shifted phenology (the summer population, SP) co-exists near Leiria, Portugal, with a population following the classical cycle (the winter population, WP). The existence of this population is an outstanding opportunity to decipher the genetic bases of phenology. No genomic resources were so far available for T pityocampa. We developed a high-throughput sequencing approach to build a first reference transcriptome, and to proceed with comparative analyses of the sympatric SP and WP. We pooled RNA extracted from whole individuals of various developmental stages, and performed a transcriptome characterisation for both populations combining Roche 454-FLX and traditional Sanger data. The obtained sequences were clustered into ca. 12,000 transcripts corresponding to 9265 unigenes. The mean transcript coverage was 21.9 reads per bp. Almost 70% of the de novo assembled transcripts displayed significant similarity to previously published proteins and around 50% of the transcripts contained a full-length coding region. Comparative analyses of the population transcriptomes allowed to investigate genes specifically expressed in one of the studied populations only, and to identify the most divergent homologous SP/WP transcripts. The most divergent pairs of transcripts did not correspond to obvious phenology-related candidate genes, and 43% could not be functionally annotated. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide resource for the target species T pityocampa. Many of the assembled genes are orthologs of published Lepidoptera genes, which allows carrying out gene-specific re-sequencing. Data mining has allowed the identification of SNP loci that will be useful for population genomic approaches and genome-wide scans of population differentiation to identify signatures of selection.

This paper presents the results of the electrical aging of oil-impregnated paper under AC-DC combined voltages by the pulsed electroacoustic technique. Data mining and feature extractions were performed on the influence of electrical aging on charge dynamics based on the experiment results in the first stage. Characteristic parameters such as total charge injection and apparent charge mobility were calculated. The influences of electrical aging on the trap energy distribution of an oil-paper insulation system were analyzed and discussed. Longer electrical aging time would increase the depth and energy density of charge trap, which decelerates the apparent charge mobility and increases the probability of hot electron formation. This mechanism would accelerate damage to the cellulose and the formation of discharge channels, enhance the acceleration of the electric field distortion, and shorten insulation lifetime under AC-DC combined voltages.

We investigate the incentives for sellers to invest in systems that allow the tracking of consumers and then to truthfully report whether potential buyers will enjoy yet untried products. We find that there are two types of equilibria: For some parameter values, sellers will target all potential buyers, hence their targeted ads or purchase recommendations provide no benefit to the consumer. But for other values, ads and recommendations will be accurate. In particular, the incentive for the seller to provide accurate ads and recommendations will be inversely related to the difference between the cost of producing the good and its average market evaluation.

J	Mayo, D				Mayo, D.			Some surprising facts about (the problem of) surprising facts (from the Dusseldorf Conference, February 2011)	STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article								A common intuition about evidence is that if data x have been used to construct a hypothesis H, then x should not be used again in support of H. It is no surprise that x fits H, if H was deliberately constructed to accord with x. The question of when and why we should avoid such "double-counting" continues to be debated in philosophy and statistics. It arises as a prohibition against data mining, hunting for significance, tuning on the signal, and ad hoc hypotheses, and as a preference for predesignated hypotheses and "surprising" predictions. I have argued that it is the severity or probativeness of the test or lack of it that should determine whether a double-use of data is admissible. I examine a number of surprising ambiguities and unexpected facts that continue to bedevil this debate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concept of the algorithm investigated here is based on linear transformation to a space of a smaller dimension, while retaining as much as possible the same distances between particular elements. Elements of the transformation matrix are computed using the metaheuristics of parallel fast simulated annealing. Moreover, elimination of or a decrease in importance is performed on those data set elements which have undergone a significant change in location in relation to the others. The presented method can have universal application in a wide range of data exploration problems, offering flexible customization, possibility of use in a dynamic data environment, and comparable or better performance with regards to the principal component analysis. Its positive features were verified in detail for the domain's fundamental tasks of clustering, classification and detection of atypical elements (outliers).

In that case, the objective function does not have to be either convex or differentiable, and generally it may have many local or global minima. Therefore, it becomes a complex global optimization problem. A method of searching for a locally optimal solution is proposed in the paper, the convergence of the corresponding iterative process is proved and the corresponding algorithm is given. The method is illustrated by and compared with some other clustering methods, especially with the l(2)-clustering method, which is also known in the literature as a smooth k-means method, on a few typical situations, such as the presence of outliers among the data and the clustering of incomplete data. Numerical experiments show in this case that the proposed l(1)-clustering algorithm is faster and gives significantly better results than the l(2)-clustering algorithm.

Modeling and Optimization of Terbutaline Emitted from a Dry Powder Inhaler and Influence on Systemic Bioavailability Using Data Mining Technology	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Modeling; Optimization; Terbutaline; Dry powder inhaler	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RELEASE TABLET FORMULATION; INSPIRATORY MANEUVER; NEUROFUZZY LOGIC; INHALATION FLOW; PARTICLE-SIZE; HUMAN LUNGS; DELIVERY; DEPOSITION; TURBUHALER	Delivery of accurate doses from dry powder inhalers (DPI) involves many process variables which must be adjusted to ensure patient compliance and optimum therapy. Some of the process variables include: speed of inhalation (flow rate), assumed lung volume of patients, number and duration of inhalations. Data mining technology based on artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were used to model the in vitro inhalation process, predict and optimize bioavailability from the inhaled doses. The delivery of terbutaline doses from Bricanyl TurbuhalerA (R) was modeled and optimized using artificial neural network modeling and optimization software. Highly significant models (p < 0.00001) with minimum root mean squared error and high predictability: R (2) > 81 % and 91 % for the in vitro and the in vivo models were developed, respectively. The optimized models demonstrated that an optimum emitted dose (> 76 %) could be obtained if the dose was withdrawn as two inhalations with inhalation volume 4 L and flow rate 60 L/min within 4 s. The same independent variables in addition to % terbutaline emitted were modeled and optimized for % drug excreted in urine. The latter model demonstrated that optimum bioavailability (79.50 %) could be obtained from Bricanyl TurbuhalerA (R) emitting 80-87.50 % terbutaline at a flow rate of 58-60 L/min using two inhalations irrespective of subject forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or the individual lung capacity. Optimized in vitro/in vivo inhalation processes using data mining models can offer rapid solutions for dose variability problems and maximize the bioavailability of drugs from DPIs.

J	Li, XB; Raghunathan, S				Li, Xiao-Bai; Raghunathan, Srinivasan			Pricing and disseminating customer data with privacy awareness	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy; Pricing; Incentive compatibility; Data mining; Data analytics	PROTECTING PRIVACY; INFORMATION; DISCLOSURE; DATABASES; MARKETS	Organizations today regularly share their customer data with their partners to gain competitive advantages. They are also often requested or even required by a third party to provide customer data that are deemed sensitive. In these circumstances, organizations are obligated to protect the privacy of the individuals involved while still benefiting from sharing data or meeting the requirement for releasing data. In this study, we analyze the tradeoff between privacy and data utility from the perspective of the data owner. We develop an incentive-compatible mechanism for the data owner to price and disseminate private data. With this mechanism, a data user is motivated to reveal his true purpose of data usage and acquire the data that suits to that purpose. Existing economic studies of information privacy primarily consider the interplay between the data owner and the individuals, focusing on problems that occur in the collection of private data. This study, however, examines the privacy issue facing a data owner organization in the distribution of private data to a third party data user when the real purpose of data usage is unclear and the released data could be misused.

The criteria used in these decisions are not always formally specified and optimized. The paper develops a semi-automated approach that improves the business performance of processes by deriving decision criteria from the experience gained through past process executions. The premise that drives the approach is that it is possible to identify a process path that would yield best performance at a given context. The approach uses data mining techniques to identify the relationships between context, path decisions, and process outcomes, and derives decision rules from these relationships. It is evaluated using a simulation of a manufacturing process, whose results demonstrate the potential of improving the business performance through the rules generated by the approach.

However, previously proposed methods are mainly based on structural analysis of social networks rather than content-based behavior analysis. Therefore, we propose a method to use the content-based behavioral features extracted from user-generated content and behavior patterns to identify users' roles and to explore role change patterns in social networks. The proposed method allows a user to play multiple roles in a social network and can identify roles without using any pre-defined roles. Thus, it provides a more general and flexible way to perform role analyses in social networks. The experimental results show that the proposed method can find various roles in different social networks, additional roles that haven't been previously aware of, and some interesting role change patterns. The results may help us better understand the characteristics and trends of a social network, and formulate more effective management strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a conventional approach this would typically be done either by combining the classifiers' outputs (e. g., in form of a classifier ensemble) or by combining the sets of classification rules (e. g., by weighting them individually). In this paper, we introduce a new way of fusing classifiers at the level of parameters of classification rules. This technique is based on the use of probabilistic generative classifiers using multinomial distributions for categorical input dimensions and multivariate normal distributions for the continuous ones. That means, we have distributions such as Dirichlet or normal-Wishart distributions over parameters of the classifier. We refer to these distributions as hyperdistributions or second-order distributions. We show that fusing two (or more) classifiers can be done by multiplying the hyperdistributions of the parameters and derive simple formulas for that task. Properties of this new approach are demonstrated with a few experiments. The main advantage of this fusion approach is that the hyperdistributions are retained throughout the fusion process. Thus, the fused components may, for example, be used in subsequent training steps (online training).

An important problem in microarray data analysis is to discover phenotype structures. The goal is to 1) find groups of samples corresponding to different phenotypes (such as disease or normal), and 2) for each group of samples, find the representative expression pattern or signature that distinguishes this group from others. Some methods have been proposed for this issue, however, a common drawback is that the identified signatures often include a large number of genes but with low discriminative power. In this paper, we propose a g*-sequence model to address this limitation, where the ordered expression values among genes are profitably utilized. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed sequence model is more robust to noise and allows to discover the signatures with more discriminative power using fewer genes. This is important for the subsequent analysis by the biologists. We prove that the problem of phenotype structure discovery is NP-complete. An efficient algorithm, FINDER, is developed, which includes three steps: 1) trivial g*-sequences identifying, 2) phenotype structure discovery, and 3) refinement. Effective pruning strategies are developed to further improve the efficiency. We evaluate the performance of FINDER and the existing methods using both synthetic and real gene expression data sets. Extensive experimental results show that FINDER dramatically improves the accuracy of the phenotype structures discovered (in terms of both statistical and biological significance) and detects signatures with high discriminative power. Moreover, it is orders of magnitude faster than other alternatives.

Despite its importance, most studies of feature selection are restricted to batch learning. Unlike traditional batch learning methods, online learning represents a promising family of efficient and scalable machine learning algorithms for large-scale applications. Most existing studies of online learning require accessing all the attributes/features of training instances. Such a classical setting is not always appropriate for real-world applications when data instances are of high dimensionality or it is expensive to acquire the full set of attributes/features. To address this limitation, we investigate the problem of online feature selection (OFS) in which an online learner is only allowed to maintain a classifier involved only a small and fixed number of features. The key challenge of online feature selection is how to make accurate prediction for an instance using a small number of active features. This is in contrast to the classical setup of online learning where all the features can be used for prediction. We attempt to tackle this challenge by studying sparsity regularization and truncation techniques. Specifically, this article addresses two different tasks of online feature selection: 1) learning with full input, where an learner is allowed to access all the features to decide the subset of active features, and 2) learning with partial input, where only a limited number of features is allowed to be accessed for each instance by the learner. We present novel algorithms to solve each of the two problems and give their performance analysis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for online feature selection on several public data sets, and demonstrate their applications to real-world problems including image classification in computer vision and microarray gene expression analysis in bioinformatics. The encouraging results of our experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed techniques.	[Wang, Jialei; Zhao, Peilin; Hoi, Steven C.

Recently, querying incomplete data has attracted extensive attention as it poses new challenges to traditional querying techniques. The existing work on querying incomplete data addresses the problem where the data values on certain dimensions are unknown. However, in many real-life applications, such as data collected by a sensor network in a noisy environment, not only the data values but also the dimension information may be missing. In this work, we propose to investigate the problem of similarity search on dimension incomplete data. A probabilistic framework is developed to model this problem so that the users can find objects in the database that are similar to the query with probability guarantee. Missing dimension information poses great computational challenge, since all possible combinations of missing dimensions need to be examined when evaluating the similarity between the query and the data objects. We develop the lower and upper bounds of the probability that a data object is similar to the query. These bounds enable efficient filtering of irrelevant data objects without explicitly examining all missing dimension combinations. A probability triangle inequality is also employed to further prune the search space and speed up the query process. The proposed probabilistic framework and techniques can be applied to both whole and subsequence queries. Extensive experimental results on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Clustering becomes difficult due to the increasing sparsity of such data, as well as the increasing difficulty in distinguishing distances between data points. In this paper, we take a novel perspective on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data. Instead of attempting to avoid the curse of dimensionality by observing a lower dimensional feature subspace, we embrace dimensionality by taking advantage of inherently high-dimensional phenomena. More specifically, we show that hubness, i.e., the tendency of high-dimensional data to contain points (hubs) that frequently occur in k-nearest-neighbor lists of other points, can be successfully exploited in clustering. We validate our hypothesis by demonstrating that hubness is a good measure of point centrality within a high-dimensional data cluster, and by proposing several hubness-based clustering algorithms, showing that major hubs can be used effectively as cluster prototypes or as guides during the search for centroid-based cluster configurations. Experimental results demonstrate good performance of our algorithms in multiple settings, particularly in the presence of large quantities of noise. The proposed methods are tailored mostly for detecting approximately hyperspherical clusters and need to be extended to properly handle clusters of arbitrary shapes.

In an AODE network some redundant SPODEs maybe result in some bias of classifiers, as a consequence, it could reduce the classification accuracy substantially. In this paper, a kind of MDL metrics is used to select SPODEs in a whole or partially, therefore there are three different classifiers presented. The performance comparisons between them and AODE have been shown not only the theoretical analyses are reasonable, but also efficient and effective. And Mean Square Error (MSE) is used to test overfitting. Experiential results have indicated that the classifier using MDL score metrics had better performance than original AODE, and at the same time, has less overfitting. At the end of the paper, further discussions and verifications of some properties of overfilling have also shown in the experiments.

Also known as the oncoprotein 18, STMN1 performs an important function in regulating rapid microtubule remodeling of the cytoskeleton in response to the cellular conditions. Immunoexpression of STMN1 was retrospectively assessed in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and treated with consistent guidelines. The outcome was correlated with clinicopathological features and patient survivals. Results indicated that high STMN1 expressions (50 %) were correlated with advanced age (p = 0.027), higher T stage (p = 0.003), and overall clinical stage (p = 0.006) by the 7th American Joint Committee of Cancer Staging. In multivariate analyses, high STMN1 expression emerged as an independent prognosticator for worse disease-specific survival (p = 0.001), distal metastasis-free survival (p = 0.003), and local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.006). Exogenous expression of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) or/and its dimeric partner, transcription factor Dp-1 (TFDP1), notably induced the STMN1 protein level in a NPC-derived cell line, TW01. Accordingly, high STMN1 protein level is commonly associated with adverse prognosticators and confers tumor aggressiveness in patients with NPC, and its upregulation might be attributed to E2F1 and/or TFDP1 transactivation.

Projecting changes in agricultural land use that are caused by changes in land management practices for analyzing the performance of land activity-related policies, such as agricultural policies, also requires this type of data for model inputs. Crop sequences, which are vital and widely adopted agricultural practices, are difficult to directly detect at a regional scale. This study presents innovative stochastic data mining that was aimed at describing the spatial distribution of crop sequences at a large regional scale. The data mining is performed by hidden Markov models and an unsupervised clustering analysis that processes sequentially observed (from 1992 to 2003) land-cover survey data on the French mainland named Teruti. The 2549 3-year crop sequences were first identified as major crop sequences across the entire territory, which included 406 (merged) agricultural districts, using hidden Markov models. The 406 (merged) agricultural districts were then grouped into 21 clusters according to the similarity of the probabilities of occurrences of major 3-year crop sequences using hierarchical clustering analysis. Four cropping systems were further identified: vineyard-based cropping systems, maize monoculture and maize/wheat-based cropping systems, temporary pasture and maize-based cropping systems and wheat and barley-based cropping systems. The modeling approach that is presented in this study provides a tool to extract large-scale cropping patterns from increasingly available time series data on land-cover and land-use. With this tool, users can (a) identify the homogeneous zones in terms of fixed-length crop sequences across a large territory, (b) understand the characteristics of cropping systems within a region in terms of typical crop sequences, and (c) identify the major crop sequences of a region according to the probabilities of occurrences.

Their ability to indicate various types of anthropogenic stressors is widely recognized which has made them an integral component of freshwater biomonitoring. The use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring is dependent on manual taxa identification which is currently a time-consuming and cost-intensive process conducted by highly trained taxonomical experts. Automated taxa identification of macroinvertebrates is a relatively recent research development Previous studies have displayed great potential for solutions to this demanding data mining application. In this research we have a collection of 1350 images from eight different macroinvertebrate taxa and the aim is to examine the suitability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for automated taxa identification of macroinvertebrates. More specifically, the focus is drawn on different training algorithms of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and Radial Basis Function network (RBFN). We performed thorough experimental tests and we tested altogether 13 training algorithms for MLPs. The best classification accuracy of MLPs, 95.3%, was obtained by two conjugate gradient backpropagation variations and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation. For PNN 92.8% and for RBFN 95.7% accuracies were achieved. The results show how important a proper choice of ANN is in order to obtain high accuracy in the automated taxa identification of macroinvertebrates and the obtained model can outperform the level of identification which is made by a taxonomist.

Change detection in animal movement using discrete wavelet analysis	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Animal movement; Wavelets; Change detection; Geographic Information System; Data mining	TIME-SERIES DATA; FORAGING SEABIRD; TELEMETRY DATA; ECOLOGY; PATTERNS; FOURIER; MODELS; IMAGES	Animals moving through a complex environment change their movement patterns frequently. Such transitions from one movement behavior to another are a result of multiple factors such as weather, habitat and interspecific interactions occurring either individually or in tandem. Understanding where and when these changes occur is the first step towards understanding the limiting or key factors acting at different scales. We applied discrete wavelet analysis to find change points in the movement behavior of a Lesser Black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). We compared our results with results from the residence method proposed by Barraquand and Benhamou (2008) and the statistical method proposed by Lavielle (1999, 2005). Discrete wavelet analysis allows the identification and localization of change points by decomposing the frequency content of two time series consisting of step length and residence time data, while omitting the problem of redundancy of coefficients consistent with continuous wavelet transformation of movement data. We show that the novel use of discrete wavelet analysis in animal movement studies is widely applicable on different focus variables, allowing changes in the movement behavior and precise change points to be detected.

Healthcare is on the cusp of its own era of big data, catalyzed by the changing regulatory and competitive environments, fueled by growing adoption of electronic health records, as well as efforts to integrate medical claims, electronic health records and other novel data sources. Applying the lessons from big data pioneers will require healthcare and life science organizations to make investments in new hardware and software, as well as in individuals with different skills. For life science companies, this will impact the entire pharmaceutical value chain from early research to postcommercialization support. More generally, this will revolutionize comparative effectiveness research.

A number of events that appear in atmospheric time series result from as yet unidentified physical mechanisms. This is particularly the case for stable boundary layers, where the usual statistical turbulence approaches do not work well and increasing evidence relates the bulk of their dynamics to generally unknown individual events.This study explores the possibility of extracting and classifying events from time series without previous knowledge of their generating mechanisms. The goal is to group large numbers of events in a useful way that will open a pathway for the detailed study of their characteristics, and help to gain understanding of events with previously unknown origin. A two-step method is developed that extracts events from background fluctuations and groups dynamically similar events into clusters. The method is tested on artificial time series with different levels of complexity and on atmospheric turbulence time series. The results indicate that the method successfully recognizes and classifies various events of unknown origin and even distinguishes different physical characteristics based only on a single-variable time series. The method is simple and highly flexible, and it does not assume any knowledge about the shape geometries, amplitudes, or underlying physical mechanisms. Therefore, with proper modifications, it can be applied to time series from a wider range of research areas.

As relevant applications accumulate, data-mining methods have been developed to specifically address the problem of group difference detection. Contrast set mining discovers group differences in the form of conjunction of feature-value pairs or items. In this paper, we incorporate absolute difference, relative difference, and statistical significance in our definition of a group difference, and develop a novel method named DIFF that uses the prefix-tree structure to compress the search space, follows a tree traversal procedure to discover the complete set of significant group differences, and employs efficient pruning strategies to expedite the search process. We conducted comprehensive experiments to compare our method with existing methods on completeness of results, pruning efficiency, and computational efficiency. The experiments demonstrate that our method guarantees completeness of results and achieves higher pruning efficiency and computational efficiency compared to STUCCO. In addition, our definition of group difference is more general than STUCCO. Our method is more effective than traditional approaches, such as classification trees, in discovering the complete set of significant group differences.

J	Kao, HP; Tang, K				Kao, Hung-Pin; Tang, Kwei			Cost-Sensitive Decision Tree Induction with Label-Dependent Late Constraints	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						classification; decision tree; cost- and time-sensitive learning; constrained data mining; classification time constraint		Completion time requirements are often imposed on a classification task. In practice, the desired completion time for classifying a subject may depend on its label (target) value. For example, a timely diagnosis is important for an illness that requires immediate medical attention. It is common in medical diagnoses, therefore, to set completion times based on the severity level of the illness. In this study, we use "label-dependent" completion time requirements to formulate a new classification problem for cost-sensitive decision tree induction by adding "late constraints" to control the rate of tardy classifications for each label value. Adding the late constraints generalizes and enriches the decision tree induction problem, but also poses a challenge to developing an efficient solution algorithm because the conventional approach based on the "divide-and-conquer" strategy cannot be used. We develop a novel algorithm that relaxes the late constraints and iteratively solves a series of cost-sensitive decision tree problems under systematically-generated late penalties. The results of an extensive numerical experiment show that the proposed algorithm is effective in finding the optimal or a near-optimal solution.

Most state of the art traffic management and information systems focus on data analysis, and very little has been done in the sense of prediction. In this article, we devise an efficient system for the prediction of peak traffic flow using machine learning techniques. In the proposed system, the traffic flow of a locality is predicted with the aid of the geospatial data obtained from aerial images. The proposed system comprises of two significant phases: Geospatial data extraction from aerial images, and traffic flow prediction using See5.0 decision tree. Firstly, geographic information essential for traffic flow prediction are extracted from aerial images like traffic maps, using suitable image processing techniques. Subsequently, for a user query, the trained See5.0 decision tree predicts the traffic state of the intended location with relevance to the date and time specified. The experimental results portray the effectiveness of the proposed system in predicting traffic flow.

Applicability of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to multi-disk search	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Topic models; Query by document; Data mining; Text mining; Document search	TEXT; SEGMENTATION; CORPUS; MODEL	Digital forensics practitioners face a continual increase in the volume of data they must analyze, which exacerbates the problem of finding relevant information in a noisy domain. Current technologies make use of keyword based search to isolate relevant documents and minimize false positives with respect to investigative goals. Unfortunately, selecting appropriate keywords is a complex and challenging task. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) offers a possible way to relax keyword selection by returning topically similar documents. This research compares regular expression search techniques and LDA using the Real Data Corpus (RDC). The RDC, a set of over 2400 disks from real users, is first analyzed to craft effective tests. Three tests are executed with the results indicating that, while LDA search should not be used as a replacement to regular expression search, it does offer benefits. First, it is able to locate documents when few, if any, of the keywords exist within them. Second, it improves data browsing and deals with keyword ambiguity by segmenting the documents into topics.

This paper presents the design and the implementation of an architecture for the analysis of data streams in distributed environments. In particular, data stream analysis has been carried out for the computation of items and itemsets that exceed a frequency threshold. The mining approach is hybrid, that is, frequent items are calculated with a single pass, using a sketch algorithm, while frequent itemsets are calculated by a further multi-pass analysis. The architecture combines parallel and distributed processing to keep the pace with the rate of distributed data streams. In order to keep computation close to data, miners are distributed among the domains where data streams are generated. The paper reports the experimental results obtained with a prototype of the architecture, tested on a Grid composed of three domains each one handling a data stream.

Routine methods such as dry-and wet-sieving approaches are generally time consuming and tedious, which calls for a robust, fast, and nondestructive method of soil aggregate characterization. Over the last two decades, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) has emerged as a rapid and noninvasive technique for soil characterization. Combined with chemometric and data-mining algorithms, it provides an effective way of measuring several soil attributes and has the added advantage of being amenable to a remote sensing mode of operation. The objective of this study was to determine if the DRS approach could be used as a rapid, noninvasive technique to estimate soil aggregate characteristics. The DRS approach was examined for the estimation of soil aggregate characteristics such as the geometric mean diameter and two statistical parameters of the lognormal aggregate size distribution (ASD) functions using 910 soil samples from India representing three important soil groups. Results showed that the geometric mean diameter and the median aggregate size parameter provided excellent predictions, with ratio of performance deviation (RPD) values ranging from 1.99 to 2.28. The RPD value for the standard deviation of the ASD ranged from 1.36 to 1.72, suggesting moderate prediction. It was further observed that soil aggregates influence the incident electromagnetic radiation on soils primarily in the visible region and to some extent the shortwave-and near-infrared regions. Electronic transitions of Fe-bearing minerals, clay minerals, and C-H functional groups of organic matter may be responsible for modifying the spectral reflectance from soils in addition to the self-shadowing effects of surface roughness. The results of this study suggest that the chemometric approach may be combined with DRS to estimate soil aggregate size characteristics.	[Sarathjith, M.

This study focuses on the voltage control of the evacuation network which connects different wind farms to the transmission network bus. The main contribution of this study is to present a novel real time algorithm which can be used as an alternative to classical techniques such as optimal power flow or artificial intelligence to determine the amount of reactive power that each wind farm should supply in order to minimise the power losses of a whole evacuation network. The optimal voltage control proposed in this study uses data mining techniques (regression rules to estimate the optimum reactive power of the wind farms and classification trees to estimate the optimum transformer taps). The methodology proposed in this study is illustrated with a study of two actual evacuation networks in the Spanish power system. The first one is representative of long feeders whereas the second one is representative of short feeders. The variability in the results of the methodology seems to be dependent on the features of the grids.

Well permeability estimation and CO2 leakage rates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL			English	Article						Wellbore; Leakage rate; CO2 flux; Effective permeability; Sustained casing pressure; Surface casing vent flow	GEOLOGICAL STORAGE; TEMPERATURE; RESERVOIR; PRESSURE; BRINE	The risk of leakage along existing wellbores associated with CO2 sequestration depends strongly upon the leakage path permeabilities. Assuming the gas migration path through leaky wellbores in hydrocarbon reservoirs is analogous to the leakage path for CO2 plumes, the distribution of inferred permeabilities enables quantitative estimation of CO2 leakage rates. We estimate the effective permeabilities of about 300 wellbores in six different fields that exhibit sustained casing pressure (SCP) or surface casing vent flow (SCVF). Uncertain parameters that affect the estimated permeability, such as the location of the leak source, are accounted for by a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, yielding an expected value of leakage path permeability for each measurement of SCP or SCVF. The expected permeabilities along most of the leaky wellbores are between 10 mu d and 10 md. We further use a data mining approach to seek correlations between the permeabilities and wellbore characteristics. Using the wellbore permeabilities to estimate the aperture of the leakage pathways, we estimate the capillary pressure and hence the minimum CO2 plume heights required for CO2 to enter the leakage paths. We compute worst-case steady CO2 leakage fluxes, finding that over 90% of the fluxes are less than 0.1 ton/m(2)/yr, which are smaller than large persistent fluxes observed in nature. The majority of the leakage rates along the wellbores are less than 1 kg/yr, and the highest rates are less than 0.1 ton/yr. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods This article employs data mining with characteristics of executives worldwide against the state's Freedom House ranking. Results Through data mining, the results indicate that while there are still many important factors that coincide with democracy, the length of time in office and to a lesser extent the religious beliefs of executives and the likelihood of being classified as a democracy are heavily related. Conclusion This article concludes with a recommendation for supporting specific types of executives to increase the likelihood for successful democratization to minimize authoritarian rule.

To this end, we collect all cloud security patent applications (about 512 patent applications) from the United States Patent Trademark Office (USPTO) and apply data mining techniques to their titles. This allows us to identify unique keywords that these patent applications share, and to apply social network analysis to study the relationships between them. We then use cluster analysis to uncover specific focal innovation areas that correspond to the well-known confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad, thus complementing the USPTO classification of cloud security innovations. Our results reveal in particular that the area of cloud availability is under-investigated, suggesting that more innovation is needed on this front.

Consequently, the microbial networks and metabolic dynamics of bioprocesses catalyzed by these ecosystems are highly complex, and their visualization is regarded as essential to bioengineering technology and innovation. Here we describe a means of visualizing the variants in a microbial community and their metabolic profiles. The approach enables previously unidentified bacterial functions in the ecosystems to be elucidated. We investigated the anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated ethene in a soil column experiment as a case study. Microbial community and dechlorination profiles in the ecosystem were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and gas chromatography, respectively. Dechlorination profiles were obtained from changes in dechlorination by microbial community (evaluated by data mining methods). Individual microbes were then associated with their dechlorination profiles by heterogenous correlation analysis. Our correlation-based visualization approach enables deduction of the roles and functions of bacteria in the dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. Because it estimates functions and relationships between unidentified microbes and metabolites in microbial ecosystems, this approach is proposed as a control-logic tool by which to understand complex microbial processes.

Precise and timely information aids decision-making, which is widely accepted as intrinsically necessary for increased production and improved quality. Studies in this research domain, especially those related to data mining and interpretation are being carried out by the authors and their colleagues. Some of this work that relates to data definition, description, analysis, and modelling is described in this paper. This includes studies that have evaluated extreme dry/wet weather events against reported yield at different scales in general. They indicate the effects of weather extremes such as prolonged high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and severe wind gusts. Occurrences of these events are among the main weather extremes that impact on many crops worldwide. Wind gusts are difficult to anticipate due to their rapid manifestation and yet can have catastrophic effects on crops and buildings. This paper examines the use of data mining methods to reveal patterns in the weather conditions, such as time of the day, month of the year, wind direction, speed, and severity using a data set from a single location. Case study data is used to provide examples of how the methods used can elicit meaningful information and depict it in a fashion usable for management decision making. Historical weather data acquired between 2008 and 2012 has been used for this study from telemetry devices installed in a vineyard in the north of New Zealand. The results show that using data mining techniques and the local weather conditions, such as relative pressure, temperature, wind direction and speed recorded at irregular intervals, can produce new knowledge relating to wind gust patterns for vineyard management decision making.

It has successfully been applied to the gene function prediction in yeast, hypersensitive response in response to pathogen and human cancer. However, within the microarray data, there exists lots of unknown information which is worth mining. Based on mutants' signature genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, we constructed a reference matrix including 267 pairs of subsets of differential reference profiles. We analyzed our data through expression profiles and connectivity map. Two notable results were detected by comparing every mutant in the matrix. Above all, the data mining procedure confirmed the biological relations not only between different stresses and glucose metabolism, but also stresses and MAPK signaling pathway among HSP90, PGM, VTE1, AXR4, SFR6, and SFR2 mutants. In addition, sfr6 might be involved in light cycle regulations, in accordance with the results of the overlap analysis.

Semi-automatic support may reduce the time needed for the detection of such situations, generating early warnings that can prevent accidents or provide time to prepare countermeasures. In order to provide adequate cognitive support for operators and guide the design of more efficient surveillance systems, this paper investigates the human analytical reasoning process of detecting anomalous behavior through a case study, the surveillance of sea areas. The analysis of data gathered during interviews and participant observations at three maritime control centers and the inspection of video recordings of real incidents lead to a characterization of operators' analytical processes. We suggest how to support these processes using data mining and visualization, and we derive recommendations for designers and developers of future maritime control systems.

A new comprehensive model to simulate the restructured power market for seasonal price signals by considering on the wind resources	JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article							RELIABILITY EVALUATION; ELECTRICITY MARKETS; ENERGY; GENERATION; SYSTEMS; AVAILABILITY	Generation expansion planning requires simulating the medium term power market. This can be done based on electricity price signals in the power market. The market clearing price is one of the most important factors to determine the incremental rate of private investor's profit. When calculating this parameter, the planners encounter greater uncertainties in a restructured power market than in a centralized market. This can be critical when renewable energies participate in this type of electricity market. In this study, the scenario based method is used to model a wind power plant in the restructured power market. The hourly output of the wind turbine generators is simulated based on a hybrid Auto Regressive and Moving Average-Monte Carlo method. Each scenario of the wind power plant as well as its occurrence probability is determined based on a data mining technique. Then, a new comprehensive model for the restructured power market is proposed to maximize the profit of investors as well as to determine the market clearing price by considering stochastic and rational uncertainties. The stochastic uncertainties include the demand and fuel price that are modelled by using the Monte-Carlo method. The Nash equilibrium in the rational uncertainty as a strategic behaviour of players in the power market is determined by using the Cournot game. The effect of the CO2 tax rate and the bilateral contract are investigated in this study. Finally, the model is implemented in a test power market. According to the findings, this model can be used as a robust and comprehensive model to determine the market clearing price which can be applied for capacity expansion planning.

To optimally operate these hybrid energy systems, one should consider the problems due to huge amount of raw data achieved through several measuring systems in different sections in a MG. In this paper, a new Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) is proposed and tested via simulation studies. The proposed SEMS performs some critical tasks such as data acquisition, data processing, and determining control signals for the MG. Two objective functions are defined for the SEMS to minimize the total operating cost and the net emission of the fossil fueled Distributed Generators with respect to some technical and reliability (Expected Energy Not Supplied index) constraints for the MG. The simulation results show a promising performance of the proposed SEMS for smart micro-grids. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Theoretically, an adequate bioinformatic analysis could allow identification of candidate antigen-specific antibodies, requiring their recombinant production for experimental validation of their specificity. Gene synthesis is commonly used for the generation of recombinant antibodies identified in silico. Novel strategies that bypass gene synthesis could offer more accessible antibody identification and validation alternatives. We developed a hybridization-based recovery strategy that targets the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) for the enrichment of cDNA of candidate antigen-specific antibody sequences. Ten clonal groups of interest were identified through bioinformatic analysis of the heavy chain antibody repertoire of mice immunized with hen egg white lysozyme (HEL). cDNA from eight of the targeted clonal groups was recovered efficiently, leading to the generation of recombinant antibodies. One representative heavy chain sequence from each clonal group recovered was paired with previously reported anti-HEL light chains to generate full antibodies, later tested for HEL-binding capacity. The recovery process proposed represents a simple and scalable molecular strategy that could enhance antibody identification and specificity assessment, enabling a more cost-efficient generation of recombinant antibodies.

This is particularly true for the equine species. Here we present a first Equine PeptideAtlas encompassing high-resolution tandem MS analyses of 51 samples representing a selection of equine tissues and body fluids from healthy and diseased animals. The raw data were processed through the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to yield high quality identification of proteins and peptides. The current release comprises 24131 distinct peptides representing 2636 canonical proteins observed at false discovery rates of 0.2% at the peptide level and 1.4% at the protein level. Data from the Equine PeptideAtlas are available for experimental planning, validation of new datasets, and as a proteomic data mining resource. The advantages of the Equine PeptideAtlas are demonstrated by examples of mining the contents for information on potential and well-known equine acute phase proteins, which have extensive general interest in the veterinary clinic. The extracted information will support further analyses, and emphasizes the value of the Equine PeptideAtlas as a resource for the design of targeted quantitative proteomic studies.

Accumulation of the research results imposed a challenge to integrate and interpret these results. To address this problem and better understand how the left ventricle (LV) remodels post-MI at both the molecular and cellular levels, we propose here an integrative framework that couples computational methods and experimental data. We selected an initial set of MI-related proteins from published human studies and constructed an MI-specific protein-protein-interaction network (MIPIN). Structural and functional analysis of the MIPIN showed that the post-MI LV exhibited increased representation of proteins involved in transcriptional activity, inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Known plasma or serum expression changes of the MIPIN proteins in patients with MI were acquired by data mining of the PubMed and UniProt knowledgebase, and served as a training set to predict unlabeled MIPIN protein changes post-MI. The predictions were validated with published results in PubMed, suggesting prognosticative capability of the MIPIN. Further, we established the first knowledge map related to the post-MI response, providing a major step towards enhancing our understanding of molecular interactions specific to MI and linking the molecular interaction, cellular responses, and biological processes to quantify LV remodeling.

CLASSIFICATION OF DAILY BODY WEIGHT GAINS IN BEEF CATTLE VIA NEURAL NETWORKS AND DECISION TREES	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Data mining; Detection; Genes; Heifers; Leptin; Myostatin; Prion protein	BOVINE LEPTIN GENE; DAIRY-COWS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; LYING BEHAVIOR; MYOSTATIN; MASTITIS; MUTATION; CLASSIFIERS; FREQUENCIES; REGRESSION	Daily body weight gains are an important indicator for the evaluation of beef production. The objective of this study was to verify the quality and detection abilities of selected data mining methods (artificial neural networks and decision trees) applied to the analysis of daily body weight gains in beef heifers. A total of 261 individuals (Charolais, Charolais x Simmental and Charolais x Hereford) were genotyped and their daily body weight gains were recorded. The genetic analysis included polymorphic variants of leptin, myostatin, and prion protein genes. The animals were divided into two categories: those with daily body weight gains equal to or lower than the mean for the analyzed population (99 heifers) and those with daily body weight gains higher than the mean (112 heifers). Heifer birth weight, breed, birth season, dam body weight at calving, calving interval, and genotypes were used as predictors. From among the analyzed models, the neural network with 8 neurons in a single hidden layer (root mean squared error equal to 0.4471). and the tree with an error coefficient of 0.4076 were selected These classifiers correctly detected 20 out of 27 heifers with daily body weight gains below the mean. In the case of heifers with daily body weight gains above the mean, neural networks correctly classified 17 out of 23 individuals, whereas decision tree only 14. Breed, leptin genotype and combined genotype turned out to be the most important variables contributing to the determination of body weight gains class for both types of classifiers.

The study also tested the suitability of the data mining method Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to detect common drug use initiation sequences in large-scale surveys. Methods: Data from 2007 to 2009 Annual Surveys of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use by Indiana Children and Adolescents were used for this study. A close-ended, self-administered questionnaire was used to ask adolescents about the use of 21 substance categories and the age of first use. "Support%" and "confidence%" statistics of Market Basket Analysis detected multiple and substitute addictions, respectively. Results: The lifetime prevalence of using any addictive substance was 73.3%, and it has been decreasing during past few years. Although the lifetime prevalence of PDM was 19.2%, it has been increasing. Males and whites were more likely to use drugs and engage in multiple addictions. Market Basket Analysis identified common drug use initiation sequences that involved 11 drugs. High levels of support existed for associations among alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, whereas associations that included prescription drugs had medium levels of support. Conclusions: Market Basket Analysis is useful for the detection of common substance use initiation sequences in large-scale surveys. Before initiation of prescription drugs, physicians should consider the adolescents' risk of addiction. Prevention programs should address multiple addictions, substitute addictions, common sequences in drug use initiation, sex and racial differences in PDM, and normative beliefs of parents and adolescents in relation to PDM.

In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection approach based on sparse representation theory, namely Sparsity Score (SS). Due to the sparse representation procedure, SS not only owns the global property of Variance Score (VS) and the local property of Laplacian Score (LS), but also possesses the discriminating nature. Experimental results, based on three well-known face datasets (Yale, ORL and CMU PIE), reveal that SS performs well in the evaluation of the feature significance, and it significantly outperforms VS and LS.

Therefore, the interest of the scientific community in learning Bayesian network structure from data is increasing: many techniques or disciplines such as data mining, text categorization, and ontology building, can take advantage from this process. In the literature, there are many structural learning algorithms but none of them provides good results for each dataset. This paper introduces a method for structural learning of Bayesian networks based on a MultiExpert approach. The proposed method combines five structural learning algorithms according to a majority vote combining rule for maximizing their effectiveness and, more generally, the results obtained by using of a single algorithm. This paper shows an experimental validation of the proposed algorithm on standard datasets.

The resulting exposure increases the relevance of efforts to assess their effects. The activities of NPs are related to many structural features, including their shape, composition and size. Applying Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods to nanoscale systems becomes challenging, due to the lack of data and insight into the fate and effects of NPs. In this study, the possible use of QSAR methods on NPs is investigated. To this intent, several ways of representing and describing NPs were tested by using different data mining methods. The main conclusion is that QSAR methods are relevant for the study of the activity of NPs, but this should be confirmed by using larger and more diverse sets of data. Moreover, representing the constitution of NPs (in terms of core, coating and surface modification) significantly increases the prediction accuracy of the models. In our case, the most significant features to be represented were found to be the core and surface modification.

In the current study, the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the two equation SST k-omega turbulence model has been utilized to simulation the transverse injection flow field with a freestream Mach number 3.75, and the influence of the turbulence model on the flow field properties has been evaluated as well. At the same time, three grid scales have been employed to perform the grid independency analysis, and the predicted results have been compared with the available experimental data in the open literature in order to carry out the code validation process. Further, the effect of the injector geometric configuration on the mixing efficiency of the transverse injection flow field has been investigated, and four different configurations have been considered in the current study, namely the square port, the diamond port, the equilateral triangular port and the circular port. The obtained results show that the case with the square injection port can obtain the largest mixing efficiency, and it can offer the rapidest near-field mixing between the injectant and the air. At last, the transverse injection flow field with the square injection port has been optimized by the surrogate-based evolutionary algorithm, and the relationships between the design variables and the objective functions have been explored by the variance analysis method. It is shown that the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio has a high remarkable impact on the total pressure recovery efficiency, as well as the number of the injection ports on the drag force performance. The drag force increases with the increase of the number of the injection ports due to the deeper penetration of the rear jets. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Hence, a systematic dissection of the sophisticated interplays between these individual disease genes and their functional involvements becomes essential. Here, we presented a novel knowledge-based approach to identify the functional modules for CAD. First, we selected 266 disease genes in CADgene database as the initial seed genes, and used PPI knowledge as a guide to expand these genes into a CAD-specific gene network. Then, we used Newman's algorithm to decompose the primary network into 14 compact modules with high modularity. By analysis of these modules, we further identified 114 hub genes, all either directly or indirectly associated with CAD. Finally, by functional analysis of these modules, we revealed several novel pathogenic mechanisms for CAD (for examples, some yet rarely concerned like peptide YY receptor activity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and actin cytoskeleton regulation etc.).

There is no existing work for incremental causal modeling over event streams. Our approach is based on Popper's three conditions which are generally accepted for inferring causality - temporal precedence of cause over effect, dependency between cause and effect, and elimination of plausible alternatives. We meet these conditions by proposing a novel incremental causal network construction algorithm. This algorithm infers causality by learning the temporal precedence relationships using our own new incremental temporal network construction algorithm and the dependency by adopting a state of the art incremental Bayesian network construction algorithm called the Incremental Hill-Climbing Monte Carlo. Moreover, we provide a mechanism to infer only strong causality, which provides a way to eliminate weak alternatives. This research benefits causal analysis over event streams by providing a novel two layered causal network without the need for prior knowledge. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a good candidate. However, owing to at least O(M-2) memory and time complexity, MDS is computationally demanding for interactive visualization of data sets consisting of order of 10(4) objects on computer systems, ranging from PC with multicore CPU processor, graphics processing unit (GPU) board to midrange MPI clusters. To explore interactively data sets of that size, we have developed novel efficient parallel algorithms for MDS mapping based on virtual particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the performance of our MDS algorithms implemented in compute unified device architecture environment on a PC equipped with a modern GPU board (Tesla M2090, GeForce GTX 480) is considerably faster than its MPI/OpenMP parallel implementation on the modern midrange professional cluster (10 nodes, each equipped with 2x Intel Xeon X5670 CPUs). We also show that the hybridized two-level MPI/CUDA implementation, run on a cluster of GPU nodes, can additionally provide a linear speedup. Copyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There are now dozens of databases providing drug-target interaction data with varying scope, and focus. Therefore, and due to the large chemical space, the overlap of the different data sets is surprisingly small. As searching through these sources manually is cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone, integrating all the data is highly desirable. Despite a few attempts, integration has been hampered by the diversity of descriptions of compounds, and by the fact that the reported activity values, coming from different data sets, are not always directly comparable due to usage of different metrics or data formats. Description: We have built Drug2Gene, a knowledge base, which combines the compound/drug-gene/protein information from 19 publicly available databases. A key feature is our rigorous unification and standardization process which makes the data truly comparable on a large scale, allowing for the first time effective data mining in such a large knowledge corpus. As of version 3.2, Drug2Gene contains 4,372,290 unified relations between compounds and their targets most of which include reported bioactivity data. We extend this set with putative ( i.e. homology-inferred) relations where sufficient sequence homology between proteins suggests they may bind to similar compounds. Drug2Gene provides powerful search functionalities, very flexible export procedures, and a user-friendly web interface. Conclusions: Drug2Gene v3.2 has become a mature and comprehensive knowledge base providing unified, standardized drug-target related information gathered from publicly available data sources. It can be used to integrate proprietary data sets with publicly available data sets. Its main goal is to be a `one-stop shop' to identify tool compounds targeting a given gene product or for finding all known targets of a drug. Drug2Gene with its integrated data set of public compound-target relations is freely accessible without restrictions at http://www.drug2gene.com.

To facilitate diagnosis, prognosis and characterization of these cancers, it is necessary to make full use of the immunological data on HPV available through publications, technical reports and databases. These data vary in granularity, quality and complexity. The extraction of knowledge from the vast amount of immunological data using data mining techniques remains a challenging task. To support integration of data and knowledge in virology and vaccinology, we developed a framework called KB-builder to streamline the development and deployment of web-accessible immunological knowledge systems. The framework consists of seven major functional modules, each facilitating a specific aspect of the knowledge-base construction process. Using KB-builder, we constructed the Human Papillomavirus T cell Antigen Database (HPVdb). It contains 2781 curated antigen entries of antigenic proteins derived from 18 genotypes of high-risk HPV and 18 genotypes of low-risk HPV. The HPVdb also catalogs 191 verified T cell epitopes and 45 verified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. Primary amino acid sequences of HPV antigens were collected and annotated from the UniProtKB. T cell epitopes and HLA ligands were collected from data mining of scientific literature and databases. The data were subject to extensive quality control (redundancy elimination, error detection and vocabulary consolidation). A set of computational tools for an in-depth analysis, such as sequence comparison using BLAST search, multiple alignments of antigens, classification of HPV types based on cancer risk, T cell epitope/HLA ligand visualization, T cell epitope/HLA ligand conservation analysis and sequence variability analysis, has been integrated within the HPVdb. Predicted Class I and Class II HLA binding peptides for 15 common HLA alleles are included in this database as putative targets. HPVdb is a knowledge-based system that integrates curated data and information with tailored analysis tools to facilitate data mining for HPV vaccinology and immunology. To our best knowledge, HPVdb is a unique data source providing a comprehensive list of HPV antigens and peptides.

One of them, k-means, has been elected as one of the most influential data mining algorithms for being simple, scalable and easily modifiable to a variety of contexts and application domains. Although distributed versions of k-means have been proposed, the algorithm is still sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster prototypes and requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance. In this paper, we propose the use of evolutionary algorithms to overcome the k-means limitations and, at the same time, to deal with distributed data. Two different distribution approaches are adopted: the first obtains a final model identical to the centralized version of the clustering algorithm; the second generates and selects clusters for each distributed data subset and combines them afterwards. The algorithms are compared experimentally from two perspectives: the theoretical one, through asymptotic complexity analyses; and the experimental one, through a comparative evaluation of results obtained from a collection of experiments and statistical tests. The obtained results indicate which variant is more adequate for each application scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Naldi, M.

J	Daume, S; Albert, M; von Gadow, K				Daume, Stefan; Albert, Matthias; von Gadow, Klaus			Forest monitoring and social media - Complementary data sources for ecosystem surveillance?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forest monitoring; Forest observational studies; Social media mining; Forest ecosystem services; Anthropocene; Societal context	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES; SCIENCE; FACE; WEB	Forest monitoring captures human impacts and other biotic and abiotic influences on forests and is a prerequisite for the sustainable use and protection of forest ecosystems. Forest inventories for example are a key tool to plan sustainable harvesting, whereas Forest Observational Studies provide the empirical basis for an improved understanding and long-term evaluation of forest ecosystem dynamics. To that end detailed data is collected at stand level, often integrated in larger forest observational networks, which feeds into forest ecosystem models. Forests exist however in a constantly changing societal context and the direct or indirect impact of human activity has become a crucial driver on all types of ecosystems. The Millenium Ecosystem Assessment underlines the linkage between social and ecological systems, highlighting the centrality of ecosystem services to human well-being and the requirement for ecosystem monitoring in the "anthropocene" to provide a holistic view of ecosystems as social-ecological systems. Framing information about the social context of a forest ecosystem, gaining the expertise and providing resources to collect this type of information is usually outside the scope of data collection for forest inventories and monitoring. Studies in other domains faced a similar challenge and turned to data mining informal online information sources to supplement traditional monitoring and data collection strategies. This paper explores how forest monitoring approaches especially Forest Observational Studies with their long-term and large-scale focus may be complemented by social media mining. We outline (a) how social media mining methods from other domains could be applied to forest monitoring, (b) discuss identification of stakeholders, events and demands on forest ecosystems as examples of social contextual information that could be obtained via this route and (c) explain how this information could be automatically mined from social media, online news and other similar online information sources. The proposed approach is discussed on the basis of examples from a broad set of other domains. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A better understanding of these mechanisms and the detection of new resistance genes can improve crop production and food supply. Extracting this knowledge from available genomic data is a challenging task. Results: Here, we evaluate the usefulness of clustering, data-mining and regression to identify potential new resistance genes. Three types of analyses were conducted separately over two conditions, tomatoes inoculated with Phytophthora infestans and not inoculated tomatoes. Predictions for 10 new resistance genes obtained by all applied methods were selected as being the most reliable and are therefore reported as potential resistance genes. Conclusion: Application of different statistical analyses to detect potential resistance genes reliably has shown to conduct interesting results that improve knowledge on molecular mechanisms of plant resistance to pathogens.

Statistical significance of climate sensitivity predictors obtained by data mining	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						data mining; climate sensitivity; CMIP; intercomparison; ensemble	CARBON-DIOXIDE; FIELD SIGNIFICANCE; SEASONAL CYCLE; TEMPERATURE; CIRCULATION; EQUILIBRIUM; ATMOSPHERE; MODELS	Several recent efforts to estimate Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) focus on identifying quantities in the current climate which are skillful predictors of ECS yet can be constrained by observations. This study automates the search for observable predictors using data from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The primary focus of this paper is assessing statistical significance of the resulting predictive relationships. Failure to account for dependence between models, variables, locations, and seasons is shown to yield misleading results. A new technique for testing the field significance of data-mined correlations which avoids these problems is presented. Using this new approach, all 41,741 relationships we tested were found to be explainable by chance. This leads us to conclude that data mining is best used to identify potential relationships which are then validated or discarded using physically based hypothesis testing.

Here we address this problem by developing a hierarchical graph sampling/data mining approach to reduce conformational space and accelerate global sampling of candidate topologies. Starting from a 2D structure, we construct an initial graph from size measures deduced from solved RNAs and junction topologies predicted by our data-mining algorithm RNAJAG trained on known RNAs. We sample these graphs in 3D space guided by knowledge-based statistical potentials derived from bending and torsion measures of internal loops as well as radii of gyration for known RNAs. Graph sampling results for 30 representative RNAs are analyzed and compared with reference graphs from both solved structures and predicted structures by available programs. This comparison indicates promise for our graph-based sampling approach for characterizing global helical arrangements in large RNAs: graph rmsds range from 2.52 to 28.24 angstrom for RNAs of size 25-158 nucleotides, and more than half of our graph predictions improve upon other programs. The efficiency in graph sampling, however, implies an additional step of translating candidate graphs into atomic models. Such models can be built with the same idea of graph partitioning and build-up procedures we used for RNA design.

With the newly developed next generation sequencing technology, a large amount of transcribed sequences of alfalfa have been generated and are available for identifying SSR markers by data mining. A total of 54,278 alfalfa non-redundant unigenes were assembled through the Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 sequencing technology. Based on 3,903 unigene sequences, 4,493 SSRs were identified. Tri-nucleotide repeats (56.71%) were the most abundant motif class while AG/CT (21.7%), AGG/CCT (19.8%), AAC/GTT (10.3%), ATC/ATG (8.8%), and ACC/GGT (6.3%) were the subsequent top five nucleotide repeat motifs. Eight hundred and thirty-seven EST-SSR primer pairs were successfully designed. Of these, 527 (63%) primer pairs yielded clear and scored PCR products and 372 (70.6%) exhibited polymorphisms. High transferability was observed for ssp falcata at 99.2% (523) and 71.7% (378) in M. truncatula. In addition, 313 of 527 SSR marker sequences were in silico mapped onto the eight M. truncatula chromosomes. Thirty-six polymorphic SSR primer pairs were used in the genetic relatedness analysis of 30 Chinese alfalfa cultivated accessions generating a total of 199 scored alleles. The mean observed heterozygosity and polymorphic information content were 0.767 and 0.635, respectively. The codominant markers not only enriched the current resources of molecular markers in alfalfa, but also would facilitate targeted investigations in marker-trait association, QTL mapping, and genetic diversity analysis in alfalfa.

This problem is often exacerbated by the ever-increasing sophistication of technology and costs related to programming and maintenance. Traditional development methods tend to be costly and inflexible and not client centered. The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of Agile software development and outcomes of a three-phase mHealth program designed to help young adult Quebecers quit smoking. Methods: In Phase I, literature reviews, focus groups, interviews, and behavior change theory were used in the adaption and re-launch of an existing evidence-based mHealth platform. Based on analysis of user comments and utilization data from Phase I, the second phase expanded the service to allow participants to live text-chat with counselors. Phase II evaluation led to the third and current phase, in which algorithms were introduced to target pregnant smokers, substance users, students, full-time workers, those affected by mood disorders and chronic disease. Results: Data collected throughout the three phases indicate that the incremental evolution of the intervention has led to increasing numbers of smokers being enrolled while making functional enhancements. In Phase I (240 days) 182 smokers registered with the service. 51% (n = 94) were male and 61.5% (n = 112) were between the ages of 18-24. In Phase II (300 days), 994 smokers registered with the service. 51% (n = 508) were male and 41% (n = 403) were between the ages of 18-24. At 174 days to date 873 smokers have registered in the third phase. 44% (n = 388) were male and 24% (n = 212) were between the ages of 18-24. Conclusions: Emerging technologies in behavioral science show potential, but do not have defined best practices for application development. In phased-based projects with limited funding, Agile appears to be a viable approach to building and expanding digital tools.

Analysing microarray expression data through effective clustering	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Bioinformatics; Clustering; Biological data analysis	GENE-EXPRESSION; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	The recent advances in genomic technologies and the availability of large-scale microarray datasets call for the development of advanced data analysis techniques, such as data mining and statistical analysis to cite a few. Among the mining techniques proposed so far, cluster analysis has become a standard method for the analysis of microarray expression data. It can be used both for initial screening of patients and for extraction of disease molecular signatures. Moreover, clustering can be profitably exploited to characterize genes of unknown function and uncover patterns that can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Finally, clustering biological data would be useful not only for exploring the data but also for discovering implicit links between the objects. To this end, several clustering approaches have been proposed in order to obtain a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency of the clustering process. In particular, great attention has been devoted to hierarchical clustering algorithms for their accuracy in unsupervised identification and stratification of groups of similar genes or patients, while, partition based approaches are exploited when fast computations are required. Indeed, it is well known that no existing clustering algorithm completely satisfies both accuracy and efficiency requirements, thus a good clustering algorithm has to be evaluated with respect to some external criteria that are independent from the metric being used to compute clusters. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm called M-CLUBS (for Microarray data CLustering Using Binary Splitting) exhibiting higher accuracy than the hierarchical ones proposed so far while allowing a faster computation with respect to partition based approaches. Indeed, M-CLUBS is faster and more accurate than other algorithms, including k-means and its recently proposed refinements, as we will show in the experimental section. The algorithm consists of a divisive phase and an agglomerative phase; during these two phases, the samples are repartitioned using a least quadratic distance criterion possessing unique analytical properties that we exploit to achieve a very fast computation. M-CLUBS derives good clusters without requiring input from users, and it is robust and impervious to noise, while providing better speed and accuracy than methods, such as BIRCH, that are endowed with the same critical properties. Due to the structural feature of microarray data (they are represented as arrays of numeric values), M-CLUBS is suitable for analyzing them since it is designed to perform well for Euclidean distances. In order to stronger the obtained results we Interpreted the obtained clusters by a domain expert and the evaluation by quality measures specifically tailored for biological validity assessment.

The output of GWAS can be high in amount and high dimensional, also relations between SNPs, phenotypes and diseases are most likely to be nonlinear. In order to handle high volume-high dimensional data and to be able to find the nonlinear relations we have utilized data mining approaches and a hybrid feature selection model of support vector machine and decision tree has been designed. The designed model is tested on prostate cancer data and for the first time combined genotype and phenotype information is used to increase the diagnostic performance. We were able to select phenotypic features such as ethnicity and body mass index, and SNPs those map to specific genes such as CRR9, TERT. The performance results of the proposed hybrid model, on prostate cancer dataset, with 90.92% of sensitivity and 0.91 of area under ROC curve, shows the potential of the approach for prediction and early detection of the prostate cancer.

Sportomics: Building a new concept in metabolic studies and exercise science	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Proteomics; Metabolomics; Sports science; Metabolism; Biochemistry of exercise	ELITE SOCCER PLAYERS; BRAIN MYOSIN-V; SUPPLEMENTATION; AMMONIA; INJURY; GLUTAMINE; ATHLETE; BLOOD; TRIAL; ACIDS	For more than a decade, we have used alternative approaches to understand metabolic responses to physical stress. In addition to classic laboratory studies (cell and animal models), we have used elite athletes and sports to examine metabolic stress. Our central question involves the ability of the body to protect the central nervous system from high and toxic ammonemia during acute and chronic exercise. Information about this problem can aid in understanding important signaling pathways, which may yield better ways to protect people who suffer from diseases that lead to hyperammonemia, such as liver failure, or to hypermetabolic states, such as cancer or thermal injury. We proposed a Sportomics approach to mimic the real challenges and conditions that are faced during sports training and competition. Sportomics is non-hypothesis-driven research on an individual's metabolite changes during sports and exercise. It is similar to metabolomics and other "-omics" approaches, but Sportomics focuses on sports as a metabolic challenge. Our study is holistic and top-down; we treat the data systematically and have generated a large computer-searchable database. We also propose that in-field metabolic analyses are important for understanding, supporting and training elite athletes. In this review, we discuss Sportomics history, problems, benefits and results. We included different weather conditions, such as temperature, wind and humidity, and diverse metabolic responses due to uneven sleep and eating behaviors near the time of the experiment. We are currently generating databases as well as data-mining principles and procedures to improve metabolomics and proteomics studies as well as adding genomics and transcriptomics studies to the Sportomics approach. We believe that this approach can fill a methodological gap between systems biology and translational medicine similar as a bench to the field approach. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We also describe the relationship between network structures and function of elements that form it. Next, we highlight the role of the interactome in connecting data derived from different experiments, and we stress the importance of network analysis to recognize interaction context-specific features. Finally, we present an example integration to demonstrate the value of the network approach in cancer research, and highlight the importance of dynamic data in the specific context of signaling pathways.

Mg2+ coordinating dynamics in Mg:ATP fueled motor proteins	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							F-1-ATPASE MOLECULAR MOTOR; PARTICLE MESH EWALD; MYOSIN MOTOR; ATP; WATER; MAGNESIUM; SIMULATIONS; MECHANISM; COMPLEXES; PHOSPHATE	The coordination of Mg2+ with the triphosphate group of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in motor proteins is investigated using data mining and molecular dynamics. The possible coordination structures available from crystal data for actin, myosin, RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase, DNA helicase, and F-1-ATPase are verified and investigated further by molecular dynamics. Coordination states are evaluated using structural analysis and quantified by radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and pair interaction energy calculations. The results reveal a diverse range of both transitory and stable coordination arrangements between Mg2+ and ATP. The two most stable coordinating states occur when Mg2+ coordinates two or three oxygens from the triphosphate group of ATP. Evidence for five-site coordination is also reported involving water in addition to the triphosphate group. The stable states correspond to a pair interaction energy of either similar to-2750 kJ/mol or -3500 kJ/mol. The role of water molecules in the hydration shell surrounding Mg2+ is also reported.

J	Meredig, B; Wolverton, C				Meredig, Bryce; Wolverton, C.			Dissolving the Periodic Table in Cubic Zirconia: Data Mining to Discover Chemical Trends	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							X-RAY-ABSORPTION; OXIDE FUEL-CELL; STABILIZATION; CONDUCTIVITY; DOPANTS; SURFACE	Doped zirconias comprise a chemically diverse, technologically important class of materials used in catalysis, energy generation, and other key applications. The thermodynamics of zirconia doping, though extremely important to tuning these materials' properties, remains poorly understood. We address this issue by performing hundreds of very large-scale density functional theory defect calculations on doped cubic zirconia systems and elucidate the dilute-limit stability of essentially all interesting cations on the cubic zirconia lattice. Although this comprehensive thermodynamics database is useful in its own right, it raises the question: what forces mechanistically drive dopant stability in zirconia? A standard tactic to answering such questions is to identify generally by chemical intuition, a simple, easily measured, or predicted descriptor property, such as boiling point, bulk modulus, or density, that strongly correlates with a more complex target quantity (in this case, dopant stability). Thus, descriptors often provide important clues about the underlying chemistry of real-world systems. Here, we create an automated methodology, which we call clustering-ranking-modeling (CRM), for discovering robust chemical descriptors within large property databases and apply CRM to zirconia dopant stability. CRM, which is a general method and operates on both experimental and computational data, identifies electronic structure features of dopant oxides that strongly predict those oxides' stability when dissolved in zirconia.

A web-portal for interactive data exploration, visualization, and hypothesis testing	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						data exploration; data sharing; genetics; data dictionary; imaging; hypothesis testing	TOOLKIT; MODEL	Clinical research studies generate data that need to be shared and statistically analyzed by their participating institutions. The distributed nature of research and the different domains involved present major challenges to data sharing, exploration, and visualization. The Data Portal infrastructure was developed to support ongoing research in the areas of neurocognition, imaging, and genetics. Researchers benefit from the integration of data sources across domains, the explicit representation of knowledge from domain experts, and user interfaces providing convenient access to project specific data resources and algorithms. The system provides an interactive approach to statistical analysis, data mining, and hypothesis testing over the lifetime of a study and fulfills a mandate of public sharing by integrating data sharing into a system built for active data exploration. The web-based platform removes barriers for research and supports the ongoing exploration of data.

We recommend a new approach for PQ analysis that addresses several major problems of prior works, including algorithm execution time, computational complexity, and accuracy. This paper suggests an effective and comprehensive method, so-called "integrated approach", for extracting features using integration of discrete wavelet transform and hyperbolic S transform. Moreover, a comparative assessment of PQDs recognition using various combinations of different Feature Selection (FS) and classification methods is presented. FS can reduce the dimension of feature space which leads to better performance of detection system. Four well-known FS techniques namely modified relief, mutual information, sequential forward selection, sequential backward selection and three benchmark classifiers, are considered. The particle swarm optimization is used to obtain optimal parameters of these classifiers. The key attribute of this paper is that it yields good time-frequency resolution with low computation burden for optimal PQ monitoring structure. Empirical results show that the proposed structures can yield an automatic online/offline monitoring of PQ with sparser structures and less computational execution time, both in the training and recognition phases, without sacrificing generality of performance.

The data mining process of collected Raman spectra was performed with principal component analysis (PCA). Pure fat samples, extracted from forty-nine meat beef and horsemeat samples, were analysed using the Raman spectroscopy. All meat samples were classified successfully according to their origins. The presence of different concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, w/w) of horsemeat in beef was also differentiated using the developed model system. This study offers a rapid assay for determination of meat adulteration by discriminating beef and horsemeat with high accuracy, a short analysis time (30 s) and no requirement for time-consuming sample preparation procedures.

Endmember extraction (EE) is an important technique to obtain spectrally identifiable image pixels to provide a supplementary solution to field sampling. However, most current EE methods are based on simplex models and thus rarely consider capricious occurrences in the data. The new approach developed in this paper synthesizes two quantitative measures of chaotic tendencies, Lyapunov index (L) and correlation dimension (D) into an integrated statistic, L and D for EE. L and D reconstructs a spectral dataset into phases, over which the chaotic or complex characteristics hidden in the dataset could be rearranged into predictable sequences. Therefore, better endmembers could be selected from the spectral or hyperspectral dataset. The usability and applicability of L and D are tested against the USGS standard spectral library first and then with a Hyperion image classification in Wulate Zhongqi (central county) of Inner Mongolia in China. L and D, along with four other methods, PPI+n-DV+GRPs, SMACC, VCA, and PPI+VCA, is applied to extract endmembers, which are used as the surrogates of GRPs for creating the training and testing samples and classifying the Hyperion image with two classifiers, spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machine (SVM). The classification results based on GRPs derived from L and D have the overall accuracy and kappa statistics, 81.93% and 0.7905 (by SAM) or 84.11% and 0.814% (by SVM), whereas the other four methods have lower accuracies.

This study predicted coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration equipment under varying amounts of refrigerant (R404A) with the aids of data mining (DM) techniques. The performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), classification and regression tree (CART), multiple regression (MR), generalized linear regression (GLR), and chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) were applied within DM process. After obtaining the COP value, abnormal equipment conditions can be evaluated for refrigerant leakage. Analytical results from cross-fold validation method are compared to determine the best models. The study shows that DM techniques can be used for accurately and efficiently predicting COP. In the liquid leakage phase, ANNs provide the best performance. In the vapor leakage phase, the best model is the GLR model. Experimental results confirm that systematic analyses of model construction processes are effective for evaluating and optimizing refrigeration equipment performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, it is important to gain an objective understanding of how average individuals respond to real-life events they observe in environments they encounter. The.aims of this paper are to introduce the concept of observer stress and investigate whether a computational model can be developed to recognize observer stress using physiological and physical response sensor signals. The paper discusses the motivations for the investigation and details the experiments for data collection for observers of real-life settings which used unobtrusive methods suited to real-life environments. It describes an individual-independent support vector machine based model classifier to recognize stress patterns from observer response signals. A genetic algorithm is used for feature selection to build a classifier. The classifier recognized observer stress with an accuracy of 98%. The outcomes of this research provide a new application area for knowledge discovery and data mining to predict human stress response to real-life environments and a possible future extension on managing stress objectively.

Business experts can directly enter the rules into appropriate software without error prone communication with programmers. However, not all business situations and possible data quality problems can be considered in advance. In situations where business rules have not been defined yet, patterns of data handling may arise in practice. We employ data mining to accounting transactions in order to discover such patterns. The discovered patterns are represented in form of association rules. Then, deviations from discovered patterns can be marked as potential data quality violations that need to be examined by humans. Data quality breaches can be expensive but manual examination of many transactions is also expensive. Therefore, the goal is to find a balance between marking too many and too few transactions as being potentially erroneous. We apply appropriate procedures to evaluate the classification accuracy of developed association rules and support the decision on the number of deviations to be manually examined based on economic principles.

A tie strength based model to socially-enhance applications and its enabling implementation: mySocialSphere	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social Web; Software as a Service; Data mining; Tie strength; Social spheres	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; NETWORKING; PRIVACY	The growing omnipresence of the Social Web and the increasingly number of services in the Cloud have created a favourable atmosphere to develop socially-enhanced services, that is, services which are aware of the social dimension of the users to improve their experience in the Cloud. This paper introduces a model and an architecture for socially-enhanced services by mining interaction information across different Social Web sites. Most of the existing social applications require knowing who are the users socially-linked to each individual by exploring topological connections in social networks or, even, calculating the interactions network that underlies social sites. However these approaches are, on the one hand, hardly scalable when the number of users grows in the interaction network and, on the other hand, tightly coupled to the social application and so hardly reusable. The key contribution of this paper is a user-centred model whose goal is not to infer the aforementioned interaction network, but to build users' social spheres. That is, assessing the strength and the context of the user's ties by using signs of interaction available from social sites APIs (private messages, retweets, mentions,...) with user's permission. To this aim, contrary to previous approaches, we take into account (i) different interaction types and contexts, (ii) the time in which interactions occur, (iii) the people involved in them and (iv) the interactions rhythms with the rest of user's contacts. A prototype of this service has been implemented in order to, not only validate the tie strength model, but also to deploy some pilot experiences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The SPIE is designed to improve the memory efficiency by storing in a bloom filter the information on packets that are passing through routers, but the bloom filter must be initialized periodically because of its limited memory. Thus, there is a problem that the SPIE cannot trace back the attack packets that passed through the routers earlier. To address this problem, this paper proposes an IP Traceback Protocol (ITP) that uses a Compressed Hash Table, a Sinkhole Router and Data Mining based on network forensics against network attacks. The ITP embeds in routers the Compressed Hash Table Module (CHTM), which compresses the contents of a Hash Table and also stores the result in a database. This protocol can trace an attack back not only in real time using a hash table but also periodically using a Compressed Hash Table (CHT). Moreover, the ITP detects a replay attack by attaching time-stamps to the messages and verifies its integrity by hashing it. This protocol also strengthens the attack packet filtering function of routers for the System Manager to update the attack list in the routers periodically and improves the Attack Detection Rate using the association rule among the attack packets with an Apriori algorithm.

Boolean matrix decomposition has frequently been applied to data mining and machine learning. In this paper, three types of existing covering approximation operators are represented by Boolean matrices, and then used in Boolean matrix decomposition. First, we define two characteristic matrices of a covering. Through these Boolean characteristic matrices, three types of existing covering approximation operator are concisely and equivalently represented. Second, these operator representations are applied to Boolean matrix decomposition, which has a close relationship with nonnegative matrix factorization, a popular and efficient technique for machine learning. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a square Boolean matrix to decompose into the Boolean product of another matrix and its transpose. We then develop an algorithm for this Boolean matrix decomposition. Finally, these three covering approximation operators are axiomatized using Boolean matrices. This work presents an interesting viewpoint from which to investigate covering-based rough set theory and its applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The main characteristic of the ordinal scale is that the categories have a logical or ordered relationship to each other. Thus, the ordinal scale data processing is very common in marketing, satisfaction and attitudinal research. This study proposes a new data mining method, using a rough set-based association rule, to analyze ordinal scale data, which has the ability to handle uncertainty in the data classification/sorting process. The induction of rough-set rules is presented as method of dealing with data uncertainty, while creating predictive if-then rules that generalize data values, for the beverage market in Taiwan. Empirical evaluation reveals that the proposed Rough Set Associational Rule (RSAR), combined with rough set theory, is superior to existing methods of data classification and can more effectively address the problems associated with ordinal scale data, for exploration of a beverage product spectrum.

The numerical models present in the literature are continuously growing, but the complexity inherent to the process and the limits of current computers make it impossible to carry out a complete modelling process, being necessary to carry out important simplifications on the models. Taking into account these limitations of numerical models, the use of data mining techniques is proposed for the analysis and modelling of the ESP's performance, the advantages of which are the possibility to include a large amount of complex phenomena and factors and their applicability to any ESP, regardless of its specific configuration or shape. This approach is especially interesting for the analysis of ESPs that have already been implemented, from which we can recover data and take into account the environment's characteristics. Furthermore, the resulting models can be used in optimisation processes in which the best ESP configuration is sought at all times, in order to maximise its yield. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the limited knowledge regarding the nature of secondary crashes largely impeded the development of established countermeasures. The primary goal of this paper is to improve the literature's understanding of secondary crashes. This goal is achieved in two steps: first, with an analysis framework that accurately identifies secondary crashes by integrating rich traffic-sensor data with statewide-crash data and, second, by carefully investigating the characteristics of these identified secondary crashes. To that end, secondary crashes within a 27-mile section of a major highway in New Jersey were mined using the developed analysis framework, and a thorough examination of their characteristics has been performed. Empirical findings on the frequency of secondary crashes, their spatio-temporal distributions, clearance time, crash type, severity, and major contributing factors have been highlighted. Taken together, these preliminary results could potentially help transportation agencies make more informed decisions on mitigating secondary crashes and improve their incident management operations. To complement the results, further in-depth investigations using more high-resolution sensor data and high-quality incident records are suggested.

Recently, finite Dirichlet mixture models have proved to be an effective and flexible model learning technique in several machine learning and data mining applications. In this article, the problem of learning and selecting finite Dirichlet mixture models is addressed using an expectation propagation (EP) inference framework. Within the proposed EP learning method, for finite mixture models, all the involved parameters and the model complexity (i.e. the number of mixture components), can be evaluated simultaneously in a single optimization framework. Extensive simulations using synthetic data along with two challenging real-world applications involving automatic image annotation and human action videos categorization demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve better results than comparable techniques.

Proteases recognize and cleave protein and peptide substrates at a well-defined position in a substrate binding groove and a plethora of experimental techniques provide insights into their substrate recognition. We investigate the caspase family of cysteine proteases playing a key role in programmed cell death and inflammation, turning caspases into interesting drug targets. Specific ligand binding to one particular caspase is difficult to achieve, as substrate specificities of caspase isoforms are highly similar. In an effort to rationalize substrate specificity of two closely related caspases, we investigate the substrate promiscuity of the effector Caspases 3 and 7 by data mining (cleavage entropy) and by molecular dynamics simulations. We find a strong correlation between binding site rigidity and substrate readout for individual caspase subpockets explaining more stringent substrate readout of Caspase 7 via its narrower conformational space. Caspase 3 subpockets S3 and S4 show elevated local flexibility explaining the more unspecific substrate readout of that isoform in comparison to Caspase 7. We show by in silico exchange mutations in the S3 pocket of the proteases that a proline residue in Caspase 7 contributes to the narrowed conformational space of the binding site. These findings explain the substrate specificities of caspases via a mechanism of conformational selection and highlight the crucial importance of binding site local dynamics in substrate recognition of proteases.

For these reasons, this study selects the coastal area of Taichung city in Central Taiwan as an example and implements a monitoring program with 40 samples. The results indicate that the concentration of total arsenic in the coastal areas is about 0.23-270.41 mu g L-1, which is obviously higher than the interior of Taichung city. Moreover, the seawater incursion and organic pollution in the study area may be the key factors resulting in the incubation of toxic substances. The results also indicate that As3+ is the main contributor to biological toxicity compared to other disinfection by-products. With the help of the visualized spatial pollutants pattern of groundwater, an advanced water quality control plan can be made. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The highly expressed HOXA9, HOXA11 and HOXD10 genes also appear to be involved in endometrial receptivity. Within the HOX family of homeobox transcription factor genes are the leading candidates for the regulation of embryonic implantation. A crucial role of HOXA10 in endometrial receptivity has been well established. To identify HOX candidate genes, we performed data mining on all 39 human HOX genes in the Human body index gene expression database of normal human tissue. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of four highly expressed HOX genes in the human endometrium was determined. To further investigate the function of these Hox genes, we used a robust in vivo mouse model in which we blocked maternal Hox gene expression. Analysis of a gene expression profile set in the public domain consisting of 504 samples representing 95 different normal human tissues, showed that in addition to HOXA10, also HOXA9, HOXA11, HOXB6 and HOXD10 mRNA showed increased expression in the human endometrium (16 samples). The temporal and spatial expression pattern of these four HOX genes throughout the menstrual cycle was determined in the endometrium from 27 female patients eligible for IVF-embryo transfer with a normal cycle by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry. The role of maternal Hoxa9, Hoxa11 and Hoxd10 was assessed in a mouse implantation model by expression knockdown using RNA interference. Forty mice were transfected with Hoxa9-, Hoxa11- or Hoxd10-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs or a vector control by injection into the uterine horn at Day 2 after vaginal plug detection (Day 1) (160 mice in total). The effects were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot at Day 4 and litter sizes counted at Day 9 of pregnancy. HOXA10, HOXA9, HOXA11 and HOXD10 all showed increased expression during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (P 0.01). Knockdown of Hoxa9, Hoxa11 and Hoxd10 in the murine uterus resulted in significantly reduced average implantation rates (P 0.01) and, with regard to four Hox target genes, also correlated with a significantly increased empty spiracles homolog 2 (Emx2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (Igfbp1), and decreased integrin 3 (Itgb3) and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), expression (P 0.01). Menstrual cycle stage was not confirmed by serum hormone analysis. We verified the absence of significant differences in stage-specific expression of the reference genes used in our study (ACTB/Actb and GAPDH/Gapdh) and therefore possible limitations of this approach were minimized. In addition, the translatability of our data from a mouse model to patients needs to be investigated further. We provide evidence that three other HOX genes in addition to HOXA10 are involved in endometrial receptivity, and that part of their function is asserted through several known HOX target genes, suggesting the presence of a central HOX signal transduction pathway.

In order to recommend a product to a user and predict that user's preference, CF utilizes product evaluation ratings of like-minded users. The process of finding like-minded users forms a social network among all users and each link between two users represents an implicit connection between them. Users having more connections with others are the most influential users. Attacking recommender systems is a new issue for these systems. Here, an attacker tries to manipulate a recommender system in order to change the recommendation output according to her wish. If an attacker succeeds, her profile is used over and over again by the recommender system, making her an influential user. In this study, we applied the established attack detection methods to the influential users, instead of the whole user set, to improve their attack detection performance. Experiments were conducted using the same settings previously used to test the established methods. The results showed that the proposed influence-based method had better detection performance and improved the stability of a recommender system for most attack scenarios. It performed considerably better than established detection methods for attacks that inserted low numbers of attack profiles (20-25 %).

JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Clinical information systems; Clinical workflow; Communication; Decision support; Data mining; Information visualization; Social networking; Big data	HEALTH-CARE; MEMORY; MEDIA	The adoption of social media technologies appears to enhance clinical outcomes through improved communications as reported by Bacigalupe (Fam Syst Heal 29(1):1-14, 2011). The ability of providers to more effectively, directly, and rapidly communicate among themselves as well as with patients should strengthen collaboration and treatment as reported by Bacigalupe (Fam Syst Heal 29(1):1-14, 2011). This paper is a case study in one organization's development of an internally designed and developed social technology solution termed "Unite." The Unite system combines social technologies' features including push notifications, messaging, community groups, and user lists with clinical workflow and applications to construct dynamic provider networks, simplify communications, and facilitate clinical workflow optimization. Modeling Unite as a social technology may ease adoption barriers. Developing a social network that is integrated with healthcare information systems in the clinical space opens the doors to capturing and studying the way in which providers communicate. The Unite system appears to have the potential to breaking down existing communication paradigms. With Unite, a rich set of usage data tied to clinical events may unravel alternative networks that can be leveraged to advance patient care.

It has been shown to be very effective on a variety of data classification problems. However, the strong assumption that all attributes are conditionally independent given the class is often violated in real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed in order to improve the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier by alleviating the attribute independence assumption. However, violation of the independence assumption can increase the expected error. Another alternative is assigning the weights for attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute weighted Naive Bayes classifier by considering weights to the conditional probabilities. An objective function is modeled and taken into account, which is based on the structure of the Naive Bayes classifier and the attribute weights. The optimal weights are determined by a local optimization method using the quasisecant method. In the proposed approach, the Naive Bayes classifier is taken as a starting point. We report the results of numerical experiments on several real-world data sets in binary classification, which show the efficiency of the proposed method.

Preliminary presumed range of design parameter in base-isolated machinery systems could be narrowed down via entropy-based classification (EBC) by finding an appropriate cutting point for a proper design range. The designs for the modified parametric ranges through EBC effectively raise isolator's energy-absorbing ability. However, in this pervious work, when all the possible cases are considered to modify the designs of the base-isolated system, the examined parametric ranges might be a little large. If only one cutting point from EBC is used, some uncertainties in a large parametric range could make imprecise design strategies. Accordingly, modified EBC (MEBC) is introduced in this study for finding more cutting points. Simply speaking, MEBC is the use of EBC more than once. However, some additional limitations must be redefined for EBC to reduce the influence of uncertainty data. A case study is practically presented in this study. Designs for a lead rubber bearing's base-isolated machinery model located at Central Science Park in Taiwan are made. Ten excitations of Chi-Chi earthquake from different stations nearby the park are considered. In the results, they are verified that appropriate design strategies from MEBC could raise isolator's energy-absorbing ability and lower machinery's maximum deformation.

EXOD aims at helping the users to find datasets of interest. EXOD starts with the download of a large collection of datasets from an open data web site. For each dataset, it extracts its meta-data and its content. To describe each dataset in a vector space, EXOD extracts features by using text mining techniques. It considers both the metadata and the content of each dataset. Using this feature space, EXOD establishes a proximity graph by computing the Relative Neighborhood Graph. Considering the size of the collection, EXOD uses a GPU-based implementation for building this graph. We visualize the graph using the Tulip software and provide a visual and interactive global map of the collection. We developed a specific plug-in for Tulip to download and open the datasets in an interactive way. All of the presented results concern the French Open Data. EXOD was able to process 293,000 datasets, and half of this collection was visualized in Tulip. We show how clusters and other information can be discovered and how the created links can be used for local and content-based exploration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A challenge for providers is to recruit and retain parents in programs. Studies researching engagement with programs have largely focused on providers', policy makers', or researchers' reflections of their experience of parents' participation. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies where parents had been asked why they did or did not choose to commence, or complete programs, and compared these perceptions with those of researchers and those delivering programs. We used data-mining techniques to identify relevant studies and summarized findings using framework synthesis methods. Six facilitator and five barrier themes were identified as important influences on participation, with a total of 33 subthemes. Participants focused on the opportunity to learn new skills, working with trusted people, in a setting that was convenient in time and place. Researchers and deliverers focused on tailoring the program to individuals and on the training of staff. Participants and researchers/deliverers therefore differ in their opinions of the most important features of programs that act as facilitators and barriers to engagement and retention. Program developers need to seek the views of both participants and deliverers when evaluating programs.

Historical failures within Scarborough, Ontario, Canada, reveal a seasonal pattern to water main failures, with the majority of failures occurring during the very cold winter months. Extensive installation of cement mortar lining and cathodic protection have extended the life span of aging water mains and reduced escalating failure rates. Artificial neural networks are found to be capable of predicting the time to failure for individual pipes using a range of pipe-specific attributes, including diameter, length, soil type, construction year, and the number of previous failures. The developed models have correlation coefficients ranging from 0.70-0.82 on instances reserved for evaluating predictive performance and have utility on an asset-by-asset basis when planning water main inspection, maintenance, and rehabilitation. Simulated failure scenarios indicate a return to high failure rates if cement mortar lining and cathodic protection are not extended to all candidate pipes in the distribution system.

Examples of such applications come from astronomy, biology, the web, and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of time series in the order of hundreds of millions to billions. However, all relevant techniques that have been proposed in the literature so far have not considered any data collections much larger than one-million time series. In this paper, we describe SAX 2.0 and its improvements, SAX 2.0 Clustered and SAX2+, three methods designed for indexing and mining truly massive collections of time series. We show that the main bottleneck in mining such massive datasets is the time taken to build the index, and we thus introduce a novel bulk loading mechanism, the first of this kind specifically tailored to a time series index. We show how our methods allows mining on datasets that would otherwise be completely untenable, including the first published experiments to index one billion time series, and experiments in mining massive data from domains as diverse as entomology, DNA and web-scale image collections.

However, in some contexts, e.g., when the need is to minimize a certain cost function, discovering rare data correlations is more interesting than mining frequent ones. This paper tackles the issue of discovering rare and weighted itemsets, i.e., the infrequent weighted itemset (IWI) mining problem. Two novel quality measures are proposed to drive the IWI mining process. Furthermore, two algorithms that perform IWI and Minimal IWI mining efficiently, driven by the proposed measures, are presented. Experimental results show efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

One critical assumption made by those algorithms has always been cycle-free routing. The existence of even one cycle may lead all peers to the wrong outcome. Outside the lab, unfortunately, cycle freedom is not easy to achieve. This work is the first to lift the requirement of cycle freedom by presenting a local thresholding algorithm suitable for general network graphs. The algorithm relies on a new repositioning of the problem in weighted vector arithmetics, on a new stopping rule, whose proof does not require that the network be cycle free, and on new methods for balance correction when the stopping rule fails. The new stopping and update rules permit calculation of the very same functions that were calculable using previous algorithms, which do assume cycle freedom. The algorithm is implemented on a standard peer-to-peer simulator and is validated for networks of up to 80,000 peers, organized in three different topologies representative of major current distributed systems: the Internet, structured peer-to-peer systems, and wireless sensor networks.

In online social media, networked data consists of multiple dimensions/entities such as users, tags, photos, comments, and stories. We are interested in finding a group of users who interact significantly on these media entities. In a co-citation network, we are interested in finding a group of authors who relate to other authors significantly on publication information in titles, abstracts, and keywords as multiple dimensions/entities in the network. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a framework (MultiComm) to identify a seed-based community in a multi-dimensional network by evaluating the affinity between two items in the same type of entity (same dimension) or different types of entities (different dimensions) from the network. Our idea is to calculate the probabilities of visiting each item in each dimension, and compare their values to generate communities from a set of seed items. In order to evaluate a high quality of generated communities by the proposed algorithm, we develop and study a local modularity measure of a community in a multi-dimensional network. Experiments based on synthetic and real-world data sets suggest that the proposed framework is able to find a community effectively. Experimental results have also shown that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better in accuracy than the other testing algorithms in finding communities in multi-dimensional networks.

The current leading protocol is that of Kantarcioglu and Clifton [18]. Our protocol, like theirs, is based on the Fast Distributed Mining (FDM) algorithm of Cheung et al. [8], which is an unsecured distributed version of the Apriori algorithm. The main ingredients in our protocol are two novel secure multi-party algorithms-one that computes the union of private subsets that each of the interacting players hold, and another that tests the inclusion of an element held by one player in a subset held by another. Our protocol offers enhanced privacy with respect to the protocol in [18]. In addition, it is simpler and is significantly more efficient in terms of communication rounds, communication cost and computational cost.

J	Hong, JH; Su, ZLT; Lu, EHC				Hong, Jung-Hong; Su, Zeal Li-Tse; Lu, Eric Hsueh-Chan			A recommendation framework for remote sensing images by spatial relation analysis	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Remote sensing image; Spatial ranking; Data mining	REPRESENTING TOPOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS; DATABASES; MODELS	In recent years, Remote Sensing Images (RS-Images) are widely recognized as an essential geospatial data due to their superior ability to offer abundant and instantaneous ground truth information. One of the active RS-Image approaches is the RS-Image recommendation from the Internet for meeting the user's queried Area-of-Interest (AOI). Although a number of studies on RS-Image ranking and recommendation have been proposed, most of them only consider the spatial distance between RS-Image and AOI. It is inappropriate since both of the RS-Image and AOI not only have the spatial information but also the cover range information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Location-based rs-Image Finding Engine (LIFE) to rank and recommend a series of relevant RS-Images to users according to the user-specific AOI. In LIFE, we first propose a cluster-based RS-Image index structure to efficiently maintain the large amount of RS-Images. Then, two quantitative indicators named Available Space (AS) and Image Extension (IE) are proposed to measure the Extensibility and Centrality between RS-Image and AOI, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on RS-Image recommendation that considers the issues of extensibility and centrality simultaneously. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, the experiment result shows that both indicators have their own distinguished ranking behaviors and are able to successfully recommend meaningful RS-Image results. Besides, the experimental results show that the proposed LIFE framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Hausdorff in terms of Precision, Recall and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

Psycho-Informatics: Big Data shaping modern psychometrics	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							INTERNET ADDICTION; SLEEP MEDICINE; ACTIGRAPHY; DEPRESSION; SCALE	For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

NeuCube: A spiking neural network architecture for mapping, learning and understanding of spatio-temporal brain data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Spiking neural networks; Spatio-temporal brain data; Pattern recognition; Data mining; EEG; FMRI; Neurogenetic data; Gene regulatory networks; Computational neuro-genetic modeling; Associative memory; Finite automata for spatio-temporal data	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; STATES; MODEL; EEG	The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine. Spatio- and spectra-temporal brain data (STBD) are the most commonly collected data for measuring brain response to external stimuli. An enormous amount of such data has been already collected, including brain structural and functional data under different conditions, molecular and genetic data, in an attempt to make a progress in medicine, health, cognitive science, engineering, education, neuro-economics, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying computational framework to deal with all these types of data in order to better understand this data and the processes that generated it. Standard machine learning techniques only partially succeeded and they were not designed in the first instance to deal with such complex data. Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal with STBD. This paper reviews some methods of spiking neural networks (SNN) and argues that SNN are suitable for the creation of a unifying computational framework for learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG, fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and interaction. One of the reasons is that SNN use the same computational principle that generates STBD, namely spiking information processing. This paper introduces a new SNN architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of concrete models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model is based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of structural and functional areas of interest of the brain related to the modeling STBD. Gene information is included optionally in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRN) if this is relevant to the problem and the data. A NeuCube model learns from STBD and creates connections between clusters of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of neuronal activity. Once learning is applied, a NeuCube model can reproduce these trajectories, even if only part of the input STBD or the stimuli data is presented, thus acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework can be used not only to discover functional pathways from data, but also as a predictive system of brain activities, to predict and possibly, prevent certain events. Analysis of the internal structure of a model after training can reveal important spatio-temporal relationships 'hidden' in the data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a single subject (personalized modeling) or to a population of subjects. The use of NeuCube for classification of STBD is illustrated in a case study problem of EEG data. NeuCube models result in a better accuracy of STBD classification than standard machine learning techniques. They are robust to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD and the brain conditions under which data was collected. Future directions for the use of SNN for STBD are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Particularly, based on data-mining for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) codec voice, a novel QoE assessment methodology is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to assessing speech quality of fixed rate codec mode (CM) of AMR while in the other one a adaptive rate CM is designed. Measuring basic network parameters that have much impact on speech quality, QoE can be monitored in real time for operators. Meanwhile, based on the measurement data sets from real mobile network, the QoE prediction strategy can be implemented and QoE assessment model for AMR codec voice is trained and tested. Finally, the numerical results suggest that the correlation coefficient between predicted values and true values is greater than 90% and root mean squared error is less than 0.5 for fixed and adaptive rate CM.

Data-mining among microbial community samples could facilitate the discovery of valuable biological information that is still hidden in the massive data. However, current methods for the comparison among microbial communities are limited by their ability to process large amount of samples each with complex community structure. Summary: We have developed an optimized GPU-based software, GPU-Meta-Storms, to efficiently measure the quantitative phylogenetic similarity among massive amount of microbial community samples. Our results have shown that GPU-Meta-Storms would be able to compute the pair-wise similarity scores for 10240 samples within 20 min, which gained a speed-up of >17000 times compared with single-core CPU, and >2600 times compared with 16-core CPU. Therefore, the high-performance of GPU-Meta-Storms could facilitate in-depth data mining among massive microbial community samples, and make the real-time analysis and monitoring of temporal or conditional changes for microbial communities possible.

Studying 25,988 trading strategies for emerging foreign exchange markets, we find that the best rules can sometimes generate an annual mean excess return of more than 30%. Based on standard tests, we find hundreds to thousands of seemingly significant profitable strategies. However, almost all of these profits vanish once the data snooping bias is taken into account. Overall, we show that the profitability of technical analysis is illusory. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Community detection has recently attracted considerable attention in the field of data mining and social network analysis. Existing community detection methods require too much space and are very time consuming for moderate-to-large networks. We propose a bottom up community detection method in which starting with fine-grained communities we find real communities of a network. Merging preliminary small communities is done in a hybrid way to maximize two quality functions: modularity and NMI. We show that our way of community detection is better or as effective as the other community detection algorithms while it has better time and space complexity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although CSM have been widely used, they are not suitable to meet growing demands for high resolution soil information at field scales. We present a repeatable method to disaggregate CSM data into similar to 30-meter resolution rasterized soil class maps that include continuous representation of probabilistic map uncertainty. Methods include training set creation for original CSM component soil classes from soil-landscape descriptions within the original survey database. Training sets are used to build a random forest predictive model utilizing environmental covariate maps derived from ASTER satellite imagery and the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Results showed agreement at 70 percent of independent field validation sites and equivalent accuracy between original CSM map units and the disaggregated map. Uncertainty of predictions was mapped by relating prediction frequencies of the random forest model and success rates at validation sites.

Data mining driven DMAIC framework for improving foundry quality - a case study	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						six-sigma; CART; CHAID; DMAIC; casting defect; data mining; decision tree; foundry	SIGMA METHODOLOGY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMPROVEMENT; REGRESSION; TREE; INDUSTRY; DEFECTS; MODELS	Six Sigma Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) methodology has been widely used across industries as the best systematic and data driven problem solving approach for quality improvement. Statistical Design of Experiment (DOE) is used in the 'Improve' stage for obtaining optimal process settings for significant variables contributing towards quality improvement. But, DOE is an offline activity requiring time and other resources for conducting experiments and analyses. Further, there are many small and medium scale enterprises that cannot afford to conduct DOE. Under such practical constraints, it is desirable to apply DMAIC using online process data under day-to-day production situations or with little changes in process settings without compromising production. In this article, we propose a DMAIC framework, driven by data mining techniques for defect diagnosis and quality improvement where historical and online process data can be effectively utilised. We have used two decision tree algorithms namely, Classification and Regression Tree and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection in developing the proposed framework. The proposed approach is applied in an Indian grey iron foundry where conducting DOE is not a feasible option for the management. The result demonstrates a significant reduction in casting defect and validates the practical viability of this approach.

The performance of these methods has been investigated in chromatographic fingerprint data of olive oil blends with other vegetable oils without needing either to identify or to quantify the chromatographic peaks. Different data mining methods-classification and regression trees, random forest and M5 rules-were tested for classification and prediction. In addition, these classification and regression tree approaches were also used for feature selection prior to modelling in order to reduce the number of attributes in the chromatogram. The good outcomes have shown that these methods allow one to obtain interpretable models with much more information than the traditional chemometric methods and provide valuable information for detecting which vegetable oil is mixed with olive oil and the percentage of oil used, with a single chromatogram.

A Murine Uterine Transcriptome, Responsive to Steroid Receptor Coactivator-2, Reveals Transcription Factor 23 as Essential for Decidualization of Human Endometrial Stromal Cells(1)	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						decidualization; endometrium; human; microarray; mouse; progesterone; steroid receptor coactivator-2; transcription factor 23	PROGESTERONE-RECEPTOR; EMBRYO IMPLANTATION; MAMMARY MORPHOGENESIS; MOUSE UTERUS; EXPRESSION; GENE; MECHANISMS; DISEASE; COREGULATOR; PREGNANCY	Recent data from human and mouse studies strongly support an indispensable role for steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2)-a member of the p160/SRC family of coregulators-in progesterone- dependent endometrial stromal cell decidualization, an essential cellular transformation process that regulates invasion of the developing embryo into the maternal compartment. To identify the key progesterone-induced transcriptional changes that are dependent on SRC-2 and required for endometrial decidualization, we performed comparative genome-wide transcriptional profiling of endometrial tissue RNA from ovariectomized SRC-2(flox/flox) (SRC-2(f/f) [control]) and PRcre/+/SRC-2(flox/flox) (SRC-2(d/d) [SRC-2-depleted]) mice, acutely treated with vehicle or progesterone. Although data mining revealed that only a small subset of the total progesterone-dependent transcriptional changes is dependent on SRC-2 (similar to 13%), key genes previously reported to mediate progesterone-driven endometrial stromal cell decidualization are present within this subset. Along with providing a more detailed molecular portrait of the decidual transcriptional program governed by SRC-2, the degree of functional diversity of these progesterone mediators underscores the pleiotropic regulatory role of SRC-2 in this tissue. To showcase the utility of this powerful informational resource to uncover novel signaling paradigms, we stratified the total SRC-2-dependent subset of progesterone-induced transcriptional changes in terms of novel gene expression and identified transcription factor 23 (Tcf23), a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a new progesteroneinduced target gene that requires SRC-2 for full induction. Importantly, using primary human endometrial stromal cells in culture, we demonstrate that TCF23 function is essential for progesterone-dependent decidualization, providing crucial translational support for this transcription factor as a new decidual mediator of progesterone action.

The data mining approach presented herein is shown capable of unlocking information contained within inspection records and enhances existing pipe inspection practices currently used in the wastewater industry. Predictive models developed using the random forests algorithm are found capable of predicting individual sewer pipe condition so that uninspected pipes in a sewer network with the greatest likelihood of being in a structurally defective condition state are identified for future rounds of inspection. Complications posed by imbalance between classes common within inspection datasets are overcome by first establishing the classification task in a binary format (where pipes are in either good or bad structural condition) and then using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to establish alternative cutoffs for the predicted class probability. The random forests algorithm achieved a stratified test set false negative rate of 18%, false positive rate of 27% and an excellent area under the ROC curve of 0.81 in a case study application to the City of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The novel inclusion of condition information of pipes attached at either the upstream or downstream manholes of an individual pipe enhances the predictive power for bad pipes representing the minority class of interest (reducing the false negative rate to 11%, reducing the false positive rate to 25% and increasing the area under the ROC curve to 0.85). An area under the ROC curve > 0.80 indicates random forests are an "excellent" choice for predicting the condition of individual pipes in a sewer network.

The impact of prior use of these medications on outcomes in critically ill patients has not been previously examined. We performed a retrospective study to determine if preadmission use of SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is associated with mortality differences in patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: The retrospective study used a modifiable data mining technique applied to the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) 2.6 database. A total of 14,709 patient records, consisting of 2,471 in the SSRI/SNRI group and 12,238 control subjects, were analyzed. The study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: After adjustment for age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, vasopressor use, ventilator use, and combined Elixhauser score, SSRI/SNRI use was associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.40; P =.026). Among patient subgroups, risk was highest in patients with acute coronary syndrome (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21-3.13; P =.006) and patients admitted to the cardiac surgery recovery unit (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.04; P =.008). Mortality appeared to vary by specific SSRI, with higher mortalities associated with higher levels of serotonin inhibition. Conclusions: We found significant increases in hospital stay mortality among those patients in the ICU taking SSRI/SNRIs prior to admission as compared with control subjects. Mortality was higher in patients receiving SSRI/SNRI agents that produce greater degrees of serotonin reuptake inhibition. The study serves to demonstrate the potential for the future application of advanced data examination techniques upon detailed (and growing) clinical databases being made available by the digitization of medicine.

MLH-IDS: A Multi-Level Hybrid Intrusion Detection Method	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						IDS; supervised; unsupervised; multi-level; outlier; features	DETECTION SYSTEM; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; NETWORK; CHALLENGES; OUTLIERS; DATASET	With the growth of networked computers and associated applications, intrusion detection has become essential to keeping networks secure. A number of intrusion detection methods have been developed for protecting computers and networks using conventional statistical methods as well as data mining methods. Data mining methods for misuse and anomaly-based intrusion detection, usually encompass supervised, unsupervised and outlier methods. It is necessary that the capabilities of intrusion detection methods be updated with the creation of new attacks. This paper proposes a multi-level hybrid intrusion detection method that uses a combination of supervised, unsupervised and outlier-based methods for improving the efficiency of detection of new and old attacks. The method is evaluated with a captured real-time flow and packet dataset called the Tezpur University intrusion detection system (TUIDS) dataset, a distributed denial of service dataset, and the benchmark intrusion dataset called the knowledge discovery and data mining Cup 1999 dataset and the new version of KDD (NSL-KDD) dataset. Experimental results are compared with existing multi-level intrusion detection methods and other classifiers. The performance of our method is very good.	[Gogoi, Prasanta; Bhattacharyya, D.

A partial periodic pattern considers part of but not all the events within a specific period length, repeating with high frequency in an event sequence. Traditional partial periodic pattern mining, however, only considered the frequencies of patterns, but did not consider events that might have different importance. The study thus proposes a weighted partial periodic patterns mining algorithm to resolve this problem. To increase the efficiency, the two-phase upper-bound weighted model based on segmental maximum weights is adopted to prune unimportant candidates in early stage. Then the weighted partial periodic patterns are discovered from the candidate patterns. Finally, the experimental results on synthetic datasets and a real oil dataset show that the weighted partial periodic pattern mining is more practical to assist users for decision making.

However, while classification is a well-established subject, biomarker identification lacks standards and validation of its methods. Validation of biomarker identification methods is difficult because, unlike classification, there is usually no reference biomarker against which to test the biomarkers extracted by a method. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess and improve the stability of biomarkers derived by a method, and to compare biomarkers derived by different method set-ups and between different methods by means of a proposed biomarkers similarity index.

While subgroup describing rules are themselves good explanations of the subgroups, domain ontologies can provide additional descriptions to data and alternative explanations of the constructed rules. Such explanations in terms of higher level ontology concepts have the potential of providing new insights into the domain of investigation. We show that this additional explanatory power can be ensured by using recently developed semantic SD methods. We present a new approach to explaining subgroups through ontologies and demonstrate its utility on a motivational use case and on a gene expression profiling use case where groups of patients, identified through SD in terms of gene expression, are further explained through concepts from the Gene Ontology and KEGG orthology. We qualitatively compare the methodology with the supporting factors technique for characterizing subgroups. The developed tools are implemented within a new browser-based data mining platform ClowdFlows.

Many different methods were proposed to either enumerate sequences of set valued data (i.e., itemsets) or sequences containing dimensional items. However, in real-world scenarios, data sequences are described as combination of both multidimensional items and itemsets. These heterogeneous descriptions cannot be handled by traditional approaches. In this paper we propose a new approach called MMISP (Mining Multidimensional Itemset Sequential Patterns) to extract patterns from complex sequential database including both multidimensional items and itemsets. The novelties of the proposal lies in: (i) the way in which the data are efficiently compressed; (ii) the ability to reuse and adopt sequential pattern mining algorithms and (iii) the extraction of new kind of patterns. We introduce a case-study on real-world data from a regional healthcare system and we point out the usefulness of the extracted patterns. Additional experiments on synthetic data highlights the efficiency and scalability of the approach MMISP.

This strategy is demonstrated for two case studies; the design of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases with improved regioselectivity and of thiamine diphosphate dependent enzymes with improved stereoselectivity. In both families, two selectivity hotspots are found in almost all sequences, and simple, generic rules are established to predict the effect of mutations at these positions on selectivity. The crucial role of the hotspot positions is validated for an increasing number of enzymes by designing variants with improved or switched selectivity.

J	Eriksson, R; Werge, T; Jensen, LJ; Brunak, S				Eriksson, Robert; Werge, Thomas; Jensen, Lars Juhl; Brunak, Soren			Dose-Specific Adverse Drug Reaction Identification in Electronic Patient Records: Temporal Data Mining in an Inpatient Psychiatric Population	DRUG SAFETY			English	Article							SAFETY; CARE; SURVEILLANCE; TOLERABILITY; NATIONWIDE; EVENTS; DESIGN; RISKS	Data collected for medical, filing and administrative purposes in electronic patient records (EPRs) represent a rich source of individualised clinical data, which has great potential for improved detection of patients experiencing adverse drug reactions (ADRs), across all approved drugs and across all indication areas. The aim of this study was to take advantage of techniques for temporal data mining of EPRs in order to detect ADRs in a patient- and dose-specific manner. We used a psychiatric hospital's EPR system to investigate undesired drug effects. Within one workflow the method identified patient-specific adverse events (AEs) and links these to specific drugs and dosages in a temporal manner, based on integration of text mining results and structured data. The structured data contained precise information on drug identity, dosage and strength. When applying the method to the 3,394 patients in the cohort, we identified AEs linked with a drug in 2,402 patients (70.8 %). Of the 43,528 patient-specific drug substances prescribed, 14,736 (33.9 %) were linked with AEs. From these links we identified multiple ADRs (p < 0.05) and found them to occur at similar frequencies, as stated by the manufacturer and in the literature. We showed that drugs displaying similar ADR profiles share targets, and we compared submitted spontaneous AE reports with our findings. For nine of the ten most prescribed antipsychotics in the patient population, larger doses were prescribed to sedated patients than non-sedated patients; five patients exhibited a significant difference (p < 0.05). Finally, we present two cases (p < 0.05) identified by the workflow. The method identified the potentially fatal AE QT prolongation caused by methadone, and a non-described likely ADR between levomepromazine and nightmares found among the hundreds of identified novel links between drugs and AEs (p < 0.05). The developed method can be used to extract dose-dependent ADR information from already collected EPR data. Large-scale AE extraction from EPRs may complement or even replace current drug safety monitoring methods in the future, reducing or eliminating manual reporting and enabling much faster ADR detection.

To overcome this limitation, exact condensed representations were introduced in order to offer a small-sized set of elements from which the faithful retrieval of all frequent patterns is possible. In this paper, we introduce a new exact condensed representation only based on particular elements from the disjunctive search space. In this space, a pattern is characterized by its disjunctive support, the frequency of complementary occurrences instead of the ubiquitous co-occurrence link of its items. For several benchmark datasets, this representation has been shown interesting in compactness terms compared to the pioneering approaches of the literature. In this respect, we mainly focus here on proposing an efficient tool for mining this representation. For this purpose, we introduce an algorithm, called DSSRM, dedicated to this task. We also propose several techniques to optimize its mining time as well as its memory consumption. The carried out empirical study on benchmark datasets shows that DSSRM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the MEP algorithm.

The literature is classified into three general classes of manufacturing system design, manufacturing system operation, and simulation language/package development. The paper further categorizes the literature into 11 subclasses based on the application area. The current review contributes to the literature in three significant ways: (1) it provides a wide coverage by reviewing 290 papers; (2) it provides a detailed analysis of different aspects of the literature to identify research trends through innovative data mining approaches as well as insights derived from the review process; and (3) it updates and extends the existing classification schemes through identification and inclusion of recently emerged application areas and exclusion of obsolete categories. The results of the literature analysis are then used to make suggestions for future research. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interestingly, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains +3000 protein 3D structures with unknown function. Thus, we can in principle, discover new Ls mining non-annotated structures from PDB or other sources. However, there are no general models to predict new biologically relevant Ls based on 3D chemical structures. We used the MARCH-INSIDE software to calculate the Markov-Shannon 3D electrostatic entropy parameters for the complex networks of protein structure of 2200 different protein 3D structures, including 1200Ls. We have performed a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using these parameters as inputs in order to seek a new Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model, which is able to discriminate 3D structure of Ls from other proteins. We implemented this predictor in the web server named LECTINPred, freely available at http://bio-aims.udc.es/LECTINPred.php. This web server showed the following goodness-of-fit statistics: Sensitivity=96.7% (for Ls), Specificity=87.6% (non-active proteins), and Accuracy=92.5% (for all proteins), considering altogether both the training and external prediction series. In mode 2, users can carry out an automatic retrieval of protein structures from PDB. We illustrated the use of this server, in operation mode 1, performing a data mining of PDB. We predicted Ls scores for +2000 proteins with unknown function and selected the top-scored ones as possible lectins. In operation mode 2, LECTINPred can also upload 3D structural models generated with structure-prediction tools like LOMETS or PHYRE2. The new Ls are expected to be of relevance as cancer biomarkers or useful in parasite vaccine design.

During evolution, organellar proteomes are modified by gene gain and loss, by gene subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization, and by changes in protein targeting. To date, proteomics data for plastids and mitochondria are available for only a few plant model species, and evolutionary analyses of high-throughput data are scarce. We combined quantitative proteomics, cross-species comparative analysis of metabolic pathways, and localizations by fluorescent proteins in the model plant Physcomitrella patens in order to assess evolutionary changes in mitochondrial and plastid proteomes. This study implements data-mining methodology to classify and reliably reconstruct subcellular proteomes, to map metabolic pathways, and to study the effects of postendosymbiotic evolution on organellar pathway partitioning. Our results indicate that, although plant morphologies changed substantially during plant evolution, metabolic integration of organelles is largely conserved, with exceptions in amino acid and carbon metabolism. Retargeting or regulatory subfunctionalization are common in the studied nucleus-encoded gene families of organelle-targeted proteins. Moreover, complementing the proteomic analysis, fluorescent protein fusions revealed novel proteins at organelle interfaces such as plastid stromules (stroma-filled tubules) and highlight microcompartments as well as intercellular and intracellular heterogeneity of mitochondria and plastids. Thus, we establish a comprehensive data set for mitochondrial and plastid proteomes in moss, present a novel multilevel approach to organelle biology in plants, and place our findings into an evolutionary context.

Understanding new paradigm of plant metabolomes through secondary metabolite enrichment	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Data-mining tools; High throughput screening systems; In-silico analysis; plant cell culture; secondary metabolites	FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; CELL BIOTECHNOLOGY; BIOSYNTHESIS; CULTURES; BIOCHEMISTRY; PATHWAYS; BIOLOGY	Recent achievements in the metabolic engineering of plant secondary metabolism have helped to modulate various pathways using genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes or genes encoding regulatory proteins. To increase secondary metabolite production, different strategies such as the metabolic reactions in a pathway should overcome rate limiting steps, reduce catabolism and over-expression of regulatory genes can be pursued. New functional compounds can be discovered by using high throughput systems. The metabolic pathways and its genes involved can be determined by studying functional genomics and computational approaches. In silico analysis and docking studies of inhibitors that regulate enzymes and their role in secondary metabolite enrichment have been already elucidated. Functional genomics approaches are powerful tools to accelerate comprehensive investigations of cellular metabolism in specialized tissues or whole organisms. The technology of large-scale plant cell culture is feasible for the industrial production of plant-derived fine chemicals but economically there is low productivity of desired compounds. In recent years, metabolic engineering has opened new promising perspectives for improved production of secondary metabolites in a plant or plant cell culture and find applications in pharmaceuticals, insecticides, dyes and perfumery.

Data-mining-based intelligent anti-islanding protection relay for distributed generations	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article							VECTOR SURGE RELAYS; DECISION TREES; SHIFT	A data-mining-based intelligent anti-islanding detection scheme for distributed generation (DG) protection has been presented. The process starts at deriving highly involved features using discrete Fourier transform-based pre-processor at the DG end. The features derived include both positive and negative sequence quantities and related features. Once the features are retrieved, the decision tree is trained to build a data-mining model for identifying the islanding events from non-islanding situations, including disturbances close to islanding conditions. The proposed anti-islanding relay is extensively tested on simulation model and provides encouraging results considering wide variations in operating conditions. Further, the validation is extended on real-time digital simulator module to test the efficacy of the proposed anti-islanding relay. The test results indicate that the proposed anti-islanding relay can reliably detect islanding conditions while meeting the speed criteria.

Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. Cases were identified by the presence of reports of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in which statins were the suspected drug. Non-cases were all the reports of the same reactions induced by drugs other than statins. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidential interval (CI) was calculated as a measure of disproportionality. Results: A total of 44,959,104 drug-reaction pairs was found in 2,681,739 reports. Significant RORs were found for both voiding (ROR; 1.16,95% CI; 1.10 - 1.23) and storage symptoms (ROR; 1.25, 95% CI; 1.20 - 1.30). Analysis of individual statins showed that rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for voiding symptoms, while simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for storage symptoms. Of the four voiding symptoms, significant RORs were found for urine flow decrease and dysuria. Of the four storage symptoms, significant RORs were found for pollakiuria and nocturia. No fundamental differences in disproportionality were observed between genders. Conclusions: Analysis of the FAERS database showed small but reliable signals for LUTS in statin users. The mechanism responsible for these reactions is unknown. However, these adverse events should be monitored closely.

Making full use of these data in the big data era is of great significance for us to better understand the changing world and the information-based society. Though politics have been integrally involved in the hyperlinked world issues since the 1990s, the text analysis and data visualization of geo-events faced the bottleneck of traditional manual analysis. Though automatic assembly of different geospatial web and distributed geospatial information systems utilizing service chaining have been explored and built recently, the data mining and information collection are not comprehensive enough because of the sensibility, complexity, relativity, timeliness, and unexpected characteristics of political events. Based on the framework of Heritrix and the analysis of web-based text, word frequency, sentiment tendency, and dissemination path of the Huangyan Island incident were studied by using web crawler technology and the text analysis. The results indicate that tag cloud, frequency map, attitudes pie, individual mention ratios, and dissemination flow graph, based on the crawled information and data processing not only highlight the characteristics of geo-event itself, but also implicate many interesting phenomenon and deep-seated problems behind it, such as related topics, theme vocabularies, subject contents, hot countries, event bodies, opinion leaders, high-frequency vocabularies, information sources, semantic structure, propagation paths, distribution of different attitudes, and regional difference of net citizens' response in the Huangyan Island incident. Furthermore, the text analysis of network information with the help of focused web crawler is able to express the time-space relationship of crawled information and the information characteristic of semantic network to the geo-events. Therefore, it is a useful tool to collect information for understanding the formation and diffusion of web-based public opinions in political events.

J	Tahat, A; Marti, J; Khwaldeh, A; Tahat, K				Tahat, Amani; Marti, Jordi; Khwaldeh, Ali; Tahat, Kaher			Pattern recognition and data mining software based on artificial neural networks applied to proton transfer in aqueous environments	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						pattern recognition; proton transfer; chart pattern; data mining; artificial neural network; empirical valence bond	EMPIRICAL VALENCE-BOND; TRANSFER ESIPT; WATER; TRANSPORT; EXAMPLE; JETS	In computational physics proton transfer phenomena could be viewed as pattern classification problems based on a set of input features allowing classification of the proton motion into two categories: transfer 'occurred' and transfer 'not occurred'. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the use of artificial neural networks in the classification of proton transfer events, based on the feed-forward back propagation neural network, used as a classifier to distinguish between the two transfer cases. In this paper, we use a new developed data mining and pattern recognition tool for automating, controlling, and drawing charts of the output data of an Empirical Valence Bond existing code. The study analyzes the need for pattern recognition in aqueous proton transfer processes and how the learning approach in error back propagation (multilayer perceptron algorithms) could be satisfactorily employed in the present case. We present a tool for pattern recognition and validate the code including a real physical case study. The results of applying the artificial neural networks methodology to crowd patterns based upon selected physical properties (e.g., temperature, density) show the abilities of the network to learn proton transfer patterns corresponding to properties of the aqueous environments, which is in turn proved to be fully compatible with previous proton transfer studies.

J	Klann, JG; Szolovits, P; Downs, SM; Schadow, G				Klann, Jeffrey G.; Szolovits, Peter; Downs, Stephen M.; Schadow, Gunther			Decision support from local data: Creating adaptive order menus from past clinician behavior	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Clinical Decision Support; Data mining; Bayesian analysis	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; SYSTEMS; PHYSICIANS; CARE; SAFETY; ENTRY; CURVE	Objective: Reducing care variability through guidelines has significantly benefited patients. Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop and evaluate a complementary approach - using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which describes a healthcare system that learns from itself. Materials and methods: We used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining approach. Results: A short order menu on average contained the next order (weighted average length 3.91-5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good: average AUC above 0.9 for 25% of order types and overall average AUC .714-.844 (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50-.99). Higher AUC correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent. Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to enhance decision support. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A comparison of four direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometers at the Spallation Neutron Source	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							CHOPPER SPECTROMETER	The Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory now hosts four direct geometry time-of-flight chopper spectrometers. These instruments cover a range of wave-vector and energy transfer space with varying degrees of neutron flux and resolution. The regions of reciprocal and energy space available to measure at these instruments are not exclusive and overlap significantly. We present a direct comparison of the capabilities of this instrumentation, conducted by data mining the instrument usage histories, and specific scanning regimes. In addition, one of the common science missions for these instruments is the study of magnetic excitations in condensed matter systems. We have measured the powder averaged spin wave spectra in one particular sample using each of these instruments, and use these data in our comparisons. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Stone, M.

If diagnosed in the early stages, there is a high probability of a cure. Several statistical-based approaches have been developed to assist in early breast cancer detection. This paper presents a method for selection of variables for the classification of cases into two classes, benign or malignant, based on cytopathological analysis of breast cell samples of patients. The variables are ranked according to a new index of importance of variables that combines the weighting importance of Principal Component Analysis and the explained variance based on each retained component. Observations from the test sample are categorized into two classes using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Discriminant Analysis, followed by elimination of the variable with the index of lowest importance. The subset with the highest accuracy is used to classify observations in the test sample. When applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database, the proposed method led to average of 97.77% in classification accuracy while retaining an average of 5.8 variables.

J	Sankaran, S				Sankaran, Srikanth			Comparing Pay versus Performance of IPL Bowlers: An application of Cluster Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS IN SPORT			English	Article						Sports; Data Mining; Team Selection; Player Performance; K-means	BATTING PERFORMANCE; SEGMENTATION; CRICKET	Cricket is one of the sports where a large amount of data is generated in every game. In addition to popularity of existing formats of the game, the grand success of India at the first Twenty20 Cricket World Cup led to creation of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. It is a franchise based tournament where teams are formed by competitive bidding from a pool of Indian and International players. Since player salaries are determined through auctions, performance of individual players is regularly monitored by media and team owners. The purpose of this expost study is to investigate the relationship between player performance and valuation. Along with developing new performance metrics, we applied data mining (K-means cluster analysis) and identified four distinct groups of bowlers based on performance effectiveness. To validate findings, we overlaid cluster results by team ranking in 2013 and observed significant differences in team mix of top and poor performing teams. The study can be applied to assist team owners in deciding players to be retained for the next season, those who should be traded-in and those in need of additional coaching/mentoring.

J	Graening, L; Sendhoff, B				Graening, Lars; Sendhoff, Bernhard			Shape mining: A holistic data mining approach for engineering design	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Computer aided engineering; Data mining; Unified design representation; Design concepts; Sensitivity & interaction analysis; Passenger car design	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; RULE EXTRACTION; NETWORKS	Although the integration of engineering data within the framework of product data management systems has been successful in the recent years, the holistic analysis (from a systems engineering perspective) of multi-disciplinary data or data based on different representations and tools is still not realized in practice. At the same time, the application of advanced data mining techniques to complete designs is very promising and bears a high potential for synergy between different teams in the development process. In this paper, we propose shape mining as a framework to combine and analyze data from engineering design across different tools and disciplines. In the first part of the paper, we introduce unstructured surface meshes as meta-design representations that enable us to apply sensitivity analysis, design concept retrieval and learning as well as methods for interaction analysis to heterogeneous engineering design data. We propose a new measure of relevance to evaluate the utility of a design concept. In the second part of the paper, we apply the formal methods to passenger car design. We combine data from different representations, design tools and methods for a holistic analysis of the resulting shapes. We visualize sensitivities and sensitive cluster centers (after feature reduction) on the car shape. Furthermore, we are able to identify conceptual design rules using tree induction and to create interaction graphs that illustrate the interrelation between spatially decoupled surface areas. Shape data mining in this paper is studied for a multi-criteria aerodynamic problem, i.e. drag force and rear lift, however, the extension to quality criteria from different disciplines is straightforward as long as the meta-design representation is still applicable.

The need for automated and efficient management of the current networks, more specifically the Next Generation Network (NGN), is the subject addressed in this research. A detailed description of the management challenges in the context of current networks is presented and then this work enlists the desired features and characteristics of an efficient NMS. It then proposes that there is a need to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches for enhancing and automating the functions of NMS. The first contribution of this work is a comprehensive survey of the AI and ML approaches applied to the domain of NM. The second contribution of this work is that it presents the reasoning and evidence to support the choice of Bayesian Networks (BN) as a viable solution for ML-based NMS. The final contribution of this work is that it proposes and implements three novel NM solutions based on the BN approach, namely BN-based Admission Control (BNAC), BN-based Distributed Admission Control (BNDAC) and BN-based Intelligent Traffic Engineering (BNITE), along with the description of algorithms underpinning the proposed framework.

However, the size and operational costs of mobile networks are also growing. Self Organizing Networks (SON) are introduced as a part of the specifications of the LTE standard with the purpose of reducing the Operation and Maintenance costs of the mobile networks. This paper introduces a novel framework for automated Radio Resource Management (RRM) in LTE SON. This framework deals with the self-optimization and self-healing features of SON. The data mining technique of linear regression has been used to derive the functional relationship, known as model, between Key Performance Indicators and RRM parameters. The proposed framework uses this model in two ways: first, for network monitoring, which is the first step of the self-healing procedure and secondly, to devise a handover auto-tuning algorithm as part of the self-optimization procedure. The detailed results obtained for the finished case studies, demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of this approach.

The study aims at exploring the potential of machine learning algorithms in the context of an object-based image analysis and to thoroughly test the algorithm's performance under varying conditions to optimize their usage for urban pattern recognition tasks. Four classification algorithms, Normal Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Trees and Support Vector Machines, which represent different concepts in machine learning (probabilistic, nearest neighbor, tree-based, function-based), have been selected and implemented on a free and open-source basis. Particular focus is given to assess the generalization ability of machine learning algorithms and the transferability of trained learning machines between different image types and image scenes. Moreover, the influence of the number and choice of training data, the influence of the size and composition of the feature vector and the effect of image segmentation on the classification accuracy is evaluated.

A novel algorithm for fuzzy rule induction in data mining	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Fuzzy rule induction; fuzzy rules evaluation; fuzzy discretisation; fuzzy inference; membership functions; machine fault diagnosis	DECISION TREES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION RULES; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS; SEARCH; EXTRACTION; EXAMPLES; SYSTEMS	Rule induction as a method of constructing classifiers is of particular interest to data mining because it generates models in the form of If-Then rules which are more expressive and easier for humans to comprehend and check. Several induction algorithms have been developed to learn classification rules. However, most of these algorithms are based on 'crisp' data and produce 'crisp' models. This paper presents FuzzySRI, a novel algorithm based on the techniques of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic for inducing fuzzy classification rules. The algorithm possesses the clear knowledge representation capability of rule induction methods and the ability of fuzzy techniques to handle vague information. Experimental results show that FuzzySRI can outperform other fuzzy and non-fuzzy learning systems in terms of predictive accuracy, comprehensibility, and computational efficiency. It is also shown that FuzzySRI can be successfully applied to an industrial application concerning the automatic identification of machine faults.

J	Liebig, T; Andrienko, G; Andrienko, N				Liebig, Thomas; Andrienko, Gennady; Andrienko, Natalia			Methods for Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Bluetooth Tracking Data	JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bluetooth Tracking; Mobility Mining; Event Monitoring		Analysis of people's movements represented by continuous sequences of spatio-temporal data tuples have received lots of attention in recent years. The focus of those studies was mostly GPS data recorded on a constant sample rate. However, the creation of intelligent location-aware models and environments also requires reliable localization in indoor environments as well as in mixed indoor/outdoor scenarios. In these cases, signal loss makes usage of GPS infeasible; therefore other recording technologies evolved. Our approach is analysis of episodic movement data. This data contains some uncertainties among time (continuity), space (accuracy), and the number of recorded objects (coverage). Prominent examples of episodic movement data are spatio-temporal activity logs, cell-based tracking data, and billing records. To give one detailed example, Bluetooth tracking monitors the presence of mobile phones and intercoms within a sensor's footprints. Usage of multiple sensors provides flows among the sensors. Most existing data mining algorithms use interpolation and therefore are infeasible for this kind of data. For example, speed and movement direction cannot be derived directly from episodic data; trajectories may not be depicted as a continuous line; and densities cannot be computed. Still, the data hold much information on group movement. Our approach is to aggregate movement in order to overcome the uncertainties. Deriving a number of objects for the spatio-temporal compartments and transitions among them gives interesting insights on the spatio-temporal behavior of moving objects. As a next step to support analysts, we propose clustering the spatio-temporal presence and flow situations. This work focuses as well on creation of a descriptive probability model for the movement based on Spatial Bayesian Networks. We present our methods on a real world data set collected during a football game in Nimes, France in June 2011.

An automatic error correction procedure is therefore needed. We focus on the problem of restoring the consistency of agricultural data concerning cultivation areas and number of livestock, and we propose here an approach to this balancing problem based on optimization. Possible alternative models, either linear, quadratic or mixed integer, are presented. The mixed integer linear one has been preferred and used for the treatment of possibly unbalanced data records. Results on real-world Agricultural Census data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Our supervised-learning model focuses only on the offences against life and body section of the criminal law code of Thailand. The first stage identifies a set of diagnostic issues from the case facts using a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) modularized in hierarchical order. The second stage extracts a set of legal elements from the diagnostic issues by employing a set of C4.5 decision tree classifiers. These linked modular networks of ANNs and decision trees form an effective system in terms of determining power and the ability to trace or infer the relevant legal reasoning behind the determination. Isolated and system-integrated experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the proposed system. The overall accuracy of the integrated system can exceed 90%. An actual case is also demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Our major concern over privacy preserving in distributed data mining is the accuracy of the data mining results while privacy preserving is ensured. Corresponding to the horizontally partitioned data, this paper presents a new hybrid algorithm for privacy preserving distributed data mining. The main idea of the algorithm is to combine the method of random orthogonal matrix transformation with the proposed secure multi-party protocol of matrix product to achieve zero loss of accuracy in most data mining implementations.

Its main idea is centered around studying the past to predict the future. In other words, applying association rules technique to discover rules governing the city's past land use changes, then use them to forecast future changes. Taking La Plaine Zone in the city of Saint-Denis as a study case, the authors applied the proposed approach, in the framework of a developed Qgis plugin (Predict). The results are then highlighted in a cartographic format. To assess the quality of semantic land use changes prediction using our predictive approach, the authors proposed the Prediction precision degree (P) as an evaluation metric. A resulting value of 66% is considered promising since in this case, the authors only relay on history of land use changes for the prediction process, while considering some other evolution factors could remarkably enhance the results.

The major problem of mining partial periodic patterns is the efficiency problem due to a huge set of partial periodic candidates. Although some efficient algorithms have been developed to tackle the problem, the performance of the algorithms significantly drops when the mining parameters are set low. In the past, the authors have adopted the projection-based approach to discover the partial periodic patterns from single-event time series. In this paper, the authors extend it to mine partial periodic patterns from a sequence of event sets which multiple events concurrently occur at the same time stamp. Besides, an efficient pruning and filtering strategy is also proposed to speed up the mining process. Finally, the experimental results on a synthetic dataset and real oil price dataset show the good performance of the proposed approach.

Clustering centers of HASTA are defined to locate where the maximum value of local potential is. Edges of cluster in HASTA are identified by analyzing the first-order partial derivative of potential value, thus the full size of arbitrary shaped clusters can be detected. The experimented case demonstrates that HASTA performs effectively upon different datasets and can find out clusters of arbitrary shapes in noisy circumstance. Besides those, HASTA does not force users to preset the exact amount of clusters inside dataset. Furthermore, HASTA is insensitive to the order of data input. The time complexity of HASTA achieves O(n). Those advantages will potentially benefit the mining of big data.

Thus, it is an essential issue for convenience store owners to know how to accurately market appropriate products and to choose effective endorsers for brands or products in order to attract target consumers. Data mining is a business intelligence analysis approach with great potential to help businesses focus on the most important business information contained in a database. Therefore, this study uses the Apriori algorithm as an association rules approach, and clustering analysis for data mining. The authors divide consumers into three groups by their consumer profiles and then find each group's product preference mixes, product endorsers, and product/brand line extensions for new product development. These are developed as a recommendation system for 7-11 convenience stores in Taiwan.

Chemometrics for Analytical Data Mining in Separation Process Design for Recovery of Artemisinin from Artemisia annua	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PROCESS ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGY; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; DRUG DISCOVERY; DAD	The separation process for recovery of natural products from plants very often employs multiple separation techniques, and key to the success of such processes is to find the synergy between different separation techniques. Molecular level understanding of process streams is highly required in order to determine the synergy between unit operations, which can be attained through analysis of process streams using advanced process analyzers such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), etc. Very often use of such process analyzers generates an enormous amount of data making it difficult to extract useful information. Therefore, application of chemometrics for extracting process information from analytical data of process streams is demonstrated in this work. The multivariate data analysis technique PARAFAC is used to extract chemical information such as number of impurities, their relative concentrations, and finally their identification from rather complex analytical chromatograms of flash column chromatography (flash CC) fractions during purification of artemisinin from the crude extract of Artemisia annua. Crude extract of A. annua leaves obtained from dichloromethane is used in this work. Prior to the application of PARAFAC, the data set is preprocessed to remove baseline drift and peak misalignment caused by retention time shifts due to matrix effects. The process information extracted from analytical chromatograms by using the PARAFAC technique indicated the presence of impurities ranging from coumarins, polyacetylenes, and flavonoids to artemisinin related compounds in the flash CC fractions.

Most individuals in social networks have many linkages in terms of friends, connections, and/or followers. Among these linkages, some of them are stronger than others. For instance, some friends may be acquaintances of an individual, whereas others may be friends who care about him or her (e.g., who frequently post on his or her wall). In this study, we integrate data mining with social computing to form a social network mining algorithm, which helps the individual distinguish these strong friends from a large number of friends in a specific portion of the social networks in which he or she is interested. Moreover, our mining algorithm allows the individual to interactively change his or her mining parameters.

We studied the occurrences and phylogenies of CesA/Csl families in diverse plants and algae by comprehensive data mining of 82 genomes and transcriptomes. Results: We found that 1) charophytic green algae (CGA) have orthologous genes in CesA, CslC and CslD families; 2) liverwort genes are found in the CesA, CslA, CslC and CslD families; 3) The fern Pteridium aquilinum not only has orthologs in these conserved families but also in the CslB, CslH and CslE families; 4) basal angiosperms, e. g. Aristolochia fimbriata, have orthologs in these families too; 5) gymnosperms have genes forming clusters ancestral to CslB/H and to CslE/J/G respectively; 6) CslG is found in switchgrass and basal angiosperms; 7) CslJ is widely present in dicots and monocots; 8) CesA subfamilies have already diversified in ferns. Conclusions: We speculate that: (i) ferns and horsetails might both have CslH enzymes, responsible for the synthesis of mixed-linkage glucans and (ii) CslD and similar genes might be responsible for the synthesis of mannans in CGA. Our findings led to a more detailed model of cell wall evolution and suggested that gene loss played an important role in the evolution of Csl families. We also demonstrated the usefulness of transcriptome data in the study of plant cell wall evolution and diversity.

Then, the database was analyzed using three data mining tools to extract knowledge in three areas: Decision trees to determine the empirical rules and conditions that lead to high catalytic performance (high CO conversion); artificial neural networks (ANNs) to determine the relative importance of various catalyst preparation and operational variables and their effects on CO conversion; support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the outcome of unstudied experimental conditions. It was concluded that, all three models were quite successful and they complement each other to extract knowledge from the past published works and to deduce useful trends, rules and correlations, which are not easily comprehensible by the naked eyes.

When it is possible, open data sharing provides the most benefits. However, some data cannot be shared at all due to privacy concerns and/or risk of re-identification. Sharing other data sets is hampered by the proliferation of complex data use agreements (DUAs) which preclude truly automated data mining. These DUAs arise because of concerns about the privacy and confidentiality for subjects; though many do permit direct access to data, they often require a cumbersome approval process that can take months. An alternative approach is to only share data derivatives such as statistical summaries the challenges here are to reformulate computational methods to quantify the privacy risks associated with sharing the results of those computations. For example, a derived map of gray matter is often as identifiable as a fingerprint. Thus alternative approaches to accessing data are needed. This paper reviews the relevant literature on differential privacy, a framework for measuring and tracking privacy loss in these settings, and demonstrates the feasibility of using this framework to calculate statistics on data distributed at many sites while still providing privacy.

Unlike other data mining methods, the peculiarity of KODAMA is that it is driven by an integrated procedure of cross-validation of the results. The discovery of a local manifold's topology is led by a classifier through a Monte Carlo procedure of maximization of cross-validated predictive accuracy. Briefly, our approach differs from previous methods in that it has an integrated procedure of validation of the results. In this way, the method ensures the highest robustness of the obtained solution. This robustness is demonstrated on experimental datasets of gene expression and metabolomics, where KODAMA compares favorably with other existing feature extraction methods. KODAMA is then applied to an astronomical dataset, revealing unexpected features. Interesting and not easily predictable features are also found in the analysis of the State of the Union speeches by American presidents: KODAMA reveals an abrupt linguistic transition sharply separating all post-Reagan from all pre-Reagan speeches. The transition occurs during Reagan's presidency and not from its beginning.

One of the apparently missing genes was the capa gene. Capa gene expression in insects is typically associated with the neuroendocrine system of abdominal ganglia; mature CAPA peptides are known to regulate diuresis and visceral muscle contraction. The apparent absence of the capa gene raised questions about possible compensation of these functions. In this study, we re-examined this controversial issue and searched for a potentially unrecognized capa gene in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We employed a combination of data mining and a traditional PCR-based strategy using degenerate primers designed from conserved amino acid sequences of insect capa genes. Our findings demonstrate that ants possess and express a capa gene. As shown by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, processed products of the S. invicta capa gene include three CAPA periviscerokinins and low amounts of a pyrokinin which does not have the C-terminal WFGPRLa motif typical of CAPA pyrokinins in other insects. The capa gene was found with two alternative transcripts in the CNS. Within the ventral nerve cord, two capa neurons were immunostained in abdominal neuromeres 2-5, respectively, and projected into ventrally located abdominal perisympathetic organs (PSOs), which are the major hormone release sites of abdominal ganglia. The ventral location of these PSOs is a characteristic feature and was also found in another ant, Atta sexdens.	[Choi, Man-Yeon; Meer, Robert K.

J	He, XX; Shao, CX; Xiong, Y				He, Xiaoxu; Shao, Chenxi; Xiong, Yan			A new similarity measure based on shape information for invariant with multiple distortions	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Time series; Similarity search; Distortion; Data mining	TIME-SERIES PATTERNS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MEANINGLESS; SEARCH	Due to the characteristics of noise and volatility, two similar time series always appear in diverse kinds of distortions, which usually are considered as the combinations of the following basic transformations: noise, amplitude shift, amplitude scaling, temporal scaling, and linear drift. In this paper, a novel similarity measure (SIMshape) invariant to these basic distortions and any combinations of them is proposed. It is parameter-free and easy to implement. Specifically, a multi-scale shape approximation for time series based on Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform, key point extraction and symbolization is presented first; then, based on this proposed representation and a scale-weight factor, a robust similarity measure is proposed. The novelty of SIMshape lies in two aspects as follows: (a) symbolizing key points sequence extracted from approximate wavelet coefficients; (b) adding the scale-weight factor and shape similarity in the similarity criterion. To show the effectiveness and efficiency, SIMshape is compared with other popular methods Euclidean Distance (ED), LB_keogh, Complexity Invariant Distance (CID), and ASEAL (Approximate Shape Exchange ALgorithm) using two indices: the number of kinds of distortions and the degree of distortion. Obtained results show that compared with ED, CID, LB_keogh, and ASEAL, SIMshape has better robustness in synthetic data, and shows better performance in real time series classification.

Data-Mining for Sulfur and Fluorine: An Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals To Reveal Opportunities for Drug Design and Discovery	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; MOLECULES; AGENTS; STORY	Among carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, sulfur and fluorine are both leading constituents of the pharmaceuticals that comprise our medicinal history. In efforts to stimulate the minds of both the general public and expert scientist, statistics were collected from the trends associated with therapeutics spanning 12 disease categories (a total of 1969 drugs) from our new graphical montage compilation: disease focused pharmaceuticals posters. Each poster is a vibrant display of a collection of pharmaceuticals (including structural image, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval date, international nonproprietary name (INN), initial market name, and a color-coded subclass of function) organized chronologically and classified according to an association with a particular clinical indication. Specifically, the evolution and structural diversity of sulfur and the popular integration of fluorine into drugs introduced over the past 50 years are evaluated. The presented qualitative conclusions in this article aim to promote innovative insights into drug development.

J	Milone, DH; Stegmayer, G; Lopez, M; Kamenetzky, L; Carrari, F				Milone, Diego H.; Stegmayer, Georgina; Lopez, Mariana; Kamenetzky, Laura; Carrari, Fernando			Improving clustering with metabolic pathway data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Clustering; SOM training; Pathway data	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY DATA; DATA-FUSION; VISUALIZATION; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; REVEALS; ARABIDOPSIS; INTEGRATION; ANNOTATION	Background: It is a common practice in bioinformatics to validate each group returned by a clustering algorithm through manual analysis, according to a-priori biological knowledge. This procedure helps finding functionally related patterns to propose hypotheses for their behavior and the biological processes involved. Therefore, this knowledge is used only as a second step, after data are just clustered according to their expression patterns. Thus, it could be very useful to be able to improve the clustering of biological data by incorporating prior knowledge into the cluster formation itself, in order to enhance the biological value of the clusters. Results: A novel training algorithm for clustering is presented, which evaluates the biological internal connections of the data points while the clusters are being formed. Within this training algorithm, the calculation of distances among data points and neurons centroids includes a new term based on information from well-known metabolic pathways. The standard self-organizing map (SOM) training versus the biologically-inspired SOM (bSOM) training were tested with two real data sets of transcripts and metabolites from Solanumlycopersicum and Arabidopsis thaliana species. Classical data mining validation measures were used to evaluate the clustering solutions obtained by both algorithms. Moreover, a new measure that takes into account the biological connectivity of the clusters was applied. The results of bSOM show important improvements in the convergence and performance for the proposed clustering method in comparison to standard SOM training, in particular, from the application point of view. Conclusions: Analyses of the clusters obtained with bSOM indicate that including biological information during training can certainly increase the biological value of the clusters found with the proposed method. It is worth to highlight that this fact has effectively improved the results, which can simplify their further analysis. The algorithm is available as a web-demo at http://fich.unl.edu.ar/sinc/web-demo/bsom-lite/.

Measuring the impact of spatial network layout on community social cohesion: a cross-sectional study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article						Social cohesion; Severance; Walkability; Spatial network analysis; sDNA	NEIGHBORHOOD; WALKING; HEALTH	Background: There is now a substantial body of research suggesting that social cohesion, a collective characteristic measured by the levels of trust, reciprocity and formation of strong social bonds within communities, is an important factor in determining health. Of particular interest is the extent to which factors in the built environment facilitate, or impede, the development of social bonds. Severance is a characteristic of physical environments which is hypothesized to inhibit cohesion. In the current study we test a number of characteristics of spatial networks which could be hypothesized to relate either to severance, or directly to community cohesion. Particular focus is given to our most promising variable for further analysis (Convex Hull Maximum Radius 600 m). Methods: In the current study we analysed social cohesion as measured at Enumeration District level, aggregated from a survey of 10,892 individuals aged 18 to 74 years in the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Cohort Study, 2001. In a data mining process we test 16 network variables on multiple scales. The variable showing the most promise is validated in a test on an independent data set. We then conduct a multivariate regression also including Townsend deprivation scores and urban/rural status as predictor variables for social cohesion. Results: We find convex hull maximum radius at a 600 m scale to have a small but highly significant correlation with social cohesion on both data sets. Deprivation has a stronger effect. Splitting the analysis by tertile of deprivation, we find that the effect of severance as measured by this variable is strongest in the most deprived areas. A range of spatial scales are tested, with the strongest effects being observed at scales that match typical walking distances. Conclusion: We conclude that physical connectivity as measured in this paper has a significant effect on social cohesion, and that our measure is unlikely to proxy either deprivation or the urban/rural status of communities. Possible mechanisms for the effect include intrinsic navigability of areas, and the existence of a focal route on which people can meet on foot. Further investigation may lead to much stronger predictive models of social cohesion.	[Cooper, Crispin H.

Correct diagnosis of rotator cuff tears can save patients from further invasive, costly and painful tests. This study used predictive data mining and Bayesian theory to improve the accuracy of diagnosing rotator cuff tears by clinical examination alone. Methods: In this retrospective study, 169 patients who had a preliminary diagnosis of rotator cuff tear on the basis of clinical evaluation followed by confirmatory MRI between 2007 and 2011 were identified. MRI was used as a reference standard to classify rotator cuff tears. The predictor variable was the clinical assessment results, which consisted of 16 attributes. This study employed 2 data mining methods (ANN and the decision tree) and a statistical method (logistic regression) to classify the rotator cuff diagnosis into "tear" and "no tear" groups. Likelihood ratio and Bayesian theory were applied to estimate the probability of rotator cuff tears based on the results of the prediction models. Results: Our proposed data mining procedures outperformed the classic statistical method. The correction rate, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve of predicting a rotator cuff tear were statistical better in the ANN and decision tree models compared to logistic regression. Based on likelihood ratios derived from our prediction models, Fagan's nomogram could be constructed to assess the probability of a patient who has a rotator cuff tear using a pretest probability and a prediction result (tear or no tear). Conclusions: Our predictive data mining models, combined with likelihood ratios and Bayesian theory, appear to be good tools to classify rotator cuff tears as well as determine the probability of the presence of the disease to enhance diagnostic decision making for rotator cuff tears.

Public health and pipe breaks in water distribution systems: Analysis with internet search volume as a proxy	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Distribution network; Pipe breaks; Gastrointestinal illness; Non-linear regression	DRINKING-WATER; GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS; UNITED-STATES; DISEASE; SURVEILLANCE; RISK; ASSOCIATION; CONSUMPTION; WEB	Drinking water distribution infrastructure has been identified as a factor in waterborne disease outbreaks and improved understanding of the public health risks associated with distribution system failures has been identified as a priority area for research. Pipe breaks may pose a risk, as their occurrence and repair can result in low or negative pressure, potentially allowing contamination of drinking water from adjacent soils. However, measuring this phenomenon is challenging because the most likely health impact is mild gastrointestinal (GI) illness, which is unlikely to result in a doctor or hospital visit. Here we present a novel method that uses data mining techniques and internet search volume to assess the relationship between pipe breaks and symptoms of GI illness in two U.S. cities. Weekly search volume for the terms diarrhea and vomiting was used as the response variable with the number of pipe breaks in each city as a covariate as well as additional covariates to control for seasonal patterns, search volume persistence, and other sources of GI illness. The fit and predictive accuracy of multiple regression and data mining techniques were compared, with the best performance obtained using random forest and bagged regression tree models.

Next-generation sequencing technology is now used widely to probe these protein-DNA interactions and to profile gene expression at a genome-wide scale. As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to fall, the interpretation of the ever increasing amount of data generated represents a considerable challenge. Results: We have developed ngs.plot - a standalone program to visualize enrichment patterns of DNA-interacting proteins at functionally important regions based on next-generation sequencing data. We demonstrate that ngs.plot is not only efficient but also scalable. We use a few examples to demonstrate that ngs.plot is easy to use and yet very powerful to generate figures that are publication ready. Conclusions: We conclude that ngs.plot is a useful tool to help fill the gap between massive datasets and genomic information in this era of big sequencing data.

On finding bicliques in bipartite graphs: a novel algorithm and its application to the integration of diverse biological data types	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Biclique; Biclustering; Bioinformatics databases; Bipartite graphs; Graph algorithms	GENE-EXPRESSION; COCAINE; GENERATION; SUBGRAPHS; CLIQUES; MATRIX; SETS	Background: Integrating and analyzing heterogeneous genome-scale data is a huge algorithmic challenge for modern systems biology. Bipartite graphs can be useful for representing relationships across pairs of disparate data types, with the interpretation of these relationships accomplished through an enumeration of maximal bicliques. Most previously-known techniques are generally ill-suited to this foundational task, because they are relatively inefficient and without effective scaling. In this paper, a powerful new algorithm is described that produces all maximal bicliques in a bipartite graph. Unlike most previous approaches, the new method neither places undue restrictions on its input nor inflates the problem size. Efficiency is achieved through an innovative exploitation of bipartite graph structure, and through computational reductions that rapidly eliminate non-maximal candidates from the search space. An iterative selection of vertices for consideration based on non-decreasing common neighborhood sizes boosts efficiency and leads to more balanced recursion trees. Results: The new technique is implemented and compared to previously published approaches from graph theory and data mining. Formal time and space bounds are derived. Experiments are performed on both random graphs and graphs constructed from functional genomics data. It is shown that the new method substantially outperforms the best previous alternatives. Conclusions: The new method is streamlined, efficient, and particularly well-suited to the study of huge and diverse biological data. A robust implementation has been incorporated into GeneWeaver, an online tool for integrating and analyzing functional genomics experiments, available at http://geneweaver.org. The enormous increase in scalability it provides empowers users to study complex and previously unassailable gene-set associations between genes and their biological functions in a hierarchical fashion and on a genome-wide scale. This practical computational resource is adaptable to almost any applications environment in which bipartite graphs can be used to model relationships between pairs of heterogeneous entities.

This study was aimed at the exploitation of new SSRs for the genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of wild barley by data mining. We developed 49 novel EST-SSRs and confirmed 20 genomic SSRs for 80 Tibetan annual wild barley and 16 cultivated barley accessions. A total of 213 alleles were generated from 69 loci with an average of 3.14 alleles per locus. The trimeric repeats were the most abundant motifs (40.82%) among the EST-SSRs, while the majority of the genomic SSRs were di-nuleotide repeats. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.75 with a mean of 0.46. Besides this, the expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.0854 to 0.7842 with an average of 0.5279. Overall, the polymorphism of genomic SSRs was higher than that of EST-SSRs. Furthermore, the number of alleles and the PIC of wild barley were both higher than that of cultivated barley, being 3.12 vs 2.59 and 0.44 vs 0.37. Indicating more polymorphism existed in the Tibetan wild barley than in cultivated barley. The 96 accessions were divided into eight subpopulations based on 69 SSR markers, and the cultivated genotypes can be clearly separated from wild barleys. A total of 47 SSR-containing EST unigenes showed significant similarities to the known genes. These EST-SSR markers have potential for application in germplasm appraisal, genetic diversity and population structure analysis, facilitating marker-assisted breeding and crop improvement in barley.

A novel meta-analytic approach: Mining frequent co-activation patterns in neuroimaging databases	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						PaMiNI; Gaussian mixture modeling; Association analysis; BrainMap database; Coordinate-based meta-analysis	WORKING-MEMORY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN PARIETAL; HUMAN BRAIN; MODEL; FRONTOPARIETAL; ACTIVATION; LIKELIHOOD; CONTEXT	In recent years, coordinate-based meta-analyses have become a powerful and widely used tool to study co-activity across neuroimaging experiments, a development that was supported by the emergence of large-scale neuroimaging databases like BrainMap. However, the evaluation of co-activation patterns is constrained by the fact that previous coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques like Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) and Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) reveal all brain regions that show convergent activity within a dataset without taking into account actual within-experiment co-occurrence patterns. To overcome this issue we here propose a novel meta-analytic approach named PaMiNI that utilizes a combination of two well-established data-mining techniques, Gaussian mixture modeling and the Apriori algorithm. By this, PaMiNI enables a data-driven detection of frequent co-activation patterns within neuroimaging datasets. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by means of several analyses on simulated data as well as a real application. The analyses of the simulated data show that PaMiNI identifies the brain regions underlying the simulated activation foci and perfectly separates the co-activation patterns of the experiments in the simulations. Furthermore, PaMiNI still yields good results when activation foci of distinct brain regions become closer together or if they are non-Gaussian distributed. For the further evaluation, a real dataset on working memory experiments is used, which was previously examined loan ALE meta-analysis and hence allows a cross-validation of both methods. In this latter analysis, PaMiNI revealed a fronto-parietal "core" network of working memory and furthermore indicates a left-lateralization in this network. Finally, to encourage a widespread usage of this new method, the PaMiNI approach was implemented into a publicly available software system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This activity is usually performed within dedicated databases (national, European, international...), in which the ADRs declared for patients are usually coded with a specific controlled terminology MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities). Traditionally, the detection of adverse drug reactions is performed with data mining algorithms, while more recently the groupings of close ADR terms are also being exploited. The Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) have become a standard in pharmacovigilance. They are created manually by international boards of experts with the objective to group together the MedDRA terms related to a given safety topic. Within the MedDRA version 13, 84 SMQs exist, although several important safety topics are not yet covered. The objective of our work is to propose an automatic method for assisting the creation of SMQs using the clustering of semantically close MedDRA terms. The experimented method relies on semantic approaches: semantic distance and similarity algorithms, terminology structuring methods and term clustering. The obtained results indicate that the proposed unsupervised methods appear to be complementary for this task, they can generate subsets of the existing SMQs and make this process systematic and less time consuming.

Nonlinear Machine Learning of Patchy Colloid Self-Assembly Pathways and Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; DIFFUSION MAPS; FREE-ENERGY; PARTICLES; NANOSTRUCTURES; SIMULATIONS; PROTEINS; MOTIONS	Bottom-up self-assembly offers a means to synthesize materials with desirable structural and functional properties that cannot easily be fabricated by other techniques. An improved understanding of the structural pathways and mechanisms by which self-assembling materials spontaneously form from their constituent building blocks is of value in understanding the fundamental principles of assembly and in guiding inverse building block design. We present an approach to infer systematically assembly pathways and mechanisms by nonlinear data mining of molecular simulation trajectories using diffusion maps. We have validated our methodology in applications to Brownian dynamics simulations of the assembly of anisotropic "patchy colloids" into polyhedral aggregates. For particles designed to form tetrahedral aggregates, we identify two divergent assembly pathways leading to chains of interlocking dimers and tetramers and chains of interlocking trigonal planar trimers. For particles designed to assemble icosahedral aggregates, our approach recovers two distinct assembly pathways corresponding to monomeric addition and budding from a disordered liquid phase. These assembly routes were previously reported by inspection of simulation trajectories by Wilber et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 085106; J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 175102), validating the capacity of our approach to systematically recover assembly mechanisms previously discernible only by trajectory visualization.

Conclusion: LEV-9 is activated by proteolytic cleavage following the final tandem complement control protein (CCP) modules. Significance: Many LEV-9-related factors are likely cleaved after CCP domains, suggesting that cleavage location can be conserved in distant architecturally related proteins. Correct positioning of neurotransmitter-gated receptors at postsynapses is essential for synaptic transmission. At Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions, clustering of levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptors (L-AChRs) requires the muscle-secreted scaffolding protein LEV-9, a multidomain factor containing complement control protein (CCP) modules. Here we show that LEV-9 needs to be cleaved at its C terminus to exert its function. LEV-9 cleavage is not required for trafficking nor secretion but directly controls scaffolding activity. The cleavage site is evolutionarily conserved, and post-translational cleavage ensures the structural and functional decoupling between different isoforms encoded by the lev-9 gene. Data mining indicates that most human CCP-containing factors are likely cleaved C-terminally from CCP tandems, suggesting that not only domain architectures but also cleavage location can be conserved in distant architecturally related proteins.

It is essential for software developers to identify defective software modules in order to continuously improve the quality of a software system. As the conditions for a software module to have defects are hard to identify, machine learning based classification models are still developed to approach the problem of defect prediction. We propose a novel classification model based on relational association rules mining. Relational association rules are an extension of ordinal association rules, which are a particular type of association rules that describe numerical orderings between attributes that commonly occur over a dataset. Our classifier is based on the discovery of relational association rules for predicting whether a software module is or it is not defective. An experimental evaluation of the proposed model on the open source NASA datasets, as well as a comparison to similar existing approaches is provided. The obtained results show that our classifier overperforms, for most of the considered evaluation measures, the existing machine learning based techniques for defect prediction. This confirms the potential of our proposal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Without an accurate prediction of service reliability, any unexpected failure can disrupt service. The majority of existing models use static data collected prior to the release of the software. These types of models may predict the reliability of the software as it was during the data collection phase. However, online service software is continuously evolving, and their behaviors can be changed by the runtime usage. Thus, the prediction made by static data can be inaccurate. We present an approach to tackle this challenge by taking into account software runtime behavior in our reliability prediction. We used a data mining tool, Dalkon, to collect likely invariants of the software to capture its states in the runtime. This runtime information is then used to compute the reliability of the software by using our port-based reliability model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Datta, A; Chen, CP; Sze, SK				Datta, Arnab; Chen, Christopher P.; Sze, Siu Kwan			Discovery of Prognostic Biomarker Candidates of Lacunar Infarction by Quantitative Proteomics of Microvesicles Enriched Plasma	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; SMALL-VESSEL DISEASE; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; NEUROLOGICAL-DISORDERS; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS; ALBUMIN THERAPY; SERUM-ALBUMIN; RISK	Background: Lacunar infarction (LACI) is a subtype of acute ischemic stroke affecting around 25% of all ischemic stroke cases. Despite having an excellent recovery during acute phase, certain LACI patients have poor mid-to long-term prognosis due to the recurrence of vascular events or a decline in cognitive functions. Hence, blood-based biomarkers could be complementary prognostic and research tools. Methods and Finding: Plasma was collected from forty five patients following a non-disabling LACI along with seventeen matched control subjects. The LACI patients were monitored prospectively for up to five years for the occurrence of adverse outcomes and grouped accordingly (i.e., LACI-no adverse outcome, LACI-recurrent vascular event, and LACI-cognitive decline without any recurrence of vascular events). Microvesicles-enriched fractions isolated from the pooled plasma of four groups were profiled by an iTRAQ-guided discovery approach to quantify the differential proteome. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000748. Bioinformatics analysis and data mining revealed upregulation of brain-specific proteins including myelin basic protein, proteins of coagulation cascade (e.g., fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen beta chain) and focal adhesion (e.g., integrin alpha-IIb, talin-1, and filamin-A) while albumin was downregulated in both groups of patients with adverse outcome. Conclusion: This data set may offer important insight into the mechanisms of poor prognosis and provide candidate prognostic biomarkers for validation on larger cohort of individual LACI patients.

High-throughput neuroimaging-genetics computational infrastructure	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						aging; pipeline; neuroimaging; genetics; computation solutions; Alzheimer's disease; big data; visualization	SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOW; BRAIN; ASSOCIATION; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE	Many contemporary neuroscientific investigations face significant challenges in terms of data management, computational processing, data mining, and results interpretation. These four pillars define the core infrastructure necessary to plan, organize, orchestrate, validate, and disseminate novel scientific methods, computational resources, and translational healthcare findings. Data management includes protocols for data acquisition, archival, query, transfer, retrieval, and aggregation. Computational processing involves the necessary software, hardware, and networking infrastructure required to handle large amounts of heterogeneous neuroimaging, genetics, clinical, and phenotypic data and meta-data. Data mining refers to the process of automatically extracting data features, characteristics and associations, which are not readily visible by human exploration of the raw dataset. Result interpretation includes scientific visualization, community validation of findings and reproducible findings. In this manuscript we describe the novel high-throughput neuroimaging-genetics computational infrastructure available at the Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics (INI) and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at University of Southern California (USC). INI and LONI include ultra-high-field and standard-field MRI brain scanners along with an imaging-genetics database for storing the complete provenance of the raw and derived data and meta-data. In addition, the institute provides a large number of software tools for image and shape analysis, mathematical modeling, genomic sequence processing, and scientific visualization. A unique feature of this architecture is the Pipeline environment, which integrates the data management, processing, transfer, and visualization. Through its client-server architecture, the Pipeline environment provides a graphical user interface for designing, executing, monitoring validating, and disseminating of complex protocols that utilize diverse suites of software tools and web-services. These pipeline workflows are represented as portable XML objects which transfer the execution instructions and user specifications from the client user machine to remote pipeline servers for distributed computing. Using Alzheimer's and Parkinson's data, we provide several examples of translational applications using this infrastructure(1).

While the problem of contamination is well recognised in microbiology labs the corresponding problem of database corruption has received less attention. Results: Mapping 50 billion next generation DNA sequences from The Thousand Genome Project against published genomes reveals many that match one or more Mycoplasma but are not included in the reference human genome GRCh37.p5. Many of these are of low quality but NCBI BLAST searches confirm some high quality, high entropy sequences match Mycoplasma but no human sequences. Conclusions: It appears at least 7% of 1000G samples are contaminated.

These compounds are responsible for quality of red wines, influencing the antioxidant activity, astringency, bitterness and colour, their composition in wine being influenced by the varieties, the vintage and the wineries. The aim of the present work is to build software instruments intended to work as data-mining tools for predicting valuable properties of wine and for revealing different wine classes. The developed ANNs are able to reveal the relationships between the concentration of total phenolic, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins content, associated to the antioxidant activity, and the wine distinctive classes determined by the wine variety, harvesting year or winery. The presented ANNs proved to be reliable software tools for assessment or validation of the wine essential characteristics and authenticity and may be further used to establish a database of analytical characteristics of wines.

In the pursuit of robust aromatase inhibitors, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and classification structure-activity relationship (CSAR) studies were performed on a non-redundant set of 63 flavonoids using multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine and decision tree approaches. Easy-to-interpret descriptors providing comprehensive coverage on general characteristics of molecules (i.e., molecular size, flexibility, polarity, solubility, charge and electronic properties) were employed to describe the unique physicochemical properties of the investigated flavonoids. QSAR models provided good predictive performance as observed from their statistical parameters with Q values in the range of 0.8014 and 0.9870 for the cross-validation set and Q values in the range of 0.8966 and 0.9943 for the external test set. Furthermore, CSAR models developed with the J48 algorithm are able to accurately classify flavonoids as active and inactive as observed from the percentage of correctly classified instances in the range of 84.6 % and 100 %. The study presented herein represents the first large-scale QSAR study of aromatase inhibition on a large set of flavonoids. Such investigations provide an important insight on the origins of aromatase inhibitory properties of flavonoids as breast cancer therapeutics.

Early research has proved that ensemble classifiers in most cases can be more accurate than any single component classifier both empirically and theoretically. Though many ensemble approaches are proposed, it is still not an easy task to find a suitable ensemble configuration for a specific dataset. In some early works, the ensemble is selected manually according to the experience of the specialists. Metaheuristic methods can be alternative solutions to find configurations. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one popular approach among metaheuristics. In this work, we propose a new ensemble construction method which applies ACO to the stacking ensemble construction process to generate domain-specific configurations. A number of experiments are performed to compare the proposed approach with some well-known ensemble methods on 18 benchmark data mining datasets. The approach is also applied to learning ensembles for a real-world cost-sensitive data mining problem. The experiment results show that the new approach can generate better stacking ensembles.

It is particularly effective in mining association rules. However, a concept lattice is not efficient for large databases because the lattice size increases with the number of transactions. Finding an efficient strategy for dynamically updating the lattice is an important issue for real-world applications, where new transactions are constantly inserted into databases. To build an efficient storage structure for mining association rules, this study proposes a method for building the initial frequent closed itemset lattice from the original database. The lattice is updated when new transactions are inserted. The number of database rescans over the entire database is reduced in the maintenance process. The proposed algorithm is compared with building a lattice in batch mode to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the principle of PCA is based on the synchronous covariance, which is not very effective in some cases. In this paper, an asynchronism-based principal component analysis (APCA) is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of univariate time series. In the process of APCA, an asynchronous method based on dynamic time warping (DTW) is developed to obtain the interpolated time series which derive from the original ones. The correlation coefficient or covariance between the interpolated time series represents the correlation between the original ones. In this way, a novel and valid principal component analysis based on the asynchronous covariance is achieved to reduce the dimensionality. The results of several experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach APCA outperforms PCA for dimensionality reduction in the field of time series data mining. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many researchers have mined the hierarchical association rules and thus proposed various approaches. However, some of the existing approaches produce many multilevel and cross-level association rules that fail to convey quality information. From these large number of redundant association rules, it is extremely difficult to extract any meaningful information. There also exist some approaches that mine minimal association rules, but these have many shortcomings due to their naive-based approaches. In this paper, we have focused on the need for generating hierarchical minimal rules that provide maximal information. An algorithm has been proposed to derive minimal multilevel association rules and cross-level association rules. Our work has made significant contributions in mining the minimal cross-level association rules, which express the mixed relationship between the generalized and specialized view of the transaction itemsets. We are the first to design an efficient algorithm using a closed itemset lattice-based approach, which can mine the most relevant minimal cross-level association rules. The parent-child relationship of the lattices has been exploited while mining cross-level closed itemset lattices. We have extensively evaluated our proposed algorithm's efficiency using a variety of real-life datasets and performing a large number of experiments. The proposed algorithm has outperformed the existing related work significantly during the pervasive performance comparison. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the use of global density parameter epsilon-distance makes DBSCAN not suitable in varying density datasets. Also, guessing the value for the same is not straightforward. In this paper, we generalise this algorithm in two ways. First, adaptively determine the key input parameter epsilon-distance, which makes DBSCAN independent of domain knowledge satisfying the unsupervised notion of clustering. Second, the approach of deriving epsilon-distance based on checking the data distribution of each dimension makes the approach suitable for subspace clustering, which detects clusters enclosed in various subspaces of high dimensional data. Experimental results illustrate that our approach can efficiently find out the clusters of varying sizes, shapes as well as varying densities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly our work and ideology is introduced as the research background of this paper. Digital library evaluation is an important topic in information systems domain. We creatively import data mining technologies into it to get an intelligent decision support. But traditional data prediction algorithm didn't work well. This is the problem which would be solved in this paper. Secondly related preliminary research is introduced. We researched on attributes of digital library collections, proposed a parallel discretization algorithm based on z-score theory, and by the discretization algorithm discovered a complicated condition attribute relation among attributes, it is the reason why traditional data prediction algorithm didn't work well. At last a stratified decision tree algorithm for value prediction about digital collection is put forward as the ultimate solution to solve the problem. Stratified attribute concept is imported in this algorithm. It can expand the selection of splitting attribute in decision tree from flat information to stereoscopic information, eliminate the influence of complicated condition attribute relationship, nested use existing decision tree algorithms, and solve the bottleneck of data mining application in digital library evaluation.

Self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) is a powerful technique for clustering analysis and data mining. Competitive learning in the SOFM training process focuses on finding a neuron that its weight vector is most similar to that of an input vector. SOFM can be used to map large data sets to a simpler, usually one or two-dimensional topological structure. In this paper, we present a new approach to acquisition of initial fuzzy rules using SOFM learning algorithm, not only for its vector feature, but also for its topological. In general, fuzzy modeling requires two stages: structure identification and parameter learning. First, the algorithm partitions the input space into some local regions by using SOFM, then it determines the decision boundaries for local input regions, and finally, based on the decision boundaries, it learns the fuzzy rule for each local region by recursive least squares algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method can provide good model structure for fuzzy modeling and has high computing efficiency.

Mining categorical sequences from data using a hybrid clustering method	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Data mining; Sequential data; Hidden Markov models; Clustering; Categorical data	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; TIME-SERIES DATA; NAVIGATION PATTERNS; WEB USERS; ALGORITHM; PROGNOSIS; DYNAMICS; EM	The identification of different dynamics in sequential data has become an every day need in scientific fields such as marketing, bioinformatics, finance, or social sciences. Contrary to cross-sectional or static data, this type of observations (also known as stream data, temporal data, longitudinal data or repeated measures) are more challenging as one has to incorporate data dependency in the clustering process. In this research we focus on clustering categorical sequences. The method proposed here combines model-based and heuristic clustering. In the first step, the categorical sequences are transformed by an extension of the hidden Markov model into a probabilistic space, where a symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance can operate. Then, in the second step, using hierarchical clustering on the matrix of distances, the sequences can be clustered. This paper illustrates the enormous potential of this type of hybrid approach using a synthetic data set as well as the well-known Microsoft dataset with website users search patterns and a survey on job career dynamics.

Para Miner is built on the principles of pattern enumeration in strongly accessible set systems. Its efficiency is due to a novel dataset reduction technique (that we call EL-reduction), combined with novel technique for performing dataset reduction in a parallel execution on a multi-core architecture. We illustrate Para Miner's genericity by using this algorithm to solve three different pattern mining problems: the frequent itemset mining problem, the mining frequent connected relational graphs problem and the mining gradual itemsets problem. In this paper, we prove the soundness and the completeness of Para Miner. Furthermore, our experiments show that despite being a generic algorithm, Para Miner can compete with specialized state of the art algorithms designed for the pattern mining problems mentioned above. Besides, for the particular problem of gradual itemset mining, Para Miner outperforms the state of the art algorithm by two orders of magnitude.

CID: an efficient complexity-invariant distance for time series	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Time series; Classification; Clustering; Similarity measures; Complexity	METRIC-SPACES; SIGNALS	The ubiquity of time series data across almost all human endeavors has produced a great interest in time series data mining in the last decade. While dozens of classification algorithms have been applied to time series, recent empirical evidence strongly suggests that simple nearest neighbor classification is exceptionally difficult to beat. The choice of distance measure used by the nearest neighbor algorithm is important, and depends on the invariances required by the domain. For example, motion capture data typically requires invariance to warping, and cardiology data requires invariance to the baseline (the mean value). Similarly, recent work suggests that for time series clustering, the choice of clustering algorithm is much less important than the choice of distance measure used.In this work we make a somewhat surprising claim. There is an invariance that the community seems to have missed, complexity invariance. Intuitively, the problem is that in many domains the different classes may have different complexities, and pairs of complex objects, even those which subjectively may seem very similar to the human eye, tend to be further apart under current distance measures than pairs of simple objects. This fact introduces errors in nearest neighbor classification, where some complex objects may be incorrectly assigned to a simpler class. Similarly, for clustering this effect can introduce errors by "suggesting" to the clustering algorithm that subjectively similar, but complex objects belong in a sparser and larger diameter cluster than is truly warranted.We introduce the first complexity-invariant distance measure for time series, and show that it generally produces significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracy. We further show that this improvement does not compromise efficiency, since we can lower bound the measure and use a modification of triangular inequality, thus making use of most existing indexing and data mining algorithms. We evaluate our ideas with the largest and most comprehensive set of time series mining experiments ever attempted in a single work, and show that complexity-invariant distance measures can produce improvements in classification and clustering in the vast majority of cases.

J	Chandola, V; Mithal, V; Kumar, V				Chandola, Varun; Mithal, Varun; Kumar, Vipin			A reference based analysis framework for understanding anomaly detection techniques for symbolic sequences	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Sequences; Anomaly detection; Data mining; Reference based analysis		Anomaly detection for symbolic sequence data is a highly important area of research and is relevant in many application domains. While several techniques have been proposed within different domains, understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses is limited. The key factor for this is that the nature of sequence data varies significantly across domains, and hence while a technique might perform well in its original domain, its performance is not guaranteed in a different domain. In this paper, we aim at establishing this understanding for a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques for symbolic sequences. We present a comparative evaluation of a large number of anomaly detection techniques on a variety of publicly available as well as artificially generated data sets. Many of these are existing techniques while some are slight variants and/or adaptations of traditional anomaly detection techniques to sequence data. The analysis presented in this paper allows relative comparison of the different anomaly detection techniques and highlights their strengths and weaknesses. We extend the reference based analysis (RBA) framework, which was originally proposed to analyze multivariate categorical data, to analyze symbolic sequence data sets. We visualize the symbolic sequences using the characteristics provided by the RBA framework and use the visualization to understand various aspects of the sequence data. We then use the characterization done by RBA to understand the performance of the different techniques. Using the RBA framework, we propose two anomaly detection techniques for symbolic sequences, which show consistently superior performance over the existing techniques across the different data sets.

A main issue regards the strategy to adopt in exploring the power set lattice. Assuming a power set lattice with full set at the top and empty set at the bottom, the most of the algorithms adopt a bottom-up exploration, i.e. moving from smaller to larger sets. Although this approach is advantageous in the case of frequent itemsets, it might not be worth being used for rare itemsets, as they occur on the top of the lattice. We propose Rarity, a top-down breadth-first level-wise algorithm. Experimental results and comparisons are illustrated in order to provide a quantitative characterization of algorithm performances and complexity. Application to some UCI benchmark and real world datasets is provided. An algorithm parallelization is outlined. Experiments showed that this approach takes advantage of finding all rare non-zero itemsets in less time than other solutions, at expenses of higher memory demand.

Traditional data mining approaches are typically developed for single-table databases, and are not directly applicable to multi-relational data. Nevertheless, multi-relational data is a more truthful and therefore often also a more powerful representation of reality. Mining patterns of a suitably expressive syntax directly from this representation, is thus a research problem of great importance. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to mining patterns in multi-relational data. We propose a new syntax for multi-relational patterns as complete connected subsets of database entities. We show how this pattern syntax is generally applicable to multi-relational data, while it reduces to well-known tiles " Geerts et al. (Proceedings of Discovery Science, pp 278-289, 2004)" when the data is a simple binary or attribute-value table. We propose RMiner, a simple yet practically efficient divide and conquer algorithm to mine such patterns which is an instantiation of an algorithmic framework for efficiently enumerating all fixed points of a suitable closure operator "Boley et al. (Theor Comput Sci 411(3):691-700, 2010)". We show how the interestingness of patterns of the proposed syntax can conveniently be quantified using a general framework for quantifying subjective interestingness of patterns "De Bie (Data Min Knowl Discov 23(3):407-446, 2011b)". Finally, we illustrate the usefulness and the general applicability of our approach by discussing results on real-world and synthetic databases.

Given two sets of objects and , a top-k similarity join returns k pairs of most similar objects from . In the conventional model of top-k similarity join processing, an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity is measured by some simple distance metrics like Euclidean distance. However, in many applications an object may be described by multiple values (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable since it does not address the distributions of object instances. In this paper, we study top-k similarity join over multi-valued objects. We apply two types of quantile based distance measures, I center dot-quantile distance and I center dot-quantile group-base distance, to explore the relative instance distribution among the multiple instances of objects. Efficient and effective techniques to process top-k similarity joins over multi-valued objects are developed following a filtering-refinement framework. Novel distance, statistic and weight based pruning techniques are proposed. Comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our techniques.

J	Honko, P				Honko, Piotr			Upgrading a Granular Computing Based Data Mining Framework to a Relational Case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								One of the popular methods to develop an algorithm for mining data stored in a relational structure is to upgrade an existing attribute-value algorithm to a relational case. Current approaches to this problem have some shortcomings such as (1) a dependence on the upgrading process of the algorithm to be extended, (2) complicated redefinitions of crucial notions (e.g., pattern generality, pattern refinement), and (3) a tolerant limitation of the search space for pattern discovery. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a general methodology for upgrading a data mining framework to a relational case. This methodology is defined in a granular computing environment. Thanks to our relational extension of a granular computing based data mining framework, the three above problems can be overcome.

Although this fact has been pointed out in the past, it is still worth periodic updates so that the metadata obtained by global analysis of the available crystal structures, as well as the utilization of the individual structures for tasks such as drug design, should be based on only the most reliable data. Here, selected abnormal deposited structures have been analysed based on the Bayesian reasoning that the correctness of a model must be judged against both the primary evidence as well as prior knowledge. These structures, as well as information gained from the corresponding publications (if available), have emphasized some of the most prevalent types of common problems. The errors are often perfect illustrations of the nature of human cognition, which is frequently influenced by preconceptions that may lead to fanciful results in the absence of proper validation. Common errors can be traced to negligence and a lack of rigorous verification of the models against electron density, creation of non-parsimonious models, generation of improbable numbers, application of incorrect symmetry, illogical presentation of the results, or violation of the rules of chemistry and physics. Paying more attention to such problems, not only in the final validation stages but during the structure-determination process as well, is necessary not only in order to maintain the highest possible quality of the structural repositories and databases but most of all to provide a solid basis for subsequent studies, including large-scale data-mining projects. For many scientists PDB deposition is a rather infrequent event, so the need for proper training and supervision is emphasized, as well as the need for constant alertness of reason and critical judgment as absolutely necessary safeguarding measures against such problems. Ways of identifying more problematic structures are suggested so that their users may be properly alerted to their possible shortcomings.

As for multi-criteria optimization classifier (MCOC), it can learn a decision function from different classes of training data and use it to predict the class labels of unknown samples. In many real world applications, owing to noises, outliers, imbalanced class distribution, nonlinearly separable problems, and other uncertainties, the predictive performance of MCOC degenerates rapidly. In this paper, we introduce a fuzzy contribution to each instance of training data, the unequal penalty factors to the samples in imbalanced classes, and kernel method to nonlinearly separable dataset, then a novel multi-criteria optimization classifier with fuzzification, kernel and penalty factors (FKP-MCOC) is constructed so as to reduce the effects of anomalies, improve the class imbalanced performance, and nonlinear separability in classification. The experimental results of predicting active compounds and protein interaction hot spots and comparison with MCOC, support vector machines (SVM) and fuzzy SVM, the conclusion shows that FKP-MCOC significantly increases the efficiency of classification, the partition of active and inactive compounds in bioassay, the separation of hot spot residues and energetically unimportant residues in protein interactions, and the generalization of predicting active compounds and hot spot residues in new instances.

Due to the difficulty of analyzing this massive volume of data using traditional methods, medical data mining on Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been a major concern in medical research. Therefore, it is necessary to assess EHR architectures based on the capabilities of extracting useful medical knowledge from a huge amount of EHR databases. In this paper, we develop a bi-level interactive decision support framework to identify data mining-oriented EHR architectures. The contribution of this bi-level framework is fourfold: (1) it develops Interactive Simple Additive Weighting (ISAW) model from an individual single-level environment to a group bi-level environment; (2) it utilizes decision makers' preferences gradually in the course of interactions to reach to a consensus on an data mining-oriented EHR architecture; (3) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; and (4) it synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative and quantitative indicators in the EHR assessment process. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed bi-level interactive framework for benchmarking a national data mining-oriented EHR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed framework can solve the problem of sparsity and the cold-start problem which affect traditional CF algorithms. The fuzzy linguistic model, which is a more natural way for the consumer to present their preferences, is adopted within the proposed framework. Based on these concepts, two algorithms, a simple aggregated (SA) algorithm and aggregated subjective and objective users' viewpoint (ASOV) algorithm are developed. A series of experiments is performed, the results of which indicate that the proposed methodologies produce high-quality recommendations. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed algorithms perform better than the traditional method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modeling multiple land use changes using ANN, CART and MARS: Comparing tradeoffs in goodness of fit and explanatory power of data mining tools	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Land Transformation Model - Multiple; Classifications (LTM-MC); Classification And Regression Trees (CART); Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS); Multiple Classifications (MC)	CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; SIMULATION; AREA; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	Over half of the earth's terrestrial surface has been modified by humans. This modification is called land use change and its pattern is known to occur in a non-linear way. The land use change modeling community can advance its models using data mining tools. Here, we present three data mining land use change models, one based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), another on Classification And Regression Trees (CART) and another Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). We reconfigured the three data mining models to concurrently simulate multiple land use classes (e.g. agriculture, forest and urban) in South-Eastern Wisconsin (SEWI), USA (time interval 1990-2000) and in Muskegon River Watershed (MRW), Michigan, USA (time interval 1978-1998). We compared the results of the three data mining tools using relative operating characteristic (ROC) and percent correct match (PCM). We found that ANN provided the best accuracy in both areas for three land use classes (e.g. urban, agriculture and forest). In addition, in both regions, CART and MARS both showed that forest gain occurred in areas close to current forests, agriculture patches and away from roads. Urban increased in areas of high urban density, close to roads and in areas with few forests and wetlands. We also found that agriculture gain is more likely for the areas closer to the agriculture and forest patches. Elevation strongly influenced urbanization and forest gain in MRW while it has no effect in SEWI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to solve these kinds of data special tactics like data mining are needed. Data mining may meet these kinds of needs with both categorizing and piling tactic. In this study, we have used data mining by using Rural Development Investment Support Program (RDISP) data with various categorizing algorithms. The most prospering categorizing algorithm was tried to determine by using present data. At the end of analysis, it has been understood that MLP (multilayer perceptron), a nerve net model, is the best algorithm that makes the best categorizing.

Therefore, NA is an interesting potential target to design promising NA inhibitiors to serve as antiviral agents for preventing viral propagation. In this study, a data set of 61 H1N1 neuraminidase inhibitors of influenza A virus was employed in the construction of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model using the CORrelation And Logic (CORAL) software available at http://www.insilico.eu/coral. The chemical structure of compounds in the SMILES format was used as input to CORAL in discerning the correlation between an endpoint (i.e. neuraminidase inhibitory activity) and their corresponding molecular descriptors. Three random splits of the data into sub-training, calibration and testing sets were carried out. The optimal threshold and number of epoch to use in building the QSAR models were derived from the CORAL software. Results indicated that the QSAR models displayed good prediction performance as deduced from statistical parameters affording r(2) = 0.7783-0.9166, 0.7609-0.8336 and 0.8384-0.9069 and q(2) = 0.7453-0.8924, and 0.7311-0.7939 and 0.8051-0.8843 for sub-training, calibration and test set, respectively. Furthermore, F value and standard error of estimation provided good statistical results for the predictive performance of QSAR models. Interpretations of the derived structure-activity relationship provided pertinent knowledge on the origins of good and poor neuraminidase inhibitory activity. Therefore, the QSAR model holds great potential for the rational design of novel neuraminidase inhibitors.

The model is based on the Gamma classifier, which is inspired on the Alpha-Beta associative memories, which are both supervised pattern recognition models. The objective is to mine known patterns in the time series in order to forecast unknown values, with the distinctive characteristic that said unknown values may be towards the future or the past of known samples. The proposed model performance is tested both on time series forecasting benchmarks and a data set of oil monthly production. Some features of interest in the experimental data sets are spikes, abrupt changes and frequent discontinuities, which considerably decrease the precision of traditional forecasting methods. As experimental results show, this classifier-based predictor exhibits competitive performance. The advantages and limitations of the model, as well as lines of improvement, are discussed.

In this work, the use of a network representation is proposed for studying the appearance of Loss of Separation events, a kind of safety occurrence in which two aircraft violate the minimal separation while airborne. The topological analysis of networks representing the structure of traffic flows allows identifying situations in which the probability of appearance of such events is increased. Beyond these specific results, this work demonstrates the usefulness of the complex network approach in the analysis of operational patterns and occurrences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, we analyse ANNs - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Functions (REP) and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) - decision trees, the logistic regression model and discriminant analysis. To this end, we worked with a sample of 2666 teenagers, 1378 of whom do not consume nicotine while 1288 are nicotine consumers. The models analysed were able to discriminate correctly between both types of subjects within a range of 77.39% to 78.20%, achieving 91.29% sensitivity and 74.32% specificity. With this study, we place at the disposal of specialists in addictive behaviours a set of advanced statistical techniques that are capable of simultaneously processing a large quantity of variables and subjects, as well as learning complex patterns and relationships automatically, in such a way that they are very appropriate for predicting and preventing addictive behaviour.

Parameter variation and data mining of oil-film bearings: a stochastic study on the Reynolds's equation of lubrication	ARCHIVE OF APPLIED MECHANICS			English	Article						Oil-film bearings; Reynolds equation; Stochastic study; Parameter variation; Data mining; Bearing design; Oil-film properties; Parameter correlation; Sensitivity analysis; Self-organizing maps		The modeling and simulation process of oil-film bearing dynamics constitutes a rather essential task integrated in the workflow of various mechanical products. Specifically, in the turbo charger industry, the correct capture and understanding of the associated nonlinear rotating dynamics is of utmost importance, since the system's efficiency and lifetime span depends on it. The root cause of the nonlinear rotordynamic effects is the oil-film concentrated in the rotor's journal bearings. Its behavior is highly coupled with both the system's geometric and dynamic configuration. The dynamics of the oil-film are described by the well-known Navier-Stokes equation, which under a series of assumptions and simplifications results to the, so-called, Reynolds equation. In this paper, the Reynolds equation is numerically solved based on a finite difference scheme and several parameter variation studies are conducted in an effort to pinpoint the most influential parameters-journal bearing geometric dimensions, oil-film properties and rotor-velocity-driven inputs-with respect to designated responses-friction, oil-film pressure force, minimum oil-film thickness and boundary oil-flow-all of which are regarded as important in terms of the aforementioned system's efficiency and lifetime span. Based on multivariate analysis algorithms, correlation outcomes and global sensitivity results are presented. In an effort to capture possible nonlinear phenomena, which might not be possible via linear data mining tools, the Spearman rank-order coefficient and self-organizing maps methodology are applied.

J	Lorentzen, DG				Lorentzen, David Gunnarsson			Webometrics benefitting from web mining? An investigation of methods and applications of two research fields	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Webometrics; Cybermetrics; Web mining; Web data mining; Literature review	WORLD-WIDE-WEB; LINK ANALYSIS; ACADEMIC WEB; SOUTH-KOREA; BUSINESS DISCIPLINES; HYPERLINK ANALYSIS; SITE INTERLINKING; CITATION ANALYSIS; NETWORK STRUCTURE; DECISIONAL DNA	Webometrics and web mining are two fields where research is focused on quantitative analyses of the web. This literature review outlines definitions of the fields, and then focuses on their methods and applications. It also discusses the potential of closer contact and collaboration between them. A key difference between the fields is that webometrics has focused on exploratory studies, whereas web mining has been dominated by studies focusing on development of methods and algorithms. Differences in type of data can also be seen, with webometrics more focused on analyses of the structure of the web and web mining more focused on web content and usage, even though both fields have been embracing the possibilities of user generated content. It is concluded that research problems where big data is needed can benefit from collaboration between webometricians, with their tradition of exploratory studies, and web miners, with their tradition of developing methods and algorithms.

A framework for building hypercubes using MapReduce	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Hypercube; Histogram; Data mining; MapReduce; Hadoop; Framework; Column-oriented; Gaia mission		The European Space Agency's Gaia mission will create the largest and most precise three dimensional chart of our galaxy (the Milky Way), by providing unprecedented position, parallax, proper motion, and radial velocity measurements for about one billion stars. The resulting catalog will be made available to the scientific community and will be analyzed in many different ways, including the production of a variety of statistics. The latter will often entail the generation of multidimensional histograms and hypercubes as part of the precomputed statistics for each data release, or for scientific analysis involving either the final data products or the raw data coming from the satellite instruments. In this paper we present and analyze a generic framework that allows the hypercube generation to be easily done within a MapReduce infrastructure, providing all the advantages of the new Big Data analysis paradigm but without dealing with any specific interface to the lower level distributed system implementation (Hadoop). Furthermore, we show how executing the framework for different data storage model configurations (i.e. row or column oriented) and compression techniques can considerably improve the response time of this type of workload for the currently available simulated data of the mission. In addition, we put forward the advantages and shortcomings of the deployment of the framework on a public cloud provider, benchmark against other popular solutions available (that are not always the best for such ad-hoc applications), and describe some user experiences with the framework, which was employed for a number of dedicated astronomical data analysis techniques workshops.
