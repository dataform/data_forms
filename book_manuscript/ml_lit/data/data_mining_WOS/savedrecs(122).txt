Instances of these applications include pervasive social networking, games, file sharing and so on. In such scenarios, users are usually involved in selecting the peers with whom communication should take place, continuously facing trust issues. Unfortunately, providing trust support in a pervasive world is challenging due to peer mobility and lack in central control. We propose a novel approach that establishes trust leveraging users' profiles: humans today produce rich strings of unique data twenty-four hours a day. These information enables a task-aware trust model, namely a finer-grained model in which users are classified as trusted or not depending on the intended business activity. However, simply collecting user's interests may be insufficient to provide a reasonable trust management system. In order to enable the system to recognize malicious users, we include a recommendation subsystem based on the Wilson score confidence interval. It has been designed to be lightweight, minimizing battery depletion. It also protects user privacy. To make our approach fully deployable, it supports two modalities: a TPM-based one and a TPM-less one. The former gives more security guarantees and ensures a fully distributed approach. The latter, requires a Trusted Authority to avoid feedbacks to get tampered and is no more fully distributed.

Traditionally, the output of a group ranking problem can be classified into ranking lists and maximum consensus sequences. In this study, we propose a consensus preference graph approach to represent the coherent aggregated results of users' preferences. The advantages of our approach are that (1) the graph is built based on users' consensuses, (2) the graph can be understood intuitively, and (3) the relationships between items can be easily seen. An algorithm is developed to construct the consensus preference graph from users' total ranking data. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out using synthetic and real data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and can effectively identify consensus graphs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using the method developed, the influence degree of each input variable to the transmittance could be obtained and then the useful influencing inputs could also be determined. In this research, the data of the transmittance of TP film with Cr and Cr2O3 coating are studied. The possible influencing factors including the coating target composition, the layers of coating material, the film's thickness, the position of panel placed and the rotation speed of evaporator's holder are collected and analyzed.

The shape dynamics describe the spatial-temporal shape deformation of a human body during its movement and thus provide important information about the identity of a human subject and the motions performed by the subject. The dynamic shapes of four subjects in five activities (digging, jogging, limping, throwing, and walking) were created via 3-D motion replication. The Paquet Shape Descriptor (PSD) was used to describe subject shapes in each frame. The principal component analysis was performed on the calculated PSDs and principal components (PCs) were used to characterize PSDs. The PSD calculation was then reasonably approximated by its significant projections in the eigen-space formed by PCs and represented by the corresponding projection coefficients. As such, the dynamic human shapes for each activity were described by these projection coefficients, which in turn, along with their derivatives were used to form the feature vectors (attribute sets) for activity classification. Data mining technology was employed with six classification methods used. Seven attribute sets were evaluated with high classification accuracy attained for most of them. The results from this investigation illustrate the great potential of human shape dynamics for activity recognition.

J	Cheng, ZY; Caverlee, J; Lee, K				Cheng, Zhiyuan; Caverlee, James; Lee, Kyumin			A Content-Driven Framework for Geolocating Microblog Users	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Microblog; Twitter; location-based estimation; spatial data mining; text mining		Highly dynamic real-time microblog systems have already published petabytes of real-time human sensor data in the form of status updates. However, the lack of user adoption of geo-based features per user or per post signals that the promise of microblog services as location-based sensing systems may have only limited reach and impact. Thus, in this article, we propose and evaluate a probabilistic framework for estimating a microblog user's location based purely on the content of the user's posts. Our framework can overcome the sparsity of geo-enabled features in these services and bring augmented scope and breadth to emerging location-based personalized information services. Three of the key features of the proposed approach are: (i) its reliance purely on publicly available content; (ii) a classification component for automatically identifying words in posts with a strong local geo-scope; and (iii) a lattice-based neighborhood smoothing model for refining a user's location estimate. On average we find that the location estimates converge quickly, placing 51% of users within 100 miles of their actual location.

Protein Sequence Motif Patterns using Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means Granular Computing Model	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, INFORMATICS AND MEDICAL ENGINEERING (PRIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering (PRIME)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Salem, INDIA		Periyar Univ, Dept Comp Sci	Proteins; Motif; Clustering; Weighted K-Means; SVD	DATABASE	Data Mining is the process to extract hidden predictive information from large databases. In Bioinformatics, data mining enables researchers to meet the challenge of mining large amount of biomolecular data to discover real knowledge. Major research efforts done in the area of bioinformatics involves sequence analysis, protein structure prediction and gene finding. Proteins are said to be prominent molecules in our cells. They involve virtually in all cell functions. The activities and functions of proteins can be determined by protein sequence motifs. These protein motifs are identified from the segments of protein sequences. All segments may not be important to produce good motif patterns. The generated sequence segments do not have classes or labels. Hence, unsupervised segment selection technique is adopted to select significant segments. Therefore Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy method is adopted to select significant sequence segments. In this proposed work, weighted K-Means and Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means have been applied to the selected segments to generate granules, since large amount of segments cannot be grouped or clustered as such. Each granules generated by weighted K-Means algorithm are further clustered by using the K-Means algorithm and granules generated by Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means algorithm are clustered by using Weighted K-Means. The two proposed models are compared with K-Means granular computing model. The experimental results show that Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means with Weighted K-Means technique produces better results than K-Means and weighted K-Means granular computing methods.

If the dataset has an enough amount of labeled data points, the optimal value for the model parameter can be found via validation by using a subset of the given dataset. However, for semi-supervised learning one of the most recent learning algorithms, this is not as available as in conventional supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, it is assumed that the dataset is given with only a few labeled data points. Therefore, holding out some of labeled data points for validation is not easy. The lack of labeled data points, furthermore, makes it difficult to estimate the degree of noise in the dataset. To circumvent the addressed difficulties, we propose to employ ensemble learning and graph sharpening. The former replaces the model parameter selection procedure to an ensemble network of the committee members trained with various values of model parameter. The latter, on the other hand, improves the performance of algorithms by removing unhelpful information caused by noise. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method for many real-world problems with no concern for the technical difficulties, by selecting the best parameter values and mitigating the influence of noise.

Its goal is to extract knowledge from massive datasets in a human-understandable structure, for example, the decision trees. In this article we present an innovative, high-performance, system-level architecture for the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) algorithm, one of the most important and widely used algorithms in the data mining area. Our proposed architecture exploits parallelism at the decision variable level, and was fully implemented and evaluated on a modern high-performance reconfigurable platform, the Convey HC-1 server, that features four FPGAs and a multicore processor. Our FPGA-based implementation was integrated with the widely used "rpart" software library of the R project in order to provide the first fully functional reconfigurable system that can handle real-world large databases. The proposed system, named HC-CART system, achieves a performance speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to well-known single-threaded data mining software platforms, such as WEKA and the R platform. It also outperforms similar hardware systems which implement parts of the complete application by an order of magnitude. Finally, we show that the HC-CART system offers higher performance speedup than some other proposed parallel software implementations of decision tree construction algorithms.

Research Scientist states that: "Data Mining is a mixture of statistics, artificial intelligence and database research." In other words, the purpose of this process is the automatic discovery of knowledge hidden in data using various computational techniques. The purpose of this work is represented by the analysis of the impact of GRID technology for storing and processing large amounts of information and knowledge. Using computational power of computers and the most effective means of working with data, information exploitation is no longer a difficulty. It shows a strong expansion of the use of GRID technologies in various fields, as a consequence of the development of our society and, in particular, of the scientific and technical world that require technologies that allow all parties to use resources in a well-controlled and well organized way. Therefore, we can use GRID technologies for Data Mining processing. To see what the data "mining" process consist of, we must go through the following steps: construction and validation of the model and application of the model to new data. GRID - Data Mining connection can be successfully used to monitor environmental factors in environmental protection field, in civil engineering field to monitor the behavior in time, in medical field to determine diagnoses, in telecommunications. To be able to develop "mining" applications of the distributed data within a GRID network, the infrastructure that will be used is the Knowledge GRID one. This high level infrastructure has an architecture dedicated to data "mining" operations and specialized services for resource discovery stored in distributed deposits, information services management. In this concept, the achievement of data storage and processing is one of the most effective ways one can obtain results with high accuracy, according to initial requirements, using the automated knowledge discovery principles from the entire resource of knowledge existing in different systems. We can say that the main benefit obtained by using Knowledge GRID architecture is a major improvement in the execution speed of the "mining" process.

This data can be the starting point of data mining processes that could provide useful information for the design and adaptation of different therapies to obtain the maximum efficiency. Because data dimensionality affects the performances of data mining tasks, this paper presents two supervised feature selection methods to be used in the frame of an information system. These methods were validated by experiments in the classification of Romanian patients with speech disorders.

Thus, it is an urgent problem of great importance when mining high-dimensional data. However, there are some challenges for mining data of high dimensions, the first one is the curse of dimensionality and the second one is the meaningfulness of the similarity measure in the high dimension space. In this paper, we present several state-of-art techniques for constructing three data mining models with analyzing high-dimensional data, these models include frequent pattern mining, clustering, and classification. And we discuss how these methods deal with the challenges of high dimensionality.

A compact but high quality set of patterns, such as closed patterns and maximal patterns is needed. Most of the previously maximal sequential pattern mining algorithms on high dimensional sequence, such as biological data set, work under the same support. In this paper, an efficient algorithm MM-PrefixSpan (Maximal and Multi-Support-based PrefixSpan) for mining maximal patterns based on multi-support is proposed. Thorough performances on Beta-globin gene sequences have demonstrated that MM-PrefixSpan consumes less memory usage and runtime than PrefixSpan.

Even if the research on text categorization has been progressed very much, traditional approaches to text categorization require encoding documents into numerical vectors which leads to the two main problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution in each numerical vector. Although many various feature selection methods are developed to address the first problem, the reduced dimension remains still large. If the dimension is reduced excessively by a feature selection method, robustness of text categorization is degraded. The idea of this research as the solution to the problems is to encode medical documents into string vectors and apply it to the novel competitive neural network as a string vector. The quantitative experiment results demonstrate that this method can significantly improve the performance of medical document classification.

It is essential that the mining algorithm should be efficient in both time and space for data stream is continuous and unbounded. To the best of our knowledge, the existing algorithms require multiple database scans to mine high utility itemsets, and this hinders their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new data structure, called UT-Tree (Utility on Tail Tree), for maintaining utility information of transaction itemsets to avoid multiple database scans. The UT-Tree is created with one database scan, and contains a fixed number of transaction itemsets; utility information is stored on tail-nodes only. Based on the proposed data structure and the sliding window approach, we propose a mining algorithm, called HUM-UT (High Utility itemsets Mining based on UT-Tree), to find high utility itemsets from transactional data streams. The HUM-UT algorithm mines high utility itemsets from the UT-Tree without additional database scan. Experiment results show that our algorithm has better performance and is more stable under different experimental conditions than the state-of-the-art algorithm HUPMS in terms of time and space.

The global linear algorithms characterize the local sampling information, thereby making it superior to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, these algorithms are all inefficient for extracting the local data feature, which leads to incomplete learning. A new global linear algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is named Maximal Similarity Embedding (MSE). The preserving local feature of this new algorithm makes it distinct from most other methods. The MSE algorithm utilizes the Cosine Metric to describe the geometric characteristics of neighborhood and thus seeks to maximize the global similarity for dimensionality reduction. This new proposal method is robust for sparse dataset and naturally helps in avoiding the problem of small sample size cases. Extensive experiments have been performed on both synthetic and real-world images to prove the efficiency of the MSE algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Overview on the Structure and Applications for Business Intelligence and Data Mining in Cloud Computing	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIZATIONS: SERVICE AND CLOUD COMPUTING	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Knowledge Management in Organizations (KMO 2012)	JUL 11-13, 2012	Salamanca, SPAIN				MAPREDUCE	Cloud Computing is a new computational paradigm which has attracted a lot of interest within the business and research community. Its objective is to integrate a wide amount of heterogeneous resources in an online way to provide services under demand to different types of users, which are liberated from the details of the inner infrastructure, just concentrating on their request of resources over the net. Its main features include an elastic resource configuration and therefore a suitable framework for addressing scalability in an optimal way. From the different scenarios in which Cloud Computing could be applied, its use in Business Intelligence and Data Mining in enterprises delivers the highest expectations. The main aim is to extract knowledge of the current working of the business, and therefore to be able to anticipate certain critical operations, such as those based on sales data, fraud detection or the analysis of the clients' behavior. In this work, we give an overview of the current state of the structure of Cloud Computing for applications on Business Intelligence and Data Mining. We provide details of the layers that are needed to develop such a system in different levels of abstraction, that is, from the underlying hardware platforms to the software resources available to implement the applications. Finally, we present some examples of approaches from the field of Data Mining that had been migrated to the Cloud Computing paradigm.

Combining this technology with intelligent systems will permit to automate most of the decisions needed to generate the appropriate sanitary resource sets, thereby reducing the time from the occurrence of the accident to the stabilization and hospitalization of the injured passengers. However, generating the optimal allocation of sanitary resources is not an easy task, since there are several objectives that are mutually exclusive, such as assistance improvement, cost reduction, and balanced resource usage. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the sanitary resources allocation in traffic accidents. Our approach is based on the use of multi-objective genetic algorithms, and it is able to generate a list of optimal solutions accounting for the most representative factors. The inputs to our model are: (i) the accident notification, which is obtained through vehicular communication systems, and (ii) the severity estimation for the accident, achieved through data mining. We evaluate our approach under a set of vehicular scenarios, and the results show that a memetic version of the NSGA-II algorithm was the most effective method at locating the optimal resource set, while maintaining enough variability in the solutions to allow applying different resource allocation policies.

This paper focuses On the use of KOLAM for target tracking in high-resolution, high throughput wide format video also known as wide-area motion imagery (WAMI). It was originally developed for the interactive visualization of extremely large geospatial imagery of high spatial and spectral resolution. KOLAM is plat form, operating system and (graphics) hardware independent, and supports embedded datasets scalable from hundreds of gigabytes to feasibly petabytes in size on clusters, workstations, desktops and mobile computers. In addition to rapid roam, zoom and hyper-jump spatial operations, a large number of simultaneously viewable embedded pyramid layers (also referred to as multiscale or sparse imagery), interactive colormap and histogram enhancement; spherical projection and terrain maps are supported. The KOLAM software architecture was extended to support airborne wide-area motion imagery by organizing spatiotemporal tiles in very large format video frames using a temporal cache of tiled pyramid cached data structures. The current version supports WAMI animation, fast intelligent inspection, trajectory visualization and target tracking (digital tagging); the latter by interfacing with external automatic tracking software. One of the critical needs for working with WAMI is a supervised tracking and visualization tool that allows analysts to digitally tag multiple targets, quickly review and correct tracking results and apply geospatial visual analytic tools on the generated trajectories. One-click manual tracking combined with multiple automated tracking algorithms are available to assist the analyst and increase human effectiveness.

Both craquelure separation and retouching identification are important steps in art restoration process. Since the main goal is to enable recognition of character and cause of damage, as well as forecasting its further enlargement, a proper tool for precise detection of the pattern is needed. However, the complex nature of the pattern is a reason why a simple, universal detection algorithm is not always possible to implement. Algorithms presented in this work apply mining structures which depend of expandable set of attributes forming a feature vector, and thus offer an elastic structure for analysis.(1)	Univ Bielsko Biala, PL-43309 Bielsko Biala, Poland	Gancarczyk, J (reprint author), Univ Bielsko Biala, Willowa 2, PL-43309 Bielsko Biala, Poland.	jgan@ath.bielsko.pl					Abas F.S., 2002, P IEEE 14 INT C DIG, P111; Abas F.S., 2004, THESIS U SOUTHAMPTON; Abas F.S., 2003, IST SPIES 15 ANN S E; Barni M, 2005, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V22, P141, DOI 10.1109/MSP.2005.1511835; Barni M, 2000, IEEE MULTIMEDIA, V7, P34, DOI 10.1109/93.848424; Bucklow S.L., 1998, COMPUT HUMANITIES, V31, P503; Cappelfini V., 2006, P EUSIPCO 2006 FLOR; Cappellini V, 2003, J VISUAL COMP ANIMAT, V14, P149, DOI 10.1002/vis.313; De Willigen P., 1999, MATH STUDY CRAQUELUR; Gancarczyk J., DECISION TR IN PRESS; Gonzalez R, 2007, DIGITAL IMAGE PROCES; Gupta A., 2008, THAMMASAT INT J SC T, V13, P66; Hanbury A., 2003, P ICIAP 2003 MANT IT; Liu J, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4820, P121; Serra J, 1982, IMAGE ANAL MATH MORP, V1; Sobczyk J., 2006, OCHRONA ZABYTKOW, V2, P69; Stork DG, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5702, P9; Stout G.L., 1977, JAIC, V17, P17, DOI 10.2307/3179359; Tadeusiewicz R., 1997, COMPUTER ANAL IMAGE	19	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	2194-5357	978-3-642-32517-5	ADV INTELL SYST			2013	185						373	381				9	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BDE92	WOS:000312972300035

To ensure a good quality of experience, this diverse environment demands adaptability of the video stream. In general, video contents are compressed to save storage capacity and to reduce the bandwidth required for its transmission. Therefore, if these compressed video streams were compressed using scalable video coding schemes, they would be able to adapt to those heterogeneous networks and a wide range of terminals. Since the majority of the multimedia contents are compressed using H.264/AVC, they cannot benefit from that scalability. This paper proposes a low-complexity algorithm to convert an H.264/AVC bitstream without scalability to scalable bitstreams with temporal scalability in baseline and main profiles by accelerating the mode decision task of the scalable video coding encoding stage using machine learning tools. The results show that when our technique is applied, the complexity is reduced by 87% while maintaining coding efficiency.

J	Giannella, CR; Liu, K; Kargupta, H				Giannella, Chris R.; Liu, Kun; Kargupta, Hillol			Breaching Euclidean distance-preserving data perturbation using few known inputs	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Euclidean distance; Privacy; Data mining; Data perturbation	PRIVACY; ALGORITHMS; ANONYMITY	We examine Euclidean distance-preserving data perturbation as a tool for privacy-preserving data mining. Such perturbations allow many important data mining algorithms (e.g. hierarchical and k-means clustering), with only minor modification, to be applied to the perturbed data and produce exactly the same results as if applied to the original data. However, the issue of how well the privacy of the original data is preserved needs careful study. We engage in this study by assuming the role of an attacker armed with a small set of known original data tuples (inputs). Little work has been done examining this kind of attack when the number of known original tuples is less than the number of data dimensions. We focus on this important case, develop and rigorously analyze an attack that utilizes any number of known original tuples. The approach allows the attacker to estimate the original data tuple associated with each perturbed tuple and calculate the probability that the estimation results in a privacy breach. On a real 16-dimensional dataset, we show that the attacker, with 4 known original tuples, can estimate an original unknown tuple with less than 7% error with probability exceeding 0.8.

To this end, we propose a regularized shared subspace learning framework, which can exploit the mutual strengths of related data sources while being immune to the effects of the variabilities of each source. This is achieved by further imposing a mutual orthogonality constraint on the constituent subspaces which segregates the common patterns from the source specific patterns, and thus, avoids performance degradations. Our approach is rooted in nonnegative matrix factorization and extends it further to enable joint analysis of related data sources. Experiments performed using three real world data sets for both retrieval and clustering applications demonstrate the benefits of regularization and validate the effectiveness of the model. Our proposed solution provides a formal framework appropriate for jointly analyzing related data sources and therefore, it is applicable to a wider context in data mining.

J	Hsu, YC; Lin, SF				Hsu, Yung-Chi; Lin, Sheng-Fuu			Self-organization hybrid evolution learning algorithm for recurrent wavelet-based neuro-fuzzy identifier design	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy model; control; group-based symbiotic evolution; FP-Growth; identification	SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CONTROLLER-DESIGN; SYSTEMS; PREDICTION; NETWORKS	In this paper, a recurrent wavelet-based neuro-fuzzy identifier (RWNFI) with a self-organization hybrid evolution learning algorithm (SOHELA) is proposed for solving various identification problems. In the proposed SOHELA, the group-based symbiotic evolution (GSE) is adopted such that each group in the GSE represents a collection of only one fuzzy rule. The proposed SOHELA consists of structure learning and parameter learning. In structure learning, the proposed SOHELA uses the self-organization algorithm (SOA) to determine a suitable rule number in the RWNFI. In parameter learning, the proposed SOHELA uses the data mining-based selection method (DMSM) and the data mining-based crossover method (DMCM) to determine groups and parent groups using the data mining method called the frequent pattern growth (FP-Growth) method. Based on identification simulations, the excellent performance of the proposed SOHELA compares with other various existing models.

J	Huang, CY; Lin, YH				Huang, Chien-Yi; Lin, Yueh-Hsun			Applying CHAID algorithm to investigate critical attributes of void formation in QFN assembly	SOLDERING & SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Programming and algorithm theory; Chi-square automatic interaction detection; Data mining; Soldering; Void; Quad flat non-lead; Assembly	FREE SOLDER JOINTS; RELIABILITY; TEMPERATURE; QUALITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ data mining as a new diagnosing scheme for investigating void formation to the thermal pad in quad flat non-lead (QFN) assembly. Occurrences of voiding in various scenarios of component design, materials selection and manufacturing process are analyzed. Design/methodology/approach - This research investigates the process yield of a PCB assembly for a handheld device in the electronics manufacturing industry using the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) algorithm and chi-square test. Practical data generated by an Xray apparatus from the shop floor are collected. The critical attributes to the void formation (in the solder joint) of the QFN component are identified. Findings - Stocking the PCB material beyond ten days may increase the level of voiding by 1%. Using PCB provided by vendor U helps decrease the level of voiding by 1.6%. Stocking the component material above 43 days may increase the level of voiding by 1.9%. In addition, reflow soldering profile with time above liquid (TAL) less than or equal to 62 sec and with peak temperature higher than or equal to 241 degrees C generate less voids. Finally, the via-in-pad design causes a concave geometry on the surface of thermal pad which contributes to the voiding formation. The amount of voiding can be further diminished by plugging the via with plated copper. Originality/value - This research implements CHAID that extracts useful knowledge from a huge amount of manufacturing data in order to realize the complex interaction effects through automated analysis. The extent of voiding in the samples using the optimal process suggested through CHAID algorithm can be reduced from 16% to 10.2%.

An important advantage of these classification systems is that, using association rule mining they are able to examine several features at a time. Associative classifiers are especially fit to applications where the model may assist the domain experts in their decisions. Cardiovascular deceases are the number one cause of death globally. An estimated 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008, representing 30% of all global deaths. India is at risk of more deaths due to CHD. Cardiovascular disease is becoming an increasingly important cause of death in Andhra Pradesh. Hence a decision support system is proposed for predicting heart disease of a patient. In this paper we propose a new Associate classification algorithm for predicting heart disease for Andhra Pradesh population. Experiments show that the accuracy of the resulting rule set is better when compared to existing systems. This approach is expected to help physicians to make accurate decisions.	[Jabbar, M.

Discovery of Knowledge Patterns in Lymphographic Clinical Data through Data Mining Methods and Techniques	ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 3	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing and Informaiton Technology (ACITY 2012)	JUL 13-15, 2012	Chennai, INDIA			Data Mining; Lymphography; Feature Selection; Classification; Machine Learning	CLASSIFICATION	Data mining refers to a process that aims at extracting knowledge by discovering new patterns from large datasets. Classification is a data mining task that generalizes an established, proven structure to apply to new data. A dominant area of modern-day research is the field of medical investigations that include disease prediction and malady categorization. In this paper, our focus is to design an efficient classifier that is trained to classify oncogenic data. The Lymphographic dataset is utilized by means of machine learning techniques to train the classifier using feature selection and classification algorithms. Feature selection is a supervised method that attempts to select a subset of the predictor features based on the information gain. The Lymphography dataset comprises of 18 predictor attributes and 148 instances with the class label having four distinct values. This paper highlights the performance of sixteen classification algorithms on the Lymphographic dataset that enables the classifier to accurately perform multi-class categorization of medical data. Furthermore our research work also places emphasis on the performance of four feature selection algorithms and their impact on the classification accuracy. Our work asserts the fact that the Random Tree algorithm and the Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm give 100 percent classification accuracy with all the predictor features and also with the feature subset selected by the Fisher Filtering feature selection algorithm. Moreover ReliefF feature selection algorithm gives improved results for Radial Basis Function algorithm improving the classifier accuracy by 1.35%.

J	Jaddi, NS; Abdullah, S				Jaddi, Najmeh Sadat; Abdullah, Salwani			Nonlinear Great Deluge Algorithm for Rough Set Attribute Reduction	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						nonlinear great deluge algorithm; rough set theory; attribute reduction; classification; optimization		The process of reducing the number of attributes from an information system is known as attribute reduction problem. The action of attribute reduction problem is an important step of pre-processing in data mining. In the attribute reduction process, reduction is performed with considerations for minimum information loss. Having a dataset with discrete attribute values, it is possible to find a minimal subset of the original attribute set in rough set theory. Great Deluge algorithm optimizes this problem by controlling the search space using lower boundary "Level". This paper presents a modification of Great Deluge algorithm for rough set attribute reduction wherein the "Level" is nonlinear. In the modified model, the "Level" is increased by a value that is calculated based on the quality of the current solution for each iteration. An alternative neighborhood structure assists the nonlinear Great Deluge to improve the quality of the method. The standard datasets available in a UCI machine-learning repository are employed to examine the proposed method. The accuracies of the classifications are investigated using ROSETTA. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the results of nonlinear with linear Great Deluge algorithm and other available approaches in the literature. Statistical tests are performed to analyze the results. Experimental results show promising results of the proposed method compared to other available approaches in the literature.

J	Jiang, H; Ren, ZL; Xuan, JF; Wu, XD				Jiang, He; Ren, Zhilei; Xuan, Jifeng; Wu, Xindong			Extracting elite pairwise constraints for clustering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Semi-supervised; Elite pairwise constraints; Clustering		Semi-supervised clustering under pairwise constraints (i.e. must-links and cannot-links) has been a hot topic in the data mining community in recent years. Since pairwise constraints provided by distinct domain experts may conflict with each other, a lot of research work has been conducted to evaluate the effects of noise imposing on semi-supervised clustering. In this paper, we introduce elite pairwise constraints, including elite must-link (EML) and elite cannot-link (ECL) constraints. In contrast to traditional constraints, both EML and ECL constraints are required to be satisfied in every optimal partition (i.e. a partition with the minimum criterion function). Therefore, no conflict will be caused by those new constraints. First, we prove that it is NP-hard to obtain EML or ECL constraints. Then, a heuristic method named Limit Crossing is proposed to achieve a fraction of those new constraints. In practice, this new method can always retrieve a lot of EML or ECL constraints. To evaluate the effectiveness of Limit Crossing, multi-partition based and distance based methods are also proposed in this paper to generate faux elite pairwise constraints. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both UCI and synthetic data sets using a semi-supervised clustering algorithm named COP-KMedoids. Experimental results demonstrate that COP-KMedoids under EML and ECL constraints generated by Limit Crossing can outperform those under either faux constraints or no constraints.

Among the several clustering algorithms, k-means is the one of most extensively used clustering techniques in addition to fuzzy k-means clustering. The performance of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering is influenced by the initial cluster centers and might converge to local optimum. In addition, the performance of any data mining algorithm is influenced by the significant feature subset. This paper attempts to augment the performance of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering using two stages. As part of first stage, this paper investigates the use of wrapper approach of feature selection for clustering, where Genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a random search technique for subset generation, wrapped with k-means clustering. In the second stage of projected work, GA and Entropy based fuzzy clustering (EFC) are used to find the initial centroids for both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering. Investigations have been directed using standard medical dataset namely Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). Experimental results confirm markable decline of almost 7% in the classification error of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering with GA nominated significant features and GA identified initial centroids when compared to randomly selected centroids with all features.

Association rules in market basket database represent the shopping behavior of customers. The association information may reveal trade secrets. It must be hidden before publishing. Association rule hiding in privacy preserving data mining hides sensitive rules containing sensitive items. In this paper, a new method is proposed to detect the sensitive items for hiding sensitive association rules. This proposed method finds the frequent item sets and generates the association rules. It employs the concept of representative association rules to detect sensitive items.

In practice, labeling large or even medium-size graphs is a hard task and we need experts to do so. The biggest challenge in graph classification is extracting a set of proper features from graphs. Since graphs are represented by a complex data structure, this issue has been dealt with for a long time. Previous methods focused on extracting features from a certain class in a dataset. In this paper we propose a new feature selection method that extracts features from each graph rather than extracting them from a certain class in the dataset. We extract only frequent subgraphs as features. These subgraphs are chosen according to their number of occurrences in a graph. Moreover, we proposed a new formula which calculates the minimum number of occurrences required for a subgraph to be considered as frequent. We experimented on five real datasets and reached 7-17% higher accuracy than previously proposed methods.

Mining source code by using different data mining techniques to extract the valuable hidden patterns is the new revolution in software engineering. Over last decade many tools and techniques have been proposed by researcher to extract pertinent information and uncover relationships and trends from source code about a particular characteristic of Software Engineering (SE) tasks. These efforts have resulted in wide range of research body but currently there is no comprehensive overview exists. This paper surveys the tools and techniques which rely only on data mining methods to determine patterns from source code in context of programming, bug detection, maintenance, program understanding and software reuse. The work provides comparison and evaluation of the current state-of-the-art source code mining tools and techniques, and organizes the large amount of information into a coherent conceptual way. Thus the survey provides researchers with a concise overview of source code mining techniques and assists practitioners the selection of appropriate techniques for their work. The result of this review shows existing studies focus on one specific pattern being mined from source code such as special kind of bug detection. Thus, there is a need of multiple tools to test and find potential information from software which increase cost and time of development. Hence there is a strong need of tool which helps in developing quality software by automatically detecting different kind of bugs and generates relevant API code automatically to help in decreasing overall software development time.

In this paper, we attempt to discard this assumption in order to develop a more efficient and secure scheme to perform classification with minimal disclosure of private data. Our proposed scheme is based on the work by Vaidya and Clifton [2], which uses commutative encryption to perform secure set intersection so that the parties with access to the individual partitions have no knowledge of the intersection. The evaluations presented in this paper are based on experimental results, which show that our proposed protocol scales well with large sparse datasets*.

In the vertically partitioned datasets, a single class (target) attribute are shared by both parities or carefully treated by either party in the existing studies. The proposed scheme allows both parties to have independent class attributes in secure way and to combine multiple class attributes in arbitrary boolean function, which gives parties a flexibility in data-mining. Our proposed PPDT protocol reduces the CPU intensive computation of logarithm by approximating with the piecewise linear function defined by light-weight fundamental operations of addition and constant-multiplication so that information gain for attribute can be evaluated in the secure function evaluation scheme. Using the UCI Machine Learning dataset and the synthesized dataset, the proposed protocol is evaluated in terms of the accuracy and the size of tree.

J	Kisilevich, S; Keim, D; Rokach, L				Kisilevich, Slava; Keim, Daniel; Rokach, Lior			A GIS-based decision support system for hotel room rate estimation and temporal price prediction: The hotel brokers' context	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hedonic methods; Hotels; Price prediction; Geographic Information Systems; Regression analysis; Data mining	REGRESSION; OPENSTREETMAP; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; TECHNOLOGY; VALUATION; FUTURE; MODEL; TRUST	The vastly increasing number of online hotel room bookings is not only intensifying the competition in the travel industry as a whole, but also prompts travel intermediates (i.e. e-companies that aggregate information about different travel products from different travel suppliers) into a fierce competition for the best prices of travel products, i.e. hotel rooms. An important factor that affects revenues is the ability to conclude profitable deals with different travel suppliers. However, the profitability of a contract not only depends on the communication skills of a contract manager. It significantly depends on the objective information obtained about a specific travel supplier and his/her products. While the contract manager usually has a broad knowledge of the travel business in general, collecting and processing specific information about travel suppliers is usually a time and cost expensive task. Our goal is to develop a tool that assists the travel intermediate to acquire the missing strategic information about individual hotels in order to leverage profitable deals. We present a GIS-based decision support system that can both, estimate objective hotel room rates using essential hotel and locational characteristics and predict temporal room rate prices. Information about objective hotel room rates allows for an objective comparison and provides the basis for a realistic computation of the contract's profitability. The temporal prediction of room rates can be used for monitoring past hotel room rates and for adjusting the price of the future contract. This paper makes three major contributions. First, we present a GIS-based decision support system, the first of its kind, for hotel brokers. Second, the DSS can be applied to virtually any part of the world, which makes it a very attractive business tool in real-life situations. Third, it integrates a widely used data mining framework that provides access to dozens of ready to run algorithms to be used by a domain expert and it offers the possibility of adding new algorithms once they are developed. The system has been designed and evaluated in close cooperation with a company that develops travel technology solutions, in particular inventory management and pricing solutions for many well-known websites and travel agencies around the world. This company has also provided us with real, large datasets to evaluate the system. We demonstrate the functionality of the DSS using the hotel data in the area of Barcelona, Spain. The results indicate the potential usefulness of the proposed system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Harmony Search based Wrapper Feature Selection Method for 1-Nearest Neighbour Classifier	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, INFORMATICS AND MEDICAL ENGINEERING (PRIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering (PRIME)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Salem, INDIA		Periyar Univ, Dept Comp Sci	Feature Selection; Harmony Search; Wrapper method; 1-NN classifier	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	The high-dimensional feature vectors often impose a high computational cost when classification is performed. Feature selection plays major role as a pre-processing technique in reducing the dimensionality of the datasets in data analysis and data mining. This process reduces the number of features by removing irrelevant and redundant data and hence resulting in acceptable classification accuracy. Filter and wrapper are the two kinds of feature selection methods. Experimental results have proved that the wrapper methods can yield better performance, although they have the disadvantage of high computational cost. This paper presents a Harmony Search based novel optimization algorithm for wrapper feature selection. 1-NN classifier method has been used to evaluate the quality of the solutions. The performance of the proposed approach has been analysed by experiments with various real-world data sets. The proposed method, HS-1-NN, produced better performance than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and convergence rate.

The classification difficulties in medical area frequently classify medical dataset based on the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the medical specialist. The Extensive amounts of information and data warehouse in medical databases need the development of specialized tools for storing, retrieving, investigation, and effectiveness usage of stored knowledge and data. Intelligent methods such as neural networks, fuzzy sets, decision trees, and expert systems are, slowly but steadily, applied in the medical fields. Recently, Bijective soft set theory has been proposed as a new intelligent technique for the discovery of data dependencies, data reduction, classification and rule generation from databases. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on Bijective soft sets for the generation of classification rules from the data set. Investigational results from applying the Bijective soft set analysis to the set of data samples are given and evaluated. In addition, the generated rules are also compared to the well-known decision tree classifier algorithm and Naive bayes. The learning illustrates that the theory of Bijective soft set seems to be a valuable tool for inductive learning and provides a valuable support for building expert systems.	[Kumar, S.

[1] Patient have to undergo various test which are very costly and sometimes all of them are not required so in this way it will hugely increase the bill of a patient unnecessarily. In such cases our proposed work will be very helpful. The aim of this paper is to propose an intelligent and effective methodology for the automated detection of Diabetes Mellitus. This methodology is based on Neural Network. There have been many computerized methods to diagnose Diabetes Mellitus but the drawback of all these methods is that patient still has to undergo various medical tests to provide the input values to the computerized diagnostic system and the overall cost for diagnosis will remain almost same for the patient but in our proposed model user itself sitting from home can diagnose whether he/she is suffering from Diabetes Mellitus or not. There is only need to provide some physical parameter values and on the basis of provided information's our model will detect whether that person is suffering from Diabetes Mellitus or not. In our work we have used Neural Network, for designing and testing Neural Network we used MATLAB software.

Motivated by the limited number of related approaches and an obvious need for applicable methods, our article focuses on this research topic. We present an interactive approach for obtaining cost function estimations from a decision maker. As a result of previous experiments, a knowledge-based Genetic Programming approach for rough function approximations is presented first. After that, a novel algorithm for reaching better convergence of the roughly approximated cost functions is described. Constituting the central research topic of this article, different interactive strategies for questioning a decision maker are then implemented and computationally tested. A decision support system integrating both aspects is illustrated and numerical results are presented. It is shown that the quality of computational results first depends on the quality of decision maker's answers. Second, looking at different questioning strategies in detail, cost function convergence seems to be reached faster, if decision maker statements are added to the database step- and not group-wise.

J	Lee, J; Jun, CH				Lee, Jeonghwa; Jun, Chi-Hyuck			PCA-based high-dimensional noisy data clustering via control of decision errors	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Clustering; Dimension reduction; Multiple hypothesis testing; Noise detection		Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning technique of partitioning objects into several homogeneous groups. If noises are included in the data set, they should be eliminated in the course of clustering. Although soft clustering methods can handle noise-included data, most of them do not give an appropriate guideline for discriminating noise objects from significant objects. We propose a multiple testing procedure to filter out noises and cluster significant objects while simultaneously maintaining the decision error within the target level. To handle high-dimensional data, we reduce the dimension of attributes by using the principal component analysis and model the objects using the Gaussian mixture. The proposed two-phase procedure is effective in noise separation and in estimation of Gaussian mixture. We applied the proposed procedure to two real and two synthetic data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method works effectively for high-dimensional data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, JW; Giraud-Carrier, C				Lee, Jun Won; Giraud-Carrier, Christophe			Automatic selection of classification learning algorithms for data mining practitioners	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Algorithm selection; clustering; metalearningg	ACCURACY; RANKING	Classification algorithm selection is an open research problem whose solution has tremendous value for practitioners. In recent years, metalearning has emerged as a viable approach. Unfortunately, the ratio of examples to classes is small at the metalevel for any reasonable number of algorithms to choose from, and there are serious risks of overfitting due to underlying similarities among algorithms. To alleviate these problems, we propose to 1) cluster algorithms based on behavior similarity, and 2) redefine the metalearning task as mapping classification tasks to clusters of behaviorally-similar algorithms. Experiments with a wide range of classification tasks and algorithms demonstrate that the clustering-based selection model yields better results than typical selection models.

Three association algorithms - Apriori, PredictiveApriori and Tertius Algorithms are employed to discuss different case studies. A comparative study of the three algorithms is also made. Further architecture for implementing the association rules on datasets using Weka is also given. The analysis reveals that although the implementation of the three algorithms gives the strong association rules they have problems with the number of cycles taken to generate the frequent itemsets, minimum support needed, memory utilized and non-numeric data.

In this approach, we assume that the analysis of likelihood of the occurrence of particular types of attributes and their values allows us to measure the similarity of the objects within a given category and the dissimilarity of the objects between categories. Therefore, on the basis of the complex data set of attributes of any type, we can successfully raise a lot of interesting information about these attributes without necessity of considering their real meaning. Our research shows that the algorithm inspired by the mechanisms observed in nature may return better results due to the modification of the neighborhood based on the similarity coefficient.

Transactions with quantitative values are, however, also commonly seen in real-world applications. Each transaction in a quantitative database consists of items with their purchased quantities. The multiple fuzzy frequent pattern tree (MFFP-tree) algorithm was thus designed to handle a quantitative database for efficiently mining complete fuzzy frequent itemsets. It however, only processes a database for mining the desired rules. In this paper, we propose an integrated MFFP (called iMFFP)-tree algorithm for merging several individual MFFP trees into an integrated one. The proposed iMFFP-tree algorithm firstly handles the fuzzy regions for providing linguistic knowledge for human beings. The integration mechanism of the proposed algorithm thus efficiently and completely moves a branch from one sub-tree to the integrated tree. The proposed approach can derive both global and local fuzzy rules from distributed databases, thus allowing managers to make more significant and flexible decisions. Experimental results also showed the performance of the proposed approach.

The security guarantee of nuclear power plant is the center topic for discussion of the development of nuclear power plant (NPP). As an important equipment of NPP, steam generator (SG) will produce large amounts of real-time data streams in the process of running every day, such as temperature streams of U-shaped tubes. Mining temperature stream outliers (TSO) of U-shaped tubes is helpful to the implementation of early warning behavior, which contributes to the safety of NPP. In this paper, the authors propose a novel algorithm for mining TSO of U-shaped tubes. By using data stream labels to mark the abnormal frequent items, the data stream is considered to be abnormal if it is marked three times continuously. The proposed algorithm is tested by experiments. And experimental results show that the algorithm has higher accuracy and better scalability.

And these problems can be solved by a convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem which minimizes the nuclear norm instead of the rank of the matrix, and has to be solved iteratively and involves singular value decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. Therefore, those algorithms for nuclear norm minimization problems suffer from high computation cost of multiple SVDs. In this paper, we propose a Fast Tri-Factorization (FTF) method to approximate the nuclear norm minimization problem and mitigate the computation cost of performing SVDs. The proposed FTF method can be used to reliably solve a wide range of low-rank matrix recovery and completion problems such as robust principal component analysis (RPCA), low-rank representation (LRR) and low-rank matrix completion (MC). We also present three specific models for RPCA, LRR and MC problems, respectively. Moreover, we develop two alternating direction method (ADM) based iterative algorithms for solving the above three problems. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets validate the efficiency, robustness and effectiveness of our FTF method comparing with the state-of-the-art nuclear norm minimization algorithms.

In particular, two different algorithms are presented, both guided by a context-free grammar that defines the search space, specifically suited to association rule mining. The first proposal follows a single-objective approach in which a novel fitness function is used to evaluate the individuals mined. In contrast, the second algorithm considers individual evaluation from a Pareto-based point of view, measuring the confidence and support of the rules mined and assigning them a ranking fitness. Both algorithms are verified over 16 varied data sets, comparing their results to other association rule mining algorithms from several paradigms such as exhaustive search, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming. The results obtained are very promising, and they indicate that ant programming is a good technique for the association task of data mining, lacking of the drawbacks that exhaustive methods present.

Modeling of Ligand Selectivity for G-Protein-Coupled Cannabinoid Receptors	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CB2 RECEPTOR; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; BONE MASS; DESCRIPTORS; AGONISTS; SEARCH	The cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for blood cancer, pain relief, osteoporosis, and immune system disease. The recent withdrawal of Rimonabant, which targets another closely related cannabinoid receptor (CB1), accentuates the importance of selectivity for the development of CB2 ligands in order to minimize their effects on the CB1 receptor. In our previous study, LiCABEDS (Ligand Classifier of Adaptively Roosting Ensemble Decision Stumps) was reported as a generic ligand classification algorithm for the prediction of categorical molecular properties. Here, we report extension of the application of LiCABEDS to the modeling of cannabinoid ligand selectivity with molecular fingerprints as descriptors. The performance of LiCABEDS was systematically compared with another popular classification algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), according to prediction precision and recall rate. In addition, the examination of LiCABEDS models revealed the difference in structure diversity of CB1 and CB2 selective ligands. The structure determination from data mining could be useful for the design of novel cannabinoid lead compounds.

To investigate the influence of molar ratio, grinding time, holding temperature, holding time on yield and zinc content of the product, experimental project was designed by uniform design and data mining technology. Obtained product was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy disperses spectroscopy. The results show that the two mathematical models can be established by regression analysis according to yield and zinc content, which can be used to obtain the best technology conditions of solid-state reaction. Under the optimum reaction conditions: molar ratio of K3PO4 center dot 3H(2)O: ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O = 1.01, grinding time 31min, holding temperature 750 degrees C, holding time 3.2 h, the prepared product is KZnPO4 with nano-lamellar structure, and the reaction average yield value is 84.33% and zinc content is 31.29%.

Privacy issues arise in various area such as health care, intellectual property, biological data etc. It is one of the challenging issues when sharing or publishing the data between one to many sources for research purpose and data analysis. Sensitive information of data owners must be protected. There are two kinds of major attacks against privacy namely record linkage and attribute linkage attacks Earlier, researchers have proposed new methods namely k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness for data privacy. K-anonymity method preserves the privacy against record linkage attack alone. It fails to address attribute linkage attack. l-diversity method overcomes the drawback of k-anonymity method. But it fails to address identity disclosure attack and attribute disclosure attack in some exceptional cases. t-closeness method preserves the privacy against attribute linkage attack but not identity disclosure attack. But it computational complexity is large. In this paper, the authors propose a new method to preserve the privacy of individuals' sensitive data from record and attribute linkage attacks. In the proposed method, privacy preservation is achieved through generalization of quasi identifier by setting range values and record elimination. The proposed method is implemented and tested with various data sets.

Based on independent analysis of a set of commercial flights with different methodologies, we identify the strengths of each approach. Then, the paper discusses the design of an analysis process using a flight decomposition relying on crew activities and including discrete parameters that reflect crew actions. The results lay the foundations for a better use of such data-mining algorithms in the next generation of Flight Data Monitoring tools used by airlines.

Studies have shown that multimodal biomarkers provide better diagnosis accuracy of AD and MCI than unimodal biomarkers, but their construction has been based on traditional statistical approaches. The objective of this work was the creation of accurate AD and MCI diagnostic multimodal biomarkers using advanced bioinformatics tools. The biomarkers were created by exploring multimodal combinations of features using machine learning techniques. Data was obtained from the ADNI database. The baseline information (e. g. MRI analyses, PET analyses and laboratory essays) from AD, MCI and healthy control (HC) subjects with available diagnosis up to June 2012 was mined for case/controls candidates. The data mining yielded 47 HC, 83 MCI and 43 AD subjects for biomarker creation. Each subject was characterized by at least 980 ADNI features. A genetic algorithm feature selection strategy was used to obtain compact and accurate cross-validated nearest centroid biomarkers. The biomarkers achieved training classification accuracies of 0.983, 0.871 and 0.917 for HC vs. AD, HC vs. MCI and MCI vs. AD respectively. The constructed biomarkers were relatively compact: from 5 to 11 features. Those multimodal biomarkers included several widely accepted univariate biomarkers and novel image and biochemical features. Multimodal biomarkers constructed from previously and non-previously AD associated features showed improved diagnostic performance when compared to those based solely on previously AD associated features.

However, attempts to find an exact solution are hardly feasible in multidimensional space. In this paper, a novel indexing technique for the approximate solution of k - NN problem is described and analyzed. The construction of the indexing tree is based on clustering. Indexing structure is implemented on top of high-performance industrial DBMS.

Our goal is to find ways that PCA can be used with this massive data set to automate the process of detecting forest disturbance and attributing it to particular agents. We briefly describe the parallel computational approaches we used to make PCA feasible, and present some examples in which we have used it to visualize the seasonal vegetation phenology for the CONUS and to detect areas where anomalous NDVI traces suggest potential threats to forest health.

An open-source toolkit for mining Wikipedia	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Wikipedia; Toolkit; Ontology extraction; Semantic relatedness; Disambiguation; Annotation	SEMANTIC RELATEDNESS	The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is a vast, constantly evolving tapestry of interlinked articles. For developers and researchers it represents a giant multilingual database of concepts. and semantic relations, a potential resource for natural language processing and many other research areas. This paper introduces the Wikipedia Miner toolkit, an open-source software system that allows researchers and developers to integrate Wikipedia's rich semantics into their own applications. The toolkit creates databases that contain summarized versions of Wikipedia's content and structure, and includes a Java API to provide access to them. Wikipedia's articles, categories and redirects are represented as classes, and can be efficiently searched, browsed, and iterated over. Advanced features include parallelized processing of Wikipedia dumps, machine-learned semantic relatedness measures and annotation features, and XML-based web services. Wikipedia Miner is intended to be a platform for sharing data mining techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mimaroglu, S				Mimaroglu, Selim			Mining Approximate Descriptions Using Rough Sets and Genetic Algorithms	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Binary Methods; Description Mining; Genetic Algorithms; Rough Sets; Ralaxing Rough Set Border; Fitness Functions		Using concepts from rough set theory and genetic algorithms we investigate the existence of approximate descriptions of a set of objects, a problem of interest to many fields such as data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning and biology that needs succinct descriptions. A set of objects is defined relative to a given set of attributes; our aim is to find succinct approximate descriptions by removing some of the irrelevant attributes. In this paper, we propose two different methods; first algorithm is based on anti-monotonicity principle and rough sets, and the second algorithm is based on genetic algorithms and rough sets. Proposed methods in this paper have different characteristics and complement each other. Experimental evaluations show that our methods are efficient and practical.

Bots earn much more money in a virtual world than human players, and finally collapse balance and fairness of the MMORPG. At present, many techniques have been applied to detect and exterminate bots. However, they have a common problem that the technique effective in a certain MMORPG is not equally effective in other MMORPGs, thus no general method to detect bots has been established. Toward establishing such general technique, we analyze behavioral patterns of human players and bots in server-side game log data with two commonly available features characterizing users (human players and bots): location-based information (i.e., speed of players) and action frequency information (i.e., action count per fixed time slot). The main findings of our analysis are as follows: (1) The variation of the speed of bots is smaller than that of humans (i.e, the movement of bots is more efficient). However, the discriminative power of this location-based feature is not so significant in MMORPG, while it showed good performance in First Person Shooting (FPS) game. (2) Action count and battle count indicate more discriminative power than the speed feature. In particular, the action count is more robust than battle count against the size of the time slot.

Its purpose was to identify and track system nonconformance. The PRACA database over the years changed from a nominal way to identify system problems, to a complex tracking and report production database. The PRACA database became the primary method to categorize any anomalies, from corrosion issues to catastrophic failures. The systems documented in the PRACA database range from flight hardware to ground or facility support equipment. While the PRACA database is complex, it does possess all the failure modes, times of occurrence, length of system delay, parts repaired or replaced, and corrective action performed. The difficulty is mining the data to then utilize that data in order to estimate component, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and system reliability analysis metrics. In this paper, we identify a methodology to categorize qualitative data from the ground system PRACA database for common ground or facility support equipment utilizing a heuristic method to identify credible failures. These data are then used to determine interarrival times to perform an estimation of a metric for repairable component or LRU reliability. This analysis is used to determine failure modes of the equipment, probability of the component failure mode, and to support various quantitative differing techniques for performing repairable system analysis. Components or LRU's are evaluated in the same environment and condition that occurs during the launch process.

Thus, energy efficiency improvement is an important way to reduce these costs and to increase predictable earnings, especially in times of high energy price volatility. This work describes the development of an expert system for the improvement of this efficiency of the reaction zone of a petrochemical plant. This system has been developed after a data mining process of the variables registered in the plant. Besides, a kernel of neural networks has been embedded in the expert system.

Although this technique has been proven to have the ability to classify encrypted and unknown traffic, the software implementation of DT cannot cope with the current speed of packet traffic. In this paper, hardware architecture of decision tree is proposed on NetFPGA platform. The proposed architecture is fully parameterizable to cover wide range of applications. Several optimizations have been done on the DT structure to improve the tree search performance and to lower the hardware cost. The optimizations proposed are: a) node merging to reduce the computation latency, b) limit the number of nodes in the same level to control the memory usage, and c) support variable throughput to reduce the hardware cost of the tree.

In data mining, association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. One of the emerging research areas under Data mining is Social Networks. The objective of this paper focuses on the formulation of association rules using which decisions can be made for future Endeavour. This research applies Apriori Algorithm which is one of the classical algorithms for deriving association rules. The Algorithm is applied to Face book 100 university dataset which has originated from Adam D'Angelo of Face book. It contains self-defined characteristics of a person including variables like residence, year, and major, second major, gender, school. This paper to begin with the research uses only ten Universities and highlights the formation of association rules between the attributes or variables and explores the association rule between a course and gender, and discovers the influence of gender in studying a course. The previous research with this dataset has applied only regression models and this is the first time to apply association rules.	[Nancy, P.; Ramani, R.

We consider the so-called relational dynamic oriented graphs that can be encoded as n-ary relations with n >= 3 and thus represented by Boolean tensors. Two dimensions are used to encode the graph adjacency matrices and at least one other denotes time. We design the pattern domain of multi-dimensional association rules, i.e., non trivial extensions of the popular association rules that may involve subsets of any dimensions in their antecedents and their consequents. First, we design new objective interestingness measures for such rules and it leads to different approaches for measuring the rule confidence. Second, we must compute collections of a priori interesting rules. It is considered here as a post-processing of the closed patterns that can be extracted efficiently from Boolean tensors. We propose optimizations to support both rule extraction scalability and non redundancy. We illustrate the added-value of this new data mining task to discover patterns from a real-life relational dynamic graph.

Improving the Interpretability of Classification Rules Discovered by an Ant Colony Algorithm	GECCO'13: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2013 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	15th Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 06-10, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat (ACM SIGEVO)		ant colony optimization; data mining; classification; sequential covering; unordered rules	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CLASSIFIERS	The vast majority of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms for inducing classification rules use an ACO-based procedure to create a rule in an one-at-a-time fashion. An improved search strategy has been proposed in the c Ant-Miner(PB) algorithm, where an ACO-based procedure is used to create a complete list of rules (ordered rules)-i.e., the ACO search is guided by the quality of a list of rules, instead of an individual rule. In this paper we propose an extension of the c Ant-Miner(PB) algorithm to discover a set of rules (unordered rules). The main motivation for discovering a set of rules is to improve the interpretation of individual rules and evaluate the impact on the predictive accuracy of the algorithm. We also propose a new measure to evaluate the interpretability of the discovered rules to mitigate the fact that the commonly-used model size measure ignores how the rules are used to make a class prediction. Comparisons with state-of-the-art rule induction algorithms and the c Ant-MinerPB producing ordered rules are also presented.	[Otero, Fernando E.

A software architecture for Twitter collection, search and geolocation services	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Tweet; Social network; Software architecture; Semantic analysis		The substantial increase of social networks and their combination with mobile devices make rigorous analysis of the outcomes of such system of paramount importance for intelligence gathering and decision making purposes. Since the introduction of Twitter system in 2006, tweeting emerged as an efficient open social network that attracted interest from various research/commercial and military communities. This paper investigates the current software architecture of Twitter system and put forward a new architecture dedicated for semantic and spatial analysis of Twitter data. Especially, Twitter Streaming API was used as a basis for tweet collection data stored in MySQL like database. While Lucene system together with WordNet lexical database linked to advanced natural language processing and PostGIS platform were used to ensure semantic and spatial analysis of the collected data. A functional diversity approach was implemented to enforce fault tolerance for the data collection part where its performances were evaluated through comparison with alternative approaches. The proposal enables the discovery of spatial patterns within geo-located Twitter and can provide the user or operator with useful unforeseen elements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Papalexakis, EE; Sidiropoulos, ND; Bro, R				Papalexakis, Evangelos E.; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.; Bro, Rasmus			From K-Means to Higher-Way Co-Clustering: Multilinear Decomposition With Sparse Latent Factors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Co-clustering; compressed sensing; factor analysis; k-means; multi-way analysis; sparsity; tensor decomposition; triclustering; unsupervised clustering	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; LASSO; CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; PARAFAC	Co-clustering is a generalization of unsupervised clustering that has recently drawn renewed attention, driven by emerging data mining applications in diverse areas. Whereas clustering groups entire columns of a data matrix, co-clustering groups columns over select rows only, i.e., it simultaneously groups rows and columns. The concept generalizes to data "boxes" and higher-way tensors, for simultaneous grouping along multiple modes. Various co-clustering formulations have been proposed, but no workhorse analogous to K-means has emerged. This paper starts from K-means and shows how co-clustering can be formulated as a constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. For three-and higher-way data, uniqueness of the multilinear decomposition implies that, unlike matrix co-clustering, it is possible to unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters. A basic multi-way co-clustering algorithm is proposed that exploits multilinearity using Lasso-type coordinate updates. Various line search schemes are then introduced to speed up convergence, and suitable modifications are proposed to deal with missing values. The imposition of latent sparsity pays a collateral dividend: it turns out that sequentially extracting one co-cluster at a time is almost optimal, hence the approach scales well for large datasets. The resulting algorithms are benchmarked against the state-of-art in pertinent simulations, and applied to measured data, including the ENRON e-mail corpus.

Interactive visualization enables not only extensive exploration of data but also better matching of clustering/classification schemes to the type of data being analyzed. The multidimensional scaling (MDS), which employs particle dynamics to the error function minimization, is a good candidate to be a computational engine for interactive data mining. However, the main disadvantage of MDS is both its memory and time complexity. We developed novel SUBSET algorithm of a lower complexity, which is competitive to the best, currently used, MDS algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. SUBSET employs reduced dissimilarity matrix, which structure allows for efficient usage of both multi-core CPU and SIMD GPU processor architectures. Consequently, SUBSET enables visualization of datasets consisting of an order of 105 data items on a standard personal computer or laptop. We compare a few strategies of dissimilarity matrix reduction and we present typical timings obtained by respective MDS algorithms on selected multithread CPU and GPU architectures.

Utility Mining aims to identify itemsets with high utilities by considering profit, quantity, cost or other user preferences. In market basket analysis, high consideration should be given to utility of item in a transaction, since items having low selling frequencies may have high profits. As a result, High Utility Itemset Mining emerged as a revolutionary field in Data Mining. Rare itemsets provide useful information in different decision-making domains. High Utility Rare Itemset Mining, HURI algorithm proposed in [12], generate high utility rare itemsets of users' interest. HURI is a two-phase algorithm, phase I generates rare itemsets and phase 2 generates high utility rare itemsets, according to users' interest. In this paper, performance evaluation and complexity analysis of HURI algorithm, based on different parameters have been discussed which indicates the efficiency of HURI.

To improve our understanding of natural, climate change, and human-induced variability in shelf environments, the IMOS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) facility has been charged with generating physical and biological observations of benthic variables that cannot be cost-effectively obtained by other means. Starting in 2010, the IMOS AUV facility began collecting precisely navigated benthic imagery using AUVs at selected reference sites on Australias shelf. This observing program capitalizes on the unique capabilities of AUVs that have allowed repeated visits to the reference sites, providing a critical observational link between oceanographic and benthic processes. This paper provides a brief overview of the relevant capabilities of the AUV facility, the design of the IMOS benthic sampling program, and some preliminary results. We also report on some of the challenges and potential benefits to be realized from a benthic observation system that collects several TB of geo-referenced stereo imagery a year. This includes collaborative semi-automated image analysis, clustering and classification, large scale visualization and data mining, and lighting correction for change detection and characterization. We also mention some of the lessons from operating an AUV-based monitoring program and future work in this area.

There is a number of different applications where frequent sequence mining is very important: medicine, finance, internet behavioural data, marketing data, etc. Exact frequent sequence mining methods make multiple passes over the database and if the database is large, then it is a time consuming and expensive task. Approximate methods for frequent sequence mining are faster than exact methods because instead of doing multiple passes over the original database, they analyze a much shorter sample of the original database formed in a specific way. This paper presents Markov Property Based Method (MPBM) - an approximate method for mining frequent sequences based on kth order Markov models, which makes only several passes over the original database. The method has been implemented and evaluated using real-world foreign exchange database and compared to exact and approximate frequent sequent mining algorithms.

These methods along with their variants and hybrid approaches have emerged as worthwhile class of methods for clustering. Clustering is an unsupervised classification method. The partitional clustering algorithms look for hard clustering; they decompose the dataset into a set of disjoint clusters. This paper describes a brief review of evolutionary and swarm intelligence methods with their variants and hybrid approaches designed for partitional clustering algorithms for hard clustering of datasets.

The variation in the rainfall is primarily attributed to its association with Humidity, Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed and Dew Point etc. Several works have been done in this field over the past few decades. An accurate prediction of rainfall events can aid in accurate financial planning of the economy of nation. The unpredictable natural disasters like floods and droughts not only affected the economy of a country but also the lifestyle of people of the countryside. Data mining is a influential approach which helps in extracting hidden information from huge databases and allows decisions to be taken on knowledge mining basis. This paper highlights Supervised Learning in Quest (SLIQ), decision tree algorithm using Gini Index in order to predict the precipitation with an accuracy of 72.3% and is completely based on the historical data. The decision tree is constructed and the classification rules are generated.

The main aim of this paper is to show possibilities of using FCA to detect anomalies in the data. Our attitude is based on the fact that although during the production process a large amount of input data is obtained, the size of conceptual lattice is relatively small, and therefore, it is possible to work with it in real-time. The conceptual lattice represents a model of production process, and this model is based on historical production data. The input data stream contains measurements on the production line and it is applied on the model of the production process. The result of this activity is to identify anomalies in the incoming data and their relationship with faulty products, including disclosure of possible causes of errors and also to obtain a histogram of quality for manufactured products.

Decision making involves a model with several possible actions, state of the world with a probability, and a metric of how well the best decision was made. The ability to perform data mining and discover patterns to automatically predict likelihood of reaction to specific events and situational awareness is enhanced from multiple social media inputs. We discuss development of a method for determining actionable information to efficiently propitiate manpower, equipment assets, or propaganda responses. Our solution combines a variety of textual content information in different formats to help with a decision process to include sources, systems, and services that control and influence a situation. Different viewpoints need to be understood that are points involved in the event. Our FeatureSEARCH (TM) tool is helpful for rapidly parsing text that has been extracted with an intelligent algorithm in order to evaluate the population sentiment for the targeted area. Our tool allows for calculating optimal strategies provides greater knowledge about the state of the world and increases the likelihood of a decision maker making the best decision. We discuss game theory using linear programming methods to solve for multiple possible strategies that are known. The decision maker's success depends upon his ability to correctly and automatically judge the multiple psychological and rational factors. The goal of our system, called GlobalSite, is to deliver trustworthy threat analysis systems and services that understand situations, while being a vital tool for continuing mission operations information.

The capacity of digital data storage has doubled every nine months for at least a decade. Furthermore, our skills and interest to collect data and analyze them are also remarkable. There has been a wide variety of research going on in the field of privacy preservation in data mining. Most of the methods are implemented for static data. But the world is filled with dynamic data which grows rapidly than what we expect. No technique is better than the other ones with respect to all criteria. This paper focus on privacy criteria that provide formal safety guarantees, present algorithms that sanitize data to make it safe for release while preserving useful information, and discuss ways of analyzing the sanitized data. This paper focus on a methodology that is well suited for incremental data that preserves its privacy while also performing an efficient mining. The method does not require the entire data to be processed again for the insertion of new data. The method uses frequency discretization technique that represents the interestingness of items in a database as a pattern. This method is suggested for both incremental data and providing privacy for such data. We develop the algorithm for making the database flexible in terms of mining and cost effective in terms of storage.

Data mining expertise is usually needed to deploy the algorithms available. Specifically, a process of interconnected actions referred to as knowledge flow (KF) needs to be assembled when the algorithms are to be applied to given data. In this paper, we propose an innovative evolutionary approach to automated KF synthesis and optimization. We demonstrate the evolutionary KF synthesis on the problem of classifier construction.

Indeed, a major part of the data worth analyzing is stored in relational databases and, since recently, on the Web of Data. This clearly underscores the need for Entity-Relationship and rdf compliant data mining (dm) tools. We are studying an approach to the underlying multi-relational data mining (mrdm) problem, which relies on formal concept analysis (fca) as a framework for clustering and classification. Our relational concept analysis (rca) extends fca to the processing of multi-relational datasets, i.e., with multiple sorts of individuals, each provided with its own set of attributes, and relationships among those. Given such a dataset, rca constructs a set of concept lattices, one per object sort, through an iterative analysis process that is bound towards a fixed-point. In doing that, it abstracts the links between objects into attributes akin to role restrictions from description logics (dls). We address here key aspects of the iterative calculation such as evolution in data description along the iterations and process termination. We describe implementations of rca and list applications to problems from software and knowledge engineering.

The deduction of patterns or conclusions may uncover the information that may sometimes compromise the confidentiality and privacy obligations. Preservation of privacy is an important aspect of data mining and thus study of achieving some data mining goals without sacrificing the privacy of the individuals is not only demanding but also a task of practical importance. The analysis of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) algorithms should consider the effects of these algorithms in mining the results as well as in preserving privacy. The privacy should be preserved in all the three aspects of mining as association rules, classifiers and clusters. In this paper we present a review of the commonly existing efficient methodologies in the context of privacy preservation in data mining.

In protein analysis, especially in protein sequence classification, selection of feature is most important. Popular protein sequence classification techniques involve extraction of specific features from the sequences. Researchers apply some well-known classification techniques like neural networks, Genetic algorithm, Fuzzy ARTMAP, Rough Set Classifier etc for accurate classification. This paper presents a review is with three different classification models such as neural network model, fuzzy ARTMAP model and Rough set classifier model. A new technique for classifying protein sequences have been proposed in the end. The proposed technique tries to reduce the computational overheads encountered by earlier approaches and increase the accuracy of classification.

Each facility must serve minimum pre-specified level of demand. The objective is to minimize the distance traveled by users to reach the facilities this means also to maximize the accessibility to facilities. A location model that captures the above features is formulated and different solution methods are tested. Clustering in spatial data mining is to group similar objects based on their connectivity, distance, or their relative density in space. In real word, there exist many physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes, highways and mountains, and their presence may affect the result of clustering significantly. In this paper, we study the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles to solve location of public service facility problem. In this paper, CSPOD-DBSCAN algorithm (Clustering with short path Obstructed Distance - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is developed in the spirit of DBSCAN clustering algorithms. This algorithm is Density-based clustering algorithm using Dijkstra algorithm to calculate obstructed short path distance. The application of this algorithm is illustrated through a case study involving the location of schools in the districts of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

Prediction provides knowledgeable information regarding the current status of the stock price movement. Thus this can be utilised in decision making for customers in finalizing whether to buy or sell the particular shares of a given stock. Temporal data mining has been emerged as an interesting field in providing technologies for stock forecasting. As the data of the stock market is temporal in nature effective techniques can be applied to enhance prediction analysis. Many researchers have focused on this prediction research area, but still the results are not very accurate. The paper proposes a new approach of analysing the stock market and predicting in a hybrid form of linguistic-a priori concept. It provides accurate results in stock prediction which has a great impact in decision making with respect to the clients and knowledge discovery of various useful patterns for brokers. This approach provides the clients with the ease of getting information status of any stock price movement immediately.	[Saxena, Priti; Pant, Bhaskar; Goudar, R.

The generation of training data is done by human labellers - a tedious and time-consuming work. To reduce the labelling time for single documents we propose to use condensed representations of text documents instead of the full-text document. These condensed representations are key sentences and key phrases and can be generated in a fully unsupervised way. We extended and evaluated the TextRank algorithm to automatically extract key sentences and key phrases. For representing key phrases we propose a layout similar to a tag cloud. In a user study with 37 participants we evaluated whether document labelling with these condensed representations can be done faster and equally accurate by the human labellers. Our evaluation shows that the users labelled tag clouds twice as fast and as accurately as full-text documents. While further investigations for different classification tasks are necessary, this insight could potentially reduce costs for the labelling process of text documents.

A Dynamic Approach for Mining Generalised Sequential Patterns in Time Series Clinical Data Sets	ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 2	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing and Informaiton Technology (ACITY 2012)	JUL 13-15, 2012	Chennai, INDIA			Pattern match; stream time series; MultiScale Median		Similarity based stream time series is gaining ever-increasing attention due to its importance in many applications such as financial data processing, network monitoring, Web click-stream analysis, sensor data mining, and anomaly detection. These applications require managing data streams, i.e., data composed of continuous, real-time sequence of items. We propose a technique for pattern matching within static patterns and stream time series clinical data sets. The main objective of our project is to ascertain hidden patterns between incoming time series clinical data sets and the set of predetermined clinical patterns. By considering the incoming image data at a particular timestamp, we construct a MultiScale Median model at multiple levels to adapt to the stream time series, characterized by frequent updates. Further, we employ a pruning algorithm, Segment Median Pruning on clinical Image data for pruning all candidate patterns. Experiments have been carried out on retinal disease data set known as Age Related Macula Degeneration (ARMD) and simulation results show that the system is efficient in processing image data sets for making efficient and accurate decision.

A new utility-emphasized analysis for stock trading rules	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Utility based data mining; utility analysis; utility emphasized trading rules; Association Rule Mining (ARM); Genetic Algorithm (GA)	DATABASES; DISCOVERY; SYSTEMS	Utility based data mining has been emerging as a significant learning tool for formulating business practices from the economic perspective. The recent economic growth in financial world could be greatly accredited to the Stock markets. Many researchers have made valiant attempts in data mining to devise an efficient system for stock market movement analysis. Still, there have not been many systems that could formulate association rules for stock markets based on economic importance i.e. utility. So, when utility based data mining is employed in stock market prediction, it would devise association rules that would lead to high return on investments. Hereby, we propose a new analysis which deploys the Utility Based Data mining to generate utility emphasized trading rules. The proposed utility based analysis is composed of a pre-analysis and a core analysis. The pre-analysis utilizes four powerful technical indicators to interpret the raw historical data and Association Rule Mining to generate frequency-based trading rules. In the core analysis, the utility based preliminary rules are generated by using Genetic Algorithm and then a weightage based analysis is performed for extracting better utility-emphasized rules. Unlike the conventional utility based data mining, the obtained trading rules are optimal and utility efficient because of the introduction of weightage based analysis. The proficiency of the obtained rules are compared against the conventional utility-emphasized and frequency-based (non-utility emphasized) trading rules using frequency, utility and weightage values in diverse stock market datasets.

Road accident fatality rates depend upon many factors which could vary for different countries. It is a very challenging task and investigating the dependencies between the attributes become complex because of many environmental and road related factors. In this research work we applied data mining classification technique RndTree and RndTree using ensemble methods viz. Bagging, AdaBoost and Multi Cost Sensitive Bagging (MCSB) to carry out vehicle safety device based classification of which RndTree using Adaboost gives high accurate results. The training dataset used for the research work is obtained from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) which is provided by the University of Alabama's Critical Analysis Reporting Environment (CARE) system. The results reveal that RndTree using Adaboost improvised the classifier's accuracy.

J	Sohrabi, MK; Barforoush, AA				Sohrabi, Mohammad Karim; Barforoush, Ahmad Abdollahzadeh			Parallel frequent itemset mining using systolic arrays	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; Itemset mining; Systolic arrays; Bit matrix; Parallel pattern mining	ALGORITHM; GENERATION; PATTERNS	Since extraction of frequent itemsets from a transaction database is crucial to several data mining tasks such as association rule generation, so frequent itemset mining is one of the most important concepts in data mining. One of the major problems in frequent itemset mining is the explosion of the number of results which is directly effecting on the execution time of itemset mining algorithms. To address this problem, closed itemsets have been proposed, which provides concise lossless representations of the original collection of frequent itemsets. Henceforth, the frequencies of all itemsets in the original collection can be reconstructed from the reduced collection. However, the reduction provided by this exact method is not sufficient to solve the pattern explosion problem, mainly because of high dimensional datasets which have large number of items in each transaction. Colossal itemset mining is another solution to reduce the output size which will not be useful if the set of all frequent itemsets have been required. Higher level of performance improvement can be obtained from efficient scalable parallel mining methods. In this paper we represent an efficient scalable parallel algorithm using systolic arrays to conduct mining of frequent itemsets in very large, such as high dimensional, datasets. In our algorithm, we use a bit matrix to compress the dataset and mapping the mining algorithm on the systolic arrays architecture. For this purpose, each transaction of dataset represents as a row in the bit matrix. We use this bit matrix structure to model the pattern mining as a systolic array problem. Our experimental results and performance study show that this algorithm outperforms substantially the best previously developed parallel algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Closed itemset mining is introduced from traditional frequent pattern mining and having its own importance in data mining applications. Recently, regular itemset mining gained lot of attention in data mining research because of its occurrence behavior. In this paper we propose a new method called RCP-method (regular-closed pattern method) to mine regular-closed itemsets in transactional database by using vertical data format. Our RCP-method generates complete set of regular-closed patterns in transactional databases for a user given regularity threshold and support. Our experimental results show that this method is efficient in memory and execution time.

Improvement of Traditional K-means Algorithm through the Regulation of Distance Metric Parameters	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROL (ISCO 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)	JAN 04-05, 2013	Coimbatore, INDIA	Karpagam Coll Engn, Univ Sains Malaysia (USM), IEEE Madras Sect, Govt India, Minist New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Minist Def, Dept Def Res & Dev Org (DRDO), Comp Soc India (CSI), IEEE		Data Mining; k-Means; Canberra; Chebyshev; Gene Expression Data; Kernel; Manhattan; Supremum		This paper discusses in detail the behavior of the basic k-means algorithm with four more new algorithms with varied distance measures on gene expression data. In data mining, k-means clustering is a method which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The traditional k-means is one of the most popular clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data. However, it suffers from major shortcomings. It is sensitive to initial partitions and it is only applicable to data with spherical-shape clusters. The results of the present study show that the performances of the new algorithms are extremely well when compared to the traditional k-means and also emphasizes that through the regulation of distance metric parameters, one can achieve better clustering effects then the traditional k-means, and has an advantage in sensitivity, specificity and run time. Finally it is found that Canberra k-means performs extremely well.	[Srimani, P.

CA uses a basic set of five knowledge sources (KS's) which are used in various animal species to guide the search toward best solutions and thus are better than evolutionary algorithms which are memory less blind search methods. The preserved knowledge in CA is disseminated throughout the system in future generations. Cultural algorithms have been used effectively in solving optimization problems, in engineering rule based systems, and combined with data mining to study complex social systems. However application of cultural algorithm for multi objective optimization of classification rules is hardly found in the literature. Research gap exists in using Cultural Algorithm for rule mining taking the various properties of rules as objectives for optimization. In the current study a cultural algorithm framework is proposed for rule mining considering it as a multi objective optimization problem.

Virtual organizations, as one of the challenges of third millennium, which came to existence for enhancing organization's performance through outsourcing, are not excluding. A virtual organization and its smaller variant, the virtual team, is an organizational network that is structured and managed to function as an identifiable and complete organization. Determining what meanings virtual team members attach to performance evaluation system in IT Companies is a vital precursor to understand the effectiveness of the management practice, rendering this study a preliminary investigation. The literature confirms that perceptions of management practices in IT Industries can influence employee loyalty and role-related behaviors. Perceptions of unfairness can be more detrimental for geographically distributed workers in MNCs than for collocated teams. Although businesses continue to drive demands for virtual organizations, most contemporary studies of performance evaluation system are limited to traditional organizational settings. An interpretive, phenomenological domain Driven Data Mining (D3M) approach utilizing 360 Degree data mining for objective measurement and opinion mining for subjective measurement enabled a hermeneutic analysis process. The main objective of this research is to investigate the main factors that affect the performance of employees in virtual organization especially IT Companies and to show how these factors can be used for performance evaluation in virtual organization. Based on the review of literature, this study provides a unified domain Driven Data Mining (d3m) approach for evaluating data intelligence, domain intelligence, human intelligence, network intelligence, social intelligence, and meta synthesis of ubiquitous intelligence for performance appraisal in virtual organizations like IT Industries. This study examined opinion mining of virtual team members as subjective measure for their performance evaluation system. A phenomenological approach using support vector machine was used to Meta synthesize as ubiquitous intelligence. This D3M approach gives a valuable insight into the performance of employees in virtual organization and can give a useful help to practitioners to evaluate the performance of employees in virtual organizations.

Here an alignment-free method of sequence comparison and visualisation based on the Chaos Games Representation (CGR) and multifractal analysis is explored as an approach to search and filter through a data set of over 1500 microbial genomes. Whereas BLAST takes 25 hours to search this data set with large sequence fragments (e.g. 100 Kb), the method introduced here can reduce this data set by 95% (from 1550 target species to just 50) in about 15 minutes, and it is able to predict the exact species correctly in 67% of cases. The results presented here demonstrate that CGR is worth further investigation as a fast method to perform genome sequence comparison on large data sets, and various ways to further develop the method are discussed.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the management of the deleted transactions based on the IT-tree structure and pre-large concepts. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good performance.

Simply put, it is a method to extract and analyze meaningful patterns and correlations in a large relational database. In Data mining, Decision trees are one of the most worldwide used tools for decision support. In the emerging area of Data mining applications, users of data mining tools are faced with the problem of data sets that are comprised of large numbers of features and instances. Such kinds of data sets are not easy to handle for mining because decision trees generally depends on several parameters like dataset used and configuration of the tree itself among others in order to build an accurate model classification. In this work a novel hybrid classifier system is presented for improving accuracy of decision trees using clustering techniques. This system is formed by a clustering algorithm, a decision tree and an optional module for identifying appropriate parameters for the clustering algorithm. These three modules working together are capable to increase the accuracy of the solutions. The validation of the results of this work has been performed using several well-known datasets and applying two decision trees algorithms. The accuracy percentages are compared in order to show our proposal improvement, obtaining good results. Finally two clustering algorithms have been used to compare the accuracy between different proposals.

An Integrated Approach to derive effective rules from Association Rule Mining using Genetic Algorithm	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, INFORMATICS AND MEDICAL ENGINEERING (PRIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering (PRIME)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Salem, INDIA		Periyar Univ, Dept Comp Sci	Apriori; Genetic Algorithm; Lift ratio; Multiple Minimum Support; Disjunctive Rules		Association rule mining is one of the most important and well-researched techniques of data mining, that aims to induce associations among sets of items in transaction databases or other data repositories. Currently Apriori algorithms play a major role in identifying frequent item set and deriving rule sets out of it. But it uses the conjunctive nature of association rules, and the single minimum support factor to generate the effective rules. However the above two factors are alone not adequate to derive useful rules effectively. Hence in the proposed algorithm we have taken Apriori Algorithm as a reference and included disjunctive rules and multiple minimum supports also to capture all possible useful rules. Although few algorithms [4][5] are dealing the disjunctive rules and multiple minimum supports separately to some extent, the proposed concept is to integrate all into one that lead to a robust algorithm. And the salient feature of our work is introducing Genetic Algorithm (GA) in deriving possible Association Rules from the frequent item set in an optimized manner. Besides we have taken one more add-on factor 'Lift Ratio' which is to validate the generated Association rules are strong enough to infer useful information. Hence this new approach aims to put together the above points to generate an efficient algorithm with appropriate modification in Apriori Algorithm so that to offer interesting/useful rules in an effective and optimized manner with the help of Genetic Algorithm.

These approaches are very useful to pre-process the large dataset and then use it to analyze and mine. In this paper, we propose a method based on turning points to reduce the dimensions of stream time series data, this task helps the prediction process faster. The turning points which are extracted from the maximum or minimum points of the time series stream are proved more efficient and effective in preprocessing data for stream time series prediction. To implement the proposed framework, we use stock time series obtained from Yahoo Finance, the prediction approach based on Sequential Minimal Optimization and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

We generate numerous regression models by concurrently executing multiple independent instances of a genetic programming learner. Each instance may be configured with different parameters and a different subset of the training data. Several strategies for fusing predictions from multiple regression models are compared. To overcome the small memory size of each instance, we challenge our framework to learn from small subsets of training data and yet produce a prediction of competitive quality after fusion. This decreases the running time of learning which produces models of good quality in a timely fashion. Finally, we examine the quality of fused predictions over the progress of the computation.

These devices may need to collaborate among them to allow nomad workers to perform a common activity. Unfortunately software developers in charge of creating infrastructures or applications allowing these devices to cooperate among them, do not count with clear guidelines to design such software components; particularly when these components must work in a scenario involving heterogeneous devices. This paper presents a study that tries to understand how to address collaboration among heterogeneous mobile devices, by exploring several variables affecting the process. In particular, this study explores various strategies to borrow CPU slots from peer mobile computing devices and return the favor back later on. The study outcomes indicate there is a short list of computing and network variables affecting the collaboration capability of the mobile devices. These findings have been verified using data mining techniques. Based on these findings and the lessons learned, the article presents a simulation method of computing scenarios that can help developers to determine which computing configuration would be suitable to be used in each particular work scenario. Software designers can take advantage of this simulation method and the design guidelines reported in this paper in order to develop applications able to work appropriately in heterogeneous computing scenarios.

Association rule hiding methods	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							DATA MINING ALGORITHMS; PRIVACY; KNOWLEDGE	Privacy preserving data mining has been recently introduced to cope with privacy issues related to the data subjects in the course of the mining of the data. It has also been recognized that it is not only the data that need to be protected but sensitive knowledge hidden in the data as well. Knowledge hiding is an emerging area of research focusing on appropriately modifying the data in such a way that sensitive knowledge escapes the mining and is not communicated to the public for privacy purposes. This article investigates the development of techniques falling under the knowledge-hiding umbrella that pertain to the association rule-mining task. These techniques are known as association rule hiding or frequent pattern hiding approaches, and have been receiving a lot of attention lately because they touch upon important issues of handling a sort of commonly used patterns such as the frequent patterns and the association rules. We present an overview of this area as well as a taxonomy and a presentation of an important sample of algorithms. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, such a model may fail in real applications, because there exist objects or events that are very important, but rare and difficult to predict. In this work, we consider classification rules that are relatively abnormal, with respect to those rules that have high confidence and large support. We present a method for computing both normal and abnormal classification models in one phase and show the important complementary role of abnormal models with respect to normal models in classification through experimentation on UCI datasets.

Radicalization (also called cyber extremism and cyber hate propaganda) is a growing concern to the society and also of great pertinence to governments & law enforcement agencies all across the world. Further, the dynamism of these groups adds another level of complexity in the domain, as with time, one may witness a change in members of the group and hence has motivated many researchers towards this field. This proposal presents an investigative data mining approach for detecting the dynamic behavior of these radical groups in online social networks by textual analysis of the messages posted by the members of these groups along with the application of techniques used in social network analysis. Some of the preliminary results obtained through partial implementation of the approach are also discussed.	[Wadhwa, Pooja; Bhatia, M. P.

J	Wang, CS				Wang, Chen-Shu			An Agent-Based Expert System Architecture for Product Return Administration	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						product return; intelligent agent; case-based reasoning; intelligent system design	REVERSE LOGISTICS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; POLICIES; INFORMATION; CHANNEL; DESIGN; IMPACT	Product return is a critical but controversial issue. To deal with such a vague return problem, businesses must improve their information transparency in order to administrate the product return behaviour of their end users. This study proposes an intelligent return administration expert system (iRAES) to provide product return forecasting and decision support for returned product administration. The iRAES consists of two intelligent agents that adopt a hybrid data mining algorithm. The return diagnosis agent generates different alarms for certain types of product return, based on forecasts of the return possibility. The return recommender agent is implemented on the basis of case-based reasoning, and provides the return centre clerk with a recommendation for returned product administration. We present a 3C-iShop scenario to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the iRAES architecture. Our experiments identify a particularly interesting return, for which iRAES generates a recommendation for returned product administration. On average, iRAES decreases the effort required to generate a recommendation by 70% compared to previous return administration systems, and improves performance via return decision support by 37%. iRAES is designed to accelerate product return administration, and improve the performance of product return knowledge management.

Space missions that are targeting for aerospace exploration or aviation also pose great challenges on the health conditions of people involved, such like astronauts, crew members, aviators, etc. Considering the inherent risks of space missions and the difficulty of direct communications between crew and ground support medical specialists, we see that greater autonomy in medical operations for crew is required. Namely, there is an urgent call for an effective on board medical system to predict and prevent health problems in a timely manner, rather than following reactive approaches which are inherent to conventional medicine. Interdisciplinary research is underway to develop computer based, self-diagnosis and self-directed treatment programs for the crew to autonomously predict, prevent, and manage potential health problems of two types: physiological and psychological. Predictive diagnostics aims at identifying negative health trends with concerned premonitory symptoms followed by predicting the future health condition and raising alarms in case of emergency. These alarms will startup devices that are capable of quickly reacting to an acute disease by delivering therapy or notifying a caregiver, thus avoiding fatal consequences likely to occur. Acute diseases such as cardiovascular and epileptic seizures are found to be frequently incident in-flight medical events, where the aftermath of seizures such as dyspnoea or serious physical injuries usually does the most harm to the subject. Consequently, a predictive diagnostics system that is able to provide early and action able real-time warnings of impending health problems would play an extremely crucial role in aerospace medicine. In this process, the diagnostic determination is based on the differences between current health status and the predefined normal status. Besides, considering the underlying concepts in predictive diagnostics of aerospace medicine in which every crew member is unique, the development of a processing strategy specially designed for each individual on a subject-by-subject basis is not only necessary but also feasible. The highly autonomous predictive diagnostics system in aerospace medicine would then be able to perform real-time health assessment followed by a comparison of inspection results with a crew member's health baseline, where the health baseline refers to a normal health state in which the crew member is identified as a physically and mentally healthy person to meet in-flight specific requirements. On the Information Technology side, machine learning techniques have made tremendous progress recently in medical diagnosis and health data analytics. We consequently initiate an effort on bringing machine learning based disease prediction technology as predictive diagnostics applications in the context of aerospace medicine. In space missions the physiological and psychological health conditions of crew are subject to continuous monitoring, in which electroencephalogram (EEG) , electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be critical. EEG is broadly used to study the nervous system, monitoring of sleep stages, biofeedback and control, and diagnosis of epilepsy. Considering EEG has long been employed in crew selection and training, and recently been widely recognized as an effective means for disease diagnosis and prediction, in this paper we mainly focus on EEG in our investigation for aerospace medicine. After introduction of EEG and its applications in predictive diagnostics, we explore and extract amplitude-frequency patterns in EEG to provide distinctive features as health indicators. To further achieve predictive diagnostics for aerospace medicine, we propose a machine learning based framework involving physiological signals for automatic health monitoring and disease prediction. This framework incorporates feature extraction as front end, and employs state-of-the-art data mining and classification mechanism to proactively distinguish between normal and abnormal health conditions in real time. Automatic disease prediction for crew members can therefore be timely provided for proper actions. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm, we employ epileptic seizure prediction as a case study. It is shown through experiments that the proposed predictive diagnostic system leads to promising prediction results. As an application of the disease prediction framework on physiological sources other than EEG, we have further discussed its employment on measuring and diagnosing disrupted neuromuscular characteristics and muscle fatigue for astronauts and aviators with EMG signals. We expect the framework described in this paper will result in a positive impact on enhancing the medical operation autonomy in aerospace medicine.

As the most existing stream clustering, algorithms can not generate online clustering results in real-time, an online data stream clustering algorithm is proposed by using sliding windows and density-based grid storage structure. The algorithm achieves a rapid speed for online clustering data stream and it can provide users with real-time clustering results and reflect the dynamic evolution of data streams. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed has a good capacity of dealing with rapid evolutional data stream and have a good clustering quality.

Hadoop-an open-source implementation of MapReduce is widely used for short jobs requiring low response time. In this paper, We proposed a new preshuffling strategy in Hadoop to reduce high network loads imposed by shuffle-intensive applications. Designing new shuffling strategies is very appealing for Hadoop clusters where network interconnects are performance bottleneck when the clusters are shared among a large number of applications. The network interconnects are likely to become scarce resource when many shuffle-intensive applications are sharing a Hadoop cluster. We implemented the push model along with the preshuffling scheme in the Hadoop system, where the 2-stage pipeline was incorporated with the preshuffling scheme. We implemented the push model and a pipeline along with the preshuffling scheme in the Hadoop system. Using two Hadoop benchmarks running on the 10-node cluster, we conducted experiments to show that preshuffling-enabled Hadoop clusters are faster than native Hadoop clusters. For example, the push model and the preshuffling scheme powered by the 2-stage pipeline can shorten the execution times of the WordCount and Sort Hadoop applications by an average of 10% and 14%, respectively.

J	Yang, H; Fong, S; Wong, R; Sun, GM				Yang, Hang; Fong, Simon; Wong, Raymond; Sun, Guangmin			Optimizing Classification Decision Trees by Using Weighted Naive Bayes Predictors to Reduce the Imbalanced Class Problem in Wireless Sensor Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Standard classification algorithms are often inaccurate when used in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the observed data occur in imbalanced classes. The imbalanced data classification problem occurs when the number of samples in one class, usually the class of interest, is much lower than the number in the other classes. Many classification models have been studied in the data-mining research community. However, they all assume that the input data are stationary and bounded in size, so that resampling techniques and postadjustment by measuring the classification cost can be applied. In this paper, we devise a new scheme that extends a popular stream classification algorithm to the analysis of WSNs for reducing the adverse effects of the imbalanced class in the data.. is new scheme is resource light at the algorithm level and does not require any data preprocessing. It uses weighted naive Bayes predictors at the decision tree leaves to effectively reduce the impact of imbalanced classes. Experiments show that our modified algorithm outperforms the original stream classification algorithm.

Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) is a particularly effective and flexible treatment that allows patients to adjust the dosages of the analgesics that control their pain after surgery. However, PCA requires manual operation for sustained attention, and should be analysed with other pathology information for synergic usage. In this paper, we propose an integrated information system for pain management, called Integrated Patient Controlled Analgesia (iPCA). The system integrates various PCA-related devices by wireless techniques to provide real-time information for medial staffs, and offer more efficient and convenient pain control for both in-hospital and at-home patients. To evaluate our system, we have developed a prototype and conducted a series of field trails at a large private hospital in southern Taiwan. The results show that the iPCA system indeed works well with patients, and can provide better post-operative pain control by efficiently collecting PCA usage information.

Android has surpassed other mobile platforms as the most popular whilst also witnessing a dramatic increase in malware targeting the platform. A worrying trend that is emerging is the increasing sophistication of Android malware to evade detection by traditional signature-based scanners. As such, Android app marketplaces remain at risk of hosting malicious apps that could evade detection before being downloaded by unsuspecting users. Hence, in this paper we present an effective approach to alleviate this problem based on Bayesian classification models obtained from static code analysis. The models are built from a collection of code and app characteristics that provide indicators of potential malicious activities. The models are evaluated with real malware samples in the wild and results of experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Among them, one of the active topics is Cloud-based Trip Planning for meeting user's personal requirements. Although a number of studies on this topic have been proposed in literatures, most of them only regard the user-specific constraints as some filtering conditions for planning the trip. In fact, immersing the constraints into travel recommendation systems to provide a personalized trip is desired for users. Furthermore, time complexity of trip planning from a set of attractions is sensitive to the scalability of travel regions. Hence, how to reduce the computational cost by parallel cloud computing techniques is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel system named Touch Map to efficiently recommend the personalized trips meeting multiple constraints of users by mining user's check-in behaviors. In Touch Map, a POI search module is first proposed to select POIs which are desired for user-specific constraints. Then, we adopt our previous work, Trip-Mine, to efficiently plan the trip that satisfies multiple user-specific constraints. As a whole, we propose a novel framework for cloud-based travel recommendation that considers the issues of multiple constraints. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, PTR is shown to deliver excellent performance.

These sites allow the users to share just about everything, including photos, videos, favorite music, and games, and record all user interactions and retain them for potential use in social data mining. This storing and sharing of large amounts of information causes privacy problems for the users of these websites. In order to prevent these problems, we have to provide strict privacy policies, data protection mechanisms, and trusted and built-in applications that help to protect user privacy by limiting the people who get access to a user's personal information. Thus, the privacy problem has prompted us to provide a solution that offers the users of these social networking websites an opportunity to protect their information. In this paper, a social networking application and its system design, algorithm, and database structure are described. Our application offers a reputation-based trusted architecture to social network users. It creates and monitors social reputations, finds social circles, and helps the users to group their friends easily, meaningfully, and automatically to protect their privacy. This system provides the grouping of users through an automated system into different social circles by analyzing the user's social connections depending on what common information or application they share that should not be accessed by other users.

Thus the failure of synchronous temperature monitoring is the bottleneck of cold-chain temperature monitoring. Targeting at the real-time features of synchronous temperature monitoring, this paper discusses some issues about RFID technology applied to outlier detection. Through comparing differing feasible RFID data mining methods, along with the requirements of the cold chain temperature monitoring, we put forward the improved QOD (quick outlier detection) algorithm by clustering based on data stream. After that, we prove that QOD algorithm's performance can be improved after optimization and compared it with several other related methods in accuracy, memory consumption.

Evaluation criterion designing arises as a main aspect for constructing feature selection algorithms. In this paper, a new feature evaluation criterion, called the neighborhood effective information ratio (NEIR), is proposed to compute discernibility capability of categorical and numerical features. Based on the evaluation criterion, a general definition of significance of hybrid features is presented. Then a greedy selection algorithm for hybrid feature subsets based on the proposed evaluation criterion is constructed for data classification. We compare the proposed algorithm with other feature selection algorithms. Both theoretical and experimental analysis verifies the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Privacy-preserving range set union for rare cases in healthcare data	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							INTERSECTION; OPERATIONS	Hospitals have to use a large amount of medical data from individuals while protecting their privacy to execute medical data mining. It is important to find 'rare' cases among medical data of individuals in many healthcare applications. Therefore hospitals need privacy-preserving mining techniques to find rare cases among medical data of individuals. However, previous privacy-preserving data-mining techniques cannot be used to find rare cases. In this study, they suggest a privacy-preserving 'range set union' protocol that can be used to find rare cases in the private medical datasets of individuals.	[Chun, J. Y.; Lee, D. H.; Jeong, I.

A data mining approach for fall detection by using k-nearest neighbour algorithm on wireless sensor network data	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Fall detection technology is critical for the elderly people. In order to avoid the need of full time care giving service, the actual trend is to encourage elderly to stay living autonomously in their homes as long as possible. Reliable fall detection methods can enhance life safety of the elderly and boost their confidence by immediately alerting fall cases to caregivers. This study presents an algorithm of fall detection, which detects fall events by using data-mining approach. The authors' proposed method performs detection in two steps. First, it collects the wireless sensor network (WSN) data in stream format from sensor devices. Second, it uses k-nearest neighbour algorithm, that is, well-known lazy learning algorithm to detect fall occurrences. It detects falls by identifying the fall patterns in the data stream. Experiments show that the proposed method has promising results on WSN data stream in detecting falls.	[Erdogan, S. Z.; Bilgin, T.

J	Kim, K; Lee, J				Kim, Kyoungok; Lee, Jaewook			Sequential manifold learning for efficient churn prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Churn prediction; Dimensionality reduction; Manifold learning; Data mining	SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; RETENTION; MACHINE; MODELS; TREES	Nowadays, thanks to the rapid evolvement of information technology, an explosively large amount of information with very high-dimensional features for customers is being accumulated in companies. These companies, in turn, are exerting every effort to develop more efficient churn prediction models for managing customer relationships effectively. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to deal with a high-dimensional large data set for constructing better churn prediction models. The proposed method starts by partitioning a data set into small-sized data subsets, and applies sequential manifold learning to reduce high-dimensional features and give consistent results for combined data subsets. The performance of the constructed churn prediction model using the proposed method is tested using an E-commerce data set by comparing it with other existing methods. The proposed method works better and is much faster for high-dimensional large data sets without the need for retraining the original data set to reduce the dimensions of new test samples.

J	Lin, MY; Tu, TF; Hsueh, SC				Lin, Ming-Yen; Tu, Tzer-Fu; Hsueh, Sue-Chen			High utility pattern mining using the maximal itemset property and lexicographic tree structures	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						High utility mining; Maximal itemset mining; Data mining; Frequent pattern; Lexicographic tree structure	FREQUENT PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; DISCOVERY; DATABASES	The problem of high utility mining is discovering all of the high utility itemsets in a transactional database. Most algorithms find high utility itemsets in two steps. The first step identifies all of the potential itemsets. The second step then determines the high utility itemsets from the set of potential itemsets. The large number of potential itemsets in the first step is generally the mining bottleneck. If we can reduce the number of potential itemsets, the mining performance can be improved significantly. In this paper, we use a maximal itemset property and propose an algorithm called UMMI (high Utility Mining using the Maximal Itemset property) to significantly reduce the number of potential itemsets in the first step. In the second step, UMMI uses an effective lexicographic tree structure to determine all of the high utility itemsets. In general, UMMI outperforms all three of the previously used algorithms, including CTU-PRO, an optimized TWU-mining algorithm, and Two-Phase, in our experiments using synthetic datasets. On average, UMMI is 5, 3, and 7 times faster than CTU-PRO, TWU-mining, and Two-Phase, respectively. In a real data experiment. UMMI is 6 times faster than Two-Phase. The other two algorithms are not capable of completing the mining step in a reasonable amount of time. UMMI uses an approximately fixed amount of memory, which is generally less than the other algorithms for each mining. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can mine the high utility itemsets efficiently. In addition, UMMI is linearly scalable with respect to the number of transactions.

Data and knowledge visualization with virtual reality spaces, neural networks and rough sets: Application to cancer and geophysical prospecting data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data and knowledge visualization; Visual data mining; Virtual reality; Data projection; Neural networks; Rough sets	EXPRESSION; REPRESENTATION	Visual data mining with virtual reality spaces is used for the representation of data and symbolic knowledge. High quality structure-preserving and maximally discriminative visual representations can be obtained using a combination of neural networks (SAMANN and NDA) and rough sets techniques, so that a proper subsequent analysis can be made. The approach is illustrated with two types of data: for gene expression cancer data, an improvement in classification performance with respect to the original spaces was obtained; for geophysical prospecting data for cave detection, a cavity was successfully predicted.

J	Warkentin, M; Sugumaran, V; Sainsbury, R				Warkentin, Merrill; Sugumaran, Vijayan; Sainsbury, Robert			The role of intelligent agents and data mining in electronic partnership management	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intelligent agents; Electronic partnership; Supply chain; Data mining; XML	WEB; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	The marketspaces of the "New Economy" and the eServices revolution have enabled the formation of new types of partnerships which are electronically mediated. Web-based electronic commerce has also brought a tremendous increase in the volume of data that can be mined for valuable managerial knowledge. The data mining procedures used in this process can be enhanced by employing intelligent agents. This paper describes emerging electronic partnerships between players in developing electronic marketspaces and identifies typical data flows between such players, with an analysis of the potential role of data mining and intelligent agent technology. By identifying the complex nature of information flows between the vast numbers of economic entities, we identify opportunities for applying data mining techniques that can lead to knowledge discovery. In particular, we show how a Generic Agent-based data Mining Architecture (GAMA) can be customized to support managerial decision-making and problem solving in a networked economy. A prototype implementation of GAMA is presented, along with a demonstration of the some of the capabilities of the system. Finally, we explore the role of agents in promoting and maintaining strong automated relationships between various strategic partners. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history involved firms that engaged in major fraud. Accordingly, there has been considerable emphasis on the development of automated approaches for detecting financial fraud. However, most methods have yielded performance results that are less than ideal. In consequence, financial fraud detection continues as an important challenge for business intelligence technologies. In light of the need for more robust identification methods, we use a design science approach to develop MetaFraud, a novel meta-learning framework for enhanced financial fraud detection. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments are conducted on a test bed encompassing thousands of legitimate and fraudulent firms. The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes to its overall effectiveness. Additional experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework over state-of-the-art financial fraud detection methods. Moreover, the MetaFraud framework generates confidence scores associated with each prediction that can facilitate unprecedented financial fraud detection performance and serve as a useful decision-making aid The results have important implications for several stakeholder groups, including compliance officers, investors, audit firms, and regulators.

J	Aggarwal, CC				Aggarwal, Charu C.			On the Equivalence of PLSI and Projected Clustering [Position Paper]	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article								The problem of projected clustering was first proposed in the ACMSIGMOD Conference in 1999, and the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) technique was independently proposed in the ACMSIGIR Conference in the same year. Since then, more than two thousand papers have been written on these problems by the database, data mining and information retrieval communities, along completely independent lines of work. In this paper, we show that these two problems are essentially equivalent, under a probabilistic interpretation to the projected clustering problem. We will show that the EM-algorithm, when applied to the probabilistic version of the projected clustering problem, can be almost identically interpreted as the PLSI technique. The implications of this equivalence are significant, in that they imply the cross-usability of many of the techniques which have been developed for these problems over the last decade. We hope that our observations about the equivalence of these problems will stimulate further research which can significantly improve the currently available solutions for either of these problems.

J	Ahmed, R; Karypis, G				Ahmed, Rezwan; Karypis, George			Algorithms for mining the evolution of conserved relational states in dynamic networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dynamic network; Relational state; Evolution	GRAPH; SUBGRAPHS; PATTERNS	Dynamic networks have recently being recognized as a powerful abstraction to model and represent the temporal changes and dynamic aspects of the data underlying many complex systems. Significant insights regarding the stable relational patterns among the entities can be gained by analyzing temporal evolution of the complex entity relations. This can help identify the transitions from one conserved state to the next and may provide evidence to the existence of external factors that are responsible for changing the stable relational patterns in these networks. This paper presents a new data mining method that analyzes the time-persistent relations or states between the entities of the dynamic networks and captures all maximal non-redundant evolution paths of the stable relational states. Experimental results based on multiple datasets from real-world applications show that the method is efficient and scalable.

Indeed, an abundance of interesting data in several applications occur naturally in this form. Our goal is to discover and capture the intrinsic nature of the data by proposing some approaches that combine the major advantages of generative models namely finite mixtures and discriminative techniques namely support vector machines (SVMs). Indeed, SVMs often rely on classic kernels which are not generally meaningful for proportional data. One serious limitation of these kernels is that they do not take into account the nature of data to classify and choosing a suitable kernel continues to be a formidable challenge for data mining and machine learning researchers. Our approach builds on selecting accurate kernels generated from finite mixtures of Dirichlet, generalized Dirichlet and Beta-Liouville distributions which chief advantage is their flexibility and explanatory capabilities in the case of heterogenous proportional data. Using extensive simulations and a number of experiments involving scene modeling and classification, and automatic image orientation detection, we show the merits of the proposed mixture models and the accuracy of the generated kernels.

It is important for root-cause analysis, network forensics, attack mitigation, and anomaly modeling. In this paper, we use meta-data provided by several histogram-based detectors to identify suspicious flows, and then apply association rule mining to find and summarize anomalous flows. Using rich traffic data from a backbone network, we show that our technique effectively finds the flows associated with the anomalous event(s) in all studied cases. In addition, it triggers a very small number of false positives, on average between 2 and 8.5, which exhibit specific patterns and can be trivially sorted out by an administrator. Our anomaly extraction method significantly reduces the work-hours needed for analyzing alarms, making anomaly detection systems more practical.

Understanding the firing patterns of neurons implicit in these spike trains is crucial to gaining insight into cellular activity. We present a solution involving a massively parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) to mine spike train datasets. We focus on mining frequent episodes of firing patterns that capture coordinated events even in the presence of intervening background events. We present two algorithmic strategies-hybrid mining and two-pass elimination-to map the finite state machine-based counting algorithms onto GPUs. These strategies explore different computation-to-core mapping schemes and illustrate innovative parallel algorithm design patterns for temporal data mining. We also provide a multi-GPU mining framework, which exhibits additional performance enhancement. Together, these contributions move us towards a real-time solution to neuronal data mining.

Classification of these defect patterns is crucial to improving reliability and yield during IC manufacturing. Accurate classification requires good feature selection in order to assist in identifying the defect cluster types. In this paper, we demonstrate that the linear Hough transformation, the circular Hough transformation incorporating the cover ratio approach, and the zone ratio approach, when used as feature-extraction techniques, are able to distinguish lines, various solid circle-like cluster patterns such as blobs and bull's-eyes, and various hollow circle-like cluster patterns such as rings and edges. On the basis of these features, in this paper we provide a comprehensive evaluation of several data-mining classification approaches in terms of performance and accuracy. The results obtained using both artificial and real manufacturing data demonstrate the potential of this approach for analyzing general defect patterns that are generated during the IC fabrication process.

There are different system designs for content based image retrieval (CBIR) system. This paper propose a novel system architecture for CBIR system which combines techniques include content-based image and color analysis, as well as data mining techniques. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to propose segmentation and grid module, feature extraction module, K-means and k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithms and bring in the neighborhood module to build the CBIR system. Concept of neighborhood color analysis module which also recognizes the side of every grids of image is first contributed in this paper. The results show the CBIR systems performs well in the training and it also indicates there contains many interested issue to be optimized in the query stage of image retrieval.

J	Chun, JY; Hong, D; Lee, DH; Jeong, IR				Chun, Ji Young; Hong, Dowon; Lee, Dong Hoon; Jeong, Ik Rae			Scalable Privacy-Preserving t-Repetition Protocol with Distributed Medical Data	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						t-repetition; rare cases; set operation; data mining; privacy	SET INTERSECTION	Finding rare cases with medical data is important when hospitals or research institutes want to identify rare diseases. To extract meaningful information from a large amount of sensitive medical data, privacy-preserving data mining techniques can be used. A privacy-preserving t-repetition protocol can be used to find rare cases with distributed medical data. A privacy-preserving t-repetition protocol is to find elements which exactly t parties out of n parties have in common in their datasets without revealing their private datasets. A privacy-preserving t-repetition protocol can be used to find not only common cases with a high t but also rare cases with a low t. In 2011, Chun et al. suggested the generic set operation protocol which can be used to find t-repeated elements. In the paper, we first show that the Chun et al's protocol becomes infeasible for calculating t-repeated elements if the number of users is getting bigger. That is, the computational and communicational complexities of the Chun et al.'s protocol in calculating t-repeated elements grow exponentially as the number of users grows. Then, we suggest a polynomial-time protocol with respect to the number of users, which calculates t-repeated elements between users.

It is a complex process whose central point is data mining, which effectively builds models from data. Data type, quality and dimensionality are some factors which affect performance of data mining task. Since the high dimensionality of data can cause some troubles, as data overload, a possible solution could be its reduction. Sampling and filtering reduce the number of cases in a dataset, whereas features reduction can be achieved by feature selection. This paper aims to present a combined method for feature selection, where a filter based on correlation is applied on whole features set to find the relevant ones, and then, on these features a wrapper is applied in order to find the best features subset for a specified predictor. It is also presented a case study for a data set provided by TERAPERS a personalized speech therapy system.

A novel approach to estimate proximity in a random forest: An exploratory study	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Random forest; Proximity matrix; Support vector machine; Kernel matrix; Data mining	CLASSIFICATION	A data proximity matrix is an important information source in random forests (RF) based data mining, including data clustering, visualization, outlier detection, substitution of missing values, and finding mislabeled data samples. A novel approach to estimate proximity is proposed in this work. The approach is based on measuring distance between two terminal nodes in a decision tree. To assess the consistency (quality) of data proximity estimate, we suggest using the proximity matrix as a kernel matrix in a support vector machine (SVM), under the assumption that a matrix of higher quality leads to higher classification accuracy. It is experimentally shown that the proposed approach improves the proximity estimate, especially when RF is made of a small number of trees. It is also demonstrated that, for some tasks, an SVM exploiting the suggested proximity matrix based kernel, outperforms an SVM based on a standard radial basis function kernel and the standard proximity matrix based kernel.

There are different learning methods in machine learning of which each has both advantages and disadvantages. Each type provides a better and interesting position, data and special structure. These methods have differences in the manner of implementation, understandability and speed of response and each is included in a special field of the data classification. Learning process in machine learning is the most important part which causes to elevate the power of a model and can learn the trained problem more quickly and work with it. In this paper, it will present a new method for data classification by Cellular Learning Automata. This method includes three stages. In order to show the power of this model, we have tested it on several types of online dataset and study it in terms of the learning speed, accuracy and simplicity in implementation with some other models and the simulated results demonstrate that the presented method provides acceptable and better answers and that one can use the proposed method for data classification.

Previous research deals mostly with attribute partitioning. We address here the combined problem of attribute partitioning and tuple clustering. We propose a novel approach for this mixed fragmentation problem by applying a genetic algorithm iteratively to attribute partitioning and tuple clustering sub-problems. We compared our results to attribute-only partitioning and random search solution, resulting in a database access cost reduction of upto 70% and 67% respectively. We analyzed the effect of varying genetic parameters on the optimal solution through experimentation.

This is not an objective definition, but a definition that is easy to understand and one that is practical, because there is a dataset too big for any computer you might use; hence, this is VL data for you. Clustering is one of the primary tasks used in the pattern recognition and data mining communities to search VL databases (including VL images) in various applications, and so, clustering algorithms that scale well to VL data are important and useful. This paper compares the efficacy of three different implementations of techniques aimed to extend fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to VL data. Specifically, we compare methods that are based on 1) sampling followed by noniterative extension; 2) incremental techniques that make one sequential pass through subsets of the data; and 3) kernelized versions of FCM that provide approximations based on sampling, including three proposed algorithms. We use both loadable and VL datasets to conduct the numerical experiments that facilitate comparisons based on time and space complexity, speed, quality of approximations to batch FCM (for loadable data), and assessment of matches between partitions and ground truth. Empirical results show that random sampling plus extension FCM, bit-reduced FCM, and approximate kernel FCM are good choices to approximate FCM for VL data. We conclude by demonstrating the VL algorithms on a dataset with 5 billion objects and presenting a set of recommendations regarding the use of different VL FCM clustering schemes.

Realization of Partial Discharge Signals in Transformer Oils Utilizing Advanced Computational Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article						Wavelet transforms; feature extraction; support vector machines; partial discharge; particle swarm optimization; sequential floating forward selection	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; FEATURE-SELECTION; PD-MEASUREMENTS; CLASSIFICATION; PULSES	The measurement of acoustic and electrical signals for the partial discharge (PD) activity due to the presence of metallic particles within transformer oil are utilized for the characterization of the incipient hazards. The utilization of phase resolved, in addition, to time resolved partial discharge signals is undertaken to extract numerous features using statistical and frequency analyzers. The extracted features are down scaled to pinpoint the effective attributes that render an intelligent classification means useful for determining contaminating particle type and dimensions. This is accomplished by utilizing feature selection wrapper models undertaking the sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) and particle swarm optimization as alternative search strategies. Support vector machines (SVM) is finally used for the classification of contaminating particles identity. A comprehensive comparison between various selection techniques of the best feature vector for the most efficient classification is tackled based on size of selected feature vector, processing time and success of classification. Results of this study can be integrated into a smart automatable tool based on recent data mining techniques that would provide an efficient and prompt identification for the nature of incipient hazards due to lack in insulation integrity.

In this paper we propose a novel SSC approach with enhanced spectral embedding (ESE), which not only considers the geometric structure information contained in data sets, but also can make use of the given side information such as pairwise constraints. Specially, we first construct a symmetry-favored k-NN graph, which is highly robust to noise and outliers, and can reflect the underlying manifold structures of data sets. Then we learn the enhanced spectral embedding towards an ideal data representation as consistent with the given pairwise constraints as possible. Finally, by using the regularization of spectral embedding we formulate learning the new data representation as a semidefinite-quadratic-linear programming (SQLP) problem, which can be efficiently solved. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets show that our ESE approach outperforms the state-of-the-art SSC algorithms in terms of speed and quality on both vector-based and graph-based clustering.

In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected. We also offer an alternative point of view on leakage that is based on causal graph modeling concepts.

Reconstruction of reflection characteristics of 3D objects in a monostatic optical location system	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article								A technique for data mining the reflection characteristics of 3D objects of monostatic optical location systems is discussed. The time profile of the pulse scattering cross section (SCS) of a target has been corrected via the deconvolution method. The continuous and "discontinuous" components of the pulse SCS have been reconstructed on the basis of the estimated time positions of its inflection points. The parameters of the polyGaussian model describing the discontinuous component of the transient response of a location object have been obtained with the help of the Estimation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

J	Miyakoshi, Y; Kato, S				Miyakoshi, Yoshihiro; Kato, Shohei			A missing value imputation method using a Bayesian network with weighted learning	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN			English	Article						classification; missing value; Bayesian network; weighted learning; K2 algorithm	RECOGNITION	With the development of computer networks, it has become easy to have huge databases. Accordingly, it is becoming difficult for users to extract knowledge from such databases. In this paper we focus on data mining, especially classification. In real-world data mining, the missing value problem occurs in cases such as speech containing noise, facial occlusion, and the like. When a test sample has missing values, a classification system cannot handle them. In previous studies, various imputation methods have been developed, with the objective of solving the missing value problem with numerous explanatory variables, even if some explanatory variables were ineffective for imputation. It has been said that the use of many variables degrades learning efficiency, and thus we believe that imputation methods should be developed considering the relations among explanatory variables. It is also effective to consider the relations between the test sample and each of the training samples. Therefore, we have proposed an imputation method using a Bayesian network with weighted learning. Experiments have confirmed that the proposed method imputes missed values with approximate values, and the classification system successfully classified test samples in which missed values were imputed by the proposed method, with better success than some conventional imputation methods.

J	Otaki, K; Sugiyama, M; Yamamoto, A				Otaki, Keisuke; Sugiyama, Mahito; Yamamoto, Akihiro			Privacy Preserving Using Dummy Data for Set Operations in Itemset Mining Implemented with ZDDs	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						privacy-preserving data mining; distributed itemset mining; dummy data; set operations; zero-suppressed bdds		We present a privacy preserving method based on inserting dummy data into original data on the data structure called Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZDDs). Our task is distributed itemset mining, which is frequent itemset mining from horizontally partitioned databases stored in distributed places called sites. We focus on the fundamental case in which there are two sites and each site has a database managed by its owner. By dividing the process of distributed itemset mining into the set union and the set intersection, we show how to make the operations secure in the sense of undistinguishability of data, which is our criterion for privacy preserving based on the already proposed criterion, p-indistinguishability. Our method conceals the original data in each operation by inserting dummy data, where ZDDs, BDD-based directed acyclic graphs, are adopted to represent sets of itemsets compactly and to implement the set operations in constructing the distributed itemset mining process. As far as we know, this is the first technique which gives a concrete representation of sets of itemsets and an implementation of set operations for privacy preserving in distributed itemset mining. Our experiments show that the proposed method provides undistinguishability of dummy data. Furthermore, we compare our method with Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC), which is one of the well-known techniques of secure computation.

In the domain of education there is a variety of data of various types that are collected. The important question is: Is it possible to process collected data with the data mining technique and what are main advantages of data mining and e-learning interaction? If an e-learning system accumulates a huge volume of data, then it is possible to deploy techniques and tools from the domain of data mining in order to gain valuable information. The research presented in this paper is conducted on real-life data that originates from the Balkan region. The software system Weka is used to generate association rules. The main result of this research is the assessment of the parameters that are associated with the opinion that computer skills will be helpful in the future, from the students point of view. This result is very important because it gives the exact insight to computer technology usage in the Balkans schools. Furthermore, some advantages of the usage of data mining techniques in the domain of education are determined.

JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; Data mining; Ensemble; Diversity; Decision tree	MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; DIVERSITY	An ensemble in machine learning is defined as a set of models (such as classifiers or predictors) that are induced individually from data by using one or more machine learning algorithms for a given task and then work collectively in the hope of generating improved decisions. In this paper we investigate the factors that influence ensemble performance, which mainly include accuracy of individual classifiers, diversity between classifiers, the number of classifiers in an ensemble and the decision fusion strategy. Among them, diversity is believed to be a key factor but more complex and difficult to be measured quantitatively, and it was thus chosen as the focus of this study, together with the relationships between the other factors. A technique was devised to build ensembles with decision trees that are induced with randomly selected features. Three sets of experiments were performed using 12 benchmark datasets, and the results indicate that (i) a high level of diversity indeed makes an ensemble more accurate and robust compared with individual models; (ii) small ensembles can produce results as good as, or better than, large ensembles provided the appropriate (e.g. more diverse) models are selected for the inclusion. This has implications that for scaling up to larger databases the increased efficiency of smaller ensembles becomes more significant and beneficial. As a test case study, ensembles are built based on these findings for a real world application-osteoporosis classification, and found that, in each case of three datasets used, the ensembles out-performed individual decision trees consistently and reliably.

Efficient algorithms for mining maximal high utility itemsets from data streams with different models	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						High utility itemset; Maximal pattern; Utility mining; Data stream mining	FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS	Data stream mining is an emerging research topic in the data mining field. Finding frequent itemsets is one of the most important tasks in data stream mining with wide applications like online e-business and web click-stream analysis. However, two main problems existed in relevant studies: (1) The utilities (e.g., importance or profits) of items are not considered. Actual utilities of patterns cannot be reflected in frequent itemsets. (2) Existing utility mining methods produce too many patterns and this makes it difficult for the users to filter useful patterns among the huge set of patterns. In view of this, in this paper we propose a novel framework, named GUIDE (Generation of maximal high Utility Itemsets from Data strEams), to find maximal high utility itemsets from data streams with different models. i.e., landmark, sliding window and time fading models. The proposed structure, named MUI-Tree (Maximal high Utility Itemset Tree), maintains essential information for the mining processes and the proposed strategies further facilitates the performance of GUIDE. Main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on mining the compact form of high utility patterns from data streams; (2) GUIDE is an effective one-pass framework which meets the requirements of data stream mining; (3) GUIDE generates novel patterns which are not only high utility but also maximal, which provide compact and insightful hidden information in the data streams. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms under various conditions in data stream environments on different models. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Su, P; Mao, WJ; Zeng, D; Zhao, HM				Su, Peng; Mao, Wenji; Zeng, Daniel; Zhao, Huimin			Mining actionable behavioral rules	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Actionable knowledge discovery; Actionable behavioral rule	PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Many applications can benefit from constructing models to predict the behavior of an entity. However, such models do not provide the user with explicit knowledge that can be directly used to influence (restrain or encourage) behavior for the user's interest. Undoubtedly, the user often exactly needs such knowledge. This type of knowledge is called actionable knowledge. Actionability is a very important criterion measuring the interestingness of mined patterns. In this paper, to mine such knowledge, we take a first step toward formally defining a new class of data mining problem, named actionable behavioral rule mining. Our definition explicitly states the problem as a search problem in a framework of support and expected utility. We also propose two algorithms for mining such rules. Our experiment shows the validity of our approach, as well as the practical value of our defined problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, most IDS methods have used transformed features, selected features, or original features. Both feature transformation and feature selection have their advantages. Neighborhood component analysis feature transformation and genetic feature selection (NCAGAFS) is proposed in this research. NCAGAFS is based on soft computing and data mining and uses the advantages of both transformation and selection. This method transforms features via neighborhood component analysis and chooses the best features with a classifier based on a genetic feature selection method. This novel approach is verified using the KDD Cup99 dataset, demonstrating higher performances than other well-known methods under various classifiers have demonstrated.

Fast and Accurate Simulation of the Cray XMT Multithreaded Supercomputer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Modeling of computer architecture; multithreaded processors; system architectures; integration and modeling; measurement; evaluation; modeling; simulation of multiple-processor systems	SYSTEM SIMULATION; ALGORITHMS	Irregular applications, such as data mining or graph-based computations, show unpredictable memory/network access patterns and control structures. Massively multithreaded architectures with large processor counts, like the Cray MTA-1, MTA-2, and XMT, appear to address irregular application requirements better than commodity clusters. However, the research on massively multithreaded systems is currently limited by the lack of adequate architectural simulation infrastructures due to issues such as size of the machines, memory footprint, simulation speed, accuracy, and customization. At the same time, Shared Memory MultiProcessors (SMPs) with multicore processors have become an attractive platform to simulate large-scale systems. This paper introduces a cycle-level simulator of the massively multithreaded Cray XMT supercomputer. The simulator runs unmodified XMT applications. We discuss how we tackled the challenges posed by its development, detailing the techniques implemented to obtain high-simulation speed while maintaining a high accuracy. By mapping XMT processors (ThreadStorm with 128 hardware threads) to host computing cores, the simulation speed remains constant as the number of simulated processors increases, up to the number of available host cores. The simulator supports zero-overhead switching among different accuracy levels at runtime and includes a parametric network and memory model that takes into account contention and hot spotting. On a modern 48-core SMP host, the proposed infrastructure simulates a large set of irregular applications 500 to 2,000 times slower than real time when compared to a 128-processor XMT, with an accuracy error under 10 percent. Emulation is only from 25 to 200 times slower than real time. The paper also presents a case study, where the simulation infrastructure is used to identify bottlenecks in the current XMT architecture and to estimate the performance scaling of a possible multicore design with next generation memory and network interconnect.

J	Wu, MT; Hong, TP; Lee, CN				Wu, Min-Thai; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Lee, Chung-Nan			A continuous ant colony system framework for fuzzy data mining	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant colony system; Continuous space; Data mining; Fuzzy set; Membership function	ASSOCIATION RULES; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	The goal of data mining is to find out interesting and meaningful patterns from large databases. In some real applications, many data are quantitative and linguistic. Fuzzy data mining was thus proposed to discover fuzzy knowledge from this kind of data. In the past, two mining algorithms based on the ant colony systems were proposed to find suitable membership functions for fuzzy association rules. They transformed the problem into a multi-stage graph, with each route representing a possible set of membership functions, and then, used the any colony system to solve it. They, however, searched for solutions in a discrete solution space in which the end points of membership functions could be adjusted only in a discrete way. The paper, thus, extends the original approaches to continuous search space, and a fuzzy mining algorithm based on the continuous ant approach is proposed. The end points of the membership functions may be moved in the continuous real-number space. The encoding representation and the operators are also designed for being suitable in the continuous space, such that the actual global optimal solution is contained in the search space. Besides, the proposed approach does not have fixed edges and nodes in the search process. It can dynamically produce search edges according to the distribution functions of pheromones in the solution space. Thus, it can get a better nearly global optimal solution than the previous two ant-based fuzzy mining approaches. The experimental results show the good performance of the proposed approach as well.

J	Ahn, B; Abbas, E; Park, JA; Choi, HJ				Ahn, Beunguk; Abbas, Elbashir; Park, Jin-Ah; Choi, Ho-Jin			Increasing Splicing Site Prediction by Training Gene Set Based on Species	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Splice sites prediction; exon; intron; species; machine learning; DNA sequence	EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; RNA	Biological data have been increased exponentially in recent years, and analyzing these data using data mining tools has become one of the major issues in the bioinformatics research community. This paper focuses on the protein construction process in higher organisms where the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence is filtered. In the process, "unmeaningful" DNA sub-sequences (called introns) are removed, and their meaningful counterparts (called exons) are retained. Accurate recognition of the boundaries between these two classes of sub-sequences, however, is known to be a difficult problem. Conventional approaches for recognizing these boundaries have sought for solely enhancing machine learning techniques, while inherent nature of the data themselves has been overlooked. In this paper we present an approach which makes use of the data attributes inherent to species in order to increase the accuracy of the boundary recognition. For experimentation, we have taken the data sets for four different species from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) data repository, divided the data sets based on the species types, then trained a preprocessed version of the data sets on neural network(NN)-based and support vector machine(SVM)-based classifiers. As a result, we have observed that each species has its own specific features related to the splice sites, and that it implies there are related distances among species. To conclude, dividing the training data set based on species would increase the accuracy of predicting splicing junction and propose new insight to the biological research.

J	Kang, AR; Kim, HK; Woo, J				Kang, Ah Reum; Kim, Huy Kang; Woo, Jiyoung			Chatting Pattern Based Game BOT Detection: Do They Talk Like Us?	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Online game security; game bot; MMORPG; data mining; text mining	CENTRALITY; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Among the various security threats in online games, the use of game bots is the most serious problem. Previous studies on game bot detection have proposed many methods to find out discriminable behaviors of bots from humans based on the fact that a bot's playing pattern is different from that of a human. In this paper, we look at the chatting data that reflects gamers' communication patterns and propose a communication pattern analysis framework for online game bot detection. In massive multi-user online role playing games (MMORPGs), game bots use chatting message in a different way from normal users. We derive four features; a network feature, a descriptive feature, a diversity feature and a text feature. To measure the diversity of communication patterns, we propose lightly summarized indices, which are computationally inexpensive and intuitive. For text features, we derive lexical, syntactic and semantic features from chatting contents using text mining techniques. To build the learning model for game bot detection, we test and compare three classification models: the random forest, logistic regression and lazy learning. We apply the proposed framework to AION operated by NCsoft, a leading online game company in Korea. As a result of our experiments, we found that the random forest outperforms the logistic regression and lazy learning. The model that employs the entire feature sets gives the highest performance with a precision value of 0.893 and a recall value of 0.965.

Fast rule-based bioactivity prediction using associative classification mining	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Associative classification mining; Fingerprint; Pipeline Pilot; Bayesian; SVM	THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA; DECISION TREE MODELS; GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS; PUBCHEM	Relating chemical features to bioactivities is critical in molecular design and is used extensively in the lead discovery and optimization process. A variety of techniques from statistics, data mining and machine learning have been applied to this process. In this study, we utilize a collection of methods, called associative classification mining (ACM), which are popular in the data mining community, but so far have not been applied widely in cheminformatics. More specifically, classification based on predictive association rules (CPAR), classification based on multiple association rules (CMAR) and classification based on association rules (CBA) are employed on three datasets using various descriptor sets. Experimental evaluations on anti-tuberculosis (antiTB), mutagenicity and hERG (the human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) blocker datasets show that these three methods are computationally scalable and appropriate for high speed mining. Additionally, they provide comparable accuracy and efficiency to the commonly used Bayesian and support vector machines (SVM) methods, and produce highly interpretable models.

Personnel specifications have greatest impact on total efficiency. They can enhance total efficiency of critical personnel attributes. This study presents an intelligent integrated decision support system (DSS) for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel efficiency. DSS assesses the impact of personnel efficiency by data envelopment analysis (DEA), artificial neural network (ANN), rough set theory (RST), and K-Means clustering algorithm. DEA has two roles in this study. It provides data to ANN and finally it selects the best reduct through ANN results. Reduct is described as a minimum subset of features, completely discriminating all objects in a data set. The reduct selection is achieved by RST. ANN has two roles in the integrated algorithm. ANN results are basis for selecting the best reduct and it is used for forecasting total efficiency. Finally. K-Means algorithm is used to develop the DSS. A procedure is proposed to develop the DSS with stated tools and completed rule base. The DSS could help managers to forecast and optimize efficiencies by selected attributes and grouping inferred efficiency. Also, it is an ideal tool for careful forecasting and planning. The proposed DSS is applied to an actual banking system and its superiorities and advantages are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, to control the growth in the size of the solution with noise and regularize the solution in iterations, two auxiliary constraints are added into NMF. Then we introduce the logarithmic barrier function to eliminate the nonnegative regularization, and obtain an equivalent quadratic trust region problem by some mathematical calculation. According to the necessary and sufficient conditions of the trust region problem, we obtain a solution of the original problem by solving a parameterized linear system. We apply this method into NMF with different cost functions, including alpha-divergence, beta-divergence, KL-divergence, dual KL(DKL)-divergence, where different cost functions are imposed on different types of data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Altinisik, U; Yildirim, M				Altinisik, Umut; Yildirim, Mehmet			A new fault tolerant control approach for the three-tank system using data mining	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS	In this study, we propose a knowledge-based approach for detection and isolation of sensor faults in fault tolerant control (FTC) of the three-tank system. Farthest first traversal algorithm (FFTA) of data mining is used first-time for the classification of faults in an FTC system. The sliding window is used to detect signal changes, which contain possible transients due to faults. The variance-changing ratio is calculated to extract the features of the sensor signal in each window. Then, FFTA is utilized for the isolation of sensor faults. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, seven types of artificial faults were applied to closed-loop fault tolerant control system in certain periods. All faults were detected and isolated immediately after they occurred. Moreover, fault isolation was achieved when multiple faults occurred simultaneously. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ayadi, W; Ellourni, M; Hao, JK				Ayadi, Wassim; Ellourni, Mourad; Hao, Jin Kao			BiMine+: An efficient algorithm for discovering relevant biclusters of DNA microarray data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biclustering; Gene expression data; Evaluation function; Enumeration algorithm; Data mining	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; TIME-COURSE; CLUSTERS; INFERENCE; SELECTION; MODULES	Biclustering is a very useful tool for analyzing microarray data. It aims to identify maximal groups of genes which are coherent with maximal groups of conditions. In this paper, we propose a biclustering algorithm, called BiMine+, which is able to detect significant biclusters from gene expression data. The proposed algorithm is based on two original features. First, BiMine+ is based on the use of a new tree structure, called Modified Bicluster Enumeration Tree (MBET), on which biclusters are represented by the profile shapes of genes. Second, BiMine+ uses a pruning rule to avoid both trivial biclusters and combinatorial explosion of the search tree. The performance of BiMine+ is assessed on both synthetic and real DNA microarray datasets. Experimental results show that BiMine+ competes favorably with several state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms and is able to extract functionally enriched and biologically relevant biclusters.

Even with the recent progress in two-party computation techniques such as fully homomorphic encryption, general MPCremains relevant as it has shown promising performance metrics in real-world benchmarks. SHAREMIND is a secure multi-party computation framework designed with real-life efficiency in mind. It has been applied in several practical scenarios, and from these experiments, new requirements have been identified. Firstly, large datasets require more efficient protocols for standard operations such as multiplication and comparison. Secondly, the confidential processing of financial data requires the use of more complex primitives, including a secure division operation. This paper describes new protocols in the SHAREMIND model for secure multiplication, share conversion, equality, bit shift, bit extraction, and division. All the protocols are implemented and benchmarked, showing that the current approach provides remarkable speed improvements over the previous work. This is verified using real-world benchmarks for both operations and algorithms.

J	Borgelt, C				Borgelt, Christian			Frequent item set mining	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							DISCOVERING SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION RULES; UNCERTAIN DATA; DATABASES; ALGORITHM	Frequent item set mining is one of the best known and most popular data mining methods. Originally developed for market basket analysis, it is used nowadays for almost any task that requires discovering regularities between (nominal) variables. This paper provides an overview of the foundations of frequent item set mining, starting from a definition of the basic notions and the core task. It continues by discussing how the search space is structured to avoid redundant search, how it is pruned with the a priori property, and how the output is reduced by confining it to closed or maximal item sets or generators. In addition, it reviews some of the most important algorithmic techniques and data structures that were developed to make the search for frequent item sets as efficient as possible.

The Role of Visual Rhetoric in Semantic Multimedia: Strategies for Decision Making in Times of Crisis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						semantic multimedia; visual rhetoric; text to visual matching; interactive documentary; crisis strategies; multimedia storytelling	RETRIEVAL	As semantic multimedia is approaching mainstream, even the great improvements that can be seen in its classic schools, like the data mining inspired Information Retrieval based on metadata analysis, or Computer Vision, might not be enough. We identify a new group that gains traction in the semantic multimedia community and which uses as starting point developments from psychology and visual communication. For the purposes of this article we restrict our domain to visual rhetoric as we consider it to yield the biggest potential for future developments. Living in times when the periods between crises seem to be shorter and shorter, we look at how developments in semantic multimedia can be used for predicting and overcoming crises. We analyze at least 2 aspects related to this: using information visualization to understand the evolution of crises and creating multi-layered semantic multimedia technologies that can easily be adapted to use a variety of sources and solve problems from different domains. In both cases we show how techniques inspired by visual rhetoric (information linking, framing, composition) in conjunction with named entity recognition offer a lot of benefits. The section related to multi-layered semantic multimedia technologies also draws on the lessons learned while designing a prototype application aimed at improving tourism decision making process. The article ends with a discussion on evaluation methods for multi-layered semantic technologies applications. We look at how to evaluate them on both levels: mechanisms (information linking versus raw named entity recognition when generating visuals, for example), and decision making strategies (Do such systems actually solve real problems related to crises, create jobs or at least can they be repurposed to solve other problems than the one with which we have started?).

A brief introduction to agent mining	AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agent mining; Multiagent system; Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Machine learning		Agent mining is an emerging interdisciplinary area that integrates multiagent systems, data mining and knowledge discovery, machine learning and other relevant areas. It brings new opportunities to tackling issues in relevant fields more efficiently by engaging together the individual technologies. It will also bring about symbiosis and symbionts that combine advantages from the corresponding constituent systems. In this editorial, we briefly introduce the concept of agent mining, the main areas of research, and challenges and opportunities in agent mining. Finally, we give an overview of the papers in this special issue.

A unique feature of the framework is that it provides mechanisms to allow agents to negotiate so as to improve an initial cluster configuration. The framework encourages a two phase approach to clustering. During the first phase clustering agents bid for records in the input data and form an initial cluster configuration. In the second phase (the negotiation phase) agents pass individual records to each other so as to improve the initial configuration. The communication framework and its operation is fully described in terms of the performatives used and from an algorithmic perspective. The reported evaluation was conducted using benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that the supported agent negotiation produces enhanced clustering results.

Behavioral event data and their analysis	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Social data; Event data		Social science is broadly defined as the analysis of human behavior whether it be at an individual or a group level. In this work, we explore the analysis of human behavior encoded as a trail of their events over time and space, which we refer to as behavioral event data. We show that such data offers challenges to data mining algorithm designers as the data to analyze is naturally multi-way, involves complex patterns that form/reform over time, and has complex interactions between groups in the population. Though the data naturally lends itself to be represented as graphs and tensors we show how existing techniques are limited in their usefulness and outline our own algorithms to overcome these challenges. In this paper, using the adversarial event behavior of blue and red forces, we show three core problems and solutions in event behavior analysis: (1) Decomposing behavior to identify areas of intense activity, (2) Predicting what groups of events are likely to occur, and (3) Analysis to identify interacting behavior given a known template.

A GMDH polynomial neural network-based method to predict approximate three-dimensional structures of polypeptides	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Artificial Neural Networks; Protein Structure Prediction; Group Method of Data Handling; Multilayer Perceptron	PROTEIN-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; GLOBULAR-PROTEINS; DATA-BANK; CHANNEL; FOLD; RECOGNITION; REFINEMENT; SIMULATION; PATTERNS	Tertiary Protein Structure Prediction is one of the most important problems in Structural Bioinformatics. Along the last 20 years many algorithms have been proposed as to solve this problem. However, it still remains a challenging issue because of the complexity and of the dimensionality of the protein conformational search space. In this article a first principle method which uses database information for the prediction of the 3-D structure of polypeptides is presented. The technique is based on the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) algorithm, implemented by a software tool introduced on this work. GMDH Polynomial Neural Networks have been used with success in many fields such as data mining, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition and prediction. The proposed method was tested with seven protein sequences whose sizes vary from 14 to 54 amino acid residues. Results show that the predicted tertiary structures adopt a fold similar to the experimental structures. RMSD and secondary structure analysis reveal that the proposed method present accurate results in their predictions. The predicted structures can be used as input structures in refinement methods based on molecular mechanics (MM), e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The search space is expected to be greatly reduced and the ab initio methods can demand a much reduced computational time to achieve a more accurate polypeptide structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Optical Fiber Sensors Array to Identify Beverages by Their Odor	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Array signal processing; chemical sensors; multiplexing; optical fiber sensors; remote sensing; wavelength division	ELECTRONIC NOSE; PHOTONIC SENSORS; COMPLEXES; AMPLIFICATION; REACTIVITY; NETWORKS; POLYMER; VAPORS; SINGLE; SYSTEM	Four optical fiber sensors have been grouped in an array which is able to distinguish odors of different drinks. The sensing materials employed have been deposited onto optical fibers following the electrostatic self assembly method. The responses have been characterized in terms of reflected optical power; more specifically, the dynamic range and the recovery of each device have been used to discriminate between the samples. Data mining techniques based on the combination of principal component analysis and artificial neural networks are performed. The final system is trained to distinguish between grape juice, wine, and vinegar by using a set of one hundred samples of each one. Furthermore, the array can be located at up to 6 km away from the optical header, offering the possibility of in situ measurements.

J	Fyson, N; De Bie, T; Cristianini, N				Fyson, Nick; De Bie, Tijl; Cristianini, Nello			The NETCOVER algorithm for the reconstruction of causal networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Machine learning; Network inference; Data mining; Complex systems; Minimum Description Length; Twitter		We present the NECOVER algorithm, a method for the reconstruction of networks based on the order of nodes visited by a stochastic branching process. Our algorithm reconstructs a network of minimal size that ensures consistency with the data, and we verify performance on both synthetic and real-world data. We show that, crucially, the neighbourhood of each node may be inferred in turn, with global consistency between network and data achieved through purely local considerations. The resulting optimisation problem for each node can be reduced to a set covering problem, which though NP-hard can be approximated well in practice. We provide theoretical bounds on the performance of the algorithm, before describing an extension to account for noisy data, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. We first demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on synthetic data, generated by an SIR-like epidemiological model. Finally we test our approach on data gathered from the social networking site Twitter, demonstrating that we can extract the underlying social graph by analysing only the content of individual user feeds.

J	Gold, DL				Gold, David L.			Restoring coverage to the Bayesian false discovery rate control procedure	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						False discovery rate; Bayesian; Composite hypothesis; Multiple testing	MICROARRAY	Principal among knowledge discovery tasks is recognition of insightful patterns or features from data that can inform otherwise challenging decisions. For the costly future decisions, there is little room for error. Features must provide substantial evidence to be robust for classification and dependable for important decisions. Here we seek statistical evidence for feature selection, that feature signals are of sufficient magnitude and frequency to be generalizable for classification. The Bayesian false discovery rate (bFDR) error control procedure is powerfully suited for this task. In realistic situations often encountered in practice, the bFDR procedure is biased, yielding a greater than desired FDR. In other less typical cases, the FDR is less than desired. We investigate the sources of bias in the bFDR procedure, and predict the direction of bias. A new algorithm has been developed to recover the bias in the bFDR control procedure. In simulation and real data mining examples, the new bFDR control algorithm shows promise. The strengths and limitations of the new approach are presented with examples and discussed.

J	Huang, CJ; Chen, PW; Pan, WT				Huang, Chien-Jen; Chen, Peng-Wen; Pan, Wen-Tsao			Using multi-stage data mining technique to build forecast model for Taiwan stocks	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Genetic programing; Grey model neural network; Artificial fish swarm algorithm; Arithmetic expressions	OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS	Taiwan stock market trend is fast changing. It is affected by not only the individual investors and the three major institutional investors, but also impacted by domestic political and economic situations. Therefore, to precisely grasp the stock market movement, one must build a perfect stock forecast model. In this article, we used a multi-stage optimized stock forecast model to grasp the changing trend of the stock market. First, data of 2 stocks, TSMC and UMC were collected, and then inputted the test data into the genetic programing and built a model to find out the arithmetic expressions. Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm is used to dynamically adjust the variable factors and constant factors in the arithmetic expressions. Next, we took the error term (epsilon) in arithmetic expressions to Gray Model Neural Network to make the forecast. Finally, we used the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm to dynamically adjust the parameters of the Gray Model Neural Network to enhance the precision of the stock forecast model as a whole. The result showed that the forecast capability of each stage after the optimization process is better than that of its previous stage, and the mixed stock forecast model (GP-AFSA+GMNN-AFSA) in stage 4 greatly enhanced the precision of the forecast.

J	Isola, R; Carvalho, R; Tripathy, AK				Isola, Rahul; Carvalho, Rebeck; Tripathy, Amiya Kumar			Knowledge Discovery in Medical Systems Using Differential Diagnosis, LAMSTAR, and k-NN	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining; differential diagnosis; knowledge discovery; medical decision support system; neural networks; service-oriented architecture (SOA)	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORK; FUTURE	Medical data are an ever-growing source of information generated from the hospitals in the form of patient records. When mined properly, the information hidden in these records is a huge resource bank for medical research. As of now, these data are mostly used only for clinical work. These data often contain hidden patterns and relationships, which can lead to better diagnosis, better medicines, better treatment, and overall, a platform to better understand the mechanisms governing almost all aspects of the medical domain. Unfortunately, discovery of these hidden patterns and relationships often goes unexploited. However, there is on-going research in medical diagnosis which can predict the diseases of the heart, lungs, and various tumours based on the past data collected from the patients. They are mostly limited to domain-specific systems that predict diseases restricted to their area of operation like heart, brain, and various other domains. These are not applicable to the whole medical dataset. The system proposed in this paper uses this vast storage of information so that diagnosis based on these historical data can be made. It focuses on computing the probability of occurrence of a particular ailment from the medical data by mining it using a unique algorithm which increases accuracy of such diagnosis by combining the key points of neural networks, Large Memory Storage, and Retrieval, k-NN, and differential diagnosis all integrated into one single algorithm. The system uses a service-oriented architecture wherein the system components of diagnosis, information portal, and other miscellaneous services are provided. This algorithm can be used in solving a few common problems that are encountered in automated diagnosis these days, which include diagnosis of multiple diseases showing similar symptoms, diagnosis of a person suffering from multiple diseases, receiving faster and more accurate second opinion, and faster identification of trends present in the medical records.

Clustering daily patterns of human activities in the city	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Human activity; Eigen decomposition; Daily activity clustering; Metropolitan area; Statistical learning	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; HUMAN MOBILITY; TIME; MODEL; VALIDATION; GENDER; SYSTEM; SPACE	Data mining and statistical learning techniques are powerful analysis tools yet to be incorporated in the domain of urban studies and transportation research. In this work, we analyze an activity-based travel survey conducted in the Chicago metropolitan area over a demographic representative sample of its population. Detailed data on activities by time of day were collected from more than 30,000 individuals (and 10,552 households) who participated in a 1-day or 2-day survey implemented from January 2007 to February 2008. We examine this large-scale data in order to explore three critical issues: (1) the inherent daily activity structure of individuals in a metropolitan area, (2) the variation of individual daily activities-how they grow and fade over time, and (3) clusters of individual behaviors and the revelation of their related socio-demographic information. We find that the population can be clustered into 8 and 7 representative groups according to their activities during weekdays and weekends, respectively. Our results enrich the traditional divisions consisting of only three groups (workers, students and non-workers) and provide clusters based on activities of different time of day. The generated clusters combined with social demographic information provide a new perspective for urban and transportation planning as well as for emergency response and spreading dynamics, by addressing when, where, and how individuals interact with places in metropolitan areas.

First, we use the K-mean algorithm to classify historical load data by season into four patterns. Second, we use the k-NN algorithm to divide the classified data into four patterns for Mondays, other weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The classified data are used to develop a time series forecasting model. We then forecast the hourly load on weekdays and weekends, excluding special holidays. The historical load data are used as inputs for load forecasting. We compare our results with the KEPCO hourly record for 2008 and conclude that our approach is effective.

Though some approaches have been proposed in the last several years, the practical balance between their required computation amount and obtained accuracy are insufficient for some class of the relation estimation. The objective of this paper is to formalize a problem to quickly and efficiently estimate missing relations among objects from the other known relations among the objects and to propose techniques called "PSD Estimation" and "Row Reduction" for the estimation problem. This technique uses a characteristic of the relations named "Positive Semi-Definiteness (PSD)" and a special assumption for known relations in a matrix. The superior performance of our approach in both efficiency and accuracy is demonstrated through an evaluation based on artificial and real-world data sets.

We applied the data mining approach in data from 1140 children (9-13 years), in order to derive dietary habits related to children's obesity status. Rules emerged via data mining approach revealed the detrimental influence of the increased consumption of soft dinks, delicatessen meat, sweets, fried and junk food. For example, frequent (3-5 times/week) consumption of all these foods increases the risk for being obese by 75%, whereas in children who have a similar dietary pattern, but eat > 2 times/week fish and seafood the risk for obesity is reduced by 33%. In conclusion patterns revealed from data mining technique refer to specific groups of children and demonstrate the effect on the risk associated with obesity status when a single dietary habit might be modified. Thus, a more individualized approach when translating public health messages could be achieved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, G; Wang, YD				Li, Guang; Wang, Yadong			A Privacy-Preserving Classification Method Based on Singular Value Decomposition	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Privacy preservation; data mining; SVD; sample selection		With the development of data mining technologies, privacy protection has become a challenge for data mining applications in many fields. To solve this problem, many privacy-preserving data mining methods have been proposed. One important type of such methods is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The SVD-based method provides perturbed data instead of original data, and users extract original data patterns from perturbed data. The original SVD-based method perturbs all samples to the same degree. However, in reality, different users have different requirements for privacy protection, and different samples are not equally important for data mining. Thus, it is better to perturb different samples to different degrees. This paper improves the SVD-based data perturbation method so that it can perturb different samples to different degrees. In addition, we propose a new privacy-preserving classification mining method using our improved SVD-based perturbation method and sample selection. The experimental results indicate that compared with the original SVD-based method, this new proposed method is more efficient in balancing data privacy and data utility.

However, because the assumptions of traditional parametric SRGMs (PSRMs) are usually not consistent with the real conditions, the prediction accuracy of PSRMs are hence not very satisfying in most cases. In contrast to PSRMs, the non-parametric SRGMs (NPSRMs) which use machine learning (ML) techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and genetic programming (GP), for reliability modeling can provide better prediction results across various projects. Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which is a new evolutionary algorithm based on Genetic algorithm (GA) and GP, has been acknowledged as a powerful ML and widely used in the field of data mining. Thus, we apply GEP into non-parametric software reliability modeling in this paper due to its unique and pretty characters, such as genetic encoding method, translation process of chromosomes. This new GEP-based modeling approach considers some important characters of reliability modeling in several main components of GEP, i.e. function set, terminal criteria, fitness function, and then obtains the final NPSRM (GEP-NPSRM) by training on failure data. Finally, on several real failure data-sets based on time or coverage, four case studies are proposed by respectively comparing GEP-NPSRM with several representative PSRMs, NPSRMs based on ANN, SVM and GP in the form of fitting and prediction power which show that compared with the comparison models, the GEP-NPSRM provides a significantly better power of reliability fitting and prediction. In other words, the GEP is promising and effective for reliability modeling. So far as we know, it is the first time that GEP is applied into constructing NPSRM.

Characterizing the frequency of repeated citations: The effects of journal, subject area, and self-citation	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						citation; Multiple mentions; Document search; Self-citation	IMPACT FACTOR; INFORMATION; INDEX	Previous studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the relevance of a citing document is related to the number of times with which the source document is cited. Despite the ease with which electronic documents would permit the incorporation of this information into citation-based document search and retrieval systems, the possibilities of repeated citations remain untapped. Part of this under-utilization may be due to the fact that very little is known regarding the pattern of repeated citations in scholarly literature or how this pattern may vary as a function of journal, academic discipline or self-citation. The current research addresses these unanswered questions in order to facilitate the future incorporation of repeated citation information into document search and retrieval systems. Using data mining of electronic texts, the citation characteristics of nine different journals, covering the three different academic fields (economics, computing, and medicine & biology), were characterized. It was found that the frequency (f) with which a reference is cited Nor more times within a document is consistent across the sampled journals and academic fields. Self-citation causes an increase in frequency, and this effect becomes more pronounced for large N. The objectivity, automatability, and insensitivity of repeated citations to journal and discipline, present powerful opportunities for improving citation-based document search. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, TY; Cheng, YL; Ni, ZH				Liu, Tingyu; Cheng, Yalong; Ni, Zhonghua			Mining event logs to support workflow resource allocation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Workflow; Resource allocation; Data mining; Process mining; Association rules	STAFF ASSIGNMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Currently, workflow technology is widely used to facilitate the business process in enterprise information systems (EIS), and it has the potential to reduce design time, enhance product quality and decrease product cost. However, significant limitations still exist: as an important task in the context of workflow, many present resource allocation (also known as "staff assignment") operations are still performed manually, which are time-consuming. This paper presents a data mining approach to address the resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow resource management. Specifically, an Apriori-like algorithm is used to find the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a correlation measure named lift is utilized to annotate the negatively correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the rules are ranked using the confidence measures as resource allocation rules. Comparative experiments are performed using C4.5, SVM, ID3, Naive Bayes and the presented approach, and the results show that the presented approach is effective in both accuracy and candidate resource recommendations.

In this article, we present the results of a preliminary study of cyberlearning projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that address these issues. Our work demonstrates that text-mining tools can be used to partially automate the process of finding NSF's cyberlearning awards and characterizing the fine-grained topics implicit in award abstracts. The methodology we have established to assess NSF's cyberlearning investments should generalize to other areas of research and other repositories of public-access documents.

Cascading Spatio-Temporal Pattern Discovery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cascading spatiotemporal patterns; space-time K-function; cascade participation index; spatiotemporal join; spatiotemporal continuity; positive ST autocorrelation; spatiotemporal partial order	DATA SETS	Given a collection of Boolean spatiotemporal (ST) event-types, the cascading spatiotemporal pattern (CSTP) discovery process finds partially ordered subsets of these event-types whose instances are located together and occur serially. For example, analysis of crime data sets may reveal frequent occurrence of misdemeanors and drunk driving after and near bar closings on weekends, as well as after and near large gatherings such as football games. Discovering CSTPs from ST data sets is important for application domains such as public safety (e. g., identifying crime attractors and generators) and natural disaster planning, (e. g., preparing for hurricanes). However, CSTP discovery presents multiple challenges; three important ones are 1) the exponential cardinality of candidate patterns with respect to the number of event types, 2) computationally complex ST neighborhood enumeration required to evaluate the interest measure and 3) the difficulty of balancing computational complexity and statistical interpretation. Current approaches for ST data mining focus on mining totally ordered sequences or unordered subsets. In contrast, our recent work explores partially ordered patterns. Recently, we represented CSTPs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); proposed a new interest measure, the cascade participation index (CPI); outlined the general structure of a cascading spatiotemporal pattern miner (CSTPM); evaluated filtering strategies to enhance computational savings using a real-world crime data set and proposed a nested loop-based CSTPM to address the challenge posed by exponential cardinality of candidate patterns. This paper adds to our recent work by offering a new computational insight, namely, that the computational bottleneck for CSTP discovery lies in the interest measure evaluation. With this insight, we propose a new CSTPM based on spatiotemporal partitioning that significantly lowers the cost of interest measure evaluation. Analytical evaluation shows that our new CSTPM is correct and complete. Results from significant amount of new experimental evaluation with both synthetic and real data show that our new ST partitioning-based CSTPM outperforms the CSTPM from our previous work.

J	Nimmagadda, SL; Dreher, H				Nimmagadda, Shastri L.; Dreher, Heinz			On new emerging concepts of petroleum digital ecosystem	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article								Petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin is an emerging digital ecosystem. Petroleum system and its elements are narrated for each and every oil and gas field in each and every petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin. A new concept of ecosystem and its digitization are emerging within the generic petroleum system. The Significance of this concept comes with an ability to establish connectivity among petroleum subsystems, for example, Albertine Graben (Western Uganda), through attributes of their components and their contextualization and specifications. Unless the phenomenon of integration of elements and processes among subbasins in the context of digital representation, visualization, and interpretation are understood, the existence of petroleum system (both at local and global scales) and its survival, the phenomenon of interconnectivity among ecosystems cannot be well explained. Its value cannot be added in terms of petroleum accumulations and volumes, unless these phenomena are made explicit. Authors propose ontology-based data warehousing and data mining technologies in which conceptualization and contextualization of multiple data dimensions' are modeled (elements and processes of petroleum system), besides their integration (within data warehouse environment) and data mining of interpretable emerging petroleum digital ecosystem. Multidimensional data warehousing and mining facilitate an effective interpretation of petroleum ecosystems, minimizing the ambiguities involved during structure and reservoir qualifications and quantifications, especially during reserve computations.

J	Oyama, S; Hayashi, K; Kashima, H				Oyama, Satoshi; Hayashi, Kohei; Kashima, Hisashi			Link Prediction Across Time via Cross-Temporal Locality Preserving Projections	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						link prediction; temporal data; entity resolution; social network analysis; dimension reduction	MATRIX FACTORIZATION	Link prediction is the task of inferring the existence or absence of certain relationships among data objects such as identity, interaction, and collaboration. Link prediction is found in various applications in the fields of information integration, recommender systems, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. The increasing interest in dynamically changing networks has led to growing interest in a more general link prediction problem called temporal link prediction in the data mining and machine learning communities. However, only links among nodes at the same time point are considered in temporal link prediction. We propose a new link prediction problem called cross-temporal link prediction in which the links among nodes at different time points are inferred. A typical example of cross-temporal link prediction is cross-temporal entity resolution to determine the identity of real entities represented by data objects observed in different time periods. In dynamic environments, the features of data change over time, making it difficult to identify cross-temporal links by directly comparing observed data. Other examples of cross-temporal links are asynchronous communications in social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, where a message is posted in reply to a previous message. We adopt a dimension reduction approach to cross-temporal link prediction; that is, data objects in different time frames are mapped into a common low-dimensional latent feature space, and the links are identified on the basis of the distance between the data objects. The proposed method uses different low-dimensional feature projections in different time frames, enabling it to adapt to changes in the latent features over time. Using multi-task learning, it jointly learns a set of feature projection matrices from the training data, given the assumption of temporal smoothness of the projections. The optimal solutions are obtained by solving a single generalized eigenvalue problem. Experiments using a real-world set of bibliographic data for cross-temporal entity resolution and a real-world set of emails for unobserved asynchronous communication inference showed that introducing time-dependent feature projections improved the accuracy of link prediction.

Given this, it is somewhat surprising that the problem of time series clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time series clustering considers the clustering of individual time series that have been carefully extracted from their original context, for example, gene expression profiles, individual heartbeats, or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time series streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases, and in other cases shown to work only on the most contrived synthetic datasets by carefully adjusting a large set of parameters. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions that allow for the first time, the meaningful clustering of subsequences from a time series stream. First, we show that the problem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed, and a new definition is necessary. Second, we show that the minimum description length framework offers an efficient, effective, and essentially parameter-free method for time series clustering. We show that our method produces objectively correct results on a wide variety of datasets from medicine, speech recognition, zoology, gesture recognition, and industrial process analyses.

Prasad			Batch incremental processing for FP-tree construction using FP-Growth algorithm	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Incremental mining; Batch incremental processing; Sequential incremental processing; Frequent patterns; Data mining; FP-tree; FP-Growth	MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS; CANDIDATE GENERATION; ITEMSETS; DATABASES	In the present scenario of global economy and World Wide Web, large sets of evolving and distributed data can be handled efficiently by incremental data mining. Frequent patterns are very important in knowledge discovery and data mining process, such as mining of association rules, correlations. FP-tree is a very versatile data structure used for mining of frequent patterns in knowledge discovery and data mining process. FP-tree is a compact representation of transaction database that contains frequency information of all relevant frequent patterns (FP) of the database. All of the existing incremental frequent pattern mining algorithms, such as AFPIM, CATS, CanTree, CP-tree, and SPO-tree, perform incremental mining by processing one transaction of the incremental part of database at a time and updating it to the FP-tree of initial (original) database. Here, in this paper, we propose a novel method that takes advantage of FP-tree representation of incremental transaction database for incremental mining. We propose a batch incremental processing algorithm BIT_FPGrowth that restructures and merges two small consecutive duration FP-trees to obtain a FP-tree of the FP-Growth algorithm. Our BIT_FPGrowth uses FP-tree as preprocessed data repository to get transactions (i.e., item-sets), unlike other sequential incremental algorithms that read transactions from database. BIT_FPGrowth algorithm takes less time for constructing FP-tree.

Steve			MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR DETECTING PATTERNS OF MANAGEMENT FRAUD	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; financial fraud; partially adaptive models; random forests; rule ensembles; stochastic gradient boosting	GENERALIZED-T DISTRIBUTION; MODELS; CLASSIFIERS	Discovery of financial fraud has profound social consequences. Loss of stockholder value, bankruptcy, and loss of confidence in the professional audit firms have resulted from failure to detect financial fraud. Previous studies that have attempted to discover fraud patterns from publicly available information have achieved only moderate levels of success. This study explores the capabilities of recently developed statistical learning and data mining methods in an attempt to advance fraud discovery performance to levels that have potential for proactive discovery or mitigation of financial fraud. The partially adaptive methods we test have achieved success in a number of complex problem domains and are easily interpretable. Ensemble methods, which combine predictions from multiple models via boosting, bagging, or related approaches, have emerged as among the most powerful data mining and machine learning methods. Our study includes random forests, stochastic gradient boosting, and rule ensembles. The results for ensemble models show marked improvement over past efforts, with accuracy approaching levels of practical potential. In particular, rule ensembles do so while maintaining a degree of interpretability absent in the other ensemble methods.

Peculiarity factor (PF) is one of the most important concepts in POM. In this paper, it is proved that PF can accurately characterize the peculiarity of data sampled from a normal distribution. However, for a general one-dimensional distribution, it does not have the property. A local version of PF, called LPF, is proposed to solve the difficulty. LPF can effectively describe the peculiarity of data sampled from a continuous one-dimensional distribution. Based on LPF, a framework of local peculiarity oriented mining is presented, which consists of two steps, namely, peculiar data identification and peculiar data analysis. Two algorithms for peculiar data identification and a case study of peculiar data analysis are given to make the framework practical. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show their good performance.

J	Yang, Z; Yin, LH; Jin, SY; Chen, XY				Yang, Zhi; Yin, Lihua; Jin, Shuyuan; Chen, Xingyuan			Optimal mining on security labels for decentralized information flow control	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Access control; Policy description language; Constraint solving; NP-complete; Data mining; Logic programming; Genetic algorithm		Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) is a key innovation of traditional information flow control (IFC). When compared with IFC, DIFC provides new features including decentralized declassification, taint-tracking and privilege-transferring. These characteristics make DIFC more applicable than traditional IFC to the control of information flows in systems. This paper presents an optimal approach to the mining of security labels for DIFC. This approach can effectively improve DIFC's applicability and manageability in a wide variety of environments. We firstly design a novel policy description language to express security requirements in DIFC characterized assertions. Next, we prove that the problem of obtaining security labels from DIFC assertions is NP-complete. Based on logic programming and genetic algorithm, the proposed approach finally outputs optimal security labels separately for different DIFC systems in both small and large-scale environments. The objectives of this paper are to address two practical aspects of DIFC: (1) how to express security requirements by using DIFC characterized assertions; (2) how to obtain optimal DIFC labels to satisfy security requirements. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in implementing fine-grained information control according to practical security requirements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We have gathered and analysed 68,000 related on-line news articles published in 2011 in Flemish newspapers. These articles were analysed by a custom-built expert system. The results of our text mining analyses show interesting differences in media coverage and votes for several political parties and politicians. With opinion mining, we are able to automatically detect the sentiment of each article, thereby allowing to visualise how the tone of reporting evolved throughout the year, on a party, politician and newspaper level. Our suggested framework introduces a generic text mining approach to analyse media coverage on political issues, including a set of methodological guidelines, evaluation metrics, as well as open source opinion mining tools.

J	Ralha, CG; Silva, CVS				Ralha, Celia Ghedini; Sarmento Silva, Carlos Vinicius			A multi-agent data mining system for cartel detection in Brazilian government procurement	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multi-agent data mining system; Cartel detection; Brazilian government procurement; AGMI; Multi-agent; Distributed data mining; Database knowledge discovery	PARALLEL; ALGORITHM	The main focus of this research project is the problem of extracting useful information from the Brazilian federal procurement process databases used by government auditors in the process of corruption detection and prevention to identify cartel formation among applicants. Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because AGMI presented many association rules that provided a 90% correct identification of cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection, prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, SH; Huang, QM; Jiang, SQ; Tian, Q; Qin, L				Wang, Shuhui; Huang, Qingming; Jiang, Shuqiang; Tian, Qi; Qin, Lei			Nearest-neighbor method using multiple neighborhood similarities for social media data mining	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Nearest neighbor method; Multiple neighborhood similarity; Visual categorization; Locality sensitive hashing	CLASSIFICATION	Currently, Nearest-Neighbor approaches (NN) have been applied to large scale real world image data mining. However, the following three disadvantages prevent them from wider application compared to other machine learning methods: (i) the performance is inferior on small datasets; (ii) the performance will degrade for data with high dimensions; (iii) they are heavily dependent on the chosen feature and distance measure. In this paper, we try to overcome the three mentioned intrinsic weaknesses by taking the abundant and diversified content of social media images into account. Firstly, we propose a novel neighborhood similarity measure which encodes both the local density information and semantic information, thus it has better generalization power than the original image-to-image similarity. Secondly, to enhance the scalability, we adopt kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) to conduct approximated nearest neighbor search by utilizing a set of kernels calculated on several complementary image features. Finally, to enhance the robustness on diversified genres of images, we propose to fuse the discrimination power of different features by combining multiple neighborhood similarities calculated on different features/kernels with the entire retrieved nearest labeled and unlabeled image via the hashing systems. Experimental results on visual categorization on the Caltech-256 and two social media databases show the advantage of our method over traditional NN methods using the labeled data only.

The goal of this model is to classify data instances into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of classification or prediction model. Superfluous variables can also increase the costs of building a model particularly on large datasets. The feature selection and hyper-parameters optimization problem can be solved by either an exhaustive search over all parameter values or an optimization procedure that explores only a finite subset of the possible values. The objective of this research is to simultaneously optimize the hyper-parameters and feature subset without degrading the generalization performances of the induction algorithm. We present a global optimization approach based on the use of Cross-Entropy Method to solve this kind of problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In general, there are no works analysing the consequences of the presence of missing values in data in this task, although improper handling of this type of data in the analysis may introduce bias and can result in misleading conclusions being drawn from a research study. This paper presents a study on the effect of using the most relevant approaches for pre-processing of missing values in a determined group of algorithms, the evolutionary fuzzy systems for subgroup discovery.

Evolving graphs arise naturally in diverse applications such as computer network topologies, multiplayer games and medical imaging. A natural and interesting problem in evolving graph analysis is the discovery of compact subgraphs that change in a similar manner. Such subgraphs are known as regions of correlated change and they can both summarise change patterns in graphs and help identify the underlying events causing these changes. However, previous techniques for discovering regions of correlated change suffer from limited scalability, making them unsuitable for analysing the evolution of very large graphs. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called ciForager, that addresses this scalability challenge and offers considerable improvements. The efficiency of ciForager is based on the use of new incremental techniques for detecting change, as well as the use of Voronoi representations for efficiently determining distance. We experimentally show that ciForager can achieve speedups of up to 1000 times over previous approaches. As a result, it becomes feasible for the first time to discover regions of correlated change in extremely large graphs, such as the entire BGP routing topology of the Internet.

The membership functions, which critically influence the final mining results, are difficult to define. In general, multiple criteria are considered when defining membership functions. In this paper, a multi-objective genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm is proposed for extracting membership functions and association rules from quantitative transactions. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. The first one is the suitability of membership functions. It consists of the coverage factor and the overlap factor and is used to avoid two unsuitable types of membership function. The second one is the total number of large 1-itemsets from a given set of minimum support, values. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding the Pareto-front membership functions.

Since transactions in real-world applications usually consist of quantitative values, many fuzzy association-rule mining approaches have been proposed on single-or multiple-concept levels. However, the given membership functions may have a critical influence on the final mining results. In this paper, we propose a multiple-level genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm for mining membership functions and fuzzy association rules using multiple-concept levels. It first encodes the membership functions of each item class (category) into a chromosome according to the given taxonomy. The fitness value of each individual is then evaluated by the summation of large 1-itemsets of each item in different concept levels and the suitability of membership functions in the chromosome. After the GA process terminates, a better set of multiple-level fuzzy association rules can then be expected with a more suitable set of membership functions. Experimental results on a simulation dataset also show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

J	Chen, YS; Cheng, CH; Lai, CJ				Chen, You-Shyang; Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Lai, Chien-Jung			Extracting performance rules of suppliers in the manufacturing industry: an empirical study	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Performance evaluation; Manufacturing industry; SCM (Supply Chain Management); KPI (Key Performance Indicators); Data mining techniques	KNOWLEDGE	Performance evaluation of suppliers is increasingly recognized as a critical indicator in supply chain cooperation. Traditional performance evaluation methods have the problems of a simple buy/sell relation and in one's subjective views between manufacturers and suppliers, and they lack objective automatic evaluation processes in the supply chain considered. Statistical techniques used for evaluation rely on the restrictive assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables. Unfortunately, many of the common models of performance evaluation of suppliers violate these assumptions. The study proposes an integrated model by combining K-means clustering, feature selection, and the decision tree method into a single evaluation model to assess the performance of suppliers and simultaneously tackles the above-mentioned shortcomings. The integrated model is illustrated with an empirical case study of a manufacturer for an original design manufacturer (ODM) to demonstrate the model performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms listed methods in terms of accuracy, and three redundant attributes can be eliminated from the empirical case. Furthermore, the extracted rules by the decision tree C4.5 algorithm form an automatic knowledge system for supplier performance evaluation.

PUCK: an automated prompting system for smart environments: toward achieving automated prompting-challenges involved	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Automated prompting; Prompting systems; Smart environments; Machine learning; Imbalanced class distribution	IMPAIRMENT; PEOPLE; MEMORY	The growth in popularity of smart environments has been quite steep in the last decade and so has the demand for smart health assistance systems. A smart home-based prompting system can enhance these technologies to deliver in-home interventions to users for timely reminders or brief instructions describing the way a task should be carried out for successful completion. This technology is in high demand given the desire of people who have physical or cognitive limitations to live independently in their homes. In this paper, with the introduction of the "PUCK" prompting system, we take an approach to automate prompting-based interventions without any predefined rule sets or user feedback. Unlike other approaches, we use simple off-the-shelf sensors and learn the timing for prompts based on real data that are collected with volunteer participants in our smart home test bed. The data mining approaches taken to solve this problem come with the challenge of an imbalanced class distribution that occurs naturally in the data. We propose a variant of an existing sampling technique, SMOTE, to deal with the class imbalance problem. To validate the approach, a comparative analysis with cost-sensitive learning is performed.

J	Julie, MD; Kannan, B				Julie, M. David; Kannan, Balakrishnan			Attribute reduction and missing value imputing with ANN: prediction of learning disabilities	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Closest fit; Data mining; Learning disability; Multilayer perceptron		Learning disability (LD) is a neurological condition that affects a child's brain and impairs his ability to carry out one or many specific tasks. LD affects about 10% of children enrolled in schools. There is no cure for learning disabilities and they are lifelong. The problems of children with specific learning disabilities have been a cause of concern to parents and teachers for some time. Just as there are many different types of LDs, there are a variety of tests that may be done to pinpoint the problem The information gained from an evaluation is crucial for finding out how the parents and the school authorities can provide the best possible learning environment for child. This paper proposes a new approach in artificial neural network (ANN) for identifying LD in children at early stages so as to solve the problems faced by them and to get the benefits to the students, their parents and school authorities. In this study, we propose a closest fit algorithm data preprocessing with ANN classification to handle missing attribute values. This algorithm imputes the missing values in the preprocessing stage. Ignoring of missing attribute values is a common trend in all classifying algorithms. But, in this paper, we use an algorithm in a systematic approach for classification, which gives a satisfactory result in the prediction of LD. It acts as a tool for predicting the LD accurately, and good information of the child is made available to the concerned.	[Julie, M.

Using WCE physicians can examine the digestive tract in a minimum invasive way searching for pathological abnormalities such as bleeding, polyps, ulcers and Crohn's disease. In order for WCE to be more effective for gastroenterologists, engineers have developed software methods to automatically detect these diseases at high successful rate. Using proposed a synergistic methodology for automatic discovering polyps (protrusions) and ulcers in WCE video frames, a data mining approach is used that offers useful information about ulcers, polyps and normal tissues and their visual similarities. Finally, results of the methodology are given and statistical comparisons are also presented relevant to other works.

J	Lee, SS; Lin, JC				Lee, Suiang-Shyan; Lin, Ja-Chen			An accelerated K-means clustering algorithm using selection and erasure rules	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						K-means clustering; Acceleration; Vector quantization; Selection; Erasure		The K-means method is a well-known clustering algorithm with an extensive range of applications, such as biological classification, disease analysis, data mining, and image compression. However, the plain K-means method is not fast when the number of clusters or the number of data points becomes large. A modified K-means algorithm was presented by Fahim et al. (2006). The modified algorithm produced clusters whose mean square error was very similar to that of the plain K-means, but the execution time was shorter. In this study, we try to further increase its speed. There are two rules in our method: a selection rule, used to acquire a good candidate as the initial center to be checked, and an erasure rule, used to delete one or many unqualified centers each time a specified condition is satisfied. Our clustering results are identical to those of Fahim et al. (2006). However, our method further cuts computation time when the number of clusters increases. The mathematical reasoning used in our design is included.

J	Liao, WC; Hsu, CC				Liao, Wen-Chung; Hsu, Chung-Chian			A self-organizing map for transactional data and the related categorical domain	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Self-organizing map (SOM); Transactional data; Categorical data; Mixed data; Data visualization; Distance measure; Tree-growing adaptation	STRUCTURE VISUALIZATION; DATA PROJECTION; SYMBOL STRINGS; MIXED DATA; ALGORITHM	After projecting high dimensional data into a two-dimension map via the SOM, users can easily view the inner structure of the data on the 2-D map. In the early stage of data mining, it is useful for any kind of data to inspect their inner structure. However, few studies apply the SOM to transactional data and the related categorical domain, which are usually accompanied with concept hierarchies. Concept hierarchies contain information about the data but are almost ignored in such researches. This may cause mistakes in mapping. In this paper, we propose an extended SOM model, the SOMCD, which can map the varied kinds of data in the categorical domain into a 2-D map and visualize the inner structure on the map. By using tree structures to represent the different kinds of data objects and the neurons' prototypes, a new devised distance measure which takes information embedded in concept hierarchies into consideration can properly find the similarity between the data objects and the neurons. Besides the distance measure, we base the SOMCD on a tree-growing adaptation method and integrate the U-Matrix for visualization. Users can hierarchically separate the trained neurons on the SOMCD's map into different groups and cluster the data objects eventually.

J	Liu, DR; Lai, CH; Chen, YT				Liu, Duen-Ren; Lai, Chin-Hui; Chen, Ya-Ting			Document recommendations based on knowledge flows: A hybrid of personalized and group-based approaches	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; collaborative filtering	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; MODEL; SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; DISCOVERY; WEB	Recommender systems can mitigate the information overload problem and help workers retrieve knowledge based on their preferences. In a knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge workers need to access task-related codified knowledge (documents) to perform tasks. A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow (KF) to represent the evolution of his or her information needs over time. Document recommendation methods can proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs. However, most traditional recommendation methods do not consider workers KFs or the information needs of the majority of a group of workers with similar KFs. A group's needs may partially reflect the needs of an individual worker that cannot be inferred from his or her past referencing behavior. In other words, the group's knowledge complements that of the individual worker. Thus, we leverage the group perspective to complement the personal perspective by using hybrid approaches, which combine the KF-based group recommendation method (KFGR) with traditional personalized-recommendation methods. The proposed hybrid methods achieve a trade-off between the group-based and personalized methods by exploiting the strengths of both. The results of our experiment show that the proposed methods can enhance the quality of recommendations made by traditional methods.

J	Ma, XL; Wang, YH; Chen, F; Liu, JF				Ma, Xiao-lei; Wang, Yin-hai; Chen, Feng; Liu, Jian-feng			Transit smart card data mining for passenger origin information extraction	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Transit smart card; Automated fare collection (AFC); Bayesian decision tree; Markov chain; Origin inference	FARE-COLLECTION SYSTEM; DESTINATION ESTIMATION; NETWORKS	The automated fare collection (AFC) system, also known as the transit smart card (SC) system, has gained more and more popularity among transit agencies worldwide. Compared with the conventional manual fare collection system, an AFC system has its inherent advantages in low labor cost and high efficiency for fare collection and transaction data archival. Although it is possible to collect highly valuable data from transit SC transactions, substantial efforts and methodologies are needed for extracting such data because most AFC systems are not initially designed for data collection. This is true especially for the Beijing AFC system, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) on a flat-rate bus is not recorded on the check-in scan. To extract passengers' origin data from recorded SC transaction information, a Markov chain based Bayesian decision tree algorithm is developed in this study. Using the time invariance property of the Markov chain, the algorithm is further optimized and simplified to have a linear computational complexity. This algorithm is verified with transit vehicles equipped with global positioning system (GPS) data loggers. Our verification results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is effective in extracting transit passengers' origin information from SC transactions with a relatively high accuracy. Such transit origin data are highly valuable for transit system planning and route optimization.

The network structure provides an intuitive representation of uncertainty relationships and the embedded conditional probability table is used by inference algorithms in an attempt to identify documents that are relevant to the user's needs, expressed in the form of Boolean queries. Our research has been directed in constructing a probabilistic IR framework that focus on assisting users to perform Ad-hoc retrieval of documents from the various domains such as economics, news, sports, etc. Furthermore, users can integrate feedback regarding the relevance of the retrieved documents in an attempt to improve performance on upcoming requests. Towards these goals, we have expanded the traditional Bayesian network IR system and tested it on several Greek web corpora on different application domains. We have developed two different approaches with regards to the structure: a simple one, where the structure is manually provided, and an automated one, where data mining is used in order to extract the network's structure. Results have depicted competitive performance against successful IR models of different theoretical backgrounds, such as the vector space utilizing tf-idf and the probabilistic model of BM25 in terms of precision-recall curves. In order to further improve the performance of the IR system, we have implemented a novel similarity-based lemmatization framework, reducing thus the ambiguity posed by the plethora of morphological variations of the languages in question. The employed lemmatization framework comprises of 3 core components (i.e. the word segregation, the data cleansing and the lemmatization modules) and is language-independent (i.e. can be applied to other languages with morphological peculiarities and thus improve Ad-hoc retrieval) since it achieves the mapping of an input word to its normalized form by employing two state-of-the-art language independent distance metric models, meaning the Levenshtein Edit distance and the Dice coefficient similarity measure, combined with a language model describing the most frequent inflectional suffixes of the examined language. Experimental results support our claim on the significance of this incorporation to Greek texts web retrieval as results improve by a factor of 4% to 11%.

We handle the failure prediction problem as a simple data-mining task on DGA samples, optionally exploiting the transformer's age, nominal power and voltage, and consider two approaches: 1) binary classification and 2) regression of the time to failure. We propose a simple logarithmic transform to preprocess DGA data in order to deal with long-tail distributions of concentrations. We have reviewed and evaluated 15 standard statistical machine-learning algorithms on that task, and reported quantitative results on a small but published set of power transformers and on proprietary data from thousands of network transformers of a utility company. Our results confirm that nonlinear decision functions, such as neural networks, support vector machines with Gaussian kernels, or local linear regression can theoretically provide slightly better performance than linear classifiers or regressors.

J	Quanz, B; Huan, J; Mishra, M				Quanz, Brian; Huan, Jun (Luke); Mishra, Meenakshi			Knowledge Transfer with Low-Quality Data: A Feature Extraction Issue	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge transfer; transfer learning; feature extraction; sparse coding; low-quality data	ADAPTATION	Effectively utilizing readily available auxiliary data to improve predictive performance on new modeling tasks is a key problem in data mining. In this research, the goal is to transfer knowledge between sources of data, particularly when ground-truth information for the new modeling task is scarce or is expensive to collect where leveraging any auxiliary sources of data becomes a necessity. Toward seamless knowledge transfer among tasks, effective representation of the data is a critical but yet not fully explored research area for the data engineer and data miner. Here, we present a technique based on the idea of sparse coding, which essentially attempts to find an embedding for the data by assigning feature values based on subspace cluster membership. We modify the idea of sparse coding by focusing the identification of shared clusters between data when source and target data may have different distributions. In our paper, we point out cases where a direct application of sparse coding will lead to a failure of knowledge transfer. We then present the details of our extension to sparse coding, by incorporating distribution distance estimates for the embedded data, and show that the proposed algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of the sparse coding algorithm on synthetic data and achieve improved predictive performance on a real world chemical toxicity transfer learning task.

Unsupervised feature relevance analysis applied to improve ECG heartbeat clustering	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Electrocardiogram analysis; Feature selection; Relevance analysis; Heartbeat classification; Q-alpha algorithm	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; MORPHOLOGY; ACCURACY; SIGNALS	The computer-assisted analysis of biomedical records has become an essential tool in clinical settings. However, current devices provide a growing amount of data that often exceeds the processing capacity of normal computers. As this amount of information rises, new demands for more efficient data extracting methods appear. This paper addresses the task of data mining in physiological records using a feature selection scheme. An unsupervised method based on relevance analysis is described. This scheme uses a least-squares optimization of the input feature matrix in a single iteration. The output of the algorithm is a feature weighting vector. The performance of the method was assessed using a heartbeat clustering test on real ECG records. The quantitative cluster validity measures yielded a correctly classified heartbeat rate of 98.69% (specificity), 85.88% (sensitivity) and 95.04% (general clustering performance), which is even higher than the performance achieved by other similar ECG clustering studies. The number of features was reduced on average from 100 to 18, and the temporal cost was a 43% lower than in previous ECG clustering schemes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The new technique is designated to continuously and automatically detect quality drifts on various manufacturing processes and then induce the common root cause. The proposed technique consists of a fast, incremental algorithm that can process extremely high dimensional data and handle more than one root-cause at the same time. Application of such a methodology consists of an on-line machine learning system that investigates and monitors the behavior of manufacturing product routes.

Evaluation of an integrated Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining process model	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Evaluation; Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDDM) process models; CRISP-DM; IKDDM; Analytical testing		Data Mining projects are implemented by following the knowledge discovery process. This process is highly complex and iterative in nature and comprises of several phases, starting off with business understanding, and followed by data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment or implementation. Each phase comprises of several tasks. Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDDM) process models are meant to provide prescriptive guidance towards the execution of the end-to-end knowledge discovery process, i.e. such models prescribe how exactly each one of the tasks in a Data Mining project can be implemented. Given this role, the quality of the process model used, affects the effectiveness and efficiency with which the knowledge discovery process can be implemented and therefore the outcome of the overall Data Mining project. This paper presents the results of the rigorous evaluation of the Integrated Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (IKDDM) process model and compares it to the CRISP-DM process model. Results of statistical tests confirm that the IKDDM leads to more effective and efficient implementation of the knowledge discovery process. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since the 1970s, many mathematical and statistical researchers have proposed prediction models on such issues. Given the recent vigorous growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining techniques, many researchers have begun to apply those techniques to the problem of bankruptcy prediction. Among these techniques, the support vector machine (SVM) has been applied successfully and obtained good performance with other AI and statistical method comparisons. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been increasingly employed in conjunction with AI techniques and has provided reliable optimization capability. However, researches addressing PSO and SVM integration are scarce, although there is great potential for useful applications in this field. This paper proposes an adaptive inertia weight (AIW) method for improving PSO performance and integrates SVM in two aspects: feature subset selection and parameter optimization. The experiments collected 54 listed companies as initial samples from American bank datasets. The proposed adaptive PSO-SVM approach could be a more suitable methodology for predicting potential financial distress. This approach also proves its capability to handle scalable and non-scalable function problems.

The rules obtained by some previous works based on support and confidence measures might be redundant to a certain degree. This paper thus proposes the concept of most generalization association rules (MGARs), which are more compact than the three previous rule types that include traditional association rules, non-redundant association rules and minimal non-redundant association rules. Some theorems relating to the properties of MGARs are derived as well, and an algorithm based on the theorems for effectively pruning unpromising rules early is then proposed. Hash tables are used to check whether the generated rules are redundant or not. Experimental results show that the number of MGARs generated from a database is much smaller than that of non-redundant association rules and that of minimal non-redundant association rules.

J	Xi, RB; Lin, N; Chen, YX; Kim, YJ				Xi, Ruibin; Lin, Nan; Chen, Yixin; Kim, Youngjin			Compression and aggregation of Bayesian estimates for data intensive computing	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian estimation; Data cubes; OLAP; Stream data mining; Compression; Aggregation	EM ALGORITHM; DATA STREAMS; REGRESSION; CUBES	Bayesian estimation is a major and robust estimator for many advanced statistical models. Being able to incorporate prior knowledge in statistical inference, Bayesian methods have been successfully applied in many different fields such as business, computer science, economics, epidemiology, genetics, imaging, and political science. However, due to its high computational complexity, Bayesian estimation has been deemed difficult, if not impractical, for large-scale databases, stream data, data warehouses, and data in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel compression and aggregation schemes (C&A) that enables distributed, parallel, or incremental computation of Bayesian estimates. Assuming partitioning of a large dataset, the C&A scheme compresses each partition into a synopsis and aggregates the synopsis into an overall Bayesian estimate without accessing the raw data. Such a C&A scheme can find applications in OLAP for data cubes, stream data mining, and cloud computing. It saves tremendous computing time since it processes each partition only once, enabling fast incremental update, and allows parallel processing. We prove that the compression is asymptotically lossless in the sense that the aggregated estimator deviates from the true model by an error that is bounded and approaches to zero when the data size increases. The results show that the proposed C&A scheme can make feasible OLAP of Bayesian estimates in a data cube. Further, it supports real-time Bayesian analysis of stream data, which can only be scanned once and cannot be permanently retained. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our method can dramatically save time and space costs with almost no degradation of the modeling accuracy.

For cost and performance reasons, processing is typically done on large clusters of tens of thousands of commodity machines. Such massive data analysis on large clusters presents new opportunities and challenges for developing a highly scalable and efficient distributed computation system that is easy to program and supports complex system optimization to maximize performance and reliability. In this paper, we describe a distributed computation system, Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution (Scope), targeted for this type of massive data analysis. Scope combines benefits from both traditional parallel databases and MapReduce execution engines to allow easy programmability and deliver massive scalability and high performance through advanced optimization. Similar to parallel databases, the system has a SQL-like declarative scripting language with no explicit parallelism, while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters. An optimizer is responsible for converting scripts into efficient execution plans for the distributed computation engine. A physical execution plan consists of a directed acyclic graph of vertices. Execution of the plan is orchestrated by a job manager that schedules execution on available machines and provides fault tolerance and recovery, much like MapReduce systems. Scope is being used daily for a variety of data analysis and data mining applications over tens of thousands of machines at Microsoft, powering Bing, and other online services.

Using association rules has proved to be a good approach for classification. In this paper, we propose an accurate classifier based on class association rules (CARs), called CAR-IC, which introduces a new pruning strategy for mining CARS, which allows building specific rules with high confidence. Moreover, we propose and prove three propositions that support the use of a confidence threshold for computing rules that avoids ambiguity at the classification stage. This paper also presents a new way for ordering the set of CARS based on rule size and confidence. Finally, we define a new coverage strategy, which reduces the number of non-covered unseen-transactions during the classification stage. Results over several datasets show that CAR-IC beats the best classifiers based on CARS reported in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose efficient and effective sequential-scan algorithms for higher-order Voronoi diagram districting. We extend the distance transform algorithm to include complex primitives (point, line, and area), Minkowski metrics, different weights and obstacles for higher-order Voronoi diagrams. The algorithm implementation is explained along with efficiencies and error. Finally, a case study based on trade area modeling is described to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithms.

Fast feature selection aimed at high-dimensional data via hybrid-sequential-ranked searches	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Feature ranking; Classification; Data mining	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; RELEVANCE; CANCER	We address the feature subset selection problem for classification tasks. We examine the performance of two hybrid strategies that directly search on a ranked list of features and compare them with two widely used algorithms, the fast correlation based filter (FCBF) and sequential forward selection (SFS). The proposed hybrid approaches provide the possibility of efficiently applying any subset evaluator, with a wrapper model included, to large and high-dimensional domains. The experiments performed show that our two strategies are competitive and can select a small subset of features without degrading the classification error or the advantages of the strategies under study.

The irrelevant features may seriously deteriorate the learning performance. Hence feature selection which aims to select the most informative features from the original dataset plays an important role in data mining, image recognition and microarray data analysis. In this paper, we developed a new feature selection technique based on the recently developed graph embedding framework for manifold learning. We first show that the recently developed feature scores such as Linear Discriminant Analysis score and Marginal Fisher Analysis score can be seen as a direct application of the graph preserving criterion. And then, we investigate the negative influence brought by the large noise features and propose two recursive feature elimination (RFE) methods based on feature score and subset level score, respectively, for identifying the optimal feature subset. The experimental results both on toy dataset and real-world dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ability to conduct a voice of the customer analysis, which could be gained through direct and indirect questioning, will enable engineers and other decision makers to successfully understand customer needs, wants, perceptions, and preferences. The information obtained from the customers is then translated into critical targets that will be used to ultimately satisfy the customer requirements. During this research project, different forms of customer input, including qualitative and quantitative data, were transformed to a common data format to develop a correlation between design input requirements and product/service outputs. We have developed a new method for measuring customer satisfaction ratio (CSR) by considering the following: mining both textual and quantitative data, multiple design parameters, mapping output on a scale of 0-1, and a decision template for means of measure. Previous measures of CSR fail to incorporate the cost implication of fixing customer complaints/issues; however, we include this important and unique measure in our research. The implication of this research will reduce Things Gone Wrong (TGW's) and engineering development time and will achieve improvements in JD Power ratings, quality perception, marketing tools, and customer satisfaction.

J	Aidos, H; Fred, A				Aidos, Helena; Fred, Ana			Statistical modeling of dissimilarity increments for d-dimensional data: Application in partitional clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Dissimilarity increments; Partitional clustering; Likelihood-ratio test; Minimum description length; Gaussian mixture decomposition	MIXTURE-MODELS; ALGORITHM; CRITERION; ENTROPY	This paper addresses the use of high order dissimilarity models in data mining problems. We explore dissimilarities between triplets of nearest neighbors, called dissimilarity increments (DIs). We derive a statistical model of DIs for d-dimensional data (d-DID) assuming that the objects follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Empirical evidence shows that the d-DID is well approximated by the particular case d=2. We propose the application of this model in clustering, with a partitional algorithm that uses a merge strategy on Gaussian components. Experimental results, in synthetic and real datasets, show that clustering algorithms using DID usually outperform well known clustering algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Instead of using these repositories as record-keeping ones, we need to transform them into active repositories that can guide the decision processes inside the company. By MSRs with several data mining algorithms, effective software fault prediction models can be built and error-prone modules can be detected prior to the testing phase. We discuss numerous real-world challenges in building accurate fault prediction models and present some solutions to these challenges. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Catania, CA; Garino, CG				Catania, Carlos A.; Garcia Garino, Carlos			Automatic network intrusion detection: Current techniques and open issues	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMPUTER-NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SECURITY; SYSTEM; CLASSIFIERS; ANOMALIES; ENSEMBLE; DESIGN; MODEL	Automatic network intrusion detection has been an important research topic for the last 20 years. In that time, approaches based on signatures describing intrusive behavior have become the de-facto industry standard. Alternatively, other novel techniques have been used for improving automation of the intrusion detection process. In this regard, statistical methods, machine learning and data mining techniques have been proposed arguing higher automation capabilities than signature-based approaches. However, the majority of these novel techniques have never been deployed on real-life scenarios. The fact is that signature-based still is the most widely used strategy for automatic intrusion detection. In the present article we survey the most relevant works in the field of automatic network intrusion detection. In contrast to previous surveys, our analysis considers several features required for truly deploying each one of the reviewed approaches. This wider perspective can help us to identify the possible causes behind the lack of acceptance of novel techniques by network security experts. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other work has been devoted to the prediction of closing price and duration of Business-to-Business (B2B) English reverse online auctions in which goods or service providers compete with each other to win contracts by lowering offering prices with each bid, which is conducted on a virtual platform hosted on the Internet. This research designs and proposes a new methodology to predict closing prices and duration within the first few bids of the corresponding auctions based on real time bidding information rather than static auction information. In this article, we employ real time information and prediction rules to forecast the behavior of live auctions. This is in contrast to the static prediction approach that takes into consideration only information available at the beginning of an auction such as products, item features, or the seller's reputation. This simulation is based on discretized auction data derived from a B2B online auction marketplace over a two-year period. Three measurements including accuracy, coverage, and benefit are used to evaluate the methodology. Results show that after observing the first 4 bids, this methodology can predict closing prices and duration with 84.6 and 71.9% accuracy, respectively.

In this phase, we evolved an artificial life population with a new brain architecture. The agents have sufficient intelligence to discover patterns in data and to make survival decisions based on those patterns. The species uses diploid reproduction, Hebbian learning, and Kohonen self-organizing maps, in combination with novel techniques such as using pattern-rich data as the environment and framing the data analysis as a survival problem for artificial life. The first generation of agents mastered the pattern discovery task well enough to thrive. Evolution further adapted the agents to their environment by making them a little more pessimistic, and also by making their brains more efficient.

J	Deng, TQ; Yang, CD; Wang, XF				Deng, Tingquan; Yang, Chengdong; Wang, Xiaofei			A reduct derived from feature selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Attribute reduction; Feature selection; Decision systems; Rough sets; Data mining	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE; SETS	In this paper, the relationship between a selected subset of attribute set of a decision system via feature selection by an optimal algorithm and a reduct of attribute set under the meaning of Pawlak's rough set is discussed. This selected subset is considered as a solution of the optimal algorithm. It is verified that a locally optimal solution is surely not a reduct while a reduct must be a globally optimal solution. Based on these assertions, a new optimal algorithm, called blindly deleting algorithm with an inverse ordering (BDAIO), is proposed to find a real reduct of a decision information system by remedying the selected attribute subset. Several standard data sets from UCI repository are implemented showing validity of the proposal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a novel vertical data representation called N-list, which originates from an FP-tree-like coding prefix tree called PPC-tree that stores crucial information about frequent itemsets. Based on the N-list data structure, we develop an efficient mining algorithm, PrePost, for mining all frequent itemsets. Efficiency of PrePost is achieved by the following three reasons. First, N-list is compact since transactions with common prefixes share the same nodes of the PPC-tree. Second, the counting of itemsets' supports is transformed into the intersection of N-lists and the complexity of intersecting two N-lists can be reduced to O(m + n) by an efficient strategy, where m and n are the cardinalities of the two N-lists respectively. Third, PrePost can directly find frequent itemsets without generating candidate itemsets in some cases by making use of the single path property of N-list. We have experimentally evaluated PrePost against four state-of-the-art algorithms for mining frequent itemsets on a variety of real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that the PrePost algorithm is the fastest in most cases. Even though the algorithm consumes more memory when the datasets are sparse, it is still the fastest one.

Ensemble Methodology Using Multistage Learning for Improved Detection of Harmful Algal Blooms	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Ensemble methods; multistage learning; probabilistic neural network; spatiotemporal data mining	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; GULF-OF-MEXICO; KARENIA-BREVIS; TOXIC DINOFLAGELLATE; CLASSIFICATION	The available empirical remote sensing techniques for harmful algal bloom (HAB) detection are reliant on prior observations and thresholds. These techniques tend to give high false alarm rate, as they are limited in spatiotemporal contextual information and decision combination techniques. We propose a multistage learning based ensemble methodology addressing the above constraints for performance improvement of HAB detection. Machine learning-based spatiotemporal data mining approach, along with empirical relationships, is used for HAB detection in the first stage of the ensemble, to exploit the potential benefits of each individual detection technique. The decision outputs from these detection techniques are fused in the second stage using nonlinear modeling-based combination techniques unlike conventional weighted averages. The proposed ensemble methodology outperforms all of the individual members and gave a significant overall performance improvement up to 0.8632 kappa accuracy. The performance is evaluated over tenfold cross validation average and compared against various ensemble methods and combination techniques.

J	Hua, M; Pei, J				Hua, Ming; Pei, Jian			Clustering in applications with multiple data sources-A mutual subspace clustering approach	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Clustering; Multiple sources		In many applications, such as bioinformatics and cross-market customer relationship management, there are data from multiple sources jointly describing the same set of objects. An important data mining task is to find interesting groups of objects that form clusters in subspaces of the data sources jointly supported by those data sources. In this paper, we study a novel problem of mining mutual subspace clusters from multiple sources. We develop two interesting models and the corresponding methods for mutual subspace clustering. The density-based model identifies dense regions in subspaces as clusters. The bottom-up method searches for density-based mutual subspace clusters systematically from low-dimensional subspaces to high-dimensional ones. The partitioning model divides points in a data set into k exclusive clusters and a signature subspace is found for each cluster, where k is the number of clusters desired by a user. The top-down method interleaves the well-known k-means clustering procedures in multiple sources. We use experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets to report the effectiveness and the efficiency of the methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study presents a strategy for discovering fuzzy decision trees from medical databases, in particular Harbeman's Survival database and the Blood Transfusion Service Center database. Harbeman's Survival database helps doctors treat and diagnose a group of patients who show similar past medical symptoms and the Blood Transfusion Service Center database advises individuals about when to donate blood. The proposed data mining procedure involves neural network based clustering using Adaptive Resonance Theory 2 (ART2), and the extraction of fuzzy decision trees for each homogeneous cluster of data records using fuzzy set theory. Besides, another objective of this paper is to examine the effect of the number of membership functions on building decision trees. Experiments confirm that the number of erroneously clustered patterns is significantly reduced compared to other methods without preprocessing data using ART2.

EFFICIENTLY MINING HIGH AVERAGE-UTILITY ITEMSETS WITH AN IMPROVED UPPER-BOUND STRATEGY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Data mining; average-utility mining; high average-utility itemsets; upper-bound strategy; prefix concept	DISCOVERY; DATABASES; PATTERNS	Utility mining has recently been discussed in the field of data mining. A utility itemset considers both profits and quantities of items in transactions, and thus its utility value increases with increasing itemset length. To reveal a better utility effect, an average-utility measure, which is the total utility of an itemset divided by its itemset length, is proposed. However, existing approaches use the traditional average-utility upper-bound model to find high average-utility itemsets, and thus generate a large number of unpromising candidates in the mining process. The present study proposes an improved upper-bound approach that uses the prefix concept to create tighter upper bounds of average-utility values for itemsets, thus reducing the number of unpromising itemsets for mining.

An improved algorithm, I-GREEDY-E is presented based on mutual information and conditional independence tests to firstly make a draft about the real network, and then greedily explore the optimal structure in the space of equivalence classes starting from the draft. Numerical experiments show that both the BIC score and structure error have some improvement, and the number of iterations and running time are greatly reduced. Therefore the structure with highest degree of data matching can be relatively faster determined by the improved algorithm.

Semantic similarity approach is a promising avenue that addresses the problems for keyword based spam filtering model. In this paper, we propose a new method that integrates three kinds of semantic similarity approaches for spam filtering as a case study of data mining application. First, to construct a latent semantic feature space from training data with a statistical method. Second, to build a corpus based thesaurus by extracting the relationship between words based on its co-occurrence in the documents. Third, to combine the latent semantic feature space with the corpus based thesaurus. Back propagation neural network is one of the efficient approaches for classification. However, the traditional BPNN has the problems of slow learning and easy to trap into a local minimum. In this paper, we adopt an adaptive algorithm to improve the traditional BPNN that can overcome these problems. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct extensive experiments on ling-spam, PU1 and PU3 data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to achieve higher performance, especially for the combination of the hybrid semantic similarity approach and the adaptive back propagation neural network.

Mining Temporal Sequential Patterns Based on Multi-granularities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						Data Mining Algorithm; Sequential Pattern Mining; Sequential Data; Time Granularity; Temporal Patterns	GROWTH	Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem that can extract frequent subsequences from sequences. However, the times between successive items in a sequence is typically used as user-specified constraints to pre-process the input data or to prune the pattern search space. In either cases, the times cannot be used to identify item intervals of sequential patterns. In this paper, we introduce a form of multi-granularity sequence patterns, which is a sequential pattern where each transition time is annotated with multi-granularity boundary interval and average time derived from the source data rather than the user-predetermined time interval or only a typical time. Then we present a novel algorithm, MG-PrefixSpan, of multiple granularity sequential patterns based on Prefix Spank which discovers all such patterns. Empirical evaluation shows that MG-PrefixSpan scales up linearly as the size of database, and has a good scalability with respect to the length of sequence and the size of transaction.

A widely studied perturbation-based PPDM approach introduces random perturbation to individual values to preserve privacy before data are published. Previous solutions of this approach are limited in their tacit assumption of single-level trust on data miners. In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of perturbation-based PPDM to Multilevel Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our setting, the more trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can access. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to differently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may combine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the original data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such diversity attacks is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services. We address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at different trust levels. We prove that our solution is robust against diversity attacks with respect to our privacy goal. That is, for data miners who have access to an arbitrary collection of the perturbed copies, our solution prevent them from jointly reconstructing the original data more accurately than the best effort using any individual copy in the collection. Our solution allows a data owner to generate perturbed copies of its data for arbitrary trust levels on-demand. This feature offers data owners maximum flexibility.

J	Liu, HS; Frishkoff, G; Frank, R; Dou, DJ				Liu, Haishan; Frishkoff, Gwen; Frank, Robert; Dou, Dejing			Sharing and integration of cognitive neuroscience data: Metric and pattern matching across heterogeneous ERP datasets	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Schema matching; Cluster comparison; Assignment problem; Hungarian method; Neuroscience; Electrophysiology	INFORMATION; CRITERIA	In the present paper, we use data mining methods to address two challenges in the sharing and integration of data from electrophysiological (ERP) studies of human brain function. The first challenge, ERP metric matching, is to identify correspondences among distinct summary features ("metrics") in ERP datasets from different research labs. The second challenge, ERP pattern matching, is to align the ERP patterns or "components" in these datasets. We address both challenges within a unified framework. The utility of this framework is illustrated in a series of experiments using ERP datasets that are designed to simulate heterogeneities from three sources: (a) different groups of subjects with distinct simulated patterns of brain activity, (b) different measurement methods, i.e, alternative spatial and temporal metrics, and (c) different patterns, reflecting the use of alternative pattern analysis techniques. Unlike real ERP data, the simulated data are derived from known source patterns, providing a gold standard for evaluation of the proposed matching methods. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms well-known existing methods, because it utilizes cluster-based structure and thus achieves finer-grained representation of the multidimensional (spatial and temporal) attributes of ERP data.

In this paper, a novel decomposition of the target coherency matrix is proposed, that is sufficient for representing the physical characteristics of the observed medium in term of a minimum set of orientation invariant parameters. The Einstein's photon circular polarization basis is used for obtaining an orientation invariant physical interpretation of the proposed parameter set both for deterministic and random target. A generalized unsupervised classification scheme is also proposed for underlining the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition theorem for classifying random reciprocal target into 75 physically meaningful clusters. The application of the proposed decomposition theorem and classification algorithm is useful for developing of novel Remote Sensing products and Data Mining softwares for monitoring the surfaces of the Earth and the Moon.

Some evidence from mining the standard alignment tool (SAT)	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						computerized cataloging; automatic classification; data mining	OF-THE-LITERATURE; INFORMATION-SCIENCE; FRAMEWORK; RELEVANCE; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; THINKING; NOTION; MODEL	We explore the feasibility of intermediary-based crosswalking and alignment of K-12 science education standards. With the increasing availability of K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) digital library content, alignment of that content with educational standards is a significant and continuous challenge. Whereas direct, one-to-one alignment of standards is preferable but currently unsustainable in its resource demands, less resource-intensive intermediary-based alignment offers an interesting alternative. But will it work? We present the results from an experiment in which the machine-based Standard Alignment Tool (SAT)incorporated in the National Science Digital Library (NSDL)was used to collect over half a million direct alignments between standards from different standard-authoring bodies. These were then used to compute intermediary-based alignments derived from the well-known AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks and NSES standards. The results show strong variation among authoring bodies in their success at crosswalking, with the best results for those who modeled their standards on the intermediaries. The results furthermore show a strong inverse relationship between recall and precision when both intermediates were involved in the crosswalking.

J	Sohrabi, MK; Barforoush, AA				Sohrabi, Mohammad Karim; Barforoush, Ahmad Abdollahzadeh			Efficient colossal pattern mining in high dimensional datasets	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent patterns mining; Colossal patterns; Bottom-up mining; Bit matrix; High dimensional dataset	FREQUENT ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM; BITTABLEFI	'Frequent pattern mining' is considered as an important data mining problem which has been extensively studied over the last decade. There are a large number of algorithms which have been developed for frequent pattern mining on a traditional commercial dataset which usually contains a huge number of transactions besides a small number of items in each transaction. The advent of bioinformatics contributed to the development of new form of datasets - called high dimensional - which are characterized by small number of transactions and large number of items in each transaction. The running time of traditional algorithms increases exponentially with increasing average transaction length, thus these algorithms cannot be suitable for the high dimensional datasets. On the other hand, the mining algorithms on high dimensional datasets create a very large output set as result which includes small and mid-size frequent patterns which do not bear any useful information for scientists. Colossal pattern mining is described as a solution to reduce the amount of output set of mining patterns. Due to ignoring the mining of the small and mid-sized patterns, mining process speed is increased in colossal patterns mining algorithms. Therefore, only very large (colossal) patterns are extracted and mined in this approach. In this paper we represent an efficient vertical bottom up method to conduct mining of frequent colossal patterns in high dimensional datasets. In our algorithm, we use a bit matrix to compress the dataset and make it easy to use in mining process. Our experimental result shows that our algorithm attains very good mining efficiencies on various input datasets. Furthermore, our performance study shows that this algorithm outperforms substantially the best former algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This design research paper discusses the methodology and principles of the design of data summarization engine. Based on an initial analysis of requirement representations in data summarization, it proposes a generic organization of ontology for data summarization engine. Furthermore, this paper proposes a design framework for data summarization engine that uses the ontology as the fundamental structure of the interactive user-computer interface. A prototype project of ontology-based data summarization engine for summarizing the data incompleteness demonstrates the effectiveness of the design of ontology-based data summarization engine.

J	Yun, U; Shin, H; Ryu, KH; Yoon, E				Yun, Unil; Shin, Hyeonil; Ryu, Keun Ho; Yoon, EunChul			An efficient mining algorithm for maximal weighted frequent patterns in transactional databases	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Weighted frequent pattern mining; Maximal frequent pattern mining; Vertical bitmap; Prefix tree	SUPPORT CONSTRAINTS; DISCOVERY; SEARCH	In the field of data mining, there have been many studies on mining frequent patterns due to its broad applications in mining association rules, correlations, sequential patterns, constraint-based frequent patterns, graph patterns, emerging patterns, and many other data mining tasks. We present a new algorithm for mining maximal weighted frequent patterns from a transactional database. Our mining paradigm prunes unimportant patterns and reduces the size of the search space. However, maintaining the anti-monotone property without loss of information should be considered, and thus our algorithm prunes weighted infrequent patterns and uses a prefix-tree with weight-descending order. In comparison, a previous algorithm, MAFIA, exponentially scales to the longest pattern length. Our algorithm outperformed MAFIA in a thorough experimental analysis on real data. In addition, our algorithm is more efficient and scalable. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Five different models were developed and analyzed to investigate the effects of the number of neighbors, the distance function and the attribute weights on the performance of the models. For each model a modified version of the differential evolution algorithm was used to find the optimal model parameters. Moreover, two different models based on generalized regression neural network and stepwise regressions were also developed. The performances of the models were evaluated using a set of high strength concrete mix data. The results of this study indicate that the optimized models outperform those derived from the standard k nearest neighbor algorithm, and that the proposed models have a better performance in comparison to generalized regression neural network, stepwise regression and modular neural networks models.

This study investigates modeling online consumer behavior by using demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, educational status, monthly income and number of people in the family. This will provide producing more synthetic data and creating an "Artificial Database" which includes the demographics of online consumers and their purchase transactions. The model is built for online shopping based on empirical data gathered in Turkey via an online survey. Two different inference systems are used for which product group is chosen by whom has which demographic characteristics. The quality of the data, gathered exclusively for this project, allows a fine validation of the simulation results.

In many stream data mining applications, the traditional KDE methods are infeasible because of the high computational cost, processing time, and memory requirement. To reduce the time and space complexity, we propose a SOM structure in this paper to obtain well-defined data clusters to estimate the underlying probability distributions of incoming data streams. The main idea of this paper is to build a series of SOMs over the data streams via two operations, that is, creating and merging the SOM sequences. The creation phase produces the SOM sequence entries for windows of the data, which obtains clustering information of the incoming data streams. The size of the SOM sequences can be further reduced by combining the consecutive entries in the sequence based on the measure of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the probability density functions over arbitrary time periods along the data streams can be estimated using such SOM sequences. We compare SOMKE with two other KDE methods for data streams, the M-kernel approach and the cluster kernel approach, in terms of accuracy and processing time for various stationary data streams. Furthermore, we also investigate the use of SOMKE over nonstationary (evolving) data streams, including a synthetic nonstationary data stream, a real-world financial data stream and a group of network traffic data streams. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

This project uses a systematic approach of data mining analysis to build a gesture recognizer for sketched diagrams. A wide range of algorithms was tested, and those with the best performance were chosen for further tuning and analysis. Our resulting recognizer, RATA. Gesture, is an ensemble of four algorithms. We evaluated it against four popular gesture recognizers with three data sets; one of our own and two from other projects. Except for recognizer-data set pairs (e.g., PaleoSketch recognizer and PaleoSketch data set) the results show that it outperforms the other recognizers. This demonstrates the potential of this approach to produce flexible and accurate recognizers.

Development of a data mining-based analysis framework for multi-attribute construction project information	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Construction data mining; Qualitative project information acquisition; Project performance analysis; Multi-attribute survey	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; PERFORMANCE	Data mining techniques extract repeated and useful patterns from a large data set that in turn are utilized to predict the outcome of future events. The main purpose of the research presented in this paper is to investigate data mining strategies and develop an efficient framework for multi-attribute project information analysis to predict the performance of construction projects. The research team first reviewed existing data mining algorithms, applied them to systematically analyze a large project data set collected by the survey, and finally proposed a data-mining-based decision support framework for project performance prediction. To evaluate the potential of the framework, a case study was conducted using data collected from 139 capital projects and analyzed the relationship between use of information technology and project cost performance. The study results showed that the proposed framework has potential to promote fast, easy to use, interpretable, and accurate project data analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This hybrid clustering method was used to study the individual characteristics of turnover trend clusters. Using a transaction questionnaire, we studied the period of peak turnover, which occurs after the Chinese New Year, for individuals divided into various age groups. The turnover trend of technology professionals was examined in well-known Taiwanese companies. The results indicate that the high outstanding turnover trend circle was primarily caused by a lack of inner fidelity identification, leadership and management. Based on cross-verification, the clustering accuracy rate was 92.7%. This study addressed problems related to the rapid loss of key human resources and should help organizations learn how to enhance competitiveness and efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present a musical interactive system acting as a melody continuator. For each musical pattern given by the user, a new one is returned by the system which is built by using general patterns for both pitch and duration stored in its knowledge base. The latter consists of data mining rules extracted from different sets of melodies for different musical styles. The proposed system uses a new music representation scheme which treats separately pitch and duration. Also, it adopts a similarity measure initially developed for clustering categorical data. Moreover, we present experimental results, using Bach's Chorales and Jazz as test inputs, for both assessing the aesthetic quality of the proposed system and comparing it to human results.

J	Hornick, MF; Tamayo, P				Hornick, Mark F.; Tamayo, Pablo			Extending Recommender Systems for Disjoint User/Item Sets: The Conference Recommendation Problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Recommender systems; collaborative filtering; extensions to recommender systems; data mining	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; ALGORITHMS	In this paper, we describe the problem of recommending conference sessions to attendees and show how novel extensions to traditional model-based recommender systems, as suggested in Adomavicius and Tuzhilin [1], can address this problem. We introduce Recommendation Engine by CONjoint Decomposition of ITems and USers (RECONDITUS)-a technique that is an extension of preference-based recommender systems to recommend items from a new disjoint set to users from a new disjoint set. The assumption being that preferences exhibited by users with known usage behavior (e. g., past conference session attendance), which can be abstracted by projections of user and item matrices, will be similar to ones of new (different) users where the basic environment and item domain are the same (e. g., new conference). RECONDITUS requires no item ratings, but operates on observed user behavior such as past conference session attendance. The RECONDITUS paradigm consists of projections of both user and item data, and the learning of relationships in projected space. Once established, the relationships enable predicting new relationships and provide associated recommendations. The approach can encompass several traditional data mining problems where both clustering and prediction are necessary. RECONDITUS has been evaluated using data from the Oracle OpenWorld conference.

AN EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION MODEL OF DISTANCE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN UNCERTAIN OBJECTS	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						uncertain database; data mining; distance representation model	DIVERGENCE MEASURES; ALGEBRA; DATABASES	In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient computation of distance between uncertain objects. In many real life applications, data like sensor readings and weather forecasts are usually uncertain when they are collected or produced. An uncertain object has a probability distribution function (PDF) to represent the probability that it is actually located in a particular location. A fast and accurate distance computation between uncertain objects is important to many uncertain query evaluation (e.g., range queries and nearest-neighbor queries) and uncertain data mining tasks (e.g., classifications, clustering, and outlier detection). However, existing approaches involve distance computations between samples of two objects, which is very computationally intensive. On one hand, it is expensive to calculate and store the actual distribution of the possible distance values between two uncertain objects. On the other hand, the expected distance (the weighted average of the pairwise distances among samples of two uncertain objects) provides very limited information and also restricts the definitions and usefulness of queries and mining tasks. In this paper, we propose several approaches to calculate the mean of the actual distance distribution and approximate its variance. Based on these, we suggest that the actual distance distribution could be approximated using a standard distribution like Gaussian or Gamma distribution. Experiments on real data and synthetic data show that our approach produces an approximation in a very short time with acceptable accuracy (about 90%). We suggest that it is practical for the research communities to define and develop more powerful queries and data mining tasks based on the distance distribution instead of the expected distance.

Modelling stress-strain and volume change behaviour of unsaturated soils using an evolutionary based data mining technique, an incremental approach	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Unsaturated soil; Evolutionary computation; Data mining	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; ELASTOPLASTIC MODEL; POROUS-MEDIA; FRAMEWORK; DEFORMATION	Modelling of unsaturated soils has been the subject of many research works in the past few decades. A number of constitutive models have been developed to describe the complex behaviour of unsaturated soils. However, many have proven to be unable to predict all aspects of the behaviour of unsaturated soils in a unified manner. In this paper an alternative new approach is presented, based on the Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) technique. EPR is a data mining technique that generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from input test data. The capabilities of the proposed EPR-based framework in modelling of behaviour of unsaturated soils are illustrated using results from a comprehensive set of triaxial tests on samples of compacted unsaturated soils from literature. The main parameters used for modelling of the behaviour of unsaturated soils during shearing are initial water content, initial dry density, mean net stress, axial strain, suction, volumetric strain, and deviator stress. The model developed is used to predict different aspects of the behaviour of unsaturated soils for conditions not used in the model building process. The results show that the proposed approach provides a useful framework for modelling of unsaturated soils. The merits and advantages of the proposed approach are highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although most of the existing solutions provide good accuracy results, the methods are often overly complex and computationally expensive, hindering practical application. In this regard, we introduce Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) to address the problem of human action recognition. Given motion trajectories of reference points on an actor, SAX efficiently converts this time-series data to a symbolic representation. Moreover, the distance between two time series is approximated by the distance between their SAX representation, which is straight-forward and very simple. Requiring only trajectories of reference points, our method requires neither structure recovery nor silhouette extraction. The proposed method is validated on two public datasets. It has an accuracy comparable to related works and it performs well even in varying conditions, in addition to being faster compared to the existing methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The AUC has various merits, such as ease of interpretation. However, since it is class indifferent, its usefulness while dealing with highly skewed data sets is questionable. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative scalar measure to the AUC-index, the area under the Kappa curve (AUK). The proposed AUK-index compensates for the class indifference of the AUC by being sensitive to the class distribution. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for measuring classifiers' performance on skewed data sets.

J	Latiri, C; Haddad, H; Hamrouni, T				Latiri, Chiraz; Haddad, Hatem; Hamrouni, Tarek			Towards an effective automatic query expansion process using an association rule mining approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Text mining; Query expansion; Information retrieval; Association rule; Generic bases; Wilcoxon test		The steady growth in the size of textual document collections is a key progress-driver for modern information retrieval techniques whose effectiveness and efficiency are constantly challenged. Given a user query, the number of retrieved documents can be overwhelmingly large, hampering their efficient exploitation by the user. In addition, retaining only relevant documents in a query answer is of paramount importance for an effective meeting of the user needs. In this situation, the query expansion technique offers an interesting solution for obtaining a complete answer while preserving the quality of retained documents. This mainly relies on an accurate choice of the added terms to an initial query. Interestingly enough, query expansion takes advantage of large text volumes by extracting statistical information about index terms co-occurrences and using it to make user queries better fit the real information needs. In this respect, a promising track consists in the application of data mining methods to the extraction of dependencies between terms. In this paper, we present a novel approach for mining knowledge supporting query expansion that is based on association rules. The key feature of our approach is a better trade-off between the size of the mining result and the conveyed knowledge. Thus, our association rules mining method implements results from Galois connection theory and compact representations of rules sets in order to reduce the huge number of potentially useful associations. An experimental study has examined the application of our approach to some real collections, whereby automatic query expansion has been performed. The results of the study show a significant improvement in the performances of the information retrieval system, both in terms of recall and precision, as highlighted by the carried out significance testing using the Wilcoxon test.

A fuzzy clustering-based binary threshold bispectrum estimation approach	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault recognition; Fuzzy clustering; Bispectrum estimation; Bearing fault	HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; BEARING FAULT-DETECTION; INFERENCE SYSTEM; ROLLER BEARING; DECISION TREE; C-MEANS; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNALS; CLASSIFIER; EXTRACTION	A fuzzy clustering bispectrum estimation approach is proposed in this paper and applied on the rolling element bearing fault recognition. The method combines the basic higher order spectrum theory and fuzzy clustering technique in data mining. At first, all the bispectrum estimation results of the training samples and test samples are taken binarization threshold processing and turned into binary feature images. Then, the binary feature images of the training samples are used to construct object templates including kernel images and domain images. Every fault category has one object templates. At last, by calculating the distances between test samples' binary feature images and the different object templates, the object classification and pattern recognition can be effectively accomplished. Bearing is the most important and much easier to be damaged component in rotating machinery. Furthermore, there exist large amounts of noise jamming and nonlinear coupling components in bearing vibration signals. Higher Order Cumulants, which can quantitatively describe the nonlinear characteristic signals with close relationship between the mechanical faults, are introduced in this paper to de-noise the raw bearing vibration signals and obtain the bispectrum estimation pictures. At last, the rolling bearing fault diagnosis experiment results showed that the classification was completely correct.	[Liu, W. Y.; Han, J.

Indeed, documents are often so large that the data set returned as answer to a query may be too big to convey interpretable knowledge. In this paper, we describe an approach based on Tree-Based Association Rules (TARs): mined rules, which provide approximate, intensional information on both the structure and the contents of Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents, and can be stored in XML format as well. This mined knowledge is later used to provide: 1) a concise idea-the gist-of both the structure and the content of the XML document and 2) quick, approximate answers to queries. In this paper, we focus on the second feature. A prototype system and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Application of growing hierarchical SOM for visualisation of network forensics traffic data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Network forensics; Hierarchical self-organisation; Data clustering; Data visualisation; Feature extraction	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP	Digital investigation methods are becoming more and more important due to the proliferation of digital crimes and crimes involving digital evidence. Network forensics is a research area that gathers evidence by collecting and analysing network traffic data logs. This analysis can be a difficult process, especially because of the high variability of these attacks and large amount of data. Therefore, software tools that can help with these digital investigations are in great demand. In this paper, a novel approach to analysing and visualising network traffic data based on growing hierarchical self-organising maps (GHSOM) is presented. The self-organising map (SOM) has been shown to be successful for the analysis of highly-dimensional input data in data mining applications as well as for data visualisation in a more intuitive and understandable manner. However. the SOM has some problems related to its static topology and its inability to represent hierarchical relationships in the input data. The GHSOM tries to overcome these limitations by generating a hierarchical architecture that is automatically determined according to the input data and reflects the inherent hierarchical relationships among them. Moreover, the proposed GHSOM has been modified to correctly treat the qualitative features that are present in the traffic data in addition to the quantitative features. Experimental results show that this approach can be very useful for a better understanding of network traffic data, making it easier to search for evidence of attacks or anomalous behaviour in a network environment.

DEA based data preprocessing for maximum decisional efficiency linear case valuation models	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis; Interactive classification; Linear programming; Data mining; Decisional efficiency	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; DATA CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIAL USE; REGRESSION; PRINCIPLE; ACCURACY	In this paper, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to preprocess training data cases before the maximum decisional efficiency (MDE) principle is used to estimate discriminant function parameters. Using an example from the literature and simulated datasets, we compare the performance of DEA-MDE procedure for parameter estimation with traditional MDE procedure without data preprocessing. The results of our experiments indicate that the DEA-MDE procedure eliminates some inconsistencies caused by MDE principle, provides results that are consistent with an ensemble of expert decisions, reduces dimensionality of examples used in training datasets, and performs equal to or better than the MDE procedure for holdout sample tests. The DEA-MDE procedure appears to be sensitive to class data distribution and best results are obtained when a class data distribution is exponential. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sen, B; Ucar, E; Delen, D				Sen, Baha; Ucar, Emine; Delen, Dursun			Predicting and analyzing secondary education placement-test scores: A data mining approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Prediction; Sensitivity analysis; SETS	ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT	Understanding the factors that lead to success (or failure) of students at placement tests is an interesting and challenging problem. Since the centralized placement tests and future academic achievements are considered to be related concepts, analysis of the success factors behind placement tests may help understand and potentially improve academic achievement. In this study using a large and feature rich dataset from Secondary Education Transition System in Turkey we developed models to predict secondary education placement test results, and using sensitivity analysis on those prediction models we identified the most important predictors. The results showed that CS decision tree algorithm is the best predictor with 95% accuracy on hold-out sample, followed by support vector machines (with an accuracy of 91%) and artificial neural networks (with an accuracy of 89%). Logistic regression models came out to be the least accurate of the four with and overall accuracy of 82%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that previous test experience, whether a student has a scholarship, student's number of siblings, previous years' grade point average are among the most important predictors of the placement test scores.

J	Shabtai, A; Shahar, Y; Elovici, Y				Shabtai, Asaf; Shahar, Yuval; Elovici, Yuval			A distributed architecture for efficient parallelization and computation of knowledge-based temporal abstractions	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Temporal reasoning; Knowledge-based systems; Temporal-abstraction; Distributed computation; Parallel computation; Temporal data mining	TIME-ORIENTED DATA; FRAMEWORK; QUERIES; RECORDS; SYSTEM	Today, data storage capabilities as well as computational power are rapidly increasing. On the one hand, this improvement makes it possible to generate and store a great amount of temporal (time-oriented) data for future query, analysis and discovery of new knowledge. On the other hand, systems and experts are encountering new problems in processing this increased amount of data. The rapid growth in stored time-oriented data necessitates the development of new methods for handling, processing, and interpreting large amounts of temporal data. One approach is to use an automatic summarization process based on predefined knowledge, such the Knowledge-Based Temporal-Abstraction (KBTA) method. This method enables one to summarize and reduce the amount of raw data by creating higher level interpretations based on predefined domain knowledge. Unfortunately, the task of temporal abstraction is inherently computationally expensive, especially when an enormous volume of multivariate data has to be handled and when complex patterns need to be considered. In this research, we address the scalability problem of a temporal-abstraction task that involves processing significantly large amounts of raw data. We propose a new computational framework, the Distributed KBTA (DKBTA), which efficiently distributes the abstraction process among several parallel computational nodes, in order to achieve an acceptable computation time. The DKBTA framework distributes the temporal-abstraction process along one or more computational axes, each of which enables parallelization of one or more temporal-abstraction tasks into which the main temporal-abstraction task is decomposed, such as by different subject groups, concepts types, or abstraction types. We have implemented the DKBTA framework and have evaluated it in a preliminary fashion in the medical and the information security domains, with encouraging results. In our small-scale evaluation, only distribution along the subjects axis and sometimes along the concept-type axis seemed to consistently enhance performance, and only for computations involving individual subjects and not functions of sets of subjects; but this observation might depend on the number of processing units. Additionally, since the communication between the processing units was based on the TCP protocol, we could not observe any speedup even when using two processing units on the same machine. In our further evaluations we plan to use a shared memory architecture in order to exchange data between processing units.

It is a key technique in data mining and has become an important issue in many fields. This article presents a new clustering algorithm based on the mechanism analysis of chaotic ant swarm (CAS). It is an optimization methodology for clustering problem which aims to obtain global optimal assignment by minimizing the objective function. The proposed algorithm combines three advantages into one: finding global optimal solution to the objective function, not sensitive to clusters with different size and density and suitable to multi-dimensional data sets. The quality of this approach is evaluated on several well-known benchmark data sets. Compared with the popular clustering method named k-means algorithm and the PSO-based clustering technique, experimental results show that our algorithm is an effective clustering technique and can be used to handle data sets with complex cluster sizes, densities and multiple dimensions.

The proposed methodology is based on the use of bibliometrics; i.e., analysis is conducted using information regarding trends and patterns of publication rather than the actual content. In particular, we explore the use of term co-occurrence frequencies as an indicator of semantic closeness between pairs of terms. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a number of visualizations are generated for a collection of renewable energy related keywords. As these keywords are regarded as manifestations of the associated research topics, we contend that the proposed visualizations can be interpreted as representations of the underlying technology landscape.

Using data mining technique to enhance tax evasion detection performance	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Value-added tax; Tax evasion; Association rule	ASSOCIATION RULES; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES	Currently, tax authorities face the challenge of identifying and collecting from businesses that have successfully evaded paying the proper taxes. In solving the problem of tax evaders, tax authorities are equipped with limited resources and traditional tax auditing strategies that are time-consuming and tedious. These continued practices have resulted in the loss of a substantial amount of tax revenue for the government. The objective of the current study is to apply a data mining technique to enhance tax evasion detection performance. Using a data mining technique, a screening framework is developed to filter possible non-compliant value-added tax (VAT) reports that may be subject to further auditing. The results show that the proposed data mining technique truly enhances the detection of tax evasion, and therefore can be employed to effectively reduce or minimize losses from VAT evasion.

Clustering is an effective method to discover natural structures of data objects in data mining. Both clustering ensemble and semi-supervised clustering techniques have been emerged to improve the clustering performance of unsupervised clustering algorithms. Cop-Kmeans is a K-means variant that incorporates background knowledge in the form of pairwise constraints. However, there exists a constraint violation in Cop-Kmeans. This paper proposes an improved Cop-Kmeans (ICop-Kmeans) algorithm to solve the constraint violation of Cop-Kmeans. The certainty of objects is computed to obtain a better assignment order of objects by the weighted co-association. The paper proposes a new constrained self-organizing map (SOM) to combine multiple semi-supervised clustering solutions for further enhancing the performance of ICop-Kmeans. The proposed methods effectively improve the clustering results from the validated experiments and the quality of complex decisions in IDSS. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zafra, A; Ventura, S				Zafra, Amelia; Ventura, Sebastian			Multi-instance genetic programming for predicting student performance in web based educational environments	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Educational data mining; Multiple instance learning; Genetic programming; Classification	ALGORITHM; RETRIEVAL; FRAMEWORK	A considerable amount of e-learning content is available via virtual learning environments. These platforms keep track of learners' activities including the content viewed, assignments submission, time spent and quiz results, which all provide us with a unique opportunity to apply data mining methods. This paper presents an approach based on grammar guided genetic programming, G3P-MI, which classifies students in order to predict their final grade based on features extracted from logged data in a web based education system. Our proposal works with multiple instance learning, a relatively new learning framework that can eliminate the great number of missing values that appear when the problem is represented by traditional supervised learning. Experimental results are carried out on data sets with information about several courses and demonstrate that G3P-MI successfully achieves better accuracy and yields trade-off between such contradictory metrics as sensitivity and specificity compared to the most popular techniques of multiple instance learning. This method could be quite useful for early identification of students at risk, especially in very large classes, and allows the instructor to provide information about the most relevant activities to help students have a better chance to pass a course.

J	Masciari, E				Masciari, E.			SMART: Stream Monitoring enterprise Activities by RFID Tags	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						RFID tag; Object tracking; Outlier detection; Data stream; Data mining	SENSOR NETWORKS; SIMILARITY	Datastreams are potentially infinite data sources that flow continuously while monitoring a physical phenomenon, like temperature levels or other kind of human activities, such as clickstreams, telephone call records, and so on. RFID technology has lead in recent years the generation of huge streams of data. Moreover, RFID based systems allow the effective management of items tagged by RFID tags, especially for supply chain management or objects tracking. In this paper we introduce SMART (Stream Monitoring enterprise Activities by RFID Tags) a system based on an outlier template definition for detecting anomalies in RFID streams. We describe SMART features and its application on a real life scenario that shows the effectiveness of the proposed method for enterprise management. Moreover, we describe an outlier detection approach we defined and effectively exploited in SMART. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, YZ; Zhang, GJ; Yu, GX; Li, X				Ren, Yazhou; Zhang, Guoji; Yu, Guoxian; Li, Xuan			Local and global structure preserving based feature selection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Laplacian Score; Local and global structure; Redundancy; Normalized mutual information	MUTUAL INFORMATION	Feature selection is of great importance in data mining tasks, especially for exploring high dimensional data. Laplacian Score, a recently proposed feature selection method, makes use of local manifold structure of samples to select features and achieves good performance. However, it ignores the global structure of samples and the selected features are of high redundancy. To address these issues, we propose a feature selection method based on local and global structure preserving, LGFS in short. LGFS first uses two graphs, nearest neighborhood graph and farthest neighborhood graph to describe the underlying local and global structure of samples, respectively. It then defines a criterion to prefer the features which have good ability on local and global structure preserving. To remove redundancy among the selected features, Extended LGFS (E-LGFS) is introduced by taking advantage of normalized mutual information to measure the dependency between a pair of features. We conduct extensive experiments on two artificial data sets, six UCI data sets and two public available face databases to evaluate LGFS and E-LGFS. The experimental results show our methods can achieve higher accuracies than other unsupervised comparing methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Typically, the behavior of a user is defined as a time series of his or her activities. In this paper, users are clustered based upon time series extracted from their behavior during the interaction with given system. Although there are several different techniques used to cluster time series and sequences, this paper will attack the problem by utilizing a novel incremental fuzzy clustering strategy in order to achieve the objective. Upon dimensionality reduction, time series data are pre-clustered using the longest common subsequence as an indicator for similarity measurement. Afterwards, by utilizing an efficient method, clusters are updated incrementally and periodically through a set of fuzzy approaches. In addition, we will present the benefits of the proposed system by implementing a real application: Customer Segmentation.

DEA provides a significant amount of information from which analysts and managers derive insights and guidelines to promote their existing performances. Regarding to this fact, effective and methodologic analysis and interpretation of DEA results are very critical. The main objective of this study is then to develop a general decision support system (DSS) framework to analyze the results of basic DEA models. The paper formally shows how the results of DEA models should be structured so that these solutions can be examined and interpreted by analysts through information visualization and data mining techniques effectively. An innovative and convenient DEA solver, SmartDEA, is designed and developed in accordance with the proposed analysis framework. The developed software provides DEA results which are consistent with the framework and are ready-to-analyze with data mining tools, thanks to their specially designed table-based structures. The developed framework is tested and applied in a real world project for benchmarking the vendors of a leading Turkish automotive company. The results show the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Assent, I				Assent, Ira			Clustering high dimensional data	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; ALGORITHMS; METRICS	High-dimensional data, i.e., data described by a large number of attributes, pose specific challenges to clustering. The so-called curse of dimensionality, coined originally to describe the general increase in complexity of various computational problems as dimensionality increases, is known to render traditional clustering algorithms ineffective. The curse of dimensionality, among other effects, means that with increasing number of dimensions, a loss of meaningful differentiation between similar and dissimilar objects is observed. As high-dimensional objects appear almost alike, new approaches for clustering are required. Consequently, recent research has focused on developing techniques and clustering algorithms specifically for high-dimensional data. Still, open research issues remain. Clustering is a data mining task devoted to the automatic grouping of data based on mutual similarity. Each cluster groups objects that are similar to one another, whereas dissimilar objects are assigned to different clusters, possibly separating out noise. In this manner, clusters describe the data structure in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without the need for class labels. A number of clustering paradigms exist that provide different cluster models and different algorithmic approaches for cluster detection. Common to all approaches is the fact that they require some underlying assessment of similarity between data objects. In this article, we provide an overview of the effects of high-dimensional spaces, and their implications for different clustering paradigms. We review models and algorithms that address clustering in high dimensions, with pointers to the literature, and sketch open research issues. We conclude with a summary of the state of the art.

The new method randomly selects a sufficiently large number of initial modes to account for the global distribution of the data set, and then progressively eliminates the redundant modes using an iterative optimization process with an elimination criterion function. Systematic experiments were carried out with data from the UCI Machine learning repository. The results and a comparative evaluation show a high performance and consistency of the proposed method, which achieves significant improvement compared to other well-known k-modes-type algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy.

Concept-based near-duplicate video clip detection for novelty re-ranking of web video search results	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Near-duplicate video clip detection; Semantic novelty and redundancy detection; Concept-based near duplicates; Conceptual clustering of videos; Video semantic time-series representation; Multimedia data mining		State-of-the-art near-duplicate video clip (NDVC) detection for novelty re-ranking uses non-semantic low-level features (color/texture) to detect and eliminate "content-based NDVC" and increases content level novelty in the top results. However, humans may perceive a video as near duplicate from a semantic perspective as well. In this paper, we propose concept-based near-duplicate video clip (CBNDVC) detection technique for novelty re-ranking. We identify "semantic NDVC", making use of the semantic features (events/concepts) and re-rank the top results to increase the content as well as semantic novelty.

Integrate tool for online analysis and offline mining of people trajectories	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article							EVENT DETECTION; SURVEILLANCE; RECOGNITION; PATTERNS; TRACKING	In the past literature, online alarm-based video-surveillance and offline forensic-based data mining systems are often treated separately, even from different scientific communities. However, the founding techniques are almost the same and, despite some examples in commercial systems, the cases on which an integrated approach is followed are limited. For this reason, this study describes an integrated tool capable of putting together these two subsystems in an effective way. Despite its generality, the proposal is here reported in the case of people trajectory analysis, both in real time and offline. Trajectories are modelled based on either their spatial location or their shape, and proper similarity measures are proposed. Special solutions to meet real-time requirements in both cases are also presented and the trade-off between efficiency and efficacy is analysed by comparing when using a statistical model and when not. Examples of results in large datasets acquired in the University campus are reported as preliminary evaluation of the system.

J	Catania, B; Maddalena, A				Catania, Barbara; Maddalena, Anna			A unified framework for heterogeneous patterns	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pattern; Logical model; Query language; Manipulation language	PERIODICITY CONSTRAINTS; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; LINEAR CONSTRAINTS; LANGUAGE; SQL	Knowledge patterns, such as association rules, clusters or decision trees, can be defined as concise and relevant information that can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and manipulated by knowledge workers in order to drive and specialize business decision processes. In this paper we deal with data mining patterns. The ability to manipulate different types of patterns under a unified environment is becoming a fundamental issue for any 'intelligent' and data-intensive application. However, approaches proposed so far for pattern management usually deal with specific and predefined types of patterns and mainly concern pattern extraction and exchange issues. Issues concerning the integrated, advanced management of heterogeneous patterns are in general not (or marginally) taken into account. What is missing is therefore a unified framework dealing with heterogeneous patterns in an homogeneous way. This work addresses this problem by proposing a general framework for heterogeneous pattern representation and management under a unified perspective. After discussing the motivations underlying our work, a formal pattern model as well as query and manipulation languages are presented. Complexity issues of the proposed framework are also investigated and a proposal for an SQL-based implementation of the framework is finally provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A logical analysis of banks' financial strength ratings	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Logical Analysis of Data; Credit risk rating; Decision support systems	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; RISK; MODELS; NOISE	We evaluate the creditworthiness of banks using statistical, as well as combinatorics-, optimization-, and logic-based methodologies. We reverse-engineer the Fitch risk ratings of banks using ordered logistic regression, support vector machine, and Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). The LAD ratings are shown to be the most accurate and most successfully cross-validated. The study shows that the LAD rating approach is (i) objective, (ii) transparent, and (iii) generalizable. It can be used to build internal rating systems that (iv) have varying levels of granularity, and ( v) are Basel compliant, allowing for their use in the decisions pertaining to the determination of the amount of regulatory capital.

AN EFFICIENT GRADUAL PRUNING TECHNIQUE FOR UTILITY MINING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Data mining; Utility mining; High utility itemsets; Level-wise mining approach; Pruning strategy	DATABASES; ITEMSETS	Utility mining in knowledge discovery has recently become a prominent research issue due to its many practical applications. A high utility itemset in utility mining considers not only quantities but also profits of items in transactions. Most of previous approaches were based on the traditional utility upper bound model to find high utility itemsets in databases. By using the model, however, a huge number of candidates have to be generated, and a good deal of time to count utility upper bounds of itemsets has to be needed for mining. In this paper, we thus propose a level-wise mining approach to find efficiently high utility itemsets in databases. In particular, a pruning strategy is designed to gradually cause better utility upper bounds of itemsets in passes. Also, data size could be gradually reduced to save data scan time. Finally, the experimental results on synthetic datasets and a real dataset show the proposed approach outperforms the traditional two-phase utility mining approach in pruning effect and execution efficiency.

J	Lin, WY; Su, JH; Tseng, MC				Lin, Wen-Yang; Su, Ja-Hwung; Tseng, Ming-Cheng			Updating generalized association rules with evolving fuzzy taxonomies	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy taxonomy; Frequent itemsets; Generalized association rule; Rule maintenance	ALGORITHMS	Mining generalized association rules with fuzzy taxonomic structures has been recognized as an important extension of generalized associations mining problem. To date most work on this problem, however, required the taxonomies to be static, ignoring the fact that the taxonomies of items cannot necessarily be kept unchanged. For instance, some items may be reclassified from one hierarchy tree to another for more suitable classification, abandoned from the taxonomies if they will no longer be produced, or added into the taxonomies as new items. Additionally, the membership degrees expressing the fuzzy classification may also need to be adjusted. Under these circumstances, effectively updating the discovered generalized association rules is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose two novel algorithms, called FDiff_ET and FDiff_ET*, to update the discovered generalized frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithms can maintain their performance even in high degree of taxonomy evolution, and are significantly faster than applying the contemporary fuzzy generalized association mining algorithm FGAR to the database with evolving taxonomy.

J	Mavroeidis, D; Magdalinos, P				Mavroeidis, Dimitrios; Magdalinos, Panagis			A Sequential Sampling Framework for Spectral k-Means Based on Efficient Bootstrap Accuracy Estimations: Application to Distributed Clustering	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Asymptotic convergence; bootstrapping; clustering; distributed clustering; matrix perturbation theory; sampling; spectral	DATA STREAMS; ALGORITHMS; STABILITY	The scalability of learning algorithms has always been a central concern for data mining researchers, and nowadays, with the rapid increase in data storage capacities and availability, its importance has increased. To this end, sampling has been studied by several researchers in an effort to derive sufficiently accurate models using only small data fractions. In this article we focus on spectral k-means, that is, the k-means approximation as derived by the spectral relaxation, and propose a sequential sampling framework that iteratively enlarges the sample size until the k-means results (objective function and cluster structure) become indistinguishable from the asymptotic (infinite-data) output. In the proposed framework we adopt a commonly applied principle in data mining research that considers the use of minimal assumptions concerning the data generating distribution. This restriction imposes several challenges, mainly related to the efficiency of the sequential sampling procedure. These challenges are addressed using elements of matrix perturbation theory and statistics. Moreover, although the main focus is on spectral k-means, we also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be generalized to handle spectral clustering. The proposed sequential sampling framework is consecutively employed for addressing the distributed clustering problem, where the task is to construct a global model for data that resides in distributed network nodes. The main challenge in this context is related to the bandwidth constraints that are commonly imposed, thus requiring that the distributed clustering algorithm consumes a minimal amount of network load. This illustrates the applicability of the proposed approach, as it enables the determination of a minimal sample size that can be used for constructing an accurate clustering model that entails the distributional characteristics of the data. As opposed to the relevant distributed k-means approaches, our framework takes into account the fact that the choice of the number of clusters has a crucial effect on the required amount of communication. More precisely, the proposed algorithm is able to derive a statistical estimation of the required relative sizes for all possible values of k. This unique feature of our distributed clustering framework enables a network administrator to choose an economic solution that identifies the crude cluster structure of a dataset and not devote excessive network resources for identifying all the "correct" detailed clusters.

One proposed mechanism uses the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, and the other relies on the Shapley value. Neither relies on the ability to verify the data of the parties participating in the distributed data mining protocol. Instead, we incentivize truth telling based solely on the data mining result. This is especially useful for situations where privacy concerns prevent verification of the data. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that these mechanisms are incentive compatible for distributed data mining. In addition, through extensive experimentation, we show that they are applicable in practice.

J	Por, LY; Ong, SY; Beh, D; Ismail, M				Por, Lip Yee; Ong, Sim Ying; Beh, Delina; Ismail, Maizatul			A Grid Enabled E-Theses and Dissertations Repository System	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ETD; GREET; catalogue; repository services		Some of the universities in Malaysia are still implementing hybrid Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) approach in managing Theses and Dissertations (TD). One of the limitations of the hybrid ETD approach is its online cataloguing method, which is only available at the physical location of the TD instead of enabling the information to be retrieved online. Maintaining the performance and the data accessing rate of an ETD system has become challenging, due in part to the high number of scholars who utilise and access the system. In order to allow remote access and maintain the services such as scalability, accessibility, availability and expressibility, a Grid Enabled E-Theses and dissertations repository system (GREET) has been proposed in this paper to provide uniform access of knowledge integration among distributed heterogeneous platforms and repositories by using data grid technology. Comparative performance results between a non-grid architecture and GREET has been benchmarked. It has been proven that GREET is able to increase the processing time approximately three times faster than the non-grid architecture. Furthermore, multiple file streams can be opened to support larger volume and larger capacity of file operation so that GREET is able to decrease the chances of network congestion caused by input/output file operations. For future direction, research will be focused on searching algorithm using data mining or pattern discovery to minimise the respond time.

J	Shim, B; Choi, K; Suh, Y				Shim, Beomsoo; Choi, Keunho; Suh, Yongmoo			CRM strategies for a small-sized online shopping mall based on association rules and sequential patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; CRM strategy; Association rule; Sequential pattern; RFM	CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE; DATA MINING APPROACH; NEURAL-NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFIERS; INDUSTRY; VALIDATION; PREDICTION; SELECTION	As dot-com bubble burst in 2002, an uncountable number of small-sized online shopping malls have emerged every day due to many good characteristics of online marketplace, including significantly reduced search costs and menu cost for products or services and easily accessing products or services in the world. However, all the online shopping malls have not continuously flourished. Many of them even vanished because of the lack of customer relationship management (CRM) strategies that fit them. The objective of this paper is to propose CRM strategies for small-sized online shopping mall based on association rules and sequential patterns obtained by analyzing the transaction data of the shop. We first defined the VIP customers in terms of recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) value. Then, we developed a model which classifies customers into VIP or non-VIP, using various data mining techniques such as decision tree, artificial neural network, logistic regression and bagging with each of these as a base classifier. Last, we identified association rules and sequential patterns from the transactions of VIPs, and then these rules and patterns were utilized to propose CRM strategies for the online shopping mall.

J	Tatti, N; Cule, B				Tatti, Nikolaj; Cule, Boris			Mining closed strict episodes	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Frequent episode mining; Closed episodes; Level-wise algorithm	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; EVENT SEQUENCES; FREQUENT	Discovering patterns in a sequence is an important aspect of data mining. One popular choice of such patterns are episodes, patterns in sequential data describing events that often occur in the vicinity of each other. Episodes also enforce in which order the events are allowed to occur. In this work we introduce a technique for discovering closed episodes. Adopting existing approaches for discovering traditional patterns, such as closed itemsets, to episodes is not straightforward. First of all, we cannot define a unique closure based on frequency because an episode may have several closed superepisodes. Moreover, to define a closedness concept for episodes we need a subset relationship between episodes, which is not trivial to define. We approach these problems by introducing strict episodes. We argue that this class is general enough, and at the same time we are able to define a natural subset relationship within it and use it efficiently. In order to mine closed episodes we define an auxiliary closure operator. We show that this closure satisfies the needed properties so that we can use the existing framework for mining closed patterns.

In the case for Tor, a widely used anonymous overlay network is considered. Despite the deployment of several protection mechanisms, an attack originated by just one rogue exit node is proposed. The attack is composed of two elements. The first is an active tag injection scheme. The malicious exit node injects image tags into all HTTP replies, which will be cached for upcoming requests and allow different users to be distinguished. The second element is an inference attack that leverages a semi-supervised learning algorithm to reconstruct browsing sessions. Captured traffic flows are clustered into sessions, such that one session is most probably associated to a specific user. The clustering algorithm uses HTTP headers and logical dependencies encountered in a browsing session. A prototype has been implemented and its performance evaluated on the Tor network. The article also describes several countermeasures and advanced attacks, modeled in a game theoretical framework, and their effectiveness assessed with reference to the Nash equilibrium.

J	Cokpinar, S; Gundem, TI				Cokpinar, Samet; Gundem, Taflan Imre			Positive and negative association rule mining on XML data streams in database as a service concept	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rule mining; Data streams; Databases		In recent years, data mining has become one of the most popular techniques for data owners to determine their strategies. Association rule mining is a data mining approach that is used widely in traditional databases and usually to find the positive association rules. However, there are some other challenging rule mining topics like data stream mining and negative association rule mining. Besides, organizations want to concentrate on their own business and outsource the rest of their work. This approach is named "database as a service concept" and provides lots of benefits to data owner, but, at the same time, brings out some security problems. In this paper, a rule mining system has been proposed that provides efficient and secure solution to positive and negative association rule computation on XML data streams in database as a service concept. The system is implemented and several experiments have been done with different synthetic data sets to show the performance and efficiency of the proposed system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Learning data structure from classes: A case study applied to population genetics	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Clustering; Hierarchical classification; Pairwise classification	CLASSIFICATION MODELS; REJECT OPTION; DATA SETS; CLASSIFIERS	In most cases, the main goal of machine learning and data mining applications is to obtain good classifiers. However, final users, for instance researchers in other fields, sometimes prefer to infer new knowledge about their domain that may be useful to confirm or reject their hypotheses. This paper presents a learning method that works along these lines, in addition to reporting three interesting applications in the field of population genetics in which the aim is to discover relationships between species or breeds according to their genotypes. The proposed method has two steps: first it builds a hierarchical clustering of the set of classes and then a hierarchical classifier is learned. Both models can be analyzed by experts to extract useful information about their domain. In addition, we propose a new method for learning the hierarchical classifier. By means of a voting scheme employing pairwise binary models constrained by the hierarchical structure, the proposed classifier is computationally more efficient than previous approaches while improving on their performance.

J	Pujol, FA; Garcia, JC				Pujol, Francisco A.; Carlos Garcia, Juan			Computing the Principal Local Binary Patterns for face recognition using data mining tools	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Local Binary Patterns; Face recognition	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; BIOMETRICS	Local Binary Patterns are considered as one of the texture descriptors with better results; they employ a statistical feature extraction by means of the binarization of the neighborhood of every image pixel with a local threshold determined by the central pixel. The idea of using Local Binary Patterns for face description is motivated by the fact that faces can be seen as a composition of micro-patterns which are properly described by this operator and, consequently, it has become a very popular technique in recent years. In this work, we show a method to calculate the most important or Principal Local Binary Patterns for recognizing faces. To do this, the attribute evaluator algorithm of the data mining tool Weka is used. Furthermore, since we assume that each face region has a different influence on the recognition process, we have designed a 9-region mask and obtained a set of optimized weights for this mask by means of the data mining tool RapidMiner. Our proposal was tested with the FERET database and obtained a recognition rate varying between 90% and 94% when using only 9 uniform Principal Local Binary Patterns, for a database of 843 individuals; thus, we have reduced both the dimension of the feature vectors needed for completing the recognition tasks and the processing time required to compare all the faces in the database.

There is increasing evidence that pathological oscillations may be specific to diseased networks in patients with epilepsy and that these oscillations may be a key biomarker for generating and indentifying epileptic networks. We present a semi-automated method that detects, maps, and mines pathological gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations (PGOs) in human epileptic brain to possibly localize epileptic networks. We apply the method to standard clinical iEEG (<100 Hz) with interictal PGOs and seizures from six patients with medically refractory epilepsy. We demonstrate that electrodes with consistent PGO discharges do not always coincide with clinically determined seizure onset zone (SOZ) electrodes but at times PGO-dense electrodes include secondary seizure-areas (SS) or even areas without seizures (NS). In 4/5 patients with epilepsy surgery, we observe poor (Engel Class 4) postsurgical outcomes and identify more PGO-activity in SS or NS than in SOZ. Additional studies are needed to further clarify the role of PGOs in epileptic brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Industrial implementation of intelligent system techniques for nuclear power plant condition monitoring	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Nuclear; Condition monitoring; Agglomerative hierarchical clustering; Rule-based reasoning	DIMENSIONAL CHANGES; GRAPHITE	As the nuclear power plants within the UK age, there is an increased requirement for condition monitoring to ensure that the plants are still be able to operate safely. This paper describes the novel application of Intelligent Systems (IS) techniques to provide decision support to the condition monitoring of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) reactor cores within the UK. The resulting system, BETA (British Energy Trace Analysis) is deployed within the UK's nuclear operator and provides automated decision support for the analysis of refuelling data, a lead indicator of the health of AGR (Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor) nuclear power plant cores. The key contribution of this work is the improvement of existing manual, labour-intensive analysis through the application of IS techniques to provide decision support to NPP reactor core condition monitoring. This enables an existing source of condition monitoring data to be analysed in a rapid and repeatable manner, providing additional information relating to core health on a more regular basis than routine inspection data allows. The application of IS techniques addresses two issues with the existing manual interpretation of the data, namely the limited availability of expertise and the variability of assessment between different experts. Decision support is provided by four applications of intelligent systems techniques. Two instances of a rule-based expert system are deployed, the first to automatically identify key features within the refuelling data and the second to classify specific types of anomaly. Clustering techniques are applied to support the definition of benchmark behaviour, which is used to detect the presence of anomalies within the refuelling data. Finally data mining techniques are used to track the evolution of the normal benchmark behaviour over time. This results in a system that not only provides support for analysing new refuelling events but also provides the platform to allow future events to be analysed. The BETA system has been deployed within the nuclear operator in the UK and is used at both the engineering offices and on station to support the analysis of refuelling events from two AGR stations, with a view to expanding it to the rest of the fleet in the near future.

J	Yeh, CW; Li, DC; Zhang, YR				Yeh, Chun-Wu; Li, Der-Chiang; Zhang, Yao-Ren			Estimation of a data-collection maturity model to detect manufacturing change	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Data-collection maturity model; Sample size; Machine learning	VAPNIK-CHERVONENKIS DIMENSION; CONTROL CHARTS; SAMPLE-SIZE; LEARNABILITY; PARAMETERS; TRIALS	Data mining methods have been successfully used for analyzing production data in manufacturing, and generally the production samples are considered derived from a population from the statistical view. However, the assumption is often challenged, because a production system is normally highly interrelated with a manufacturing environment that is time-dependent. Therefore, instead of treating data as elements from a population following a certain distribution, this research considers that, in the whole course of data collection, a total data set might reasonably be divided into three phases as a more accurate production profile: early phase, mature phase, and oversized phase. In the early phase, the data set is usually small and the information extracted is fragile; in the mature phase, the data collected can provide sufficient and stable knowledge to the management; and in the oversized phase, since the system has substantially changed, many old data are no longer current so that their representability has declined. Based on this concept, the two critical points that segment the total data set into three parts are systematically determined here using neural network technologies; and the manufacturing model can be reformed for advancing its predictive capability.

In comparison to previous studies on customer insolvency, our research presents novelty in the following areas. First of all, we deal with cellular telecommunication customers who use services without paying dues (the literature show the studies that dealt mainly with fixed line operators or banking industry). Secondly, we have a large dataset with 205 explanatory variables derived from the database (previous studies dealt with smaller datasets). Thirdly, we test the quality of the models three months after the estimation with lift and ROC curves to assess the models performance over the time. The main findings from the research are twofold: (1) artificial neural networks perform well when modeling the customer's insolvency and the best model can capture significant amount of money owed by insolvent customers: (2) decision trees get old quickly and their performance decrease over the time in the top percentiles of the score.

However, these algorithms tend to suffer from premature convergence in the high dimensional problem space. This paper proposes a novel simplified swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm to overcome the above convergence problem by incorporating it with the new local search strategy. The proposed algorithm can find a better solution from the neighbourhood of the current solution produced by SSO. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated by using 13 different widely used databases and compared with the standard PSO and three other well-known classification algorithms. In, addition, the practicability of the approach is studied by applying it in analysing golf swing from weight shift data.

A quantitative correlation coefficient mining method for business intelligence in small and medium enterprises of trading business	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Business intelligence; Data mining; Correlation coefficient mining; Product relation network; Knowledge management; Knowledge system technology	CUSTOMER; PROFITABILITY	Business intelligence based on data mining has been one of the popular and indispensable tools for identifying business opportunity in sales and marketing of new products. The traditional data mining methods based on association rules may be inadequate in completely uncovering the hidden patterns of sales based on transaction records. This paper presents a qualitative correlation coefficient mining method which is capable of uncovering hidden patterns of sales and market. Hence, a prototype business intelligence system (BIS) named correlation coefficient sales data mining system (CCSDMS) has been developed and successfully trial implemented in a selected reference site. A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results generated by the BIS are compared with a well known market available data mining system. The proposed quantitative correlation coefficient mining method is found to possess higher accuracy, better computational effectiveness and higher predictive power. With the new approach, associations for product relations and customer periodic demands are revealed and this can help to leverage organizational marketing capital to enhance quality and speed of promotions as well as awareness of product relations.

The complexity of the network increases as the number of layers and number of nodes in layers increases. Further, it is also very difficult to decide the number of nodes in a layer and the number of layers in the network required for solving a problem a priori. In this paper an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is used to train the functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) for classification and we name it ISO-FLANN. In contrast to MLP, FLANN has less architectural complexity, easier to train, and more insight may be gained in the classification problem. Further, we rely on global classification capabilities of IPSO to explore the entire weight space, which is plagued by a host of local optima. Using the functionally expanded features; FLANN overcomes the non-linear nature of problems. We believe that the combined efforts of FLANN and IPSO (IPSO + FLANN = ISO - FLANN) by harnessing their best attributes can give rise to a robust classifier. An extensive simulation study is presented to show the effectiveness of proposed classifier. Results are compared with MLP, support vector machine(SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel, FLANN with gradiend descent learning and fuzzy swarm net (FSN). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gordevicius, J; Gamper, J; Bohlen, M				Gordevicius, Juozas; Gamper, Johann; Boehlen, Michael			Parsimonious temporal aggregation	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						Temporal aggregation; Data approximation; Algorithms; Data mining	TIME-SERIES; QUERY LANGUAGE; ALGORITHMS; DATABASES	Temporal aggregation is an important operation in temporal databases, and different variants thereof have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal aggregation operator, termed parsimonious temporal aggregation (PTA), that overcomes major limitations of existing approaches. PTA takes the result of instant temporal aggregation (ITA) of size , which might be up to twice as large as the argument relation, and merges similar tuples until a given error () or size () bound is reached. The new operator is data-adaptive and allows the user to control the trade-off between the result size and the error introduced by merging. For the precise evaluation of PTA queries, we propose two dynamic programming-based algorithms for size- and error-bounded queries, respectively, with a worst-case complexity that is quadratic in . We present two optimizations that take advantage of temporal gaps and different aggregation groups and achieve a linear runtime in experiments with real-world data. For the quick computation of an approximate PTA answer, we propose an efficient greedy merging strategy with a precision that is upper bounded by (log ). We present two algorithms that implement this strategy and begin to merge as ITA tuples are produced. They require ( log ( + )) time and ( + ) space, where is the size of a read-ahead buffer and is typically very small. An empirical evaluation on real-world and synthetic data shows that PTA considerably reduces the size of the aggregation result, yet introducing only small errors. The greedy algorithms are scalable for large data sets and introduce less error than other approximation techniques.

In this work, we built an ensemble of bagging, boosting and random subspace methods ensembles with 8 sub-regressors in each one and then an averaging methodology is used for the final prediction. We performed a comparison with simple bagging, boosting and random subspace methods ensembles with 25 sub-regressors, as well as other well known combining methods, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique had better correlation coefficient in most cases.

Meanwhile, for the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) applications running on embedded system, loops inside them are the most critical part for performance optimization. To optimize the loop iteration patterns, we need to schedule the loop execution order. Due to the uncertainties within the execution time of tasks, we model varied execution times of tasks as random variables and propose a novel data graph model, called HPDFG (Heterogeneous Probabilistic Data-Flow Graph) to model DSP applications on embedded systems. A novel algorithm, LSHAPE, is proposed to minimize the cost and satisfy the timing constraints. First of all, we use the data mining methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of the execution time variables. Second, we rotate the loops in the application to explore different possible execution patterns. Finally, we combine the list-scheduling and the dynamic programming to generate a near-optimal task allocation and a core-mode assignment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Our approach can handle loops efficiently.

An experimental comparison of real and artificial deception using a deception generation model	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deception; Deception detection; Noise model; Data generation model	ATTRIBUTE NOISE; EXPERT-SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; OUTLIERS	To develop a data mining approach for a deception application, data collection costs can be prohibitive because both deceptive data and truthful data are necessary to be collected. To reduce data collection costs, artificially generated deception data can be used, but the impact of using artificially generated deception data is not well understood. To study the relationship between artificial and real deception, this paper presents an experimental comparison using a novel deception generation model. The deception and truth data were collected from financial aid applications, a document centric area with limited resources for verification. The data collection provided a unique data set containing truth, natural deception, and boosted deception. To simulate deception, the Application Deception Model was developed to generate artificial deception in different deception scenarios. To study differences between artificial and real deception, an experiment was performed using deception level and data generation method as factors and directed distance and outlier score as outcome variables. Our results provided evidence of a reasonable similarity between artificial and real deception, suggesting the possibility of using artificially generated deception to reduce the costs associated with obtaining training data.

In this paper, a novel method is presented to facilitate the clustering. The method determines the appropriate number of clusters and provides suitable representatives for each cluster by inference from a Bayesian network. Furthermore, by means of the Bayesian network, the contents of the Web pages are converted into vectors of lower dimensions. The method is also extended for hierarchical clustering, and a useful heuristic is developed to select a good hierarchy. The experimental results show that the clusters produced benefit from high quality.

The valuable information discovered from data mining can be used to support decision making. Generally, support and confidence (objective) measures are used to evaluate the interestingness of association rules. However, in some cases, by using these two measures, the discovered rules may be not profitable and not actionable (not interesting) to enterprises. Therefore, how to discover the patterns by considering both objective measures (e. g. probability) and subjective measures (e. g. profit) is a challenge in data mining, particularly in marketing applications. This paper focuses on pattern evaluation in the process of knowledge discovery by using the concept of profit mining. Data Envelopment Analysis is utilized to calculate the efficiency of discovered association rules with multiple objective and subjective measures. After evaluating the efficiency of association rules, they are categorized into two classes, relatively efficient (interesting) and relatively inefficient (uninteresting). To classify these two classes, Decision Tree (DT)-based classifier is built by using the attributes of association rules. The DT classifier can be used to find out the characteristics of interesting association rules, and to classify the unknown (new) association rules.

Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e. g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e. g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.

For example, people with heart disease do not want to disclose their ECG time-series, but they still allow mining some accurate patterns from their time-series. Our privacy model assumes that (1) data sources publish their time-series independently, and (2) all information used in publishing time-series can be publicly revealed. Based on this model, we introduce three assumptions: full disclosure, equi-uncertainty, and independency. We also derive two requirements: uncertainty preservation and distance order preservation. We show that only randomization methods satisfy all three assumptions, but even those methods do not satisfy both the requirements. Thus, we discuss the randomization-based solutions that satisfy all assumptions and requirements. For this purpose, we present a novel notion of the noise averaging effect of piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA), which is derived from a simple intuition that the summation of random noise converges to 0. This noise averaging effect can alleviate the problem of destroying distance orders in randomly perturbed time-series. Based on the noise averaging effect, we first propose two naive solutions that use the random data perturbation in publishing time-series while exploiting the PAA distance in computing distances. There is, however, a tradeoff between these two solutions with respect to uncertainty and distance orders. We thus propose three more advanced solutions that take advantages of both naive solutions. Experimental results show that our advanced solutions are superior to the naive solutions in the preservation of uncertainty, distance orders, and clustering accuracy.

This article presents Modellus, a novel system for automated modeling of complex web-based data center applications using methods from queuing theory, data mining, and machine learning. Modellus uses queuing theory and statistical methods to automatically derive models to predict the resource usage of an application and the workload it triggers; these models can be composed to capture multiple dependencies between interacting applications. Model accuracy is maintained by fast, distributed testing, automated relearning of models when they change, and methods to bound prediction errors in composite models. We have implemented a prototype of Modellus, deployed it on a data center testbed, and evaluated its efficacy for modeling and analysis of several distributed multitier web applications. Our results show that this feature-based modeling technique is able to make predictions across several data center tiers, and maintain predictive accuracy (typically 95% or better) in the face of significant shifts in workload composition; we also demonstrate practical applications of the Modellus system to prediction and provisioning of real-world data center applications.

J	Gong, RS; Huang, SH				Gong, Rongsheng; Huang, Samuel H.			A Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic based segmentation approach to learning from imbalanced datasets: With application in property refinance prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Imbalanced data; Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic; Decision tree; Segmentation; Property refinance prediction	STRATEGIES	Classification is an important task in data mining. Class imbalance has been reported to hinder the performance of standard classification models. However, our study shows that class imbalance may not be the only cause to blame for poor performance. Rather, the underlying complexity of the problem may play a more fundamental role. In this paper, a decision tree method based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (K-S tree), is proposed to segment the training data so that a complex problem can be divided into several easier sub-problems where class imbalance becomes less challenging. K-S tree is also used to perform feature selection, which not only selects relevant variables but also removes redundant ones. After segmentation, a two-way re-sampling method is used at the segment level to empirically determine the optimal sampling percentage and the rebalanced data is used to fit logistic regression models, also at the segment level. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application on property refinance prediction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ihler, A; Newman, D				Ihler, Alexander; Newman, David			Understanding Errors in Approximate Distributed Latent Dirichlet Allocation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; topic model; parallel processing; error analysis		Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular algorithm for discovering semantic structure in large collections of text or other data. Although its complexity is linear in the data size, its use on increasingly massive collections has created considerable interest in parallel implementations. "Approximate distributed" LDA, or AD-LDA, approximates the popular collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA models while running on a distributed architecture. Although this algorithm often appears to perform well in practice, its quality is not well understood theoretically or easily assessed on new data. In this work, we theoretically justify the approximation, and modify AD-LDA to track an error bound on performance. Specifically, we upper bound the probability of making a sampling error at each step of the algorithm (compared to an exact, sequential Gibbs sampler), given the samples drawn thus far. We show empirically that our bound is sufficiently tight to give a meaningful and intuitive measure of approximation error in AD-LDA, allowing the user to track the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency while executing in parallel.

This study examines how the repeated clustering method improves the ability to discriminate among the TDLPs of each cluster. The k-means algorithm is a well-known clustering technology in data mining. Repeated clustering groups the cluster into sub-clusters with the k-means algorithm and chooses the sub-cluster that has the maximum average error and repeats clustering until the final cluster count is satisfied.

Especially these are vital in the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) application which brings a revolution in business programs. Manufacturing, the logistics distribution and various stages of supply chains, retail store and quality management applications are involved in the RFID technology in business. A large volume of temporal and spatial data is generated by the ubiquitous computing and sensor networks of RFID and these are often generated with noises and duplicates. The noises and duplicates in the RFID data declare the need of an effective data warehousing system. The warehousing system has the responsibility to provide proper data cleaning technique to clean the dirty data which occurs in the applications. Also, the cleaned data has to be transformed and to be loaded properly so that they can be stored in the database with minimum space requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel data cleaning, transformation and loading technique which makes the data warehousing system employed for any RFID applications more effective. The chosen RFID application is tracking of goods in warehouses using RFID tags and readers, one of the significant RFID applications. The data cleaning is performed based on the probability of each RFID tag's response and the window size which is made adaptive. The window size changes on the basis of the occurrence of the dirty data and hence the cleaning is more effective. The purified data is transformed in a special structure in such a way that the ware house can have only the tag IDs which are under transaction and the time of interrogation in the size of bits. The transformed data are loaded into the warehouse using the proposed loading technique in a dedicated tabular format.

J	Luengo, J; Saez, JA; Herrera, F				Luengo, Julian; Saez, Jose A.; Herrera, Francisco			Missing data imputation for fuzzy rule-based classification systems	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Classification; Missing values; Fuzzy rule-based classification systems; Imputation	INPUT FEATURE-SELECTION; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; VALUES; CLASSIFIERS	Fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) are known due to their ability to treat with low quality data and obtain good results in these scenarios. However, their application in problems with missing data are uncommon while in real-life data, information is frequently incomplete in data mining, caused by the presence of missing values in attributes. Several schemes have been studied to overcome the drawbacks produced by missing values in data mining tasks; one of the most well known is based on preprocessing, formerly known as imputation. In this work, we focus on FRBCSs considering 14 different approaches to missing attribute values treatment that are presented and analyzed. The analysis involves three different methods, in which we distinguish between Mamdani and TSK models. From the obtained results, the convenience of using imputation methods for FRBCSs with missing values is stated. The analysis suggests that each type behaves differently while the use of determined missing values imputation methods could improve the accuracy obtained for these methods. Thus, the use of particular imputation methods conditioned to the type of FRBCSs is required.

Data-mining experiments on a hydroelectric power plant	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								This study presents some data-mining experiments applied to electric power systems with the aim of extracting knowledge from historical data produced by the supervision, control and data acquisition system of a hydroelectric plant in Brazil. In the first experiment, statistical analysis is performed on discrete events such as Boolean events, alarms, commands, set-points and analogue quantities as electrical frequency, to display relevant aspects of the electrical system operation. Next, the results of an experiment performed on discrete events from associations describing relationships patterns among items in a database are presented. In the third experiment, a decision tree is used to reveal relationships among several analogue variables as: the relationship between the downstream water level and generated power, for example. In the fourth experiment, a decision tree is designed to detect if the hydro generator operation is violating any constraint imposed by its capability curve, also indicating which limit is extrapolated. These experiences contribute to successfully show the data-mining applicability to power systems, to improve the management of hydroelectric power plants operation, maintenance and planning, besides also contributing to establish a culture of its usage in the electrical industry.

J	Rasmussen, R; Brown, R				Rasmussen, Rune; Brown, Ross			A deductive system for proving workflow models from operational procedures	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Workflow; Planning; Petri-net; Automation; Management; Modelling		Many modern business environments employ software to automate the delivery of workflows; whereas, workflow design and generation remains a laborious technical task for domain specialists. Several different approaches have been proposed for deriving workflow models. Some approaches rely on process data mining approaches, whereas others have proposed derivations of workflow models from operational structures, domain specific knowledge or workflow model compositions from knowledge-bases. Many approaches draw on principles from automatic planning, but conceptual in context and lack mathematical justification. In this paper we present a mathematical framework for deducing tasks in workflow models from plans in mechanistic or strongly controlled work environments, with a focus around automatic plan generations. In addition, we prove an associative composition operator that permits crisp hierarchical task compositions for workflow models through a set of mathematical deduction rules. The result is a logical framework that can be used to prove tasks in workflow hierarchies from operational information about work processes and machine configurations in controlled or mechanistic work environments.

J	Shen, CC; Yang, HH; Chang, YC				Shen, Ching-Cheng; Yang, Hsu-Hao; Chang, Yueh-Ching			A DECISION TREE-BASED APPROACH FOR CERVICAL SMEARS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Cervical smear; Pap test; Decision tree; Data mining; Cervical cancer	MASS-SPECTRAL DATA; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATIVE GENES; DIAGNOSIS; SELECT	Cervical smears are used to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and remain a popular method for the early detection of precancer and cervical cancer. One of the classification systems for CIN, the Bethesda system, classifies atypical cells into ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and ASC-H (atypical squamous cells: cannot exclude a high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion). This paper proposes a methodology involving a decision tree (DT) to identify cases of ASC-US by constructing a classification decision tree (CDT) based on samples from a Taiwanese teaching hospital. The main difference between our methodology and those of other studies is the use of a DT to identify ASC-US cases. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) to evaluate the performance of our methodology and found a sensitivity of 86.36%, a specificity of 78.94%, a PPV of 90.47% and an NPV of 71.42%. The results indicate that our CDT is capable of detecting cases that are abnormal and positive; in contrast, detecting cases that are benign and negative remains a challenge. Moreover, our CDT performs well when predicting the cases that are abnormal and positive but performs poorly when predicting benign and negative cases. Considering both the sensitivity and PPV, we demonstrate that our CDT can help decrease the number of ASC-US cases.

Given a database that is partitioned between several sites, either horizontally or vertically, we devise secure distributed algorithms that allow the different sites to obtain a k-anonymized and l-diverse view of the union of their databases, without disclosing sensitive information. Our algorithms are based on the sequential algorithm [Goldberger and Tassa 2010] that offers anonymizations with utility that is significantly better than other anonymization algorithms, and in particular those that were implemented so far in the distributed setting. Our algorithms can apply to different generalization techniques and utility measures and to any number of sites. While previous distributed algorithms depend on costly cryptographic primitives, the cryptographic assumptions of our solution are surprisingly minimal.

In this paper, we investigate the concept of active memory operation which is an active data processing operation performed on the memory side. Utilizing the active memory operation, we can replace multiple transactions of memory accesses over the on-chip network and related computations on the processor side with a smaller number of high-level transactions and computations on the memory side. To realize the concept, we have designed a special-purpose processor called active memory processor which is tightly coupled with the memory and executes the active memory operations. In our case studies, we have applied the concept to five real-world applications (parallelized JPEG, FFT, text indexing for data mining, histogram, and eikonal equation solver) running on a 36-tile architecture with 64 cores and four memory tiles and found that the proposed approach can improve performance by 20.5 similar to 259.3 percent.

For this purpose, we carried out a series of experiments on real databases, showing how relational pattern updating influences the quality of classification. We considered three types of relational patterns: classification rules, classification trees, and class representatives. We propose methods for computing class representatives over relational data and an algorithm that applies such patterns in the process of classification. Another goal is to consider relational data and the patterns generated from this as granules in granular computing. We present methods for the granulation of relational data on different levels, such as elementary granules, sequences of granules, and sets of granules. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the power of zooming as a generic activity has not been yet fully realized. In this paper, we explore this idea for the first time in data mining and use it as a powerful technique to link classical methodologies of outlier detection with their counterparts, subsequence discord identification in time series when large and more detailed data are observed where in the latter case, most of the classical methodologies and techniques have become obsolete and fresh approaches of data analysis are overdue. The idea will be demonstrated using a time series of daily household consumption of electricity featuring high frequency, multiple periodicities observed on a near continuous time periods basis. The zooming approach is shown to be both easy to adopt and powerful in linking and identifying outliers and subsequence discords efficiently saving considerable processing time and opens the way for further research in different fields.

We aimed to develop a model for detecting cases of prescription fraud and test it on real world data from a large multi-center medical prescription database. Conventionally, prescription fraud detection is conducted on random samples by human experts. However, the samples might be misleading and manual detection is costly. We propose a novel distance based on data-mining approach for assessing the fraudulent risk of prescriptions regarding cross-features. Final tests have been conducted on adult cardiac surgery database. The results obtained from experiments reveal that the proposed model works considerably well with a true positive rate of 77.4% and a false positive rate of 6% for the fraudulent medical prescriptions. The proposed model has the potential advantages including on-line risk prediction for prescription fraud, off-line analysis of high-risk prescriptions by human experts, and self-learning ability by regular updates of the integrative data sets. We conclude that incorporating such a system in health authorities, social security agencies and insurance companies would improve efficiency of internal review to ensure compliance with the law, and radically decrease human-expert auditing costs.

J	Cebron, N				Cebron, Nicolas			Active improvement of hierarchical object features under budget constraints	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						object hierarchy; machine learning; active learning	RETRIEVAL	When we think of an object in a supervised learning setting, we usually perceive it as a collection of fixed attribute values. Although this setting may be suited well for many classification tasks, we propose a new object representation and therewith a new challenge in data mining; an object is no longer described by one set of attributes but is represented in a hierarchy of attribute sets in different levels of quality. Obtaining a more detailed representation of an object comes with a cost. This raises the interesting question of which objects we want to enhance under a given budget and cost model. This new setting is very useful whenever resources like computing power, memory or time are limited. We propose a new active adaptive algorithm (AAA) to improve objects in an iterative fashion. We demonstrate how to create a hierarchical object representation and prove the effectiveness of our new selection algorithm on these datasets.

Finding Pareto-front Membership Functions in Fuzzy Data Mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						multi-objective optimization; genetic algorithm; fuzzy set; fuzzy association rules; data mining; Pareto front	WEIGHTED ASSOCIATION RULES; MULTIPLE MINIMUM SUPPORTS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; TRADE-OFF; ADAPTATION; REDUCTION; SYSTEMS; NUMBER	Transactions with quantitative values are commonly seen in real-world applications. Fuzzy mining algorithms have thus been developed recently to induce linguistic knowledge from quantitative databases. In fuzzy data mining, the membership functions have a critical influence on the final mining results. How to effectively decide the membership functions in fuzzy data mining thus becomes very important. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy mining approach based on the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to find the Pareto front of the desired membership functions. In this paper, we adopt a more sophisticated multi-objective approach, the SPEA2, to find the appropriate sets of membership functions for fuzzy data mining. Two objective functions are used to find the Pareto front. The first one is the suitability of membership functions and the second one is the total number of large 1-itemsets derived. Experimental comparisons of the proposed and the previous approaches are also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding the Pareto-front membership functions.

However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact.

J	Das, S; Egecioglu, O; El Abbadi, A				Das, Sudipto; Egecioglu, Oemer; El Abbadi, Amr			Anonimos: An LP-Based Approach for Anonymizing Weighted Social Network Graphs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anonymization; social networks; shortest paths; linear programming	PRIVACY	The increasing popularity of social networks has initiated a fertile research area in information extraction and data mining. Anonymization of these social graphs is important to facilitate publishing these data sets for analysis by external entities. Prior work has concentrated mostly on node identity anonymization and structural anonymization. But with the growing interest in analyzing social networks as a weighted network, edge weight anonymization is also gaining importance. We present Anonimos, a Linear Programming-based technique for anonymization of edge weights that preserves linear properties of graphs. Such properties form the foundation of many important graph-theoretic algorithms such as shortest paths problem, k-nearest neighbors, minimum cost spanning tree, and maximizing information spread. As a proof of concept, we apply Anonimos to the shortest paths problem and its extensions, prove the correctness, analyze complexity, and experimentally evaluate it using real social network data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that Anonimos anonymizes the weights, improves k-anonymity of the weights, and also scrambles the relative ordering of the edges sorted by weights, thereby providing robust and effective anonymization of the sensitive edge-weights. We also demonstrate the composability of different models generated using Anonimos, a property that allows a single anonymized graph to preserve multiple linear properties.

All of these algorithms lie at either extreme of the efficiency spectrum; they are either fast and use enormous amounts of space, or they are compact and orders of magnitude slower. In this paper, we present an algorithm that achieves the best of both these extremes, having runtime comparable to the fastest published algorithms while using less space than the most space efficient ones. This excellent practical performance is underpinned by theoretical guarantees. Our main mechanism for keeping memory usage low is to build the enhanced suffix array incrementally, in blocks. Once built, a block is traversed to output patterns with required support before its space is reclaimed to be used for the next block.

J	Dhurandhar, A; Dobra, A				Dhurandhar, Amit; Dobra, Alin			Distribution-free bounds for relational classification	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Relational learning; Bounds; Classification	PROBABILITY-INEQUALITIES; RANDOM-VARIABLES; LEARNABILITY; NETWORKS; SUM	Statistical relational learning (SRL) is a subarea in machine learning which addresses the problem of performing statistical inference on data that is correlated and not independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)-as is generally assumed. For the traditional i.i.d. setting, distribution-free bounds exist, such as the Hoeffding bound, which are used to provide confidence bounds on the generalization error of a classification algorithm given its hold-out error on a sample size of N. Bounds of this form are currently not present for the type of interactions that are considered in the data by relational classification algorithms. In this paper, we extend the Hoeffding bounds to the relational setting. In particular, we derive distribution-free bounds for certain classes of data generation models that do not produce i.i.d. data and are based on the type of interactions that are considered by relational classification algorithms that have been developed in SRL. We conduct empirical studies on synthetic and real data which show that these data generation models are indeed realistic and the derived bounds are tight enough for practical use.

Both groups want to know that their customers' interest in which goods and identify which sequence of the goods that are most popular. The latter group will even change the manner of arrangements of goods in their shops, manner of good order, and manner of warehousing and marketing. Through the information about the fact that customers have bought which products in sequence, suppliers of goods and shop owners could gain profits by providing suitable arrangements in the shelves. Sequence mining is essential for suppliers of goods and shop owners and will lead to an increase in annual profit. This research provides a way in sequences mining of the customer shopping. The research demonstrates that when dataset scanning is repeated several times, it could obtain sequences of the customer shopping in shorter running time. In addition to this, the research also provides a method of finding two-members and higher sequences by Cellular Learning Automata. Its cost is lower than the Apriori, FP-growth and FP-tree based on array, because of the number of total scan on the dataset. Test was done on an online basket data of costumer shopping from UCI Machine Learning and it is clear that the results of this research are much better than other works.

A multi-model approach for long-term runoff modeling using rainfall forecasts	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Rainfall-runoff model; Catchments; Runoff; Recurrent fuzzy system; Data mining	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ETA-MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SOUTH-AMERICA; FUZZY SYSTEM; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; SCHEME; RIVER; IDENTIFICATION	This work presents the development of a rainfall-runoff model for the lguacu River basin in the south of Brazil. The model was developed to support the operational planning of hydroelectric power plants and is intended to compute natural flow predictions based on meteorological rain forecasts. A recurrent fuzzy system model was employed, with parameters estimated by a genetic algorithm using observed rainfall as input. This work presents the recurrent fuzzy model within a multi-model approach, where the input data are furnished as an envelope, resulting in a prediction envelope that has demonstrated the ability to produce robust results.

In general, these platforms are made up of several assistants that handle the different design stages (e.g. definition of the dialog flow, prompt and grammar definition, database connection, or to debug and test the running of the application). In spite of all the advances in this area, in general the process of designing spoken-based dialog services is a time consuming task that needs to be accelerated. In this paper we describe a complete development platform that reduces the design time by using different types of acceleration strategies based on using information from the data model structure and database contents, as well as cumulative information obtained throughout the successive steps in the design. Thanks to these accelerations, the interaction with the platform is simplified and the design is reduced, in most cases, to simple confirmations to the "proposals" that the platform automatically provides at each stage. Different kinds of proposals are available to complete the application flow such as the possibility of selecting which information slots should be requested to the user together, predefined templates for common dialogs, the most probable actions that make up each state defined in the flow, different solutions to solve specific speech-modality problems such as the presentation of the lists of retrieved results after querying the backend database. The platform also includes accelerations for creating speech grammars and prompts, and the SQL queries for accessing the database at runtime. Finally, we will describe the setup and results obtained in a simultaneous summative, subjective and objective evaluations with different designers used to test the usability of the proposed accelerations as well as their contribution to reducing the design time and interaction.

While the data structure is of independent interest, we demonstrate its use in the context of high-radiation environments. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the resulting approach leads to a significantly higher resiliency rate compared to previous results. This is especially the case for large-scale multi-spectral satellite data, which renders the proposed approach well-suited to operate aboard today's satellites.

In this paper, the relevant data and information for an established automotive spare-parts distribution and after-sales services company (ISACO) for a 3-year period have been analyzed. With respect to the diversity and lot size of the available information such as stores location, order, goods, transportation vehicles and road and traffic information, three effecting factors with specific weights have been defined for the similarity function: 1. Euclidean distance, 2. Lot size 3. Order concurrency. Based on these three factors, the similarity function has been examined through 5 steps using the Association Rules principles, where the clustering of the stores is performed using k-means algorithm and similar stores are allocated to the clusters. These steps include: 1. Similarity function based on the Euclidean distances, 2. Similarity function based on the order concurrency, 3. Similarity function based on the combination of the order concurrency and lot size, 4. Similarity function based on the combination of these three factors and 5. Improved similarity function. The above mentioned clustering operation for each 5 cases addressed in data mining have been carried out using R software and the improved combinational function has been chosen as the optimal clustering function. Then, trend of each retail store have been analyzed using the improved combinational function and along with determining the priority of the depot center establishment for every cluster, the appropriate distribution policies have been formulated for every cluster. The obtained results of this study indicate a significant cost reduction (32%) in automotive spare-parts distribution and transportation costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prior classification analysis research predominately focuses on constructing a classification model from training instances that involve non-time-series attributes. Direct application of traditional classification analysis techniques to time-series classification problems requires the transformation of time-series attributes into non-time-series ones by applying some statistical operations (e.g., average, sum, variance). However, such statistical-transformation-based approach often results in information loss and, in turn, imperils classification effectiveness. In this study, we propose a time-series classification technique based on the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classification approach. Using churn prediction of the mobile telecommunications industry as an evaluation application, our empirical evaluation results show that the proposed kNN-based time-series classification (kNN-TSC) technique achieves better performance (measured by miss and false alarm rates) than the statistical-transformation-based approach does.

J	Liu, TT; Wang, F; Agrawal, G				Liu, Tantan; Wang, Fan; Agrawal, Gagan			Stratified sampling for data mining on the deep web	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						deep web; associate rule mining; stratified sampling	ALGORITHMS; QUERIES; SETS	In recent years, the deep web has become extremely popular. Like any other data source, data mining on the deep web can produce important insights or summaries of results. However, data mining on the deep web is challenging because the databases cannot be accessed directly, and therefore, data mining must be performed by sampling the datasets. The samples, in turn, can only be obtained by querying deep web databases with specific inputs. In this paper, we target two related data mining problems, association mining and differential rule mining. These are proposed to extract high-level summaries of the differences in data provided by different deep web data sources in the same domain. We develop stratified sampling methods to perform these mining tasks on a deep web source. Our contributions include a novel greedy stratification approach, which recursively processes the query space of a deep web data source, and considers both the estimation error and the sampling costs. We have also developed an optimized sample allocation method that integrates estimation error and sampling costs. Our experimental results show that our algorithms effectively and consistently reduce sampling costs, compared with a stratified sampling method that only considers estimation error. In addition, compared with simple random sampling, our algorithm has higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling costs.

When this happens, a Darwinian-like "natural selection" phenomenon ensures that they will be placed in the most disadvantageous position in the asset management program, negatively affecting multiple aspects of the operational and maintenance organizations. Rogue components have long plagued the airline industry and created havoc in their asset management programs. In this paper, we describe how these rogues develop, outline the natural selection process that leads to their hampering the asset management program, and examine some of the negative impacts that ensue. Then we propose a Condition based maintenance approach to control the development of these components. We explore the use of a supervised learning data mining technique called Logical analysis of data (LAD) in CBM for the purpose of detecting rogues within a population of repairable components. We apply the resulting LAD based decision model on an inventory of turbo compressors belonging to an airline fleet. Finally, we evaluate the applicability of LAD to the rogue component detection problem and review its efficiency as a decision model for this type of problem.

However, some types of requirements are elicited completely after the scheduled requirements elicitation process. is finished. Such a situation is regarded as problematic situation. In our study, the difficulties of eliciting various kinds of requirements is observed by components. We refer to the components as observation targets (OTs) and introduce the word "Requirements maturation." It means when and how requirements are elicited completely in the project. The requirements maturation is discussed on physical and logical OTs. OTs Viewed from a logical viewpoint are called logical OTs, e.g. quality requirements. The requirements of physical OTs, e.g., modules, components, subsystems, etc., includes functional and non-functional requirements. They are influenced by their requesters' environmental changes, as well as developers' technical changes. In order to infer the requirements maturation period of each OT, we need to know how much these factors influence the OTs' requirements maturation. According to the observation of actual past projects, we defined the PRINCE (Pre Requirements Intelligence Net Consideration and Evaluation) model. It aims to guide developers in their observation of the requirements maturation of OTs. We quantitatively analyzed the actual cases with their requirements elicitation process and extracted essential factors that influence the requirements maturation. The results of interviews of project managers are analyzed by WEKA, a data mining system, from which the decision tree was derived. This paper introduces the PRINCE model and the category of logical OTs to be observed. The decision tree that helps developers infer the maturation type of an OT is also described. We evaluate the tree through real projects and discuss its ability to infer the requirements maturation types.

However, since in-order processors lack complex hardware support for tolerating long-latency memory accesses, developing compiler technologies to hide such latencies becomes critical. Compiler-directed prefetching has been demonstrated effective on some applications. On the application side, a large class of data centric applications has emerged to explore the underlying properties of the explosively growing data. These applications, in contrast to traditional benchmarks, are characterized by substantial thread-level parallelism, complex and unpredictable control flow, as well as intensive and irregular memory access patterns. These applications are expected to be the dominating workloads on future microprocessors. Thus, in this paper, we investigated the effectiveness of compiler-directed prefetching on data mining applications in in-order multicore systems. Our study reveals that although properly inserted prefetch instructions can often effectively reduce memory access latencies for data mining applications, the compiler is not always able to exploit this potential. Compiler-directed prefetching can become inefficient in the presence of complex control flow and memory access patterns; and architecture dependent behaviors. The integration of multithreaded execution onto a single die makes it even more difficult for the compiler to insert prefetch instructions, since optimizations that are effective for single-threaded execution may or may not be effective in multithreaded execution. Thus, compiler-directed prefetching must be judiciously deployed to avoid creating performance bottlenecks that otherwise do not exist. Our experiences suggest that dynamic performance tuning techniques that adjust to the behaviors of a program can potentially facilitate the deployment of aggressive optimizations in data mining applications.

J	Ordonez, C; Chen, ZB				Ordonez, Carlos; Chen, Zhibo			Horizontal Aggregations in SQL to Prepare Data Sets for Data Mining Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Aggregation; data preparation; pivoting; SQL		Preparing a data set for analysis is generally the most time consuming task in a data mining project, requiring many complex SQL queries, joining tables, and aggregating columns. Existing SQL aggregations have limitations to prepare data sets because they return one column per aggregated group. In general, a significant manual effort is required to build data sets, where a horizontal layout is required. We propose simple, yet powerful, methods to generate SQL code to return aggregated columns in a horizontal tabular layout, returning a set of numbers instead of one number per row. This new class of functions is called horizontal aggregations. Horizontal aggregations build data sets with a horizontal denormalized layout (e.g., point-dimension, observation-variable, instance-feature), which is the standard layout required by most data mining algorithms. We propose three fundamental methods to evaluate horizontal aggregations: CASE: Exploiting the programming CASE construct; SPJ: Based on standard relational algebra operators (SPJ queries); PIVOT: Using the PIVOT operator, which is offered by some DBMSs. Experiments with large tables compare the proposed query evaluation methods. Our CASE method has similar speed to the PIVOT operator and it is much faster than the SPJ method. In general, the CASE and PIVOT methods exhibit linear scalability, whereas the SPJ method does not.

Similarity search over trajectories is imperative for supporting such tasks. Related works in the field, mainly inspired from the time-series domain, employ generic similarity metrics that ignore the peculiarity and complexity of the trajectory data type. Aiming at providing a powerful toolkit for analysts, in this paper we propose a framework that provides several trajectory similarity measures, based on primitive (space and time) as well as on derived parameters of trajectories (speed, acceleration, and direction), which quantify the distance between two trajectories and can be exploited for trajectory data mining, including clustering and classification. We evaluate the proposed similarity measures through an extensive experimental study over synthetic (for measuring efficiency) and real (for assessing effectiveness) trajectory datasets. In particular, the latter could serve as an iterative, combinational knowledge discovery methodology enhanced with visual analytics that provides analysts with a powerful tool for "hands-on" analysis for trajectory data.

By several combined techniques (Fourier and wavelet transform, derivative dynamic time warping, and waveform recognition), our approach extracts meaningful features (frequencies and special patterns like k-complexes and sleep spindles) from physiological recordings containing EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG data. Based on these pieces of information, an ensemble of decision trees is constructed using the principle of bagging, which classifies sleep epochs in their sleep stages according to the rules by Rechtschaffen and Kales and annotates occurrences of apnea-hypopnea (total or partial cessation of respiration). After that, case-based reasoning is applied in order to improve quality. We tested and evaluated our approach on several large public databases from PhysioBank, which showed an overall accuracy of 95.2% for sleep stage scoring and 94.5% for classifying minutes as apneic or non-apneic.

The proposed method handles sample "overlap" efficiently with spectral clustering, overcoming the disadvantages of over-fitting well, and improving the data mining efficiency greatly. Simulation provides clear evidences to the new method.

This study proposes a rule extraction algorithm from SVMs that uses a kernel-based clustering algorithm to integrate all support vectors and genetic algorithms into extracted rule sets. This study uses measurements of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, coverage, fidelity and comprehensibility to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the public credit screening data sets. Results indicate that the proposed method performs better than other rule extraction algorithms. Thus, the proposed algorithm is an essential analysis tool that can be effectively used in data mining fields.

Despite the benefits, there is no known automated method for formulating and tailoring an optimized interval training protocol for a specific individual that maximizes the amount of calories burned while limiting fatigue. Additionally, an application that provides the aforementioned optimal training protocol must also provide motivation for repetitious and tedious exercises necessary to improve a patient's adherence. This paper presents a system that efficiently formulates an optimized interval training method for each individual by using data mining schemes on attributes, conditions, and data gathered from individuals exercise sessions. This system uses accelerometers embedded within iPhones, a Bluetooth pulse oximeter, and the Weka data mining tool to formulate optimized interval training protocols and has been shown to increase the amount of calories burned by 29.54% as compared to the modified Tabata interval training protocol. We also developed a behavioral cueing system that uses music and performance feedback to provide motivation during interval training exercise sessions. By measuring a user's performance through sensor readings, we are able to play songs that match the user's workout plan. A hybrid collaborative, content, and context-aware filtering algorithm incorporates the user's music preferences and the exercise speed to enhance performance.

J	Vucina, D; Lozina, Z; Pehnec, I				Vucina, Damir; Lozina, Zeljan; Pehnec, Igor			Computational procedure for optimum shape design based on chained Bezier surfaces parameterization	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Shape representation/compaction; Geometric modeling; Parameterization; Chained Bezier surfaces; Genetic algorithms; Shape optimization	STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; ELEMENTS; SPLINES	Optimum design introduces strong emphasis on compact geometry parameterization in order to reduce the dimensionality of the search space and consequently optimization run-time. This paper develops a decision support system for optimum shape which integrates geometric knowledge acquisition using 3D scanning and evolutionary shape re-engineering by applying genetic-algorithm based optimum search within a distributed computing workflow. A shape knowledge representation and compaction method is developed by creating 2D and 3D parameterizations based on adaptive chaining of piecewise Bezier curves and surfaces. Low-degree patches are used with adaptive subdivision of the target domain, thereby preserving locality. C-1 intersegment continuity is accomplished by generating additional control points without increasing the number of design variables. The control points positions are redistributed and compressed towards the sharp edges contained in the data-set for better representation of areas with sharp change in slopes and curvatures. The optimal decomposition of the points cloud or target surface into patches is based on the requested modeling accuracy, which works as lossy geometric data-set compression. The proposed method has advantages in non-recursive evaluation, possibility of chaining patches of different degrees, options of prescribing fixed values at selected intermediate points while maintaining C1 continuity, and uncoupled processing of individual patches. The developed procedure executes external application nodes using mutual communication via native data files and data mining. This adaptive interdisciplinary workflow integrates different algorithms and programs (3D shape acquisition, representation of geometry with data-set compaction using parametric surfaces, geometric modeling, distributed evolutionary optimization) such that optimized shape solutions are synthesized. 2D and 3D test cases encompassing holes and sharp edges are provided to prove the capacity and respective performance of the developed parameterizations, and the resulting optimized shapes for different load cases demonstrate the functionality of the overall distributed workflow.

It is a key technique in data mining and has become an important issue in many fields. This article presents a new clustering algorithm based on the mechanism analysis of Bacterial Foraging (BF). It is an optimization methodology for clustering problem in which a group of bacteria forage to converge to certain positions as final cluster centers by minimizing the fitness function. The quality of this approach is evaluated on several well-known benchmark data sets. Compared with the popular clustering method named k-means algorithm, ACO-based algorithm and the PSO-based clustering technique, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is an effective clustering technique and can be used to handle data sets with various cluster sizes, densities and multiple dimensions.

Successful discovery of the thematic object is helpful for object search and tagging, video summarization and understanding, etc. However, this task is challenging because 1) there lacks a priori knowledge of the thematic objects, such as their shapes, scales, locations, and times of re-occurrences, and 2) the thematic object of interest can be under severe variations in appearances due to viewpoint and lighting condition changes, scale variations, etc. Instead of using a top-down generative model to discover thematic visual patterns, we propose a novel bottom-up approach to gradually prune uncommon local visual primitives and recover the thematic objects. A multilayer candidate pruning procedure is designed to accelerate the image data mining process. Our solution can efficiently locate thematic objects of various sizes and can tolerate large appearance variations of the same thematic object. Experiments on challenging image and video data sets and comparisons with existing methods validate the effectiveness of our method.

J	Yuan, JS; Wu, Y				Yuan, Junsong; Wu, Ying			Mining Visual Collocation Patterns via Self-Supervised Subspace Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Image data mining; visual collocation pattern; visual pattern discovery	RECOGNITION; IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; DISCOVERY; OBJECTS; MODEL	Traditional text data mining techniques are not directly applicable to image data which contain spatial information and are characterized by high-dimensional visual features. It is not a trivial task to discover meaningful visual patterns from images because the content variations and spatial dependence in visual data greatly challenge most existing data mining methods. This paper presents a novel approach to coping with these difficulties for mining visual collocation patterns. Specifically, the novelty of this work lies in the following new contributions: 1) a principled solution to the discovery of visual collocation patterns based on frequent itemset mining and 2) a self-supervised subspace learning method to refine the visual codebook by feeding back discovered patterns via subspace learning. The experimental results show that our method can discover semantically meaningful patterns efficiently and effectively.

J	Anwar, F; Petrounias, I; Morris, T; Kodogiannis, V				Anwar, Fahad; Petrounias, Ilias; Morris, Tim; Kodogiannis, Vassilis			Mining anomalous events against frequent sequences in surveillance videos from commercial environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Data mining; Sequential pattern mining; Periodicity mining; Surveillance videos; Business intelligence; Video mining; Anomalous events mining		In the UK alone there are currently over 4.2 million operational CCTV cameras, that is virtually one camera for every 14th person, and this figure is increasing at a fast rate throughout the world (especially after the tragic events of 9/11 and 7/7) (Norris, McCahill, & Wood, 2004). Security concerns are not the only factor driving the rapid growth of CCTV cameras. Another important reason is the access of hidden knowledge extracted from CCTV footage to be used for effective business decision making, such as store designing, customer services, product marketing, reducing store shrinkage, etc. Events occurring in observed scenes are one of the most important semantic entities that can be extracted from videos (Anwar & Naftel, 2008). Most of the work presented in the past is based upon finding frequent event patterns or deals with discovering already known abnormal events. In contrast, in this paper we present a framework to discover unknown anomalous events associated with a frequent sequence of events (A(EASP)): that is to discover events, which are unlikely to follow a frequent sequence of events. This information can be very useful for discovering unknown abnormal events and can provide early actionable intelligence to redeploy resources to specific areas of view (such as PTZ camera or attention of a CCTV user). Discovery of anomalous events against a sequential pattern can also provide business intelligence for store management in the retail sector. The proposed event mining framework is an extension to our previous research work presented in Anwar et al. (2010) and also takes the temporal aspect of anomalous events against frequent sequence of events into consideration, that is to discover anomalous events which are true for a specific time interval only and might not be an anomalous events against frequent sequence of events over a whole time spectrum and vice versa. To confront the memory expensive process of searching all the instances of multiple sequential patterns in each data sequence an efficient dynamic sequential pattern search mechanism is introduced. Different experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed anomalous events against frequent sequence of events mining algorithm's accuracy and performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Baig, AR; Shahzad, W				Baig, Abdul Rauf; Shahzad, Waseem			A correlation-based ant miner for classification rule discovery	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); Classification rules; Data mining; Swarm intelligence		In recent years, a few sequential covering algorithms for classification rule discovery based on the ant colony optimization meta-heuristic (ACO) have been proposed. This paper proposes a new ACO-based classification algorithm called AntMiner-C. Its main feature is a heuristic function based on the correlation among the attributes. Other highlights include the manner in which class labels are assigned to the rules prior to their discovery, a strategy for dynamically stopping the addition of terms in a rule's antecedent part, and a strategy for pruning redundant rules from the rule set. We study the performance of our proposed approach for twelve commonly used data sets and compare it with the original AntMiner algorithm, decision tree builder C4.5, Ripper, logistic regression technique, and a SVM. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate obtained by AntMiner-C is better than that of the compared algorithms. However, the average number of rules and average terms per rule are higher.

J	Chen, YJ; Chen, YB				Chen, Yangjun; Chen, Yibin			Subtree Reconstruction, Query Node Intervals and Tree Pattern Query Evaluation	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						XML documents; tree pattern queries; tree matching; tree encoding; XB-trees	XPATH	Since the extensible markup language XML emerged as a new standard for information representation and exchange on the Internet, the problem of storing, indexing, and querying XML documents has been among the major issues of database research. In this paper, we study the tree pattern matching and discuss a new algorithm for processing ordered tree pattern queries, by which not only ancestor/descendant relationships, but also left-to-right ordering of query nodes are considered. Such kind of tree matching has many applications in practice, such as the linguistic analysis, the video content-based retrieval, as well as the computational biology and the data mining. The time complexities of the new algorithm is bounded by O(vertical bar D vertical bar . vertical bar Q vertical bar + vertical bar T vertical bar . leaf(Q)) and its space overhead is by O(leaf(T) . leaf(Q)), where T stands for a document tree, Q for a tree pattern and D is the largest data stream among all the data streams associated with the nodes in Q. Each data stream contains the database nodes that match the predicate at a node q. leaf(T) (leaf(Q)) represents the number of the leaf nodes of T(resp. Q). In addition, the algorithm can be adapted to an indexing environment with XB-trees being used. Experiments have been conducted, which shows that our algorithm is promising.

J	Chen, ZX				Chen, Zhengxin			DATABASE KEYWORD SEARCH: BEYOND ITS CURRENT LANDSCAPE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Datebase keyword search (DB KWS); data mining; behavior mining; dataspace		As an active research field, database keyword search (KWS) has put much emphasis on the performance issues, due to its high computational cost. However, a closer examination on KWS reveals that there are some other interesting aspects worth noting. In this paper, we examine KWS from a broader perspective, analyzing its profound implications. Freed from syntax-related considerations, KWS users now have better opportunities to explore the data in the way as they wish, and such exploration may reveal useful hindsight for understanding the hidden nature of the data, thus benefiting the exploitation on the use of the data. In particular, we examine the potential of KWS to data mining from the behavior mining perspective. This examination also leads us to a discussion of viewing KWS in the "web of life" context. We further discuss connections of KWS with other related concepts, including dataspace. Based on our findings and critical examination, we also provide a brief overview of an integrated environment which facilitates the interplay of KWS and data mining.

J	Cheng, LC; Sun, LM				Cheng, Li-Chen; Sun, Li-Min			Exploring consumer adoption of new services by analyzing the behavior of 3G subscribers: An empirical case study	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						3G application services; Association rules; Data mining; Mobile commerce; RFM model	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; MOBILE COMMERCE; SEGMENTATION; INTENTION; INTERNET; MODEL	As the profit margins of 3G mobile network operators gradually decline, and market competition becomes increasingly intensive, they must develop rich and diverse varieties of brand new application services to attract new subscribers and retain old ones. Understanding the customer's purchasing behavior is a key issue in this process. The operator must accurately grasp movements in the market based on analysis of the behavior of 3G subscribers. This study proposes a comprehensive customer relationship management strategy framework to furnish a beneficial plan to overcome such challenges. First, we propose a new model to identify who are the high-value customers related to the characteristics of new telecommunication services. After segmenting the customers, we propose a procedure to provide different kinds of usage analysis, including inter-cluster analysis and intra-cluster analysis. The experimental results are determined based on rules extracted from a large number of call detail records generated by the mobile subscribers of leading 3G mobile system operators in Taiwan. The dependency network demonstrates the relationship between voice services, data communications, message services, micropayments and entertainment. Finally, we propose some marketing recommendations for 3G system operators based on these interesting rules. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Deng, ZH; Xu, XR				Deng, Zhi-Hong; Xu, Xiao-Ran			Fast mining erasable itemsets using NC_sets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Erasable itemsets; NC_sets; Algorithms; Data structure	FREQUENT PATTERNS; ALGORITHM	Mining erasable itemsets first introduced in 2009 is one of new emerging data mining tasks. In this paper, we present a new data representation called NC_set, which keeps track of the complete information used for mining erasable itemsets. Based on NC_set, we propose a new algorithm called MERIT for mining erasable itemsets efficiently. The efficiency of MERIT is achieved with three techniques as follows. First, the NC_set is a compact structure, which prunes irrelevant data automatically. Second, the computation of the gain of an itemset is transformed into the combination of NC_sets, which can be completed in linear time complexity by an ingenious strategy. Third, MERIT can directly find erasable itemsets without generating candidate itemsets in some cases. For evaluating MERIT, we have conducted extensive experiments on a lot of synthetic product databases. Our performance study shows that the MERIT is efficient and is on average about two orders of magnitude faster than the META, the first algorithm for mining erasable itemsets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Advanced data mining methods designed especially for these temporal data support the domain expert's pursuit to understand phenomena as the climate change, which is crucial for a sustainable world. Important solutions for mining temporal data are cluster tracing approaches, which are used to mine temporal evolutions of clusters. Generally, clusters represent groups of objects with similar values. In a temporal context like tracing, similar values correspond to similar behavior in one snapshot in time. Each cluster can be interpreted as a behavior type and cluster tracing corresponds to tracking similar behaviors over time. Existing tracing approaches are for datasets satisfying two specific conditions: The clusters appear in all attributes, i.e., fullspace clusters, and the data objects have unique identifiers. These identifiers are used for tracking clusters by measuring the number of objects two clusters have in common, i.e. clusters are traced based on similar object sets. These conditions, however, are strict: First, in complex data, clusters are often hidden in individual subsets of the dimensions. Second, mapping clusters based on similar objects sets does not reflect the idea of tracing similar behavior types over time, because similar behavior can even be represented by clusters having no objects in common. A tracing method based on similar object values is needed. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that traces subspace clusters based on object value similarity. Neither subspace tracing nor tracing by object value similarity has been done before.

J	Ienco, D; Pensa, RG; Meo, R				Ienco, Dino; Pensa, Ruggero G.; Meo, Rosa			From Context to Distance: Learning Dissimilarity for Categorical Data Clustering	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Categorical data; clustering; distance learning	ALGORITHM; VALUES	Clustering data described by categorical attributes is a challenging task in data mining applications. Unlike numerical attributes, it is difficult to define a distance between pairs of values of a categorical attribute, since the values are not ordered. In this article, we propose a framework to learn a context-based distance for categorical attributes. The key intuition of this work is that the distance between two values of a categorical attribute A(i) can be determined by the way in which the values of the other attributes A(j) are distributed in the dataset objects: if they are similarly distributed in the groups of objects in correspondence of the distinct values of A(i) a low value of distance is obtained. We propose also a solution to the critical point of the choice of the attributes A(j). We validate our approach by embedding our distance learning framework in a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We applied it on various real world and synthetic datasets, both low and high-dimensional. Experimental results show that our method is competitive with respect to the state of the art of categorical data clustering approaches. We also show that our approach is scalable and has a low impact on the overall computational time of a clustering task.

One strategy is applying data mining techniques to software metric and defect data collected during the software development process to identify potential low-quality program modules. In this paper, we investigate the use of feature selection in the context of software quality estimation (also referred to as software defect prediction), where a classification model is used to predict whether program modules (instances) are fault-prone or not-fault-prone. Seven filter-based feature ranking techniques are examined. Among them, six are commonly used, and the other one, named signal to noise ratio (SNR), is rarely employed. The objective of the paper is to compare these seven techniques for various software data sets and assess their effectiveness for software quality modeling. A case study is performed on 16 software data sets, and classification models are built with five different learners and evaluated with two performance metrics. Our experimental results are summarized based on statistical tests for significance. The main conclusion is that the SNR technique performs as well as the best performer of the six commonly used techniques.

J	Lee, GL; Zhu, YT; Chen, YC				Lee, Guanling; Zhu, Yu-tang; Chen, Yi-Chun			Summarizing Association Patterns Efficiently by Using PI Tree in a Data Stream Environment	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Association patterns; Knowledge discovery; Data stream; Data mining	RULES; ALGORITHM	In the age of Knowledge economy, people are paying more attention to data mining; especially association patterns mining in owing to valuable information have often been buried with irrelevant noise. However, the number of the association patterns often exceeds the capacity of human's mind. Therefore, it is necessary to present patterns according to their interestingness effectively. On the other hand, the interestingness of patterns vary from different situation; people are interesting in revealing undiscovered truths, but also boring when they are familiar with them. Therefore, this approach focuses on continuously differentiating interesting and valuable patterns from data stream, which is the issue for Interestingness-oriented Knowledge Discovery (IOKD). Several principles and interestingness measures are proposed for modeling and measuring the interestingness of association patterns in a data stream. A new data structure, Pattern's Interestingness Tree (PI-Tree) is presented for discovering frequent patterns and helping to distinguish interesting knowledge. Performance Analysis indicates that the proposed approach is efficient for IOKD.

In many application domains (e.g., biology), the frequent subsequences confined by the predefined gap requirements are more meaningful than the general sequential patterns. In this article, we propose two algorithms, Gap-BIDE for mining closed gap-constrained subsequences from a set of input sequences, and Gap-Connect for mining repetitive gap-constrained subsequences from a single input sequence. Inspired by some state-of-the-art closed or constrained sequential pattern mining algorithms, the Gap-BIDE algorithm adopts an efficient approach to finding the complete set of closed sequential patterns with gap constraints, while the Gap-Connect algorithm efficiently mines an approximate set of long patterns by connecting short patterns. We also present several methods for feature selection from the set of gap-constrained patterns for the purpose of classification and clustering. Our extensive performance study shows that our approaches are very efficient in mining frequent subsequences with gap constraints, and the gap-constrained pattern based classification/clustering approaches can achieve high-quality results.

In this paper, a new research problem of mining data streams for sequential patterns is defined. A data stream is an unbound sequence of data elements arriving at a rapid rate. Based on the characteristics of data streams, the problem complexity of mining data streams for sequential patterns is more difficult than that of mining sequential patterns from large static databases. Therefore, mining sequential patterns from data streams is a challenging research issue of data mining and knowledge discovery. Hence, an efficient single-pass algorithm, called IncSparn (Incremental Sequential pattern mining of streaming itemset-sequences), is proposed for discovering sequential patterns from streaming itemset-sequences over extended sliding window models. In the framework of IncSpam algorithm, a new sliding window model, called CSW-BV (Customer Sliding Window with Bit-Vectors), and an extended lexicographic tree-based data structure, called LesSeq-Tree (Lexicographic Sequence Tree), are developed to reduce the time and memory needed to slide the windows over streaming data and maintain all sequential patterns of current sliding windows. Experimental results show that the proposed method is an efficient single-pass algorithm for mining sequential patterns from streaming data.

J	Lin, CW; Hong, TP				Lin, Chun-Wei; Hong, Tzung-Pei			A new mining approach for uncertain databases using CUFP trees	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; CUFP tree; FP tree; Uncertain database; Existential probability	ASSOCIATION RULES; FREQUENT ITEMSETS; PERSPECTIVE; GENERATION; ALGORITHM	In the past, many algorithms have been proposed to mine frequent itemsets from transactional databases, in which the presence or absence of items in transactions was certainly known. In some applications, items may also be uncertain in transactions with their existential probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 in the uncertain dataset. Apparently, the processing in uncertain datasets is quite different from those in certain datasets. The UF-tree algorithm was proposed to construct the UF-tree structure from an uncertain dataset and mine frequent itemsets from the tree. In the UF-tree construction process, however, only the same items with the same existential probabilities in transactions were merged together in the tree, thus causing many redundant nodes in the tree. In this paper, a new tree structure called the compressed uncertain frequent-pattern tree (CUFP tree) is designed to efficiently keep the related information in the mining process. In the CUFP tree, the same items will be merged in a branch of the tree even when the existential probabilities in transactions are not the same. A mining algorithm called the CUFP-mine algorithm is then proposed based on the tree structure to find uncertain frequent patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better performance than UF-tree algorithm both in the execution time and in the number of tree nodes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, super-market transaction datasets are generally temporal in the sense that, when a transaction happens in a supermarket, the time of the transaction is also recorded. A number of techniques have been proposed to find frequent itemsets from temporal datasets in which each itemset is associated with a list of time intervals in which it is frequent. Considering the time of transactions as calendar dates, there may exist various types of periodic patterns viz. yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc. And, if the time internals associated with a periodic itemset are kept in a compact manner then it turns out to be a fuzzy time interval for which the set superimposition method can be used. In this paper, we propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to find clusters among the periodic itemsets. Since the fuzzy number is invariant with respect to shifting, we define similarity measure using the variance of fuzzy intervals associated with frequent itemsets. The efficacy of the proposed method is established through experimentation on real datasets.

The tasks covered by 10 case studies range from the detection of anomalies such as cancer, fraud, and system failures to the optimization of organizational operations, and include the automated extraction of information from unstructured sources. From the 10 cases we find that supervised methods prevail while unsupervised techniques play a supporting role. Further, significant domain knowledge is generally required to achieve a completed solution. Finally, we find that successful applications are more commonly associated with continual improvement rather than by single "aha moments" of knowledge ("nugget") discovery.

J	Meskine, F; Bahloul, SN				Meskine, Fatima; Bahloul, Safia Nait			Privacy Preserving K-means Clustering: A Survey Research	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						k-means clustering algorithm; secure multi-party computation; distributed data; privacy preserving	ASSOCIATION RULES	The clustering is an exploratory task of data mining. This raised a real problem of privacy when the data are from different sources. Most of researches on privacy preservation in clustering are developed for k-means clustering algorithm, by applying the secure multi-party computation framework. The distribution of data may be different (vertical, horizontal or arbitrary). Approaches allowing solving the problem on a vertical, horizontal and even arbitrary partitioned dataset were proposed. The major interest is to reveal the minimum of information during the execution of the algorithm, especially in k-means iterations, which poses a real challenge for secure multi party computation. This work consists to study and analyze all works of privacy preserving in the k-means algorithm, classify the various approaches according to the used data distribution while presenting the weaknesses and the strong points of each protocol regards to privacy. The interest is to arise the real needs of privacy during the execution of the different steps of k-mean algorithm, thus to discover the best of approaches in case of preserving privacy in k-means algorithm.

J	Qu, GZ; Wu, H				Qu, Guangzhi; Wu, Hui			Bucket Learning: Improving model quality through enhancing local patterns	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bucket Learning; Global model; Local pattern; Data mining; Classification	ENSEMBLE	It is always desirable to improve the quality of a global classification model in the light of the existing models. In this work, the Bucket Learning methodology is first proposed to improve the model quality by enhancing its local patterns. We formally define the concept of a board as a tri-tuple (D,M,R), which unifies the data view, model view and evaluation view of a data mining task. The Bucket Learning framework includes the modules of Boards Generation, Short Boards Discovery, and Short Boards Replacement. A prototypical system is developed to verify the proposed methodology. The experimental results on eight representative data sets from the UCI data repository show that Bucket Learning performs better than traditional classification methods such as J48, AdaBoost, Bagging and LogitBoost. We also demonstrate that the Bucket Learning framework can combine all kinds of data classification models and that the combined model outperforms each individual one. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We believe that now is the right time to devise non-signature based zero-day (previously unknown) malware detection strategies before Linux intruders take us by surprise. Therefore, in this paper, we first do a forensic analysis of Linux executable and linkable format (ELF) files. Our forensic analysis provides insight into different features that have the potential to discriminate malicious executables from benign ones. As a result, we can select a features' set of 383 features that are extracted from an ELF headers. We quantify the classification potential of features using information gain and then remove redundant features by employing preprocessing filters. Finally, we do an extensive evaluation among classical rule-based machine learning classifiers-RIPPER, PART, C4.5 Rules, and decision tree J48-and bio-inspired classifiers-cAnt Miner, UCS, XCS, and GAssist-to select the best classifier for our system. We have evaluated our approach on an available collection of 709 Linux malware samples from vx heavens and offensive computing. Our experiments show that ELF-Miner provides more than 99% detection accuracy with less than 0.1% false alarm rate.

IMPROVING MISSING-VALUE ESTIMATION IN MICROARRAY DATA WITH COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED ON ROUGH-SET THEORY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Collaborative filtering; Rough-set theory; Gene expression data; Missing values; Imputation	GENE-EXPRESSION; SEMANTIC SIMILARITY; ONTOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; IMPUTATION; ALGORITHM	Data mining techniques have been used to extract useful knowledge from DNA microarray gene expression data for discovering the relations between novel diseases and their related genes. However, DNA microarray gene expression data often contain missing values that must be dealt with to prevent them from significantly affecting analysis results. Hence, a number of missing-value imputation approaches have been proposed. In this paper, an intelligent imputation approach named the CFBRST (Collaborative Filtering Based on Rough-Set Theory) method is proposed to impute missing values more accurately than currently done by existing approaches. Experimental results on real microarray gene expression datasets reveal that the proposed approach can effectively improve missing-value estimation. The collaborative filtering (CF) approach is often used in recommender systems due to its excellent performance. The proposed CFRBS method is based on the CF method and rough-set theory. The CFBRST method is compared with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) imputation algorithm. Experimental results show that the CFBRST method has better accuracy than that of a k-NN approach for yeast cDNA microarray datasets, especially when the percentage of missing values is high.

J	Wang, DP; Brenner, M				Wang, Daping; Brenner, Michael			Augmented Reality: Service Construction via a 4D Communication Model	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article								Connecting people is the ultimate goal of telecommunication. With advances in computing capability and ubiquitous access to various data, today's connection is focused on the blended information delivered by a converged mechanism, driven by the consumer's thirst for digital social interaction. Leveraging technologies like data mining, service-indication texting, and synthesized imaging, next-generation applications are incorporating more information into our daily communication. More services hence emerge from this kind of data federation. This article explores potential service augmentation by placing communication in a four-dimensional model that combines service delivery and external data augmentation. Using categorized information obtained by data mining techniques, a specially designed service indication text language could bring user interactivity to new levels. Tele-reality converges toward use of synthesized images or videos that are generated by merging and processing information about people, place, time, mode, weather, recent events and more. In addition, this article also illustrates how current standard user profiles and application programming interfaces are leveraged in order to accommodate such services.

A manufacturing execution system is very appropriate to monitor and control the activities on the shop floor. Therefore, a specialized scheduler, which is the focus of this paper, has been developed to run at the core of such a system. The scheduler builds on the very general Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Generalized Precedence Relations. Each local decision step (e.g. choosing a route in the plant layout) is modeled as a separate module interconnected in a feedback loop. The quality of the generated schedules will guide the overall search process to continuously improve the decisions at an intermediate level by using local search strategies. Besides optimization methods, data mining techniques are applied to historical data in order to feed the scheduling process with realistic background knowledge on key performance indicators, such as processing times, setup times, breakdowns, etc. The approach leads to substantial speed and quality improvements of the scheduling process compared to the manual practice common in production companies. Moreover, our modular approach allows for further extending or improving modules separately, without interfering with other modules. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fuzzy Modeling Built Through a Data Mining Process	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Decision Tree; Fuzzy Modeling; Virtual Teaching Learning Environment		This work uses fuzzy logic to identify the learning profile of students in a teaching and learning environment. The purpose of this identification is to lead the student to more appropriate use of the available resources in the environment. The fuzzy modeling has been developed from a process of data mining. The mined data set has several learning profiles of several students. The classification method called Decision Tree (DT) was applied in the mining process, and for the comparison two algorithms were used. The analysis of data from the DT allowed to validate and improve the results of fuzzy modeling. This validation process can be used in the remodeling of the characteristics of any fuzzy system, it is a way to build a more harmonious and consistent model, in this case, the student profile.

J	Wong, KS; Kim, MH				Wong, Kok Seng; Kim, Myung Ho			Privacy-preserving frequent itemsets mining via secure collaborative framework	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						frequent itemsets mining; distributed association rules mining; multi-party computation; privacy preserving; collaborative framework	ASSOCIATION RULES; PATTERN TREE	Knowledge-discovering or pattern-discovering process, such as data mining, is an important technique to discover hidden but useful information from a large volume of data. Under distributed environment, data mining task has become a challenging task due to data protection and privacy concerns. The secure multi-party computation (SMC) approach has been widely used to solve privacy-preserving data mining problems. However, generic SMC solutions are not practical from an efficiency point of view, especially when the number of parties and the size of the data are large. In view of these problems, we utilize a secure collaborative framework to facilitate the computation protocol for SMC. In this paper, we particularly consider the problem of privacy-preserving frequent itemsets mining under distributed environment. Our solution reduces the risk for central data mining and improves the efficiency of the current generic SMC solutions. Furthermore, our solution is more reliable and flexible regardless of the number of parties involved. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Yi, X; Zhang, YC				Yi, Xun; Zhang, Yanchun			Equally contributory privacy-preserving k-means clustering over vertically partitioned data	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy-preserving distributed data mining; k-means clustering; Data security		In recent years, there have been numerous attempts to extend the k-means clustering protocol for single database to a distributed multiple database setting and meanwhile keep privacy of each data site. Current solutions for (whether two or more) multiparty k-means clustering, built on one or more secure two-party computation algorithms, are not equally contributory, in other words, each party does not equally contribute to kmeans clustering. This may lead a perfidious attack where a party who learns the outcome prior to other parties tells a lie of the outcome to other parties. In this paper, we present an equally contributory multiparty k-means clustering protocol for vertically partitioned data, in which each party equally contributes to k-means clustering. Our protocol is built on EIGamal's encryption scheme, Jakobsson and Juels's plaintext equivalence test protocol, and mix networks, and protects privacy in terms that each iteration of k-means clustering can be performed without revealing the intermediate values.

With current trends toward financial capital globalization, it is becoming more important to understand the hedge and arbitrage of foreign exchange markets. Thus, this study implements association rules as a data mining approach to explore the associations among 19 different pairs of foreign exchange rates. Transaction data, such as foreign exchange rates, were collected to construct a database; the Apriori algorithm was then used to generate the association rules. By doing so, this study proposes several possible portfolio alternatives in the Taiwan foreign exchange market, including foreign exchange hedge and arbitrage under different circumstances.

M.; Youssef, Amr M.; Fortin, Francis			Mining criminal networks from unstructured text documents	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Forensic analysis; Data mining; Hypothesis generation; Criminal network; Information retrieval		Digital data collected for forensics analysis often contain valuable information about the suspects' social networks. However, most collected records are in the form of unstructured textual data, such as e-mails, chat messages, and text documents. An investigator often has to manually extract the useful information from the text and then enter the important pieces into a structured database for further investigation by using various criminal network analysis tools. Obviously, this information extraction process is tedious and error-prone. Moreover, the quality of the analysis varies by the experience and expertise of the investigator. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to discover criminal networks from a collection of text documents obtained from a suspect's machine, extract useful information for investigation, and then visualize the suspect's criminal network. Furthermore, we present a hypothesis generation approach to identify potential indirect relationships among the members in the identified networks. We evaluated the effectiveness and performance of the method on a real-life cybercrimine case and some other datasets. The proposed method, together with the implemented software tool, has received positive feedback from the digital forensics team of a law enforcement unit in Canada. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A new discretization algorithm based on range coefficient of dispersion and skewness for neural networks classifier	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Supervised discretization; Classification; Data mining; Conjugate gradient training algorithm; Multilayer feedforward neural network; Preprocessing	CHI2 ALGORITHM; ATTRIBUTES	In this paper we propose a new static, global, supervised, incremental and bottom-up discretization algorithm based on coefficient of dispersion and skewness of data range. It automates the discretization process by introducing the number of intervals and stopping criterion. The results obtained using this discretization algorithm show that the discretization scheme generated by the algorithm almost has minimum number of intervals and requires smallest discretization time. The feedforward neural network with conjugate gradient training algorithm is used to compute the accuracy of classification from the data discretized by this algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is shown in terms of better discretization scheme and better accuracy of classification by implementing it on six different real data sets.

J	Chang, SY; Yeh, TY				Chang, Shiow-Yun; Yeh, Tsung-Yuan			An artificial immune classifier for credit scoring analysis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial immune network; Classifier; Credit scoring; Data mining; Classification	SYSTEM; MODELS	The primary concern of the rating policies for a banking industry is to develop a more objective, accurate and competitive scoring model to avoid losses from potential bad debt. This study proposes an artificial immune classifier based on the artificial immune network (named AINE-based classifier) to evaluate the applicants' credit scores. Two experimental credit datasets are used to show the accuracy rate of the artificial immune classifier. The ten-fold cross-validation method is applied to evaluate the performance of the classifier. The classifier is compared with other data mining techniques. Experimental results show that for the AINE-based classifier in credit scoring is more competitive than the SVM and hybrid SVM-based classifiers, except the BPN classifier. We further compare our classifier with other three AIS-based classifiers in the benchmark datasets, and show that the AINE-based classifier can rival the AIRS-based classifiers and outperforms the SAIS classifier when the number of attributes and classes increase. Our classifier can provide the credit card issuer with accurate and valuable information of credit scoring analyses to avoid making incorrect decisions that result in the loss of applicants' bad debt.

J	Chang, TP; Chen, SY				Chang, Tsui-Ping; Chen, Shih-Ying			An efficient algorithm of frequent XML query pattern mining for ebXML applications in e-commerce	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						XML query pattern mining; XML query; Data mining; ebXML; E-commerce		Providing efficient query to XML data for ebXML applications in e-commerce is crucial, as XML has become the most important technique to exchange data over the Internet. ebXML is a set of specifications for companies to exchange their data in e-commerce. Following the ebXML specifications, companies have a standard method to exchange business messages, communicate data, and business rules in e-commerce. Due to its tree-structure paradigm. XML is superior for its capability of storing and querying complex data for ebXML applications. Therefore, discovering frequent XML query patterns has become an interesting topic for XML data management in ebXML applications. In this paper, we present an efficient mining algorithm, namely ebXMiner, to discover the frequent XML query patterns for ebXML applications. Unlike the existing algorithms, we propose a new idea by collecting the equivalent XML queries and then enumerating the candidates from infrequent XML queries in our ebXMiner. Furthermore, our simulation results show that ebXMiner outperforms other algorithms in its execution time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It requires not only large investments in the communication and metering infrastructure, but also a redesign of traditional business processes. The newly incurring costs cannot be fully passed on to the end customers. One option to counterbalance these expenses is to exploit the newly generated smart metering data for the creation of new services and improved processes. For instance, performing a cluster analysis of smart metering data focused on the customers' time-based consumption behavior allows for a detailed customer segmentation. In the article we present a cluster analysis performed on real-world consumption data from a smart meter project conducted by a German regional utilities company. We show how to integrate a cluster analysis approach into a business intelligence environment and evaluate this artifact as defined by design science. We discuss the results of the cluster analysis and highlight options to apply them to segment-specific tariff design.

Privacy Preserving Decision Tree Learning Using Unrealized Data Sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; data mining; machine learning; security and privacy protection		Privacy preservation is important for machine learning and data mining, but measures designed to protect private information often result in a trade-off: reduced utility of the training samples. This paper introduces a privacy preserving approach that can be applied to decision tree learning, without concomitant loss of accuracy. It describes an approach to the preservation of the privacy of collected data samples in cases where information from the sample database has been partially lost. This approach converts the original sample data sets into a group of unreal data sets, from which the original samples cannot be reconstructed without the entire group of unreal data sets. Meanwhile, an accurate decision tree can be built directly from those unreal data sets. This novel approach can be applied directly to the data storage as soon as the first sample is collected. The approach is compatible with other privacy preserving approaches, such as cryptography, for extra protection.

On the Deep Order-Preserving Submatrix Problem: A Best Effort Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Order-preserving submatrix; OPSM; deep OPSM; deep pattern; subspace clustering; pattern-based clustering; sequential pattern mining; scalability; best effort; gene expression analysis; negative correlation; data mining	MICROARRAY EXPRESSION DATA; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; GENE ONTOLOGY; BIOLOGY; PROFILES; TOOL	Order-preserving submatrix (OPSM) has been widely accepted as a biologically meaningful cluster model, capturing the general tendency of gene expression across a subset of experiments. In an OPSM, the expression levels of all genes induce the same linear ordering of the experiments. The OPSM problem is to discover those statistically significant OPSMs from a given data matrix. The problem is reducible to a special case of the sequential pattern mining problem, where a pattern and its supporting sequences uniquely specify an OPSM. Unfortunately, existing methods do not scale well to massive data sets containing thousands of experiments and hundreds of thousands of genes, which are common in today's gene expression analysis. In particular, deep OPSMs, corresponding to long patterns with few supporting sequences, incur explosive computational costs in their discovery and are completely pruned off by existing methods. However, it is of particular interest of biologists to determine small groups of genes that are tightly coregulated across many experiments, and some pathways or processes may require as few as two genes to act in concert. In this paper, we study the discovery of deep OPSMs from massive data sets. We propose a novel best effort mining framework KiWi that exploits two parameters k and w to bound the available computational resources and search a selected search space, and does what it can to find as many as possible deep OPSMs. Extensive biological and computational evaluations on real data sets demonstrate the validity and importance of the deep OPSM problem, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the KiWi mining framework.

In this paper, we consider fundamental problems on text mining from compressed strings, i.e., computing a longest repeating substring, longest non-overlapping repeating substring, most frequent substring, and most frequent non-overlapping substring from a given compressed string. Also, we tackle the following novel problem: given a compressed text and compressed pattern, compute the representative of the equivalence class of the pattern w.r.t. the text. We present algorithms that solve the above problems in time polynomial in the size of input compressed strings. The compression scheme we consider is straight line program (SLP) which has exponential compression, and therefore our algorithms are more efficient than any existing algorithms that require decompression of given SLPs.

J	Jiang, LX				Jiang, Liangxiao			Learning Instance Weighted Naive Bayes from labeled and unlabeled data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Unlabeled data; Naive Bayes; Instance Weighted Naive Bayes (IWNB); Class membership probability; Classification	CLASSIFICATION	In real-world data mining applications, it is often the case that unlabeled instances are abundant, while available labeled instances are very limited. Thus, semi-supervised learning, which attempts to benefit from large amount of unlabeled data together with labeled data, has attracted much attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose a very fast and yet highly effective semi-supervised learning algorithm. We call our proposed algorithm Instance Weighted Naive Bayes (simply IWNB). IWNB firstly trains a naive Bayes using the labeled instances only. And the trained naive Bayes is used to estimate the class membership probabilities of the unlabeled instances. Then, the estimated class membership probabilities are used to label and weight unlabeled instances. At last, a naive Bayes is trained again using both the originally labeled data and the (newly labeled and weighted) unlabeled data. Our experimental results based on a large number of UCI data sets show that IWNB often improves the classification accuracy of original naive Bayes when available labeled data are very limited.

Parallel mining of maximal sequential patterns using multiple samples	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Maximal frequent sequences; Parallel mining; Sampling; Data skewness; Workload balance	FREQUENT SEQUENCES; ALGORITHM	In this paper, we propose a new parallel algorithm, named PMSPX, which mines maximal frequent sequences by using multiple samples to exclude infrequent candidates effectively. A frequent sequence is maximal if none of its supersequences is frequent. Unlike the traditional single-sample methods developed for mining frequent itemsets, PMSPX uses multiple samples. Thus, it can avoid or alleviate some problems inherent in the single-sample methods. We theoretically analyzed how to increase the minimum support level to prevent misestimating infrequent candidates as frequent in the mining of samples. PMSPX is a parallel version of our sequential MSPX algorithm, and it is developed on a cluster of workstations. In PMSPX, each processing node uses MSPX to find a candidate set of local maximal frequent sequences first, independently from other processing nodes. Then, a top-down search is performed, starting with all the candidates, in a synchronous manner to identify real maximal frequent sequences. This asynchronous local mining followed by synchronous global mining approach minimizes the synchronization and communication among the processing nodes. Three database partitioning methods are proposed to distribute the database across the processing nodes, so that their workloads are balanced and the data skewness of the whole database is preserved in the data partition of each node. A comprehensive analysis was performed on PMSPX and existing parallel sequence mining algorithms, and extensive experiments were conducted on PMSPX. PMSPX demonstrates very good speedup and scaleup properties. It also requires less communication and synchronization than other parallel algorithms.

DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Search result reliability; Reliability prediction; Paid results; Organic results; Search engine marketing	PRICE DISPERSION; WEB SEARCH; SPONSORED SEARCH; ONLINE; TRUST; INTERNET; STRATEGIES; RETAILERS; DECISION; COMMERCE	Search engines play a critical role in the diffusion of online information because they determine what content is easily visible to Web users. Major search engines, such as Google, Microsoft Live Search, and Yahoo!, provide two distinct types of results, organic and paid, each of which uses different mechanisms for selecting and ranking relevant Web pages. Using a third-party trust assurance program from BBB (Better Business Bureau) Online we find that vendors represented by websites in organic and paid results have varying reliability ratings. These ratings, based on overall customer experiences, may range from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. We empirically examine how vendors' reliability ratings from BBB Online are associated with cues (such as type of search result, relative price of a product, and number of sites selling the product) that can be observed or derived from organic and paid search results.

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. This paper proposes two models based on data mining technology, respectively called frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to find out quickly frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.

J	Palpanas, T				Palpanas, Themis			A Knowledge Mining Framework for Business Analysts	DATA BASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; knowledge mining; business analyst		Several studies have focused on problems related to data mining techniques, including several applications of these techniques in the e-commerce setting. In this work, we describe how data mining technology can be effectively applied in an e-commerce environment, delivering significant benefits to the business analyst. We propose a framework that takes the results of the data mining process as input, and converts these results into actionable knowledge, by enriching them with information that can be readily interpreted by the business analyst. The framework can accommodate various data mining algorithms, and provides a customizable user interface. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach by using a real-world case study that demonstrates the added benefit of the proposed method. The same study validates the claim that the produced results represent actionable knowledge that can help the business analyst improve the business performance, since it significantly reduces the time needed for data analysis, which results in substantial financial savings.

J	Sela, RJ; Simonoff, JS				Sela, Rebecca J.; Simonoff, Jeffrey S.			RE-EM trees: a data mining approach for longitudinal and clustered data	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Clustered data; Longitudinal data; Panel data; Mixed effects model; Random effects; Regression tree; CART	MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION TREES; VARIABLE SELECTION; DECISION TREE; RESPONSES; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS	Longitudinal data refer to the situation where repeated observations are available for each sampled object. Clustered data, where observations are nested in a hierarchical structure within objects (without time necessarily being involved) represent a similar type of situation. Methodologies that take this structure into account allow for the possibilities of systematic differences between objects that are not related to attributes and autocorrelation within objects across time periods. A standard methodology in the statistics literature for this type of data is the mixed effects model, where these differences between objects are represented by so-called "random effects" that are estimated from the data (population-level relationships are termed "fixed effects," together resulting in a mixed effects model). This paper presents a methodology that combines the structure of mixed effects models for longitudinal and clustered data with the flexibility of tree-based estimation methods. We apply the resulting estimation method, called the RE-EM tree, to pricing in online transactions, showing that the RE-EM tree is less sensitive to parametric assumptions and provides improved predictive power compared to linear models with random effects and regression trees without random effects. We also apply it to a smaller data set examining accident fatalities, and show that the RE-EM tree strongly outperforms a tree without random effects while performing comparably to a linear model with random effects. We also perform extensive simulation experiments to show that the estimator improves predictive performance relative to regression trees without random effects and is comparable or superior to using linear models with random effects in more general situations.

Their limited length, pervasive abbreviations, and coined acronyms and words exacerbate the problems of synonymy and polysemy, and bring about new challenges to data mining applications such as text clustering and classification. To address these issues, we dissect some potential causes and devise an efficient approach that enriches data representation by employing machine translation to increase the number of features from different languages. Then we propose a novel framework which performs multi-language knowledge integration and feature reduction simultaneously through matrix factorization techniques. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively in terms of effectiveness on two social media datasets from Facebook and Twitter. With its significant performance improvement, we further investigate potential factors that contribute to the improved performance.

J	Yun, JL; Jing, LP; Yu, J; Huang, HK				Yun, Jiali; Jing, Liping; Yu, Jian; Huang, Houkuan			A multi-layer text classification framework based on two-level representation model	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text classification; Text representation; Multi-layer classification; Wikipedia; Semantics	WIKIPEDIA	Text categorization is one of the most common themes in data mining and machine learning fields. Unlike structured data, unstructured text data is more difficult to be analyzed because it contains complicated both syntactic and semantic information. In this paper, we propose a two-level representation model (2RM) to represent text data, one is for representing syntactic information and the other is for semantic information. Each document, in syntactic level, is represented as a term vector where the value of each component is the term frequency and inverse document frequency. The Wikipedia concepts related to terms in syntactic level are used to represent document in semantic level. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-layer classification framework (MLCLA) to make use of the semantic and syntactic information represented in 2RM model. The MLCLA framework contains three classifiers. Among them, two classifiers are applied on syntactic level and semantic level in parallel. The outputs of these two classifiers will be combined and input to the third classifier, so that the final results can be obtained. Experimental results on benchmark data sets (20Newsgroups, Reuters-21578 and Classic3) have shown that the proposed 2RM model plus MLCLA framework improves the text classification performance by comparing with the existing flat text representation models (Term-based VSM, Term Semantic Kernel Model, Concept-based VSM, Concept Semantic Kernel Model and Term + Concept VSM) plus existing classification methods.

In the complex aluminium smelting process, there are difficulties in isolating historical data into different classes of faults for developing a fault diagnostic model. This paper presents a new application of using a data mining tool, k-means clustering in order to determine precisely how data corresponds to different classes of faults in the aluminium smelting process. The results of applying the clustering technique on real data sets show that the boundary of each class of faults can be identified. This means the faulty data can be isolated accurately to enable for the development of a fault diagnostic model that can diagnose faults effectively.

A Metrics-Based Data Mining Approach for Software Clone Detection	2012 IEEE 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (COMPSAC)	Proceedings International Computer Software & Applications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	JUL 16-20, 2012	Izmir, TURKEY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol	Izmir Inst Technol (IZTECH)	clone detection; clustering; data mining; fractal dimension; software metrics	CODE; SIMILARITY; DIMENSIONS; TREES	The detection of function clones in software systems is valuable for the code adaptation and error checking maintenance activities. This paper presents an efficient metrics-based data mining clone detection approach. First, metrics are collected for all functions in the software system. A data mining algorithm, fractal clustering, is then utilized to partition the software system into a relatively small number of clusters. Each of the resulting clusters encapsulates functions that are within a specific proximity of each other in the metrics space. Finally, clone classes, rather than pairs, are easily extracted from the resulting clusters. For large software systems, the approach is very space efficient and linear in the size of the data set. Evaluation is performed using medium and large open source software systems. In this evaluation, the effect of the chosen metrics on the detection precision is investigated.

This paper investigates the impact of rule ranking before constructing the classifier in AC mining. We would like to experimentally compare three different rule ranking formulas during building the classifier in order to determine the most appropriate one than can positively impact the classification accuracy of the derived classifiers. We believe that rule ranking may play a significant role in determining accuracy of the classifiers and also can be considered a pre-pruning step for the rules. Sixteen different data sets from UCI data repository have been used in the experiments, and the bases of the comparisons are the error rate, and the number of rules. The results reveal that rule ranking plays a major role in determining the subset of rules to be utilised in the prediction step and it indeed affects the predictive power of such subset.

Recently in the marketing or business situation, curation has been frequently considered and important. In addition, holistic communication is sometimes considered to deliver or promote products or solutions. In the holistic communication, usually a target "hub" is selected for additional communications. Actually, such strategy is usually conducted in a secret mode, so in the case of data mining, such a strategy might be ignored and the result will be lack of effects of holistic communication. It will be necessary to discover such hidden communication and relationships during data mining	Chiba Univ, Fac Letters, Inage Ku, Chiba 2638522, Japan	Abe, A (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Fac Letters, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan.	ave@ultimaVI.arc.net.my					Abe A., 2010, NEW MATH NATURAL COM, V6, P193; Abe A., 2011, P IJCAI2011 6 INT WO, P3; Abe A., 2012, P EWCDDS12, P37; Abe A, 2010, Proceedings 2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW 2010), DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2010.42; Abe A., 2012, ADV CHANCE DISCOVERY, V423, P1; Abe A, 2007, SOFT COMPUT, V11, P799, DOI 10.1007/S00500-006-0122-2; Akiyama R, 2004, HOLISTIC COMMUNICATI; American Association of Museums Curators Committee, 2009, COD ETH CUR; Anderson C., 2009, FREE FUTURE RADICAL; Graves P., 2010, CONSUMEROLOGY; JISC, 2004, E SCI DAT CUR REP; Katsumi A, 2011, CURATION SENSE; Lorenzon A, 2008, INNOVATIVE MARKETING, V4, P16; Martinez-Ruiz MP, 2011, AFR J BUS MANAGE, V5, P1951; Ohsawa Y., 2008, P PAKDD 2008 WORK NO, P272; Ohsawa Y, 1998, P IEEE INT FORUM RES, P12, DOI 10.1109/ADL.1998.670375; Ohsawa Y., 2003, CHANCE DISCOVERY; Poundstone W., 2010, PRICELESS MYTH FAIR; Quinlan JR, 1993, C4 5 PROGRAMS MACHIN; Rosenbaum S., 2011, CURATION NATION; Sasaki T., 2011, AGE CURATION	21	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-0-7695-4925-5				2012							273	279		10.1109/ICDMW.2012.114		7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BFQ26	WOS:000320946500036

There are several methods to evaluate the quality in developed software products. In this paper, we evaluated the correlation between two software quality tools: Source Code Analysis (SCA) and software metrics. While both approaches are used to assess one or more attributes of the software, each one has its own goals and characteristics. In this paper, we evaluated the relation and correlation between SCA and software metrics. We used tools to fix warning detected by SCA tools. Software metrics are measured before and after the modifications of SCA recommended changes. Results showed that some specific metrics related to structure, complexity and maintainability metrics can be significantly impacted by SCA modifications. This is expected given the nature of proposed modifications from SCA tools.

In this technique, we extracted image-texture based and Higher Order Spectra (HOS) based features from the images. The significant features were then selected and used to train and test the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The proposed technique was validated using 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images, obtained from 10 patients with benign and 10 with malignant disease, respectively. On evaluating the classifier with 10-fold stratified cross validation, we observed that the DT classifier presented a high accuracy of 95.1%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 97.7%. Thus, the four significant features could adequately quantify the subtle changes and nonlinearities in the pixel intensities. The preliminary results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed technique can be reliably used as an adjunct tool for ovarian tumor classification since the system is accurate, completely automated, cost-effective, and can be easily written as a software application for use in any computer.

Evidence is emerging that particular microRNAs may play a role in human cancer pathogenesis; they exhibit important regulatory roles in development, cell proliferation, cell survival and apoptosis [1]. The effectiveness in treatment and curing cancer is directly dependent on the ability to detect cancers at their earlier stages. This study developed a neural network with back-propagation learning algorithm for the prediction of microRNAs responsible from cancer pathogenesis at earlier stages. Purpose of the Study: The aim of this research was to develop a nonlinear empirical model to predict a score value for specific microRNAs responsible from cancer pathogenesis by using micro-array data. Methods: The Back-Propagation Multi Layer perceptron (BPMLP) for the prediction of score value. The supervised learning algoritm is used during the training and testing stages. The number of inputs is fixed at two and the number of output is one. The 677 micro-array data were collected from a cancer microarray database and data-mining platform called Oncomine. Testing data are classified into randomly selected four groups of data. Findings and Results: In this work, a BPMLP, is used to establish the relationship between the microRNAs, p-value and score value. Accuracy rate was adjusted to 80 % and 90 %. The best performance was obtained with 20 neurons in the hidden layer and learning parameter as 0.00099. Conclusions and Recommendations: BPMLP is obtained by developing forward propagation phase and sensitivity network. It is shown that, the generalization capability can be significantly improved by optimizing some of the parameters such as learning parameter, and neuron number. Since microRNAs may play a role in human cancer pathogenesis, we have shown that, it is possible to predict relationships of microRNAs, p-values with different score values. Therefore, by using BPMLP, it is possible to predict microRNAs responsible from cancer pathogenesis at earlier stages.

As it is very difficult to set any predefined rule for identifying correctly attack traffic since there is no major difference between normal and attack traffic. In this paper, Anomaly traffic detection system based on the Entropy of network features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared. Further, a hybrid technique that is combination of both entropy of network features and support vector machine is compared with individual methods. DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation dataset is used in order to evaluate the methods. It is proved that entropy based detection technique is capable of identifying anomalies in network better than support vector machine based detection system. In addition, hybrid approach outperforms entropy and SVM based techniques. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While the issues in devising a high-quality educational system are multi-faceted and complex, textbooks are acknowledged to be the educational input most consistently associated with gains in student learning [12]. Particularly in developing regions, they are the primary conduits for delivering content knowledge to the students and the teachers base their lesson plans primarily on the material given in textbooks [8]. However, many textbooks from these regions suffer from the lack of clarity of language as well as the inadequacy of information provided [10]. Be-cause of cost considerations, textbooks are often compressed into fewer pages resulting in poor exposition of subject matter [1]. Considerable research has gone into investigating what makes for good textbooks [7, 11]. While there are multiple dimensions that determine the quality of a textbook, there is general agreement that good textbooks should provide adequate coverage of important concepts and be organized in a systematically progressive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of information. We present our early explorations into algorithmic approaches for enhancing the quality of textbooks. Specifically, we first describe a diagnostic tool for authors and educators to identify deficiencies in textbooks. We then discuss techniques for augmenting different sections of a book with links to selective content mined from the Web. Our tool for diagnosing deficiencies consists of two components. Abstracting from the education literature, we identify the following properties of good textbooks: (1) Focus : Each section explains few concepts, (2) Unity: For every concept, there is a unique section that best explains the concept, and (3) Sequentiality: Concepts are discussed in a sequential fashion so that a concept is explained prior to occurrences of this concept or any related concept. Further, the tie for precedence in presentation between two mutually related concepts is broken in favor of the more significant of the two. The first component provides an assessment of the extent to which these properties are followed in a textbook and quantifies the comprehension load that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts [2, 3]. The second component identifies sections that are not written well and can benefit from further exposition. We propose a probabilistic decision model for this purpose, which is based on the syntactic complexity of writing and the notion of the dispersion of key concepts mentioned in the section [5]. For augmenting a section of a textbook, we first identify the set Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). IKM4DR12, November 2, 2012, Maui, Hawaii, USA. ACM 978-1-4503-1718-4/12/11. of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and endow the section with links to them [6]. We also describe techniques for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textbook, while respecting the constraint that the same image is not repeated in different sections of the same chapter. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textbook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [4]. We also provide results of applying the proposed techniques to a corpus of widely-used, high school textbooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), India. We consider books from grades IXXII, covering four broad subject areas, namely, Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. The results are encouraging and indicate that technological approaches can help address deficiencies in textbooks.

This could help to improve child mortality rate because 41% of all child death is reported during their neonatal period. Hence, a state of art modern Neonatal Intensive Care Unit is a prime need of any nation in order to improve child health and subsequently for socio economic development of a country like India. A Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) consist multiple life saving machines which are continuously recording vital parameters of neonates and generating vast data at very high frequency. A context aware based timely monitoring of such systems is a crucial task which could able to help medical experts for efficient decision making. Considering multiple vital parameters and taking decision in a real time situation could be more improved by having efficient decision support system based on strong human computer interaction. In this present research work a human computer interface for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has been proposed which utilizes Support Vector Machine to classify the health condition of neonates. A prognostic Index has been proposed which could be calculated on the basis of seven important vital parameters. Based on the value of Prognostic Index clinical rules may be identified to initiate alarms about the neonate health condition.	[Agarwal, Sonali; Pandey, G.

Data mining also opens new threats to privacy and information security if not done or used properly. The main problem is that from non-sensitive data, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information, fact or even patterns which are generated by any algorithm of data mining. In order to focusing on privacy preserving association rule mining, the simplistic solution to address the problem of privacy is presented. The solution is to survey different aspects which are discussed in the several research papers and after analyzing those research papers conclude a new solution which is best in efficiency and performance. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm named Cloud Subset Preserving Mining (CSPM). The entire system architecture consists of three phases: 1) Check for Authentication. 2) Reading the database. 3) Perform Pruning. Our algorithm is a good way to apply data mining techniques with security that hides our logical instances from others. The all the operations are performed in cloud computing environment.			agarvipul@gmail.com; yogesh.khandagre@gmail.com; ashutoshdubey123@ieee.org					Agrawal R., 1994, P 20 INT C VER LARG; Agrawal R, 1993, MINING ASS RULES SET, P207; Agrawal Rakesh, PRIVACY PRESERVING D; Chen MS, 1996, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V8, P866; Dasseni Elena, 2001, HIDING ASS RULES USI; Evfimievski A., 2002, PRIVACY PRESERVING M; Feng Yi, 2010 7 INT C FUZZ SY; Gao Hong-qing, 2010 3 INT S KNOWL A; Lin Jun Lin, PRIVACY PRESERVING I; Lin Kawuu W., IEEE 2010; Lin Y.T., 2005, NOVEL METHOD PROTECT; LIU Ming, 2008, COMPUTER ENG DESIGN; Moretti Christopher, SCAL CLASS CLOUD COM; Oliveira S.R.M., PAKDD2004; Reiter M K, 2005, ACM T INFORM SYSTEM; Rizvi S J, 2002, MAINTAINING DATA PRI; Saygin Yucel, 2002, PRIVACY PRESERVING A; Saygin Yucel, 2001, USING UNKNOWNS PREVE; SWEENEY LATANYA, 2002, K ANONYMITY MODEL PR; Verykios VS, 2004, SIGMOD REC, V33, P50; Wang E.T., 2008, EFFICIENT SANITIZATI; Wang Jianzong, 2010 9 INT C GRID CL; Wu Shaofei, 2008, INT S INF PROC; Xiao X, 2006, PERSONALIZED PRIVACY; Zaiane Osmar R., P IEEE ICDM WORKSH P	25	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4577-0726-1				2012												5	Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BFM62	WOS:000320562200048

A segment-based framework for modeling and mining data streams	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; Stream mining		Data Streams have become ubiquitous in recent years because of advances in hardware technology which have enabled automated recording of large amounts of data. The primary constraint in the effective mining of streams is the large volume of data which must be processed in real time. In many cases, it is desirable to store a summary of the data stream segments in order to perform data mining tasks. Since density estimation provides a comprehensive overview of the probabilistic data distribution of a stream segment, it is a natural choice for this purpose. A direct use of density distributions can however turn out to be an inefficient storage and processing mechanism in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of cluster histograms, which provides an efficient way to estimate and summarize the most important data distribution profiles over different stream segments. These profiles can be constructed in a supervised or unsupervised way depending upon the nature of the underlying application. The profiles can also be used for change detection, anomaly detection, segmental nearest neighbor search, or supervised stream segment classification. Furthermore, these techniques can also be used for modeling other kinds of data such as text and categorical data. The flexibility of the tasks which can be performed from the cluster histogram framework follows from its generality in storing the historical density profile of the data stream. As a result, this method provides a holistic framework for density-based mining of data streams. We discuss and test the application of the cluster histogram framework to a variety of interesting data mining applications.

The design process for developing such an RTS game usually involves designers developing rules and mechanics based on their intuition and then revising these rules over several successive iterations to ensure that the model works for the target market. For the past year, we have been collaborating with a game company (BlackBird Interactive Inc.) to create an economy model to assist in designing a game. BlackBird is developing a social multiplayer RTS game called HARDWARE. Our goal is to develop assistive technologies to allow designers to make informed decisions regarding their game mechanics. In this paper we discuss the approach we took and our method to validate it in future. In particular, we developed an innovative technique using simulation and behavior modeling to allow designers to better adjust and understand the game variables. In this paper we discuss the model and preliminary interactions with the design team to show the success of this model. Our model describes how the game economy should unfold in different dimensions. We considered several parameters for user behavior, including propensity factors (such as their tendency towards certain game activities). We then developed a simulation system using Matlab and Simulink which considers the developed parameterized mathematical model as input, and uses a stochastic Monte Carlo approach for running probability based equations. The system extracts an empirical distribution for each model output variable over time. These output variables can represent how the economy resources change for a specific class of users.

Extracted features are organized into different feature groups then a specific preprocessing technique is applied to each feature group. The applied methods have reduced the noise in the bug data. compared to traditional approach of word frequency for text categorization.

PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION-BASED FEATURE SELECTION AND PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION FOR POWER SYSTEM DISTURBANCES CLASSIFICATION	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; QUALITY DISTURBANCES; SVM; RECOGNITION; NETWORKS	In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. The appropriate input features of the classifier are selected from a given set of possible features, and the structure parameters of the classifier are adapted with respect to these features and a given dataset. This paper describes the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) that performs feature and model selection simultaneously for the probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier for power system disturbances. The probabilistic neural network is one of the successful classifiers used to solve many classification problems. However, the computational effort and storage requirement of the PNN method will prohibitively increase as the number of patterns used in the training set increases. An important issue that has not been given enough attention is the selection of a "spread parameter,'' also called a "smoothing parameter,'' in the PNN classifier. PSO is a powerful meta-heuristic technique in the artificial intelligence field; therefore, this study proposes a PSO-based approach, called PSO-PNN, to specify the beneficial features and the value of spread parameter to enhance the performance of PNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed PSO-based approach significantly improves the classification accuracy with the discriminating input features for PNN.

Online learning of data streams has some important features, such as sequential access to the data, limitation on time and space complexity and the occurrence of concept drift. The infinite nature of data streams makes it hard to label all observed instances. It seems that using the semi-supervised approaches have much more compatibility with the problem. So in this paper we present a new semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm for data streams. This algorithm uses the majority vote of learners for the labeling of unlabeled instances. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is comparable with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised online algorithms.

In this manuscript, we present a machine learning approach known as Decision Tree (C4.5) Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm, to classify such risky/attack type of connections. The algorithm obtains into consideration dissimilar features in network connections and to create a classification rule set. Every rule in rule set recognizes a particular attack type. For this research, we implement a GA, C.45 and educated it on the KDD Cup 99 data set to create a rule set that can be functional to the IDS to recognize and categorize dissimilar varieties of assault links. During our study, we have developed a rule set contain of six rules to classify six dissimilar attack type of connections that fall into 4 modules namely DoS, U2R, root to local and probing attacks. The rule produces works with 93.70% correctness for detecting the denial of service type of attack connections, and with significant accuracy for detecting the root to local, user to root and probe connections. Results from our experiment have given hopeful results towards applying enhanced genetic algorithm for NIDS.	[Akbar, Shaik; Kumar, G.

However, Internet is widely available everywhere in the country. A web based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is proposed that will serve the rural medical centers. A Clinical Decision Support System is a software that provides diagnostic suggestions based on input patient data. The system will use Artificial Intelligence technology to use given expert knowledge. The two popular types of decision support system are described, Knowledge-based and Data mining based system. Both have their respective strengths and weaknesses. A hybrid algorithm is proposed that combines the two approaches and attains higher performance. The hybrid algorithm FOCL is highly suitable for decision support. A modified form of FOCL is presented that can also take diagnostic cost into account. Several real world experiments show the advantage of this new hybrid system.

Data mining, based on pattern recognition algorithms can be of significant help for power system analysis, as high definition data is often complex to comprehend. In this paper three pattern recognition algorithms are applied to perform the data mining tasks. The deployment is carried out firstly for fault data classification, secondly for checking which faults are occurring more frequently and thirdly for identifying the root cause of a fault by clustering the parameters behind each scenario. For such purposes three algorithms are chosen, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and the k-means Clustering.

Dispersion-based prediction framework for estimating missing values in wireless sensor networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						dispersion; wireless data networks; estimation; data mining		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have attracted many researchers in the past few years due to their applicability for a wide-range of applications. WSNs rely on unreliable sensing schemes in which a sensor might lose some data due to the inherent characteristics of such networks. Estimating missing values that cope with other collected ones is crucial for some applications. In this paper, we introduced a framework dedicated to predicting missing values in WSNs. The key idea is to estimate missing values according to the natural spread (i.e. dispersion) of the guilty sensors. The framework considers cases in which distance and time play a significant role in estimating missing values. Thus, accurate values might be generated as compared to state-of-the-art central tendency measurements such as mean, median, mode, and midrange.

Towards the automatic discovery of place-related services and activities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						geographical place types; place semantics; human activities and services	CATEGORIES; ONTOLOGIES	The current web is rich in geographically referenced data. Mining, retrieving and sharing these data raises the need for rich geographical place name resources that record spatial and thematic elements of geographical places. Here, possible services offered at a place and human activities that can be practised there are considered useful concepts to discover and encode in place name resources. Recognising this dimension of place description can enhance information retrieval tasks by extending the range of possible queries and search criteria that relate to different place instances. This work proposes an automatic approach for the identification and extraction of service and activity-related concepts from multiple resources of textual descriptions of geographical place types. Frequent affordance patterns are identified and then applied to a corpus of resources to extract service and activity types associated with specific geographical place types. The evaluation experiments undertaken demonstrate the potential value of the approach.

In this paper, we first survey some of the most promising and effective techniques for the analysis and prediction of complex computational systems, then we focus on SAPERE-coordinated pervasive ecosystems. We identify the most essential elements of the SAPERE coordination model, select two techniques - model checking and data mining -, and derive two possible approaches to the analysis and prediction of the behaviour of SAPERE systems.

The aim of data mining is to extract knowledge from database and produce unambiguous and reasonable patterns. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the most successful data mining methods used in classification problems. Many researchers show that combining different classifiers through voting resulted in better performance than using single classifiers. This paper applies KNN to help criminological investigators in identifying the glass type. It also checks if integrating KNN with another classifier using voting can enhance its accuracy in indentifying the glass type. The results show that applying voting can enhance the KNN accuracy in the glass identification problem.

Novel Machnism to Improve Hadith Classifier Performance	2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES (ACSAT)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advanced Computer Science Applications and Technologies (ACSAT)	NOV 26-28, 2012	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Design Sci Renaissance (DSR)		Data Mining; Decision Tree; Hadith Classifier; Missing Data; Supervised Learning Algorithm		Muslims believe that the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAAW) is the second of the two revealed fundamental sources of Islam, after the Holy Qur'an. Hadith provides a Gold Standard "ground truth" for Artificial Intelligent (AI) knowledge extraction and knowledge representation experiments. In the present study, the extracted Islamic knowledge represented the focal point of the research; three famous books in Hadith science framed the corpus of the study. This study attempted to explore new approach to classify Hadith using a combination of the expert system and data mining techniques to classify Hadith according to its validity degree (Sahih, Hasan, Da'eef and Maudo'), the proposed Hadith Classifier model was built through learning process, Decision Tree (DT) classifier modeling had been represented by the tree structure model, and the attributes of the instances originally were obtained from the source books. Whilst some attributes were indicated as null values, or missing values. A novel mechanism called missing data detector (MDD) was employed to handle these missing data. This mechanism simulated the Isnad verification methods in Hadith science. The results of the research were compared with the resource books, concurrently with the point of view of the experts in the Hadith science. The findings of the research showed that the performance of DT Hadith classifier had significant effect with MDD, the CCR was sharply increased from (50.1502 %) to (97.597%) Furthermore, the favorable obtained results indicated that the DT Modeling is a viable approach to classify Hadith due to the ease of rules induction and results interpretation.

IPS is evolving recently in a way that is expected eventually to replace other security solutions such as firewalls and anti-viruses. To over come the static signature detecting mechanism to identify intruders that exists in all host based IPSs which in turn needs to be updated from time to time to insure the most accurate detection. In this paper we introduce a four tier host based IPS that uses data mining technique, namely decision tree, as a detecting mechanism. The input parameters for the prior decision tree algorithm are the most infected or targeted computer resources by intruders, instead of a static signature database. Three test scenarios were performed to investigate the ability of the proposed IPS to classify intruders correctly.

Online criminals have adapted traditional fraudulent schemes like phishing in electronic form. Increasingly. such schemes target an individual's IM where they mingle among masked by honest communications. The targeting and conniving nature of these schemes are an infringement upon an individual's personal privacy as well as a threat to personal safety. In order to focus on privacy preserving the proposed APD (Anti phishing detector) system embeds association rule mining (ARM) technique in IM's to detect deceptive phishing. There are many techniques developed to tackle e-mail phishing, a little research literature not yet done on deceptive phishing in Instant Messengers where the identification of user is often Unknown to users. This is one of the motivating factor for the research project described, tested and experimented.

FP-KC attempts to combine between the features of principle component analysis and frequency pattern growth. This done using the three criteria (Eigenvalue, cumulative variability and Scree plot). There are many reasons for developing the FP-Growth data mining algorithm in build up a novel algorithm FP-KC to find the association rules: (a) the size of an FP-tree is typically smaller than the size of the uncompressed data because many records in dataset often share a few items in common.(b) Given the best result, if all the records have the same set of items, and this point always satisfy in the scientific dataset. (c) FP-growth is an efficient algorithm because it illustrates how a compact representation of the transaction data set helps to efficiently generate frequent item sets. (d) The run-time performance of FP-growth depends on the compaction factor of the data set. The performance of FP-KC test using five huge databases including (Primate splice-junction gene sequences, Diabetes, DNA, GIS and Watermarking). The confidence' degree of the all association rules yield by FP-KC is equal to 95%.

At the other hand, lack of reference data is very often responsible for poor performance of learning where one of the key problems in supervised learning is due to the insufficient size of the training dataset. Therefore, we try to suggest a new development a theoretically and practically valid tool for analyzing small of sample data remains a critical and challenging issue for researches. This paper presents a methodology for Obtaining Accurate and Comprehensible Classification Rules (OACCR) of both small and huge datasets with the use of hybrid techniques represented by knowledge discovering. In this article the searching capability of a Genetic Programming Data Construction Method (GPDCM) has been exploited for automatically creating more visual samples from the original small dataset. Add to that, this paper attempts to developing Random Forest data mining algorithm to handle missing value problem. Then database which describes depending on their components were built by Principle Component Analysis (PCA), after that, association rule algorithm to the FP-Growth algorithm (FP-Tree) was used.. At the last, TreeNet classifier determines the class under which each association rules belongs to was used. The proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, this methodology can be use to compression dataset in two dimensions (number of features, number of records).

This disease occurs when the diameter narrowing of one of the left anterior descending, left circumflex, or right coronary arteries is equal to or greater than 50 percent. Angiography is the principal diagnostic modality for the stenosis of heart vessels; however, because of its complications and costs, researchers are looking for alternative methods such as data mining. This study conducts data mining algorithms on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset which has been collected from 303 random visitors to Tehran's Shaheed Rajaei Cardiovascular, Medical and Research Center. In this paper, the reason of effectiveness of a preprocessing algorithm on the dataset is investigated. This algorithm which has been merely introduced in our previous works, extracts three new features from the dataset. These features are then used to enrich the primary dataset in order to achieve more accurate results. Moreover, despite the fact that misclassification of diseased patients has more side effects than that of healthy ones, to the best of our knowledge cost-sensitive algorithms have yet to be used in this field. Therefore, in this paper 10-fold cross validation on cost-sensitive algorithms along with base classifiers of Naive Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and C4.5 were employed.

This will allow the construction of vehicular networks, commonly referred to as VANETs, as an example of mobile ad hoc networks where cars are the mobile nodes. VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) are vastly mobile wireless ad hoc networks and will cooperate an imperative role in public safety communications and commercial applications. Mobilization of these VANETs aim of the mission and duties for the rapid changes in topology and dynamics of high-speed car. Position based routing protocols are becoming trendy due to development and accessibility of GPS devices. One of the major VANETs question often leads to rupture of the corridor high-speed vehicle dynamics, which leads to a broken step, which leads to low throughput and high overhead costs. VANET has become a dynamic spot of research in the last years; one of the important and promising research topics is applying data mining techniques to extract useful patterns from VANET, such as clustering, association, classification, and more. Therefore this paper surveys some of VANET applications that used data mining techniques.

These techniques are based on the assumption that arterial stiffness is currently an important predicator of the CV diseases development and can be assessed by analyzing the arterial pressure waveform (APW). A previously developed PZ based device for non-invasive APW capture is currently under test in clinical environment, using a heterogeneous population constituted by healthy and unhealthy subjects. A dedicated Matlab analysis tool was designed and developed to extract relevant information and further APW analysis. Several recordings of the APW in the same day and in consecutive months are being performed by trained observers, to evaluate its reproducibility. Data mining analysis is subsequently the last task where the Weka 3-6-5 package software is used. The usefulness of developing data mining algorithms for cardiovascular applications can benefit the CV screenings contributing for the early identification of arterial stiffness related patterns.

This is unlike standard mixture models where each data point is generated by a single mixture component. The POWER model allows for capturing various hidden and complexly overlapping components and roles of entities that contribute to generating the data points. However. the POWER model suffers from a very slow learning time. The highest complexity time of the parameters' learning steps is O (n . k . d(2)) with n being the number of data points. k the number of components of the model and d the number of data attributes. In this paper. we propose an approximation to the POWER model weight parameter learning algorithm that reduces the computational time significantly. The overall complexity of the new algorithm is O (n . k . d . p) in practice (where p is an approximation parameter much smaller than d). This allows the model learning time to be linear in the number of attributes of the data and provides a significant speedup over the original algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation technique using synthetic and real datasets. We also provide experimental results of the approximate POWER model on a dataset of NIPS papers and a dataset of wireless web access patterns and show that the model learnt are similar. An implementation of the approximate POWER model on the dataset of NIPS papers is about 27 times faster than the original version.

The data mining methods of clustering can be used in grouping the users in social networks. However, the existing general purpose clustering algorithms perform poorly on the social network data due to the special nature of users' data in social networks. One main reason is the constraints that need to be considered in grouping users in social networks. Another reason is the need of capturing large amount of information about users which imposes computational complexity to an algorithm. In this paper, we propose a scalable and effective constraint-based clustering algorithm based on a global similarity measure that takes into consideration the users' constraints and their importance in social networks. Each constraint's importance is calculated based on the occurrence of this constraint in the dataset. Performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on a dataset obtained from an online dating website using internal and external evaluation measures. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to increases the accuracy of matching users in social networks by 10% in comparison to other algorithms.

This technique takes advantage of the large number of frequencies which an Ultra Wideband signal occupies. We propose two methods to detect differences in channel magnitude frequency responses when in the presence of different substances between the transmitting and receiving UWB antennas. We then take preliminary measurements and fit a curve of best fit to the processed data. The preliminary results indicate that this technique may be able to be used in conjunction with data mining techniques to detect the presence of different substances between the antennas. This potentially provides a non-destructive technique to measure different substances in the wireless medium between the two UWB antennas.

Even though there are many composite indicators to measure knowledge and innovation at both micro and macro levels, benefits to decision makers still limited due to numerous progress indicators, without any unified, easy to visualize and evaluate forecasting capabilities. This paper introduces a novel approach to forecasting and finding the aggregated position of many Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE) with a high degree of accuracy. The suggested approach is based on data mining, Neural Networks, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Self-Organising Map (SOM). The proposed model has the capability of forecasting and aggregating five major KBE indicators into a unified meaningful map that places any KBE in its league regardless of incomplete missing or little data. The Unified Knowledge Economy Forecast Map (UKFM) reflects the overall position of homogeneous knowledge economies, and it can be used to visualise, identify or evaluate stable, progressing or accelerating KBEs.

We talk about large data bases along both dimensions: number of recordings and number of dimensions "attribute, variable". Analysis of these data becomes very important and difficult in the same time. The visual data analysis has great potential applications because it facilitates the analysis, interpretation, validation and also increases the cognitive aspect among analysts. However, the traditional techniques of visualization of multidimensional data, such as parallel coordinates, glyphs, and scatter plot matrices, do not scale well to a very large data set. The increasing size and complexity of data sets is a new challenge and a key motivation for our works. In this article, we present our proposal approach VSCDR (Visual Single Cluster Dimension Reduction Approach) that can handle with big data.

To achieve the intended goals, an intelligent system actuates the world by realizing of strategies, scenarios, actions, activities and operations. To assist an intelligent system, we need information and knowledge from world to reason in normality of the world states and to evaluate how much the intelligent system succeeds. The non-linear behavior of intelligent systems makes it rather difficult to reason in normality of the world state, because there is no clear border or frontier to isolate the normal and abnormal world states. To do this judgment two criteria are considered. One criterion is the possible context that an activity can be accomplished in it and the other criterion is verification of the correct realization of activities. In this paper, we propose a temporal data-driven artificial intelligence technique to recognize contexts of scenarios and verify if a scenario is done in an appropriate context.

Projection Pursuit has been an effective method for finding interesting low-dimensional projections of multidimensional spaces by optimizing a score function called a projection pursuit index. However, the technique is not scalable to high-dimensional spaces. Here, we introduce a novel method for discovering noteworthy views of high-dimensional data spaces by using binning and random projections. We define score functions, akin to projection pursuit indices, that characterize visual patterns of the low-dimensional projections that constitute feature subspaces. We also describe an analytic, multivariate visualization platform based on this algorithm that is scalable to extremely large problems.

These systems are capable of inferring intelligence from acquired raw sensed data, through the use of data mining and machine learning techniques. However, due to their recent advent, associated issues remain to be solved in a systematized way. Various areas can benefit from these initiatives, with public health systems having a major application gain. There has been interest in the use of social networks as a mean of epidemic prediction. Still, the integration between large-scale sensor networks and these initiatives, required to achieve seamless epidemic detection and prediction, is yet to be achieved. In this context, it is essential to review systems applied to epidemic prediction. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To obtain meaningful classification models, partitioning data into different concepts is required as an inherent part of learning. However, existing state-of-the-art approaches to concept drift detection work only sequentially (i.e. in a non-parallel fashion) which is a serious scalability limitation. To address this issue, we extend one of the sequential approaches to work in parallel and propose an Online Map-Reduce Drift Detection Method (OMR-DDM). It uses the combined online error rate of the parallel classification algorithms to identify changes in the underlying concept. For reasons of algorithmic efficiency it is built on a modified version of the popular Map-Reduce paradigm which permits for using preliminary results within mappers.

Its aim is to power up the next generation data centers. Many companies are opting for cloud storage; hence it is important to use an efficient and effective data mining strategy to mine the cloud storage to extract interesting patterns and relationship between variables in large databases. These data patterns are nothing but forecasting or predictions that can be used by the companies in near future to increase their sales. But the predictions that are generated as a result of mining should be secure from interception. Hence we propose a Secure Cloud Mining (SCM) architecture that will generate a Secure Forecasting Report (SFR) for the company.

It produces a smallest set of rules from the training data set with predetermined targets. Various techniques like Genetic Algorithm, Rough set, Swarm based approaches have been applied for Feature Selection (FS). Particle swarm Optimization was proved to be a competitive technique for FS. However it has certain limitations like premature convergence which is resolved by Intelligent Dynamic Swarm (IDS) algorithm. IDS could produce the reduct set in a smaller time complexity but lacks the accuracy. In this paper we propose an improvised algorithm of IDS for feature selection.	[Anuradha, J.; Tripathy, B.

A heuristic approach for organizing business data is adopted, which allows us to create, confirm, or contradict a hypothesis. This is accomplished through the use of intelligent agents that act as conceptual "Data Crowed-Puller" (DCP). These DCPs attract fundamental pieces of business information. The central part of design is the support for queries, both ad-hoc and long standing, which also acts as DCPs attracting the relevant information that a human analyst needs to estimate the validity of the hypothesis.

An effective feature selection allows biologists to investigate only a subset of genes instead of the entire set, thus avoiding insignificant, noisy, and redundant features. This paper presents the Masked Painter feature selection method for gene expression data. The proposed method measures the ability of each gene to classify samples belonging to different classes and ranks genes by computing an overlap score. A density based technique is exploited to smooth the effects of outliers in the overlap score computation. Analogously to other approaches, the number of selected genes can be set by the user. However, our algorithm may automatically detect the minimum set of genes that yields the best classification coverage of training set samples. The effectiveness of our approach has been demonstrated through an empirical study on public microarray datasets with different characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields a higher classification accuracy with respect to widely used feature selection techniques.

But most researches are directed towards bi-polar classification of movie or generation of a movie recommendation system based on reviews given by viewers on various internet sites. Classification of movie popularity based solely on attributes of a movie i.e. actor, actress, director rating, language, country and budget etc. has been less highlighted due to large number of attributes that are associated with each movie and their differences in dimensions. In this paper, we propose classification scheme of pre-release movie popularity based on inherent attributes using C4.5 and PART classifier algorithm and define the relation between attributes of post release movies using correlation coefficient.

In real world, data streams are not stable but change with time. Such changes termed as drifts in concept of the data stream are categorized into gradual and abrupt, based on the amount of drifting time, i.e. the time steps taken to replace the old concept completely by the new one. In traditional online learning systems, this categorization has not been exploited in developing different approaches for handling different types of drifts in the data stream. Such handling of concept drifts according to their type can help improve the performance of the classification system and hence, the issue can be explored further. Among the most popular and effective approaches to handle concept drifts is ensemble learning, where a set of models built over different time periods is maintained and the predictions of models are combined, usually according to their expertise level regarding the current concept. If early instances of new concept are stored and used for ensemble learning once the drift is detected, this may help increase the overall accuracy after the drift. Moreover, if an ensemble learns with zero diversity for instances of a new concept during the drifting period, the ensemble may learn the new concept faster, thus boosting recovery. The paper presents the above mentioned approach for effective handling of gradual concept drifts in the data streams.

In this paper, we tackle this topic from different angles: We describe data mining methods for ubiquitous and social data, specifically focusing on physical and social activities, and provide exemplary analysis results. Furthermore, we give an overview on the UBICON platform which provides a framework for the creation and hosting of ubiquitous and social applications for diverse tasks and projects. UBICON features the collection and analysis of both physical and social activities of users for enabling inter-connected applications in ubiquitous and social contexts. We summarize three real-world systems built on top of UBICON, and exemplarily discuss the according mining and analysis aspects.

Choosing the important features (genes) is essential for the discovery of new knowledge hidden within the genetic code as well as the identification of important biomarkers. Although feature selection methods can help sort through large numbers of genes based on their relevance to the problem at hand, the results generated tend to be unstable and thus cannot be reproduced in other experiments. Relatedly, research interest in the stability of feature ranking methods has grown recently and researchers have produced experimental designs for testing the stability of feature selection, creating new metrics for measuring stability and new techniques designed to improve the stability of the feature selection process. In this paper, we will introduce the role of stability in feature selection with DNA microarray data. We list various ways of improving feature ranking stability, and discuss feature selection techniques, specifically explaining ensemble feature ranking and presenting various ensemble feature ranking aggregation methods. Finally, we discuss experimental procedures such as dataset perturbation, fixed overlap partitioning, and cross validation procedures that help researchers analyze and measure the stability of feature ranking methods. Throughout this work, we investigate current research in the field and discuss possible avenues of continuing such research efforts.

Customers switch to competitors or move out from the service provider become critical concerns for companies to retain customer loyalty. Churn prevention through chum prediction is one of the methods to ensure customer loyalty with the service provider. Detect and analyze early churn is a proactive step to ensure that existing customers did not move out or subscribe to the product from competitors. Selection of customer characteristics is one of the core issues to forecast customer churn in the telecommunications industry. This paper proposes multiple regressions analysis to predict the customers churn in the telecommunications industry based on recommended features. The results have shown that the performance of multiple regressions for predicting customer churn is acceptably good.

Such a model will enable early interventions to prevent complications and prolonged LOS and also enable more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this paper, we propose an approach for Predicting Hospital Length of Stay (PHLOS) using a multi-tiered data mining approach. In this paper we propose a methodology that employs clustering to create the training sets to train different classification algorithms. We compared the performance of different classifiers along several different performance measures and consistently found that using clustering as a precursor to form the training set gives better prediction results as compared to non-clustering based training sets. We have also found the accuracies to be consistently higher than some reported in the current literature for predicting individual patient LOS. The classification techniques used in this study are interpretable, enabling us to examine the details of the classification rules learned from the data. As a result, this study provides insight into the underlying factors that influence hospital length of stay. We also examine our results with domain expert insights.

Data Mining Technique for a Secure Electronic Payment Transaction using MJk-RSA in Mobile Computing	FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING (ICDIP 2012)	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP)	APR 07-08, 2012	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat Technol (IACSIT), Univ Putra Malaysia, Singapore Inst Elect		E-Learning Material; Security; Mobile Transaction; Data Cube Technique; Credit/Debit Card		Due to the evolution of the Electronic Learning (E-Learning), one can easily get desired information on computer or mobile system connected through Internet. Currently E-Learning materials are easily accessible on the desktop computer system, but in future, most of the information shall also be available on small digital devices like Mobile, PDA, etc. Most of the E-Learning materials are paid and customer has to pay entire amount through credit/debit card system. Therefore, it is very important to study about the security of the credit/debit card numbers. The present paper is an attempt in this direction and a security technique is presented to secure the credit/debit card numbers supplied over the Internet to access the E-Learning materials or any kind of purchase through Internet. A well known method i.e. Data Cube Technique is used to design the security model of the credit/debit card system. The major objective of this paper is to design a practical electronic payment protocol which is the safest and most secured mode of transaction. This technique may reduce fake transactions which are above 20% at the global level.

The algorithm is based on the Dynamic Bit-Vector (DBV) structure and pre-large itemsets. The DBV structure facilitates the processes for maintaining large and pre-large itemsets. The pre-large concept is used to reduce the number of database scans. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is faster than some other algorithms.

Exploiting the knowledge embedded in emails with automatic tools is challenging, due to the unstructured, noisy, and mixed language nature of this communication medium. Natural language text is often not well-formed and is interleaved with languages with other syntaxes, such as code or stack traces. We present an approach to classify email content at line level. Our technique classifies email lines in five categories (i.e., text, junk, code, patch, and stack trace) to allow one to subsequently apply ad hoc analysis techniques for each category. We evaluated our approach on a statistically significant set of emails gathered from mailing lists of four unrelated open source systems.

To make data analysis feasible for such vast volume and high-dimensional scientific data, we apply high performance dimension reduction algorithms. It facilitates the investigation of unknown structures in a three dimensional visualization. Among the known dimension reduction algorithms, we utilize the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm to configure the given high-dimensional or abstract data into a target dimension. However, the MDS algorithm requires large physical memory as well as computational resources. In order to reduce computational complexity and memory requirement effectively, the interpolation method of the MDS was proposed in 2010. With minor trade-off of approximation, the MDS interpolation method enables us to process millions of data points with modest amounts of computation and memory requirement. In this paper, we would like to improve the mapping quality of the MDS interpolation approach by adapting the original dissimilarity based on the ratio between the original dissimilarity and the corresponding mapping distances. Our experimental results illustrate that the quality of interpolated mapping results are improved by adding the adaptation step without runtime loss compared to the original interpolation method. With the proposed adaptive interpolation method, we construct a better configuration of millions of out-of-sample data into a target dimension than the previous interpolation method.

In this paper, we present an algorithm to extract frequent item sets from large distributed datasets. Our algorithm uses gossip as the communication mechanism and does not rely on any central node. In gossip based communication, nodes repeatedly select other random nodes in the system, and exchange information with them. Our algorithm proceeds in rounds and provides all nodes with the required support counts of item sets, such that each node is able to extract the global frequent item sets. For local iteration and generation of candidate item sets, a trie data structure is used, which facilitates the process and reduces execution time. We further propose an improvement to our algorithm by grouping nodes and arranging them into a hierarchical structure. By performing aggregation tasks in groups, communication overhead is effectively reduced. We evaluate our proposal using simulation, and show advantages of our algorithms in reducing execution time and communication overhead, while preserving accuracy.

Document processing applications directly depend on the quality and speed of the identification of salient terms and phrases. Applications as disparate as automatic document classification, information visualization, filtering and security policy enforcement all rely on the quality of automatically extracted keywords. Recently, a novel approach to rapid change detection in data streams and documents has been developed. It is based on ideas from image processing and in particular on the Helmholtz Principle from the Gestalt Theory of human perception. By modeling a document as a one-parameter family of graphs with its sentences or paragraphs defining the vertex set and with edges defined by Helmholtz's principle, we demonstrated that for some range of the parameters, the resulting graph becomes a small-world network. In this article we investigate the natural orientation of edges in such small world networks. For two connected sentences, we can say which one is the first and which one is the second, according to their position in a document. This will make such a graph look like a small WWW-type network and PageRank type algorithms will produce interesting ranking of nodes in such a document.

In this paper the traditional K-Means algorithm is analyzed and found that quality of the resultant cluster is based on the initial seed where it is selected either sequentially or randomly. The K-Means algorithm should be initiated with the number of cluster k and initial seeds. For real time large database its difficult to predict the number of cluster and initial seeds accurately. In order to overcome this drawback the current paper focused on developing the UCAM (Unique Clustering with Affinity Measure) algorithm for clustering without giving initial seed and number of clusters. Unique clustering is obtained with the help of affinity measures.

Upgrading of the education system, upgrades the country to the world top ranking level. One of the major problems that the education system facing is predicting the behaviour of students from large database. This paper focus on upgrading Indian education system by using one of the techniques in Data mining namely clustering. Cluster analysis solves the given data into some meaningful groups. Normally the performances of the students can be classified into different patterns as normal, average and below average. In this paper we attempt to analyze student's data in different angle beyond the above indicated patterns through newly proposed UCAM (Unique clustering with Affinity Measures) clustering algorithm..

It has also made another important attempt to increase the number of places by approving regulations to legalize the release of the places occupied by retained students for new students. According to these regulations' retention criteria, there were around 50% of places retained by these students. This Article presents a data mining approach for assessing the risk of undergraduate student retention at the end of the second semester of course aiming at supporting the counseling of students to prevent their retention. The approach has been developed for the Federal University of Pernambuco, focusing on 6 of its major courses which involved data transformation from a database of over 400,000 subjects records, the application of logistic regression for risk assessment, and induction of rules for explaining that risk at the counseling process. The risk estimation solution reached Max_KS=0.51 and AUC_ROC=0.84 in performance. Three scenarios of 30%, 50% and 70% of efficacy in the counseling process show that the procedure should be implemented and is economically viable with decision threshold and return of investment varying according to that efficacy.

So, many prediction methods have been suggested to detect churning customers. In this paper, the CORER (Colonial cOmpetitive Rule-based classifiER) classification algorithm is brought to the attention of marketing researchers to enhance the prediction accuracy of existing churn management systems. CORER is new rule-based classifier which works based on Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), a recently-proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm. Applied to the database of a telecommunication company, this classifier is found to remarkably improve accuracy in predicting churn in comparison with the most well-known techniques in the literature of the churn management, namely LOLIMOT, C5.0, neural networks and boosting classification trees. Our findings lead us to believe that the CORER classifier could cause to increase profit for the companies.

Multi-linear algebraic computations such as tensor decompositions are performed for summarization and analysis of such data. Their use in real-world applications can span across domains such as signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and graph analysis. The major challenges with applying tensor decompositions in real-world applications are (1) dealing with large-scale high dimensional data and (2) dealing with sparse data. In this paper, we address these challenges in applying tensor decompositions in real data analytic applications. We describe new sparse tensor storage formats that provide storage benefits and are flexible and efficient for performing tensor computations. Further, we propose an optimization that improves data reuse and reduces redundant or unnecessary computations in tensor decomposition algorithms. Furthermore, we couple our data reuse optimization and the benefits of our sparse tensor storage formats to provide a memory-efficient scalable solution for handling large-scale sparse tensor computations. We demonstrate improved performance and address memory scalability using our techniques on both synthetic small data sets and large-scale sparse real data sets.

The proposed model tries to formalize such an approach using a time-series based multi-label classifier which takes into account correlation between different appliances among other factors. In this work, prediction results are shown for I-hour in the future but this approach can be extended to predict more hours in the future as per the requirement(with restrictions).

Monitoring systems have a high sensitivity in order to detect relevant changes in the patient state. However, multiple studies revealed a high rate of either false or clinically not relevant alarms. It was found that the high rate of false alarms has a negative impact on both patients and staff. In this study we apply data mining methods to reduce the false alarm rate of monitoring systems. We follow a multi-parameter approach where multiple signals of a monitoring system are used to classify given alarm situations. In particular we focus on five alarm types and let our system decide whether the triggered alarm is clinically relevant or can be considered as a false alarm. Several classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, kNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron) were evaluated. For training and test sets a subset of the freely available MIMIC II database was used. Alarm-specific classification accuracy was between 78.56% and 98.84%. Suppression rates for false alarms were between 75.24% and 99.23%. Classification results strongly depend on available training data, which is still limited in the intensive care domain. However, this study shows that data mining methods are useful and applicable for alarm classification.

Instead, following recent contributions from information visualization [13] and data mining [5] [7], this design study uses visual analytics techniques to identify, describe and explain cycling behaviours within a large and attribute rich transactional dataset. Using data from London's bike share scheme(1), customer level classifications will be created, which consider the regularity of scheme use, journey length and travel times. Monitoring customer usage over time, user classifications will attend to the dynamics of cycling behaviour, asking substantive questions about how behaviours change under varying conditions. The 3-year PhD project will contribute to academic and strategic discussions around sustainable travel policy. A programme of research is outlined, along with an early visual analytics prototype for rapidly querying customer journeys.

Thus the introduction of the new parallel versions is imperative. We propose in this paper, a parallel version of a sequential algorithm "Partition". This last is fundamentally different from the other sequential algorithms, because it scans the data base only twice to generate the significant association rules. By consequence, the parallel approach does not require much communication between the sites. The proposed approach was implemented for an experimental study. The obtained results, shows a great reduction in execution time compared to the sequential version and Count Distributed algorithm.

J	Bentham, J; Hand, DJ				Bentham, James; Hand, David J.			Data mining from a patient safety database: the lessons learned	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Knowledge Discovery; Data Mining; Information Extraction; Patient Safety	SPACE; MODEL	The issue of patient safety is an extremely important one; each year in the UK, hundreds of thousands of people suffer due to some sort of incident that occurs whilst they are in National Health Service care. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) works to try to reduce the scale of the problem. One of its major projects is to collect a very large dataset, the Reporting and Learning System (RLS), which describes several million of these incidents. The RLS is used as the basis for research by the NPSA. However, the NPSA has identified a gap in their work between high-level quantitative analysis and detailed, manual analysis of small samples. This paper describes the lessons learned from a knowledge discovery process that attempted to fill this gap. The RLS contains a free text description of each incident. A high dimensional model of the text is calculated, using the vector space model with term weighting applied. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to produce the final models of the text. These models are examined using an anomaly detection tool to find groups of incidents that should be coherent in meaning, and that might be of interest to the NPSA. A three stage process is developed for assessing the results. The first stage uses a quantitative measure based on the use of planted groups of known interest, the second stage involves manual filtering by a non-expert, and the third stage is assessment by clinical experts.

DADM safeguards can be very helpful for decision-support applications in fields such as banking or employment. However, constraining data mining to exclude a fixed enumeration of potentially discriminatory features is too restrictive. It should be complemented by exploratory DADM. We discuss these two forms of DADM and their requirements for evaluation, and we discuss and refine our DCUBE-GUI tool as a system for exploratory DADM. In a user study administered via Mechanical Turk, we show that tools such as DCUBE-GUI can successfully assist novice users in exploring discrimination in data mining.

J	Berka, P				Berka, Petr			Learning compositional decision rules using the KEX algorithm	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Classification; decision rules; KEX; LISp-Miner		"If-then" rules belong to the most popular formalism used to represent knowledge either obtained from human experts (as in the case of expert systems) or learned from data (as in the case of machine learning and data mining). The most commonly used approach to learning decision rules is the set-covering approach, also called "separate and conquer". The other way to create decision rules is the compositional approach. The work reported in this paper fits into the latter approach. We will describe the KEX algorithm, its implementation within the LISp-Miner system, and results of empirical comparison of KEX with some other rule-learning algorithms implemented in the Weka system.

Due to online query processing and multi-user operation, we need to concurrently maintain and analyze the data. While the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) defines a thread interface that is widely available, and while modern implementations of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) support threading, this combination is lacking in safety, security and reliability. The development of such parallel applications is therefore complex, difficult and error-prone. In response to this, we propose an additional layer of middle-ware for threaded MPI applications designed to simplify the development of concurrent parallel programs. We formulate a list of requirements and sketch a design rationale for such a library. Based on a prototype implementation, we evaluate the run-time overhead to estimate the overhead caused by the additional layer of indirection.

J	Bernabeu, EE; Thorp, JS; Centeno, V				Bernabeu, Emanuel E.; Thorp, James S.; Centeno, Virgilio			Methodology for a Security/Dependability Adaptive Protection Scheme Based on Data Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						Adaptive protection; decision trees (DTs); hidden failures; phasor measurement units (PMUs)		Recent blackouts offer testimonies of the crucial role played by protection relays in a reliable power system. It is argued that embracing the paradigm shift of adaptive protection is a fundamental step toward a reliable power grid. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to implement a security/dependability adaptive protection scheme. The advocated methodology aims to reduce the likelihood of manifestation of hidden failures and potential cascading events by adjusting the security/dependability balance of protection systems. The proposed methodology is based on wide-area measurements obtained with the aid of phasor measurement units. A data-mining algorithm, known as decision trees, is used to classify the power system state and to predict the optimal security/dependability bias of a critical protection scheme. The methodology is tested on a detailed 4000-bus system.
