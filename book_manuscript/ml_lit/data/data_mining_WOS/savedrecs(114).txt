J	Afrati, FN; Lekeas, PV; Li, C				Afrati, Foto N.; Lekeas, Paraskevas V.; Li, Chen			Adaptive-sampling algorithms for answering aggregation queries on Web sites	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						aggregation queries; adaptive sampling; Web site		Many Web sites publish their data in a hierarchical structure. For instance, Amazon.com organizes its pages on books as a hierarchy, in which each leaf node corresponds to a collection of pages of books in the same class (e.g., books on Data Mining). Users can easily browse this class by following a path from the root to the corresponding leaf node, such as "Computers & Internet - Databases - Storage - Data Mining". Business applications often require to submit aggregation queries on such data, such as "finding the average price of books on Data Mining". On the other hand, it is computationally expensive to compute the exact answer to such a query due to the large amount of data, its dynamicity, and limited Web-access resources. In this paper, we study how to answer such aggregation queries approximately with quality guarantees using sampling. We study how to use adaptive-sampling techniques that allocate the resources adaptively based on partial samples retrieved from different nodes in the hierarchy. Based on statistical methods, we study how to estimate the quality of the answer using the sample. Our experimental study using real and synthetic data sets validates the proposed techniques.

As the amount of information increases so does the complexity of the structure of the web site. Consequently it has become difficult for visitors to find the information relevant to their needs. To overcome this problem various clustering methods have been proposed to cluster data in an effort to help visitors find the relevant information. These clustering methods have typically focused either on the content or the context of the web pages. In this paper we are proposing a method based on Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) that utilizes both content and context mining clustering techniques to help visitors identify relevant information quicker. The input of the content mining is the set of web pages of the web site whereas the source of the context mining is the access-logs of the web site. SOM can be used to identify clusters of web sessions with similar context and also clusters of web pages with similar content. It can also provide means of visualizing the outcome of this processing. In this paper we show how this two-level clustering can help visitors identify the relevant information faster. This procedure has been tested to the access-logs and web pages of the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Athens.

Summarizing data using a similarity based mountain method	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						mountain method; t-norm operators; fuzzy sets; data aggregation	CONNECTIVES; OPERATORS	We consider the problem of summarizing a collection of data values. Here we use a mountain method like approach based on the similarities of the data. Fundamental to our work is the possibility of allowing for multiple summarizing values. We present an algorithm, in the spirit of the mountain method, that uses the similarity between the data points to find focus points which serve as the seed for finding summarizing centers. Central to this algorithm is a process of reducing the energy of the data points which we show can be implemented most generally using a t-norm. We provide an application of the algorithm to the problem of binning data which is used in data mining and the development of histograms. Here we allow the location of the bins to be determined by the data rather then fixed a priori. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Since the data include many items which will be categorized differently, it is not easy to generate useful rule sets. Sometimes rare rule combinations are ignored and thus we cannot determine the health status correctly. In this paper, we analyze the features of such complex data, point out the merit of categorized data mining and propose categorized rule generation and health status determination by using combined rule sets.

This infrastructure is composed of three modules. The "Intuition Module", implemented using an Ensemble Model, is responsible for performing pattern recognition and predicting the direction of the exchange rate. The "A Posteriori Knowledge Module", implemented using a Case-Based Reasoning System, enables the agents to learn from empirical experience and is responsible for suggesting how much to invest in each trade. The "A Priori Knowledge Module", implemented using a Rule-Based Expert System, enables the agents to incorporate non-experiential knowledge in their trading decisions. This infrastructure was used to develop an agent capable of trading the USD/JPY currency pair with a 6 hours timeframe. The agent's simulated and live trading results lead us to believe our infrastructure can be of practical interest to the traditional trading community.

The concept of data mining in connection with knowledge discovery techniques plays an important role for the empirical examination of high dimensional data in the field of urban research. The procedures on the basis of knowledge discovery systems are currently not exactly scrutinised for a meaningful integration into the regional and urban planning and development process. In this study ESOM is used to examine communities in Germany. The data deals with the question of dynamic processes (e.g. shrinking and growing of cities). In the future it might be possible to establish an instrument that defines objective criteria for the benchmark process about urban phenomena.

Apart from very limited and simple cases such problem cannot be solved by a local search algorithm because of multiple local minima. In this paper a Global Optimization (GO) algorithm is used to overcome such difficulty. The proposed algorithm (Controlled Random Search) iterates by maintaining a population of solutions which tends to concentrate around the most "promising" areas. From Data Mining point of view such an approach enables to infer deep information about the underlying structure of data. Collecting and presenting such information in a human understandable manner can help the choice between several possible alternatives. Numerical experiments are carried out on a real dataset, showing that GO produces solutions with much better distortion values than the classical approach, while graphical representation of the whole solution set can be useful to data exploration.

Due to the close relation to Petri nets as an underlying theory and representation technique, it can especially add to Petri net-based approaches. However, the complex analysis techniques are not straightforward to understand and handle for software developers with little data mining background. In this paper, we first discuss possibilities to integrate process mining into our Petri net-based agent-oriented software engineering approach. As the main contribution, we focus on enhancing its usability and introduce a technique and tool for visually modeling process mining algorithms with net components. These can be used to build new complex algorithms as a patch-work of existing procedures and new compositions. Furthermore, they allow for an easy integration with standard tools such as ProM.

It is well motivated by the understandability of learned models, the limitation of the so-called "horizon effect" and by the fact that it is a multi-task solution. In particular, associative classification, whose main idea is to exploit association rules discovery approaches in classification, gathered a lot of attention in recent years. A similar idea is represented by the use of emerging patterns discovery for classification purposes. Emerging Patterns are classes of regularities whose support, significantly changes from one class to another and the main idea is to exploit class characterization provided by discovered emerging patterns for class labeling. In this paper we propose and compare two distinct, emerging patterns based classification approaches that work in the relational setting. Experiments empirically prove the effectiveness of both approaches and confirm the advantage with respect to associative classification.

Network connections are then constructed on the basis of these packet logs. Searching for abnormal connections is where the application of data mining techniques for anomaly detection promise great potential benefits. Anyway, mining packet logs poses additional challenges. In fact, a connection is composed of a sequence of packets, but classical approaches to anomaly detection loose information on the possible relations (e.g., following) between the packets forming one connection. This depends on the fact that the attribute-value data representation adopted by classical anomaly detection methods does not allow either the distinction between connections and packets or the discovery of the interaction between packets in a connection. In order to face this issue, we resort to a Multi-Relational Data Mining approach which makes possible to mine data scattered in multiple relational tables (typically one for each object type). Our goal is to analyse packet logs of consecutive days and discover multivariate relational patterns whose support significantly changes from one day to another. Discovered patterns provide a human-interpretable description of the change in the network connections occurring in consecutive days. Experimental results on real traffic data collected from the firewall logs of our University Department are reported.

Method: The analysis results of 8,736 diabetic patients in northern Taiwan by using two data mining models: C5.0 and neural network were presented and compared. Results: It is found that Creatinine is the most important predictor for diabetic retinopathy. If Creatinine is out of control, diabetic patients will easily suffer from diabetic retinopathy in spite of many other laboratory evaluations are normal. The sensitivity and specificity for diabetic retinopathy prediction using C5.0 are 58.62 and 74.73, and those using neural network are 59.48 and 99.86, respectively. In addition, diabetic nephropathy will happen when several laboratory evaluation values are worse than target values. Female diabetics with diabetic family history are easier to undergo this complication. The sensitivity and specificity for diabetic nephropathy prediction using C5.0 are 69.44 and 81.36, and those using neural network are 74.44 and 98.55, respectively. For diabetic neuropathy, female diabetics feature unqualified BMI, HbA1c and AC sugar, while male diabetics mostly have uncontrolled blood pressure. Besides, smoking diabetics are more difficult to avoid this complication. The sensitivity and specificity for diabetic foot problem prediction using C5.0 are 64.71 and 83.48, and those using neural network are 67.63 and 99.70, respectively.

However, the training complexity of SVM is highly dependent on the size of a data set. A preprocessing Support Vector Machines (PSVM) method for large-scale data set classification is presented to speed up SVM training. By analyzing the neighbor classification feature for each sample in training data set, a decision criterion was built to keep or delete this sample from the original data set without losing the classification. The new method can provide an SVM with high quality samples. Experiments with random data and UCI databases show that SVM with our new preprocessing method retains the high quality of training data set and the classification accuracy very well.

J	Chen, JL				Chen, Jinlin			Contiguous item sequential pattern mining using UpDown Tree	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining algorithm; sequential pattern; contiguous sequential pattern; transaction database; sequence database; performance analysis	PREFIXSPAN; DISCOVERY; GROWTH	In this paper the problem of Contiguous Item Sequential Pattern ( CISP) Mining is presented as a sequential pattern mining problem under two constraints. First, each element in a sequence consists of only one item. Second, items appearing in the sequences that contain a pattern must be adjacent with respect to the underlying order as they appear in the pattern. Even though the problem of CISP mining can be solved by using previous approaches on sequential pattern mining under a general constraint description framework, this may lead to poor performance due to the large searching space. To efficiently solve this problem, a new data structure, UpDown Tree, is proposed for CISP mining.

The aim of such linkages is to match all records that refer to the same entity. One of the main challenges in record linkage is the accurate classification of record pairs into matches and non-matches. Many modern classification techniques are based on supervised machine learning and thus require training data, which is often not available in real world situations. A novel two-step approach to unsupervised record pair classification is presented in this paper. In the first step, training examples are selected automatically, and they are then used in the second step to train a binary classifier. An experimental evaluation shows that this approach can outperform k-means clustering and also be much faster than other classification techniques.

The main method used in epilepsy diagnosis is electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis. However this method requires a time-consuming analysis when made manually by an expert due to the length of EEG recordings. This paper proposes an automatic classification system for epilepsy based on neural networks and EEG signals. The neural networks use 14 features (extracted from EEG) in order to classify the brain state into one of four possible epileptic behaviors: inter-ictal, pre-ictal, ictal and pos-ictal. Experiments were made in a (i) single patient (ii) different patients and (ii) multiple patients, using two datasets. The classification accuracies of 6 types of neural networks architectures are compared. We concluded that with the 14 features and using the data of a single patient results in a classification accuracy of 99%, while using a network trained for multiple patients an accuracy of 98% is achieved.

The task of the distributed data mining is to analyze data from different sources. Solving such tasks requires a special approach and tools, different from those dedicated to learning from data located in a single database. This paper presents an approach to learning classifiers from distributed data based on data reduction (the prototype selection) at a local level. The problem is solved through applying the A-Team concept implemented using the JABAT environment, which supports implementation of multiple-agent teams. The paper includes a general overview of the JABAT, the problem formulation and some technical details of the proposed implementation. Finally, the computational experiment results validating the approach are shown.

After having introduced several integration and adaptation schemes a framework for adaptive and integrated classification in the form of the software shell is proposed. The shell allows for integrating data pre-processing with data mining stages using population-based and A-Team techniques. The approach was validated experimentally. Experiment results have shown that integrated and adaptive classification outperforms traditional approaches.

It not only can help to understand topological structure of large scale networks, but also is useful for data mining. In this paper, we propose a community detection technique based on the collective behavior of swarm aggregation, where all nodes are arranged on a circumference and each of them is assigned a angle at a random. The angles are gradually updated according to node's neighbors angle agreement. Finally, a stable state is reached and nodes belonging to the same community are aggregated together By repeating this process, hierarchical community structure of input network can be obtained The proposed technique is robust and efficient. Moreover it is able to deal with both weighted and un-weighted networks.	[de Oliveira, Tatyana B.

This task is not a trivial task and different difficulties can arise depending on the nature of the problem. All these difficulties can become worse when the datasets are too large or when new information can arrive at any time. Incremental learning is an approach that can be used to deal with the classification task in these cases. It must alleviate, or solve, the problem of limited time and memory resources. One emergent approach uses concentration bounds to ensure that decisions are made when enough information supports them. IADEM is one of the most recent algorithms that use this approach. The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of this algorithm in different ways: simplifying the complexity of the induced models, adding the ability to deal with continuous data, improving the detection of noise, selecting new criteria for evolutionating the model, including the use of more powerful prediction techniques, etc. Besides these new properties, the new system, IADEM-2, preserves the ability to obtain a performance similar to standard learning algorithms independently of the datasets size and it can incorporate new information as the basic algorithm does: using short time per example.

J	Deshmeh, G; Rahmati, M				Deshmeh, G.; Rahmati, M.			Distributed anomaly detection, using cooperative learners and association rule analysis	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						distributed anomaly detection; credit card fraud detection; feature selection; association rule analysis	CLASSIFICATION	Anomaly detection is an important branch of the classification problem which has attracted much attention during the previous years. This, as well as the growing need for distributed data mining techniques, and concerns for privacy and security issues of gathering all distributed data in a central location, emphasizes the importance of the distributed anomaly detection problem, which has thus far received little attention. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting anomalies in horizontally distributed data, where only a limited ratio of the instances at each remote site are allowed to be shared, and no single entity is allowed to observe the whole dataset, neither at once nor incrementally. In our proposed method, local predictors are trained and association rules are extracted, using the difference between predicted and actual values on a context dataset. These association rules are used to represent normal and anomalous behaviors, while a final set of learners use these representations to detect anomalies. The contributions of our work are: 1) distributed anomaly detection, where (a) both data and process are distributed, (b) only a limited form of sharing is allowed and (c) no single entity is allowed to observe the whole data, in anyway, 2) solving the problem in cases where concept drifts might occur, 3) providing a solution which is able to handle potential dishonesty from participating entities, and 4) using association rules for anomaly detection, while maintaining the speed requirement in anomaly detection which is necessary in various applications. We have conducted a set of experiments, comparing our proposed method to other typical anomaly detection methods (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE), which indicate the superiority of the proposed method, while preserving the privacy of participating datasets by avoiding the communication of all local samples to other local datasets.

As the key link of pattern recognition, dimension reduction has become the research hot spot and difficulty in the fields of pattern recognition, machine learning, data mining and so on. Pattern feature extraction is one of the most challenging research fields and has attracted the attention from many scholars. This paper summarily introduces the basic principle of SPFE, and discusses the latest progress of SPFE from the aspects such as classical statistical theories and their modifications, kernel-based methods, wavelet analysis and its modifications, algorithms integration and so on. At last we discuss the development trend of SPFE.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting the performance in Grid Computing environment. The method, based on frequencies of application attributes appeared in discernibility matrix collected during a period of time; predict the applications performance that the traditional methods can't obtain. We use the novel method in Data Ming Grid and obtain better result than traditional methods. The results of the experiment show that the use of reduct algorithm can process uncertain problem in Data Mining Grid.

Since the distributed knowledge discovery process is both data and computational intensive, the Grid is a natural platform for deploying a high performance data mining service. In order to improve the performance of data mining applications, an effective method is task parallelization. Existing mechanisms of data mining parallelization are based on NOW or SMP, it is necessary to develop new parallel mechanism for grid feature. In this paper, we present a framework for high performance DDM applications in Computational Grid environments called Data Mining Grid, with the function for decomposing data mining application into subtasks and then combine those subtasks to form directed acyclic graph. This kind of parallel mechanism decomposes application according to the actual cornputation power of each node in dynamic Grid environment.

The obtained results unveil interesting relationship between Z measure and two other simple and commonly used measures of rule support and anti-support, which leads to efficiency gains while searching for the best rules.

Following Cheng and Church [41, many different biclustering methods have been widely used to find appropriate subsets of experimental conditions. Still no paper directly optimizes or bounds the Mean Squared Residue (MSR). originally suggested by Cheng and Church. Their algorithm, for a given expression matrix A and an upper bound on MSR, finds k almost non overlapping biclusters whose sizes are not predefined thus making it difficult to compare with other methods. In this paper, we propose two new Mean Squared Residue (MSR) based biclustering methods. The first method is a dual biclustering algorithm which finds (k x l)-bicluster with MSR using a greedy approach. The second method combines dual biclustering algorithm with quadratic programming. The dual biclustering algorithm reduces the size of the matrix, so that the quadratic program can find an optimal bicluster reasonably fast. We control bicluster overlapping by changing the penalty for reusing cells in biclusters. The average MSR in [4] biclusterings for yeast is almost the same as for the proposed dual biclustering while the median MSR is 1.5 times larger thus implying that the quadratic program finds much better smaller biclusters.

There are some recent tools that employ linguistics or data mining to uncover concept relationships, but the results are mixed. Since relationships are semantically complex notions, it seems interesting to combine approaches that address different aspects of concept relationships. In this paper we present a hybrid approach that combines the co-occurrence principle from association rules with contextual similarities from linguistics. The technique has been tested in an ontology engineering project, and the results show significant improvements over traditional techniques.

There is a large variety of application domains, such as spatiotemporal databases, medical applications and others, which produce datasets of non-point objects (i. e. objects that occupy a specific hyperspace). Traditional clustering algorithms are mainly based on statistical properties of data and therefore are not able to efficiently partition sets of spatially extended objects. In this paper we propose NPClu, an approach for clustering sets of objects taken into account their geometric and topological properties. The spatial objects are approximated by their MBRs. Then our approach discovers the clusters in the set of the MBRs' vertices based on three steps, that is, pre-processing, clustering and refinement. We experimentally evaluated the performance of our approach to show its effectiveness.

In this paper, we attempt to modify the FUFP-tree maintenance algorithm for maintaining sequential patterns based on the concept of pre-large sequences to reduce the need for rescanning original databases in incremental mining. A fast updated sequential pattern trees (FUSP trees) structure and the maintenance algorithm are proposed, which makes the tree update process become easier. It does not require rescanning original customer sequences until the accumulative amount of newly added customer sequences exceed a safety bound, which depends on database size. The proposed approach thus becomes efficiently and effectively for handling newly added customer sequences.

Until recently, the decision to grant credit was based on human trial to evaluate the risk of insolvency. Increased demand from companies for credit has led to the use of more accurate models for bankruptcy prediction. In recent years much progress has occurred in the process of drawing up a model fostered by increased competition among financial institutions, changes in the economic environment for businesses and advances in computational techniques. This article discusses and presents alternatives for some of the main problems in the preparation of models for bankruptcy prediction with the application of data mining techniques. The first problem approached is the class imbalance that may cause a poor classification performance and it is treated jointly with an ensemble strategy. The other one rely on the selection of the most significant combination of attributes, the financial variables, which have been widely studied in insolvency prediction. Finally, it is presented a case study in a real world data base of Brazilian companies.	[Horta, R. A. Mathiasi; de Lima, B. S. L.

However, state-of-the-art low cost wireless video-based sensors have very constrained resources such as low bandwidth, small storage, limited processing capability, and limited energy resource. Also, due to the special sensing range of video-based sensors, cluster-based routing is not as effective as it apply to traditional sensor networks. This paper provides a novel real-time change mining algorithm based on an extracted profile model of moving objects learnt from frog's eyes. Example analysis shows the extracted profile would not miss any important semantic images to send to the Base Station for further hazards detection, while efficiently reducing futile video stream data to the degree that nowadays wireless video sensor can realize. Thus it makes WVSN available to surveillance of residential districts.

Given a set of trajectories, this paper proposes new conceptual definitions for a spatio-temporal pattern named Herd and four types of herd evolvements: expand, join, shrink, and leave based on the definition of a related term flock. Herd evolvements are identified through measurements of Precision, Recall, and F-score. A graph-based representation, Herd Interaction Graph, or Herding, for herd evolvements is described and an algorithm to generate the graph is proposed and implemented in a Geographic Information System (CIS) environment. A data generator to simulate herd movements and their interactions is proposed and implemented as well. The results suggest that herds and their interactions can be effectively modeled through the proposed measurements and the herd interaction graph from trajectory data.

Hence data mining faces the algorithmic challenge of coping with this significant increase in graph size: Classic algorithms for data analysis are often too expensive and too slow on large graphs. While one strategy to overcome this problem is to design novel efficient algorithms, the other is to 'reduce' the size of the large graph by sampling, This is the scope of this paper: We will present novel Metropolis algorithms for sampling a 'representative' small subgraph from the original large graph, with 'representative' describing the requirement that the sample shall preserve crucial graph properties of the original graph. In our experiments, we improve over the pioneering work of Leskovec and Faloutsos (KDD 2006), by producing representative subgraph samples that are both smaller and of higher quality than those produced by other methods from the literature.

In which systems the need to share information among different, not trusted entities, the protection of sensible information has a relevant role. A relatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient to guarantee privacy when data mining techniques are used in a Malicious way. Privacy preserving data mining algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of preventing the discovery of sensible information. In this paper we propose a modification to privacy preserving association rule mining oil distributed homogenous database algorithm. Our algorithm is faster than old one which modified with preserving privacy and accurate results. Modified algorithm is based on a semi-honest model with negligible collision probability. The flexibility to extend to any number of sites without any change in implementation call be achieved. And also any increase doesn't add more time to algorithm because all client sites perform the mining in the same time so the overhead in communication time only. The total bit-communication cost for our algorithm is function in (N) sites.

We investigate an unsupervised backpropagation algorithm to train a multilayer feed-forward neural network (SAMANN) to perform the Sammon's nonlinear projection. The SAMANN network offers the generalization ability of projecting new data. Previous investigations showed that it is possible to train SAMANN using only a part of analyzed dataset without the loss of accuracy. It is very important to select proper vector subset for the neural network training. One of the ways to construct relevant training subset is to use clustering. This allows to speed up the visualization of large datasets.

Several relational knowledge discovery systems have been developed employing various search strategies, heuristics, language pattern limitations and hypothesis evaluation criteria, in order to cope with intractably large search space and to be able to generate high-quality patterns. In this work, a new ILP-based concept discovery method is described in which user-defined specifications are relaxed. Moreover, this new method directly works on relational databases. In addition to this, a new confidence-based pruning is used in this technique. A set of experiments are conducted to test the performance of the new method.

Although most current distributed control systems (DCS) collect and archive alarm event logs, the extensive quantity and complexity of such data make identification of the problem a very labour-intensive and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a data mining approach that is designed to support alarm rationalization by discovering correlated sets of alarm tags. The Proposed approach Was initially evaluated using simulation data from a Vinyl Acetate model. Experimental results show that our novel approach, using an event segmentation and data filtering strategy based on a cross-effect test is significant because of its practicality. It has the potential to perform meaningful and efficient extraction of alarm patterns from a sequence of alarms events.

In a previous paper we experimented with large scale symbolic regression. Here we describe in detail the enhancements and techniques employed to support large-scale, time-constrained regression and classification. In order to achieve the level of performance reported here, of necessity, we borrowed a number of ideas from disparate schools of genetic programming and recombined them in ways not normally seen in the published literature. We discuss in some detail the construction of the fitness function, the use of abstract grammars to combine genetic programming with differential evolution and particle swarm agents, and the use of context-aware crossover.

In order to do this, a simple discrimination function and semantic analysis method are proposed for sex identification in Turkish chat mediums. Then, the proposed sex identification method is compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) methods. Finally, results show that the proposed system has achieved accuracy over 90% in sex identification.

Over the years, a number of associative classifiers based on positive rules have been proposed in literature. The target of this paper is to improve classification accuracy by using both negative and positive class association rules without sacrificing performance. The generation of negative associations from datasets has been attacked from different perspectives by various authors and this has proved to be a very computationally expensive task. This paper approaches the problem of generating negative rules from a classification perspective, how to generate a sufficient number of high quality negative rules efficiently so that classification accuracy is enhanced. We adopt a simple variant of Apriori algorithm for this and show that our proposed classifier "Associative Classifier with negative rules"(ACN) is not only time-efficient but also achieves significantly better accuracy than four other state-of-the-art classification methods by experimenting on benchmark UCI datasets.

Abundant algorithms have been proposed for automatic construction of concept hierarchy. A typical application of such algorithms is constructing directories for documents in information retrieval community. However, the research result can not be directly adopted for automatic construction of concept hierarchies for objects with identifiers only, such as items in market basket database where items have no attribute and only similarities between items are available. So, the metrics for directories for documents are not suitable for hierarchies for identifier-only data. In this paper, we propose a measurement that considers the unevenness of similarities among objects in the child nodes. We use the unevenness value to express the balance of concept hierarchies. For constructing a concept hierarchy, we propose a hierarchical clustering with join/merge decision (HCJMD) which is modified from hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).

However, the approach also suffers from one major deficiency: a training data set often generates a huge set of rules. It is challenging to store, retrieve, prune and sort a large number of rules efficiently for classification, especially on dense databases. In this study, we propose a new associative classification method, ACCF(Associative Classification Based on Closed Frequent Itemsets). The method extends an efficient closed frequent pattern mining method, Charm to mine all frequent closed itemsets (CFIs) and their tidsets, which would help to generate the Class Association Rules (CARs)([6]) And we also adopt a new way to classify an unseen case correspondingly. Our extensive experiments on 18 databases from UCI machine learning database repositor)([10]) show that ACCF is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with CBA([6]). Moreover, our performance study shows that the method helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems.

Neural network has been a popular method for data mining in financial area since last decade. In this paper, we explore the use of Echo State Networks (ESNs) to perform time-series mining on stock markets. The Hurst exponent is applied to adaptively determine initial transient and choose sub-series with greatest predictability before training. With the capability of short-term memory provided by ESN, a stock prediction system is built to forecast the close price of the next trading day based on history prices and technical indicators. The experiment results on S&P 500 data set suggest that ESN outperforms other conventional neural networks in most cases and is a suitable and effective way for stock price mining.

In recent years, several approaches to distributed data mining have been developed, but only a few of them benefit rough set based knowledge acquisition methods. This paper is intended to combine multi-agent technology into rough set based knowledge acquisition method. We briefly review the multi-knowledge acquisition algorithm, and propose a novel approach of distributed multi-knowledge acquisition method. Information system is decomposed into sub-systems by independent partition attribute set. Agent based knowledge acquisition tasks depend on universes of sub-systems, and the agent-oriented implementation is discussed. The main advantage of the method is that it is efficient on large-scale datasets and avoids generating excessive rules. Finally, the capabilities of our method are demonstrated on several datasets and results show that rules acquired are compact, having classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Advances in data mining research have allowed the development of efficient methods to find interesting patterns in large databases. In this context, this work proposes a method to automatically extract detailed information from molecular docking experiments. Completely flexible molecular docking studies (including ligand and receptor explicit flexibilities) of the InhA enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complex with NADH were performed with AutoDock3.05 using receptor snapshots generated by nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations. To analyze the results we applied our data mining method which was capable of identifying important information about intermolecular interactions and association rules. The method allowed a fast and concise analysis which led to identification of relevant residues and conformations essential to ligand binding.

In this paper we argue in favor of using some well-known cryptographic primitives, borrowed from the literature on large-scale Internet elections, in order to preserve accuracy in privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) systems. Our approach is based on the classical homomorphic model for online elections, and more particularly on some extensions of the model for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also describe some weaknesses and present an attack on a recent scheme [1] which was the first to use a variation of the homomorphic model in the PPDM setting. In addition, we show how PPDM can be used as a building block to obtain a Random Forests classification algorithm over a set of homogeneous databases with horizontally partitioned data.

In this paper, an intelligent distributed framework is presented to address the use of intelligent models for adaptive distributed object groups. Moreover, this paper proposes the agent-based data-mining model for implementing adaptive schemes using data mining algorithms and efficient interactions using multi-agent system. The k-means algorithm constructs group classes of object, multilayer perceptron classifies the client requests using the classes constructed from k-means and patterns generated from Apriori algorithm determine the next object needed to be replicated. For efficient interactions, the data mining is modeled in multi-agent system. Simulation result using the proposed model shows great improvements on serving clients by minimizing delay time and optimizes system performance by efficient load distribution.

In order to moderate several simultalleous e-discussions effectively, teachers must be alerted regarding events of interest. We focused oil the identification of clusters of contributions representing interaction patterns that are of pedagogical interest (e.g., a student clarifies his or her opinion and then gets feedback frorn other students). We designed an algorithm that takes an example cluster as input and uses inexact graph matching, text analysis, and machine learning classifiers to search for similar patterns in a given corpus. The method was evaluated on an annotated dataset of real ediscussions and was able to detect almost 80% of the annotated Clusters while providing acceptable precision performance.

In the last decade, a number of efficient algorithms have been presented for frequent itemset mining, but most of them focused on only enumerating the itemsets that satisfy the given conditions, and how to store and index the mining result in order to ensure an efficient data analysis is a different matter. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for generating very large-scale all/closed/maximal frequent itemsets using Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZBDDs), a compact graph-based data structure. Our method, "LCM over ZBDDs," is based on one of the most efficient state-of-the-art algorithms proposed thus far. Not only does it enumerate/list the itemsets, but it also generates a compact output data structure on the main memory. The result can be efficiently postprocessed by using algebraic ZBDD operations. The original LCM is known as an output linear time algorithm, but our new method requires a sub-linear time for the number of frequent patterns when the ZBDD-based data compression works well.

This is an advantageous approach enabling fast learning, self-determination of the network structure and high prediction accuracy. Experiments showed that the fuzzy ARTMAP outperforms statistical techniques and the most popular backpropagation MLP neural networks, all applied to the same dataset. An exhaustive search procedure over the Altman's financial ratios leads to the conclusion that two of them are enough to obtain the highest prediction accuracy. The experiments also showed that the model is not sensitive to outliers of the dataset. Our research is the first to use fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks for bankruptcy prediction.

Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. The uncertainty to explore if certain algorithms perform better for certain attack classes constitutes the motivation for the reported herein. In this paper, we evaluate performance of a comprehensive set of classifier algorithms using KDD99 dataset. Based on evaluation results, best algorithms for each attack category is chosen and two classifier algorithm selection models are proposed. The simulation result comparison indicates that noticeable performance improvement and real-time intrusion detection can be achieved as we apply the proposed models to detect different kinds of network attacks.

This issue is crucial in the context of applications in tire field of databases, data mining and multimedia. We propose a data sharing service based on distributed, RAM-based storage of data, while leveraging a DHT-based, natively parallel metadata management scheme. As opposed to the most commonly used grid storage infrastructures that provide mechanisms for explicit data localization and transfer, we provide a transparent access model, where data are accessed through global identifiers. Our proposal has been validated through a prototype implementation whose preliminary evaluation on the Grid'5000 testbed provides promising results.

However, often a classifier is required, but for training only an incomplete set of positive examples and a set of unlabeled examples are available. This is the situation, for example, with the Transport Classification Database (TCDB, www.tcdb.org), a repository of information about proteins involved in transmembrane transport. This paper presents and evaluates a method for learning to rank the likely relevance to TCDB of newly published scientific articles, using the articles currently referenced in TCDB as positive training examples. The new method has succeeded in identifying 964 new articles relevant to TCDB in fewer than six months, which is a major practical success. From a general data mining perspective, the contributions of this paper are (i) evaluating two novel approaches that solve the positive-only problem effectively, (ii) applying support vector machines in a state-of-the-art way for recognizing and ranking relevance, and (iii) deploying a system to update a widely-used, real-world biomedical database.

A lot of dataset generators have been implemented in order to overcome this problem. ARtool is a tool that generates synthetic datasets and runs association rule mining for Market Basket Analysis. But the lack of datasets that include timestamps of the transactions to facilitate the analysis of Market Basket data taking into account temporal aspects is notable. In this paper, we present the TARtool. The TARtool is a data mining and generation tool based on the ARtool. TARtool is able to generate datasets with timestamps for both retail and e-commerce environments taking into account general customer buying habits in such environments. We implemented the generator to produce datasets with different format to ease the process of mining such datasets in other data mining tools. An advanced GUI is also provided. The experimental results showed that our tool overcomes other tools in efficiency, usability, functionality, and quality of generated data.

Art increasing number of applications make use of the WWW as a primary source of information. The usefulness of such applications is, however impaired by the current styles of display of the web search results. This paper presents a system that adapts two techniques to map and explore web results visually in order to find relevant patterns and relationships amongst the resulting documents. The first technique creates a visual map of the search results using a content-based multidimensional projection. The second techniques is capable of identifying, labeling and displaying topics within sub-groups of documents on the map. The system (The Projection explorer for the WWW, or PEx-Web) implements these techniques and various additional tools as means to make better use of web search results for exploratory applications.

On the one hand concepts to deal with uncertainty - like probability, fuzzy set or rough set theory - play a major role in the description of real life problems. On the other hand many real life situations are characterized by constant change - the structure of the data changes. For example, the characteristics of the customers of a retailer may change due to changing economical parameters (increasing oil prices etc.). Obviously the retailer has to adapt his customer classification regularly to the new situations to remain competitive. To deal with these changes dynamic data mining has become increasingly important in several practical applications. In our paper we utilize rough set theory to deal with uncertainty and suggest an engineering like approach to dynamic clustering that is based on rough k-means.

In order to overcome these disadvantages, an improved C-means algorithm with two-step is proposed. This algorithm assumes that the instances follow normal distribution. To resolve the sensitivity to the input sequence of the instances, these instances are sorted on their densities before clustering, and the proper instances are selected as the initial clustering centers with a definite process. New algorithm employs the theory of gravity to distribute the instances. Experimental results and comparisons are given to illustrate the performance of the new algorithm over that of C-means.

Currently, many NIDSs that are developed are rule-based systems and their performances mainly depend on the rule sets. But rules formation becomes a tedious and time consuming task due to the enormous amount of network traffic. This is overcome by using data mining techniques. These techniques build intrusion detection models adaptively. Random forests is an efficient data mining algorithm which can be used for network intrusion detection This can be used for real time intrusion detection. In this paper, we discuss the approaches for feature selection, and optimization of parameters of random forests, compare different models, and also discuss the other method for detecting the anomalies across active networks.

The problem facing these domain experts is the scale and quality of data they must search in order to extract meaningful results. By using peer-to-peer sensor architectures and a mechanism for reducing the search space, we can, to some extent, address the scalability issue. However, synchronisation and normalisation of distributed sensor streams remains a problem in many networks. In the case of pHealth sensor networks, it is crucial for experts to align multiple sensor readings before query or data mining activities can take place. This paper presents a system for clustering and synchronising sensor streams in preparation for user queries.

In this framework, users can conduct data mining using their private information with storing them in their local storages. After the computation, they obtain only mining result without disclosing private information to others. The number of parties that join conventional privacy-preserving data mining has been assumed to be two. In our framework, we assume large numbers of parties join the protocol, therefore, not only scalability but also asynchronism and fault-tolerance is important. Considering this, we propose a k-mean algorithm combined with a decentralized cryptographic protocol and a gossip-based protocol. The computational complexity is O(log n) with respect to the number of parties n and experimental results show that our protocol is scalable even with one million parties.

Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) techniques are well established within the so-called connectionist paradigm of Artificial Intelligence where neural networks are used to extract both explicit and implicit dependency values often between data that is sometimes disparate in type and kind. The research described here seeks to elicit relationships between grape varieties and their growing conditions using SOM techniques. In addition, utilising k-means and principle component analysis (PCA) methods, the data mined and depicted by the SOM technique is shown to have dependency values that enable a clustering of terms relating to variety quality to be associated with growing condition data to produce optimal locations for each. This study is part of a larger research project that uses comparative data from New Zealand and Chile. The text mining aspect of it forms one element of a 'toolbox' of integrated hardware and software instruments being developed to underpin an environmental modelling methodology oriented not only towards grape growing but also generally for optimal crop production. The example described here uses data from New Zealand in the first instance. The paper begins with a summary of some historical wisdom relating to grape growing with a discussion of some previous studies and then describes the text mining of comments from wine tasters, which are statistically analysed. The results are clustered and the paper concludes with a reflection on the investigation with a pointer to future work in this aspect of the larger research project previously described.

However, too often, ediscussions are not fruitful and moderation is needed. We describe our approach, which employs intelligent data analysis techniques, to support teachers as they inoderate multiple simultaneous discussions. We have generated six inachine-learned classifiers for detecting potentially important discussion characteristics, such as a "reasoned claim" and an "arguiTient-couiitei'ai-gument" sequence. All of our classifiers have achieved satisfactory Kappa values and are integrated in an online classification system. We hypothesize how a teacher might use this information by means of two authentic e-discussion examples. Finally, we discuss ways to bootstrap from these fine-grained classifications to the analysis of more complex patterns of interaction.

Therefore, multi-agent approach can be considered as an effective approach for the development of complex e-health systems. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of intelligent multi-agent approach for developing e-health systems for the prediction of kidney transplant outcomes and the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. ne proposed kidney transplant outcome prediction is based on the use of a novel classification approach which is a combination of initial data preparations, preliminary classification by ensembles of neural networks, generation of new training data based on criteria of highly accuracy and model agreement, and decision trees.

To extract this knowledge, a database may be considered as a large search space, and a mining algorithm as a search strategy. In general, a search space consists of an enormous number of elements, which make it is infeasible to search exhaustively. As a search strategy, genetic algorithms have been applied successfully in many fields. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach for mining classification rules from large database. For emphasizing on predictive accuracy, comprehensibility and interestingness of the rules and simplifying the implementation of a genetic algorithm, we discuss detail the design of encoding, genetic operator and fitness function of genetic algorithm for this task. Experimental result shows that genetic algorithm proposed in this paper is suitable for classification rule mining and those rules discovered by the algorithm have higher classification performance to unknown data.

Most such methods employ signature-based or data-mining based techniques that rely on labeled training data, but cannot detect new types of attacks. Anomaly detection techniques can be adopted to solve this problem with purely normal data. However, extracting these data is a very costly task. Unlike the approaches that rely on labeled data or purely normal data, unsupervised anomaly detection can discover "unseen" attacks by unlabeled data. This investigation presents a new mixed clustering algorithm named HDG-Clustering for unsupervised anomaly detection. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms several existing techniques.

Most proposed algorithms for data stream mining assume that each data block is basically a random sample from a stationary distribution, but many databases available violate this assumption. That is, the class of an instance may change over time, known as concept drift. In this paper, we propose a Sensitive Concept Drift Probing Decision Tree algorithm (SCRIPT), which is based on the statistical X(2) test, to handle the concept drift problem on data streams. Compared with the proposed methods, the advantages of SCRIPT include: a) it can avoid unnecessary system cost for stable data streams b) it can immediately and efficiently corrects original classifier while data streams are instable; c) it is more suitable to the applications in which a sensitive detection of concept drift is required.

In this system, two data mining methods named PBD and PBC are designed for predicting asthma attacks. The main methodology is to extract the significant information of asthma attacks and build classifiers by using users' daily bio-signal records and environmental data. Meanwhile, helpful medical information and suggestions supported by doctors are applied. In this way, the proposed system can predict the chances of asthma attacks and provide patients with the proper medical instructions or health messages. The experimental evaluation results proved that the proposed mechanism is effective and reliable in asthma attack prediction.

Subsequently, the structural lattice of such generalised contexts was introduced in [15], to provide a limited equivalent to the main theorem of K-Formal Concept Analysis, resting on a crucial parameter, the degree of existence of the object-attribute pairs phi. In this paper we introduce the spectral lattice of a concrete instance of K-Formal Concept Analysis, as a further means to clarify the structural and the K-Concept Lattices and the choice of p. Specifically, we develop techniques to obtain the join- and meet-irreducibles of a (R) over bar (max),+-Concept Lattice independently of phi and try to clarify its relation to the corresponding structural lattice.

So this article puts the Hybrid Intelligent Systems into the research of classification algorithm. Based on the cognitive psychology and aggregative model theory, the article proposes a new Hybrid Intelligent System: R-FC-DENN, according to Rough Set, Clustering theory, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network. Firstly, R-FC-DENN uses the Rough Set to reduce the data. And then it clusters the data by the Clustering theory. After that, it uses different and improved ANN to train. Subsequently, the data which are trained are integrated by fuzzy power. Lastly, the integrated data are trained by another improved ANN and the whole process of training is completed In the end, experiments are carried out based on the data of UCI database and it is observed that the system is valid.

It creates unprecedented opportunities for large-scale knowledge discovery from huge database. Data mining (DM) technology has emerged as a means of performing this discovery. There are countless researchers working on designing efficient data mining techniques, methods, and algorithms. Many data mining methods and algorithms have been developed and applied in a lot of application fields [1]. Unfortunately, most data mining researchers pay much attention to technique problems for developing data mining models and methods, while little to basic issues of data mining [2]. In this talk, some basic issues of data mining are addressed. What is data mining? What is the product of a data mining process? What are we doing in a data mining process? What is the rule we should obey in a data mining process? Through analyzing existing data mining methods, and domain-driven (or user-driven) data mining models [3-5], we find that we should take a data mining process as a process of knowledge transformation. Based on this understanding of data mining, a conceptual data mining model of domain-oriented data-driven data mining (3DM) is proposed [2]. The relationship between traditional domain-driven (or user-driven) data mining models and our proposed 3DM model is also analyzed. Some domain-oriented data-driven data mining algorithms for mining such knowledge as default rule [61, decision tree [7], and concept lattice [8] from database are proposed. The experiment results for these algorithms are also shown to illustrate the efficiency and performance of the knowledge acquired by our 3DM data mining algorithms.

Short text such as conversation in chatting room and email is common in such data. It is useful to cluster such short documents to get the structure of the data or to help building other data mining applications. But most of the current clustering algorithms can not get acceptable clustering accuracy since key words appear with a low frequency in short documents. It is also difficult to process high-dimensional text data in very large databases. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm which uses domain ontology to improve clustering accuracy. This clustering algorithm is also parallel and frequent-concept based which makes it scalable to very large high-dimensional text data. Our experimental study shows that this algorithm is more accurate than other hierarchical clustering algorithms when clustering short conversations. Furthermore, this algorithm has good scalability and it can be used to process even huge data.

We draw on research conducted in dynamic decision making, construction data-mining and situational simulations to develop methods to study human decision-making data collected in ICDMA - a situational simulation of a real four story steel frame office building construction project. Specifically, we address challenges in the collection, organization and analysis of human subject data. We define a discipline driving the collection of human decision-making data, establish a semantics to organize the data and a simple mathematical syntax to represent it. We also present an analysis of preliminary experimental work and show that our method can be used to analyze patterns in complex construction decision-making. Finally, we present an agenda of research in construction decision-making using situational simulations that can be conducted using our proposed methods.

At present, most privacy preserving clustering algorithms are concentrated on k-means and based on two parties and the trusted third party, these algorithms have the drawbacks of inaccurate results because of choosing initial clustering centers randomly and applying to multi-party difficultly and revealing privacy because of depending on the third party excessively. This paper combines the merits Of hierarchical and k-means clustering and presents a privacy-preserving hierarchical-k-means clustering algorithm and solves the problem of privacy-preserving hierarchical k-means clustering on horizontally partitioned data for semi-honest parties using some secure protocols, such as multi-party computation, secure distance, secure clustering center and standardization. We show that our scheme is secure and complete with good efficiency.

Many chemical compounds are known to be expressed by outerplanar graphs. We proposed a block preserving outerplanar graph pattern (bpo-graph pattern, for short) as a graph pattern common to a set of outerplanar graphs like a dataset of chemical compounds. In this paper, firstly we give a polynomial time algorithm for finding a minimally generalized bpo-graph pattern explaining a given set of outerplanar graphs. Secondly we give a pattern mining algorithm for enumerating all maximal frequent bpo-graph patterns in a set of outerplanar graphs.

In this paper, we describe a linear programming formulation for the data distribution problem on grids. Furthermore, a heuristic method, named HDDS (Heuristic Data Distribution Scheme), is proposed to solve this problem. We implement the parallel association rule mining method and conduct the experimentations on our grid testbed. Experimental results showed that data mining programs using our HDDS to distribute data could execute more efficiently than traditional schemes could.

Because of the complexity of relational data, it is a challenging task to design efficient and scalable data mining approaches in relational databases. In this paper we discuss two methodologies to address this issue. The first methodology is to use heuristics to guide the data mining procedure, in order to avoid aimless, exhaustive search in relational databases. The second methodology is to assign certain property to each object in the database, and let different objects interact with each other along the links. Experiments show that both approaches achieve high efficiency and accuracy in real applications.

Thus, despite a demand for supports through well-organized information, little attentions have been paid to a study on how/which information can be utilized in a technology roadmapping. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a methodology to structure technological information in order to support the process. To this end, four methods are suggested to provide useful and substantial information: summary, information extraction, search and clustering. This research identifies the characteristics of data which can be potentially used in roadmapping and presents an approach to yielding important information from such raw data through various data mining techniques including text mining, multi-dimensional scaling and K-means clustering. Moreover, this paper explains how this approach can be applied in each step of roadmapping (preliminary, mapping and managing steps).

Reconstructed gene network allows us to understand how genes interact with each. other However, network construction is very complex due to highly interactive nature of genes. A proposed approach to solve this complex problem is to cluster the genes according to similarity in their gene expression profiles. We applied k-means clustering with k = 10 to come up with ten clusters of genes. Then, we applied Bayesian Network structure learning with Hill-climbing search strategy and Akaike Information Criterion score to search for the best network. We compared inferred interactions to a reference positive interactions dataset and found similarities between our inferred interactions and the reference. We further study the gene interactions using Gene Ontology. From our findings, we conclude that the clustering step is essential in gene network reconstruction. Clustering produced better group of genes for Bayesian Network learning. Larger clusters also produced more gene interactions. Gene Ontology can be combined with clustering to produce better quality clusters to improve gene network construction.

Spatio-temporal data mining techniques are studied to discover knowledge from these images in order to provide more precise weather prediction. Two learning granularities have been proposed for inductive learning from spatial data: one is spatial object granularity and the other is pixel granularity. In this paper, we propose a pixel granularity based framework to extract useful knowledge from the remote sensing image database by using SOM and association rules mining. A three-stage algorithm, named as STARSI, is also proposed and used in this framework.

Association rule mining is one of the most important fields in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. Rules explosion is a serious problem which causes great concerned as conventional mining algorithms often produce too many rules for decision makers to digest. Since Web-based Mobile-Learning System collects vast amounts of learners profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships between attributes of learners, assessments, the solution strategies adopted by learners and so on. Therefore, this paper concentrates on a new data-mining algorithm, combined with the advantages of improved genetic agorithm, called ARGA (Association rules based on an improved Genetic Algorithm), to mine the association rules from a Web-based Mobile-Learning system. This paper first takes advantage of the genetic algorithm designed specifically for discovering association rules. Moreover, the analysis and experimenst are also made to show the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than the Apriori algorithm in Mobile Learning system.

There are a variety of techniques for solving the similarity matching in time series datasets. However, subsequence matching over data stream, finding those subsequences which are similar to a query sequence in a progressive and real-time fashion, is a challenging and novel problem due to the high speed, large quantity, potentially unbounded and evolving stream data. In this paper, firstly, we design a bound technique to prune the unnecessary computation as much as possible. Then, a novel algorithm is proposed which can identify all matched subsequences from data stream under the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) distance in a "single pass". Furthermore, our experiments on synthetic and real data show that the proposed method is at least 3 times faster than the existing algorithm: SPRING, only increasing several extra bytes.

The main property of a good aggregation algorithm is to extract the most representative data by using minimum resources. From this point of view, sampling is a promising aggregation method, that acts as surrogate for the whole data, and once extracted can be used to answer multiple kinds of queries (such as AVG, MEDIAN, SUM, COUNT, etc.), at no extra cost to the sensor network. Additionally, sampling also preserves correlations between attributes of multidimensional data, which is quite valuable for further data mining. In this paper, we propose a novel, distributed, weighted sampling algorithm to sample sensor network data and compare to an existing random sampling algorithm, which is the only algorithm to work in this kind of setting. We perform popular queries to evaluate our algorithm on a real world data set, which covers climate data in the US for the past 100 years. During testing, we focus on issues such as sample quality, network longevity, energy and communication costs. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Calders, T				Calders, Toon			The complexity of satisfying constraints on databases of transactions	ACTA INFORMATICA			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC LOGIC	Computing frequent itemsets is one of the most prominent problems in data mining. Recently, a new related problem, called FREQSAT, was introduced and studied: given some itemset-interval pairs, does there exist a database such that for every pair, the frequency of the itemset falls in the interval? In this paper, we extend this FREQSAT-problem by further constraining the database by giving other characteristics as part of the input as well. These characteristics are the maximal transaction length, the maximal number of transactions, and the maximal number of duplicates of a transaction. These extensions and all their combinations are studied in depth, and a hierarchy w.r.t. complexity is given. To make a complete picture, also the cases where the characteristics are constant; i.e., bounded and the bound being a fixed constant that is not a part of the input, are studied.

J	Hu, XH; Sokhansanj, B; Wu, D; Tang, YC				Hu, Xiaohua; Sokhansanj, Bahrad; Wu, Daniel; Tang, Yuchun			A novel approach for mining and fuzzy simulation of subnetworks from large biomolecular networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						biomedical literature mining; biomolecular network; fuzzy logic; information extraction; subnetwork	PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; GENETIC REGULATORY NETWORKS; CELL-CYCLE; EXPRESSION; COMPLEX; MODELS; COMMUNITIES; YEAST	Understanding the biomolecular network implementing cellular function goes beyond the old dogma of "one gene: one function"; only through comprehensive system understanding can we predict the impact of genetic variation in the population, design effective disease therapeutics, and evaluate the potential side-effects of therapies. In this paper, we present a novel method to model the regulatory system that executes a cellular function, which can be represented as a biomolecular network. Our method consists of three steps. First, the biomolecular network is derived using data-mining approaches to extend the initial conceptual biomolecular network from the literature search, etc. Secondly, once the whole biomolecular network structure is complete, a novel scale-free network clustering approach is applied to obtain various subnetworks. Lastly, fuzzy rule based models are generated for the subnetworks and simulations are run to predict their behavior in the cellular context. The modeling results represent hypotheses that are tested-against high-throughput data sets (microarrays and/or genetic screens) for both the natural system and perturbations. If computational results do not match experimental or previously published results, then new hypotheses are formed and they feed back into the data-mining and analyzing step to refine the biomolecuar network for the next iteration. This is repeated until a good match between modeling and data is obtained. Notably, the dynamic modeling component of this method depends on the automated network structure generation of the first component and the subnetwork clustering, which are both essential to make the solution tractable. Experimental results on human gene interaction networks and gene expression time series data for the human cell cycle indicate that our approach is promising for subnetwork mining and simulation from large biomolecular networks, as it produces a better convergence between continuous modeling and experiments.

For instance, the pages obtained in response to a query executed through a Web search form are usually generated by a program that accesses structured data in a local database, and embeds them into an HTML template. For software programs to gain full benefit from these "semi-structured" Web sources, wrapper programs must be built to provide a "machine-readable" view over them. Since Web sources are autonomous, they may experience changes that invalidate the current wrapper, thus automatic maintenance is an important issue. Wrappers must perform two tasks: navigating through Web sites and extracting structured data from HTML pages. While several works have addressed the automatic maintenance of data extraction tasks, the problem of maintaining the navigation sequences remains unaddressed to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a set of novel techniques to fill this gap. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Frank			Knowledge-based data analysis: First step toward the creation of clinical prediction rules using a new typicality measure	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						clinical prediction rules (CPRs); data analysis; fuzzy logic; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); typicality measure	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; NECK CIRCUMFERENCE; FAT DISTRIBUTION; DECISION RULE; DIAGNOSIS; SEGMENTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; VALIDATION	Clinical prediction rules play an important role in medical practice. They expedite diagnosis and limit unnecessary tests. However, the rule creation process is time consuming and expensive. With the current developments of efficient data mining algorithms and growing accessibility to medical data, the creation of clinical rules can be supported by automated rule induction from data. A data-driven method based on the reuse of previously collected medical records and clinical trial statistics is cost-effective; however, it requires well defined and intelligent methods for data analysis. This paper presents a new framework for knowledge representation for secondary data analysis and for generation of a new typicality measure, which integrates medical knowledge into statistical analysis. The framework is based on a semiotic approach for contextual knowledge and fuzzy logic for approximate knowledge. This semio-fuzzy framework has been applied to the analysis of predictors for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. This approach was tested on two clinical data sets. Medical knowledge was represented by a set of facts and fuzzy rules, and used to perform statistical analysis. Statistical methods provided several candidate outliers. Our new typicality measure identified those, which were medically significant, in the sense that the removal of those important outliers improved the descriptive model. This is a critical preprocessing step towards automated induction of predictive rules from data. These experimental results demonstrate that knowledge-based methods integrated with statistical approaches provide a practical framework to support the generation of clinical prediction rules.

J	Ma, HG; Zhu, XF; Ai, MS; Wang, JD				Ma, Hong-Guang; Zhu, Xiao-Fei; Ai, Ming-Shun; Wang, Ji-Dong			Fault diagnosis for analog circuits based on chaotic signal excitation	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; phase-space reconstruction; data mining; feature extraction	SETS	A fault diagnosis method for analog circuit is proposed in this paper. An all-purpose amplifier is taken as the typical circuit under test (CUT). The chaotic signal, which is generated by an improved Chua's circuit, is employed as the excitation signal of CUT. The algorithm for phase-space reconstruction of chaotic time series is a combination algorithm of multiple autocorrelation and Gamma-test. The circuit state is estimated based on detecting the geometric change of Chua's attractor with a data-mining approach. For the purpose of information fusion, another eight features are extracted from the testing data to comprehensively determine the CUT states. A discussion is made for comparing the effectiveness of each feature according to the testing results. (c) 2007 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, F; Chiang, SW; Lin, HR				Wu, Fan; Chiang, Shih-Wen; Lin, Jiunn-Rong			A new approach to mine frequent patterns using item-transformation methods	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; frequent pattern; Apriori; gray code; item transformation	DATABASES; ALGORITHM	Mining frequent patterns is a fundamental and crucial task in data-mining problems. The algorithms reported in the literature for mining frequent patterns can be classified into two approaches: the candidate generation-and-test approach (for example, the Apriori algorithm) and the pattern-growth approach (such as the FP-growth algorithm). The approaches both suffered from the problems that their speed is slow for large databases. This paper proposes a novel and simple approach, which does not belong to the above two approaches. This approach treats the database as a stream of data and finds frequent patterns by scanning the database only once. In addition, the approach can incrementally mine frequent patterns if the database is updated or inserted subsequently. Three versions of the approach (i.e., mapping-table, transformation-function, and logic-circuit) are provided. The logic-circuit version is the first one that mines frequent patterns by simple logic gates, and the modeling of this version shows its speed is thousands of times faster than that of the FP-growth algorithm. Analyses and simulations of the approach are also performed. Analyses show that the transformation-function version is much better than the Apriori and FP-growth ones in storage complexity. Simulation results show that the mapping-table version is comparable to the FP-growth algorithm in execution time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gigli, G; Bosse, E; Lampropoulos, GA				Gigli, George; Bosse, Eloi; Lampropoulos, George A.			An optimized architecture for classification combining data fusion and data-mining	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						data-mining; feature selection; data fusion; classification	SELECTION	This paper presents a new architecture to integrate a library of feature extraction, Data-mining, and fusion techniques to automatically and optimally configure a classification solution for a given labeled set of training patterns. The most expensive and scarce resource in any detection problem (feature selection/classification) tends to be the acquiring of labeled training patterns from which to design the system. The objective of this paper is to present a new Data-mining architecture that will include conventional Data-mining algorithms, feature selection methods and algorithmic fusion techniques to best exploit the set of labeled training patterns so as to improve the design of the overall classification system. The paper describes how feature selection and Data-mining algorithms are combined through a Genetic Algorithm, using single source data, and how multi-source data are combined through several best-suited fusion techniques by employing a Genetic Algorithm for optimal fusion. A simplified version of the overall system is tested on the detection of volcanoes in the Magellan SAR database of Venus. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Tsoumakas, G; Vlahavas, I				Tsoumakas, Grigorios; Vlahavas, Ioannis			An interoperable and scalable Web-based system for classifier sharing and fusion	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						web services; classifier fusion; distributed data mining; classification models		This paper describes CSF/DC, a Web-based system for classifier sharing and fusion. CSF/DC enables the sharing of classification models, by allowing the upload and download of such models expressed in the industry standard PMML language on the system's online classifier repository. CSF/DC also leverages the individual knowledge shared by such (potentially heterogeneous) classification models and offers quality decision support to any user with an Internet connection through a guided procedure. However, some organizations or individuals might want to share the predictive capabilities of their classification models without compromising their internal structure. This is accommodated by CSF/DC through the use of Web services. Specifically, CSF/DC allows the participation of classifier Web services in the decision fusion process, by offering the necessary online mechanisms for the registration and invocation of such Web services developed and installed at remote sites.

A database including clinical test scores and sit-to-stand test variables obtained from 110 medically stable elderly subjects was submitted to data mining by searching for association rules. The presence of rules revealed some redundancies due to sample homogeneity, as mainly observed in the joint analysis of a questionnaire for daily activities assessment (Nottingham test) and the sitto-stand, and due to similar evaluated information, as resulted from the joint analysis of a balance and gait scale (Tinetti test) and the sit-to-stand. Conversely, when no association rules were found, the tests carried unrelated information. The associations mined while analysing these clinical tests encouraged the integration of biomechanical tests, increasing significantly its clinical applicability and reducing the information redundancy. The information extracted also allowed to highlight rules typical of elderly persons that may serve as a knowledge-based tool for the detection of possible deviation from normality.

The challenge that motivated the development of a grid-enabled version of the 'standalone' KDDML (Knowledge Discovery in Databases Markup Language) environment was on one side to exploit the parallelism offered by the grid environment, and on the other side to overcome the problem of data immovability, a quite frequent restriction on real-world data collections that has principally a privacy-preserving purpose. The last question is addressed by moving the code and 'mining' the data 'on the place', that is by adapting the computation to the availability and localization of the data.

J	Guo, GM				Guo, Gen Ming			A computer-aided bibliometric system to article ranked lists in interdisciplinar generate core subjects	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						bibliometrics; scientometrics; citation analysis; paper ranking	SELF-CITATION	Due to the tremendous increase and variations in serial publications, the impact of every peer-reviewed paper on different subjects is varying continually. Domain experts or researchers want to keep track of those latest and highly cited peer-reviewed papers: however they are finding it difficult to update or collect their subject core paper lists regularly and accurately. The evaluation of serial papers for generating and ranking core paper lists on different subjects becomes a very challenging task for scholars or librarians. Therefore, a computer-aided bibliometric system (CABS) was developed to generate a core article ranked list automatically. Four indicators - subject reference cited counts, subject total cited Counts. subject reference period impact and subject reference cited history - were proposed to generate a subject core article ranking list. Seven different subjects including E-commerce. Data Mining, Supply Chain, Image Processing, Enterprise Resource Planning, Microarray and Expert Systems were used as samples. The turning point (TP) was proposed to determine the core article area in the paper citation analysis. The TP patterns observed were that all TPs had the same rate for four different subjects. The usage of TP patterns can also be used to verify the experimental results. This study provides experimental evidence to disprove three myths. Myth 1: the top papers on a subject (for instance, the top 10 papers) were all submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 2: the highly cited papers (cited counts >4) on interdisciplinary subjects were almost submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 3: the articles published in the top journals on a subject would be highly cited. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Compressed hierarchical mining of frequent closed patterns from dense data sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						frequent closed patterns; progressive; dense data sets; data mining; parallel mining		This paper addresses the problem of finding frequent closed patterns ( FCPs) from very dense data sets. We introduce two compressed hierarchical FCP mining algorithms: C-Miner and B-Miner. The two algorithms compress the original mining space, hierarchically partition the whole mining task into independent subtasks, and mine each subtask progressively. The two algorithms adopt different task partitioning strategies: C-Miner partitions the mining task based on Compact Matrix Division, whereas B-Miner partitions the task based on Base Rows Projection. The compressed hierarchical mining algorithms enhance the mining efficiency and facilitate a progressive refinement of results. Moreover, because the subtasks can be mined independently, C-Miner and B-Miner can be readily paralleled without incurring significant communication overhead. We have implemented C-Miner and B-Miner, and our performance study on synthetic data sets and real dense microarray data sets shows their effectiveness over existing schemes. We also report experimental results on parallel versions of these two methods.

J	Juhola, M; Laurikkala, J				Juhola, Martti; Laurikkala, Jorma			On metricity of two heterogeneous measures in the presence of missing values	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Metric; Distance; Mixed-type variables; Missing values; Medical data	SYSTEM	Heterogeneous Euclidean-overlap metric and heterogeneous value difference metric given in machine learning literature are useful for the consideration of mixed-type data for machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining tasks. Mixed-type variables are quite common in practical problems, but this property has been taken into account only seldom in pattern recognition, data mining and decision making algorithms. We observed that these two distance measures are not actually metrics after having found a special situation when they are not metric, but pseudometric, a feature to be noted while using them. Nevertheless, by changing their definitions somewhat, it is possible to meet the metricity. Especially in medical applications, the redefinition of the two measures might be important, since otherwise it is possible in theory that, for example, two identical cases would be classified differently. Nearest neighbor searching tests with medical data were run to illustrate the behavior of these measures. Notwithstanding the violation of the metricity their original forms yielded slightly better classification results. The reason was that in real data sets tested there were very few almost similar cases according to these distance measures, and the original forms based on more separating distances than the redefinitions were slightly better in the classification.

Spectroscopic scatterometry, an optical-wavelength light-diffraction technique, is emerging as a fast, accurate, and nondestructive means of monitoring profiles. A photoresist grating pattern on an InP substrate and an etched InP grating with periods of 0.2 and 0.24 mu m were successfully evaluated by using unpolarized simple optical metrology. A precise grating profile evaluation technique with an accuracy of nanometers enabled us to obtain an accurate coupling coefficient (kappa L) for DFB laser diodes. DFB laser diodes with well-controlled kappa L are very promising for practical use in cost-effective optical networks.

Attribute-oriented fuzzy generalization in proximity- and similarity-based relational database systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							MODEL; DEPENDENCIES; HIERARCHIES	In this article we investigate an attribute-oriented induction approach for acquisition of abstract knowledge from data stored in a fuzzy database environment. We utilize a proximity-based fuzzy database schema as the medium carrying the original information, where lack of precise information about an entity can be reflected via multiple attribute values, and the classical equivalence relation is replaced with the broader fuzzy proximity relation. We analyze in detail the process of attribute-oriented induction by concept hierarchies, utilizing the original properties of fuzzy databases to support this established data mining technique. In our approach we take full advantage of the implicit knowledge about the similarity of original attribute values, included by default in the investigated fuzzy database schemas.

While the current methods are inducing sequential patterns within a single attribute, the proposed method is able to detect them among different attributes. By incorporating the additional attributes, the sequential patterns found are richer and more informative to the user. This paper proposes a new method for inducing multi-dimensional sequential patterns with the use of Hellinger entropy measure. A number of theorems are proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the sequential pattern systems. The proposed method is tested on some synthesized transaction databases.

Logistic regression was employed to distinguish between near-crisis months and safe months from January 1998 through October 2000, which is the last month before the most recent crisis in Turkey. Thus trained and once validated, the Turkish Economy Stability Index (TESI) was then successfully tested using independent data from the 1994 crisis. One of the two dimensionless attributes that we integrated into TESI, the capital adequacy ratio of banks, a precursor of banking crises, was selected from among seven precursors of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The other one, the ratio of international reserves to short term outstanding external debt, is itself a precursor of currency crises. Our method for designing TESI may easily be applied to other emerging markets provided that they have had at least one financial crisis in recent history.

As a low dimensional graphical representation of the clusters could be much more informative than such a single value, this paper proposes a new tool for the visualization of fuzzy clustering results. By using the basic properties of fuzzy clustering algorithms, this new tool maps the cluster centers and the data such that the distances between the clusters and the data-points are preserved. During the iterative mapping process, the algorithm uses the membership values of the data and minimizes an objective function similar to the original clustering algorithm. Comparing to the original Sammon mapping not only reliable cluster shapes are obtained but the numerical complexity of the algorithm is also drastically reduced. The developed tool has been applied for visualization of reconstructed phase space trajectories of chaotic systems. The case study demonstrates that proposed FUZZSAMM algorithm is a useful tool in user-guided clustering.

Due to the economical importance of the products, it is important to know who are the ones who have the largest influence to the products. Is there a dominant player in developing communities? In this paper, the aspect is studied with respect to the Linux Kernel community. We show that the influence is centered to a small number of core people, and corporates have a large impact to the development. Moreover, we enumerate the most influential companies.

However, mobile applications are required to operate in pervasive computing environments of dynamic nature. Such applications predict the appropriate context in their environment in order to act efficiently. A context model, which deals with the location prediction of moving users, is proposed. Such model is used for trajectory classification through Machine Learning techniques. Hence, spatial and spatiotemporal context prediction is regarded as context classification based on supervised learning. Finally, two classification schemes are presented, evaluated and compared with other ML schemes in order to support location prediction and decision making.

For extraction from TSDB perception based information relevant to decision making problems it is necessary to develop methods of perception based time series data mining (PTSDM). The paper considers different approaches used in analysis of time series databases for description of perception based patterns and discusses some methods of PTSDM.

Some of the features may be redundant or contribute little (if anything) to the detection process. That is why the purpose of this study is to identify important KDD features which will be used to train a neural network (NN), in order to best classify and detect attacks. Four NNs were studied: Modular, Recurrent, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Time-Lag recurrent (TLR) NNs. We investigated the performance of combining the Fisher's filter used as a feature selection technique, with one of the previously cited NNs. Our simulations show that using Fisher's filter improves largely the performance of the four considered NNs in terms of detection rate, attack classification, and computational time.

In these scenarios, several related decisions must be made at a time, which are also bounded by constraints (e.g. inventory/stock limitations, costs, limited resources, time, schedules, etc). In this paper, we present a new method to make a good global decision when we have such a complex environment with several local interwoven data mining models. In these situations, the best local cutoff for each model is not usually the best cutoff in global terms. We use simulation with Petri nets to obtain better cutoffs for the data mining models. We apply our approach to a frequent problem in customer relationship management (CRM), more specifically, a direct-marketing campaign design where several alternative products have to be offered to the same house list of customers and with usual inventory limitations. We experimentally compare two different methods to obtain the cutoff for the models (one based on merging the prospective customer lists and using the local cutoffs, and the other based on simulation), illustrating that methods which use simulation to adjust model cutoff obtain better results than a more classical analytical method.

Two types of indices are available: mono-attribute indices (B-tree, bitmap, hash, etc.) and multi-attribute indices (join indices, bitmap join indices). In relational data warehouses, bitmap join indices (BJIs) are bitmap indices for optimizing star join queries through bit-wise operations. They can be used to avoid actual joins of tables, or to greatly reduce the volume of data that must be joined, by executing restrictions in advance. BJIs are defined using non-key dimension attributes and fact key attributes. Moreover, the problem of selecting these indices is difficult because there is a large number of candidate attributes (defined on dimension tables) that could participate in building these indices. To reduce this complexity, we propose an approach which first prunes the search space of this problem using data mining techniques, and then based on the new search space, it uses a greedy algorithm to select BJIs that minimize the cost of executing a set of queries and satisfy a storage constraint. The main peculiarity of our pruning approach, compared to the existing ones (that use only appearance frequencies of indexable attributes appearing in queries as a pruning metric), is that it uses others parameters such as the size of their dimension tables, the length of each tuple and the size of a disk page.

The main idea of the Discovery Challenge organized at the European Conferences on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases since 1999 was to encourage a collaborative research effort rather than a competition between data miners. Different data sets have been used for the Discovery Challenge workshops during the seven years. The paper summarizes our experience gained when organizing and evaluating the Discovery Challenge on the atherosclerosis risk factor data.

However, for many application domains, the raw data is numerical (matrices of real numbers whose dimensions denote objects and properties). Therefore, using efficient 0/1 mining techniques needs for tedious Boolean property encoding phases. This is, e.g., the case, when considering microarray data mining and its impact for knowledge discovery in molecular biology. We consider the possibility to mine directly numerical data to extract collections of relevant bi-sets, i.e., couples of associated sets of objects and attributes which satisfy some user-defined constraints. Not only we propose a new pattern domain but also we introduce a complete solver for computing the so-called numerical bi-sets. Preliminary experimental validation is given.

Various measures exist for evaluating and ranking these discovered patterns but often they don't consider user subjective interest. We propose an ontology-based data-mining methodology called ExCIS (Extraction using a Conceptual Information System) for integrating expert prior knowledge in a data-mining process. Its originality is to build a specific Conceptual Information System related to the application domain in order to improve datasets preparation and results interpretation. This paper focus on our ontological choices and an interestingness measure IMAK which evaluates patterns considering expert knowledge.

One of the works we have presented is the ontology-based integration of business, data warehousing and data mining. This way may make existing BI systems as user and business-friendly as expected. However, it is challenging to tackle issues and construct actionable and business-friendly systems by simply improving existing BI framework. Therefore, in this paper, we further propose a new framework for constructing nextgeneration BI systems. That is intelligence metasynthesis, namely the next-generation BI systems should to some extent synthesize four types of intelligence, including data intelligence, domain intelligence, human intelligence and network/web intelligence. The theory for guiding the intelligence metasynthesis is metasynthetic engineering. To this end, an appropriate intelligence integration framework is substantially important. We first address the roles of each type of intelligence in developing next-generation BI systems. Further, implementation issues are addressed by discussing key components for synthesizing the intelligence. The proposed framework is based on our real-world experience and practice in designing and implementing BI systems. It also greatly benefits from multi-disciplinary knowledge dialog such as complex intelligent systems and cognitive sciences. The proposed theoretical framework has potential to deal with key challenges in existing BI framework and systems.

Nevertheless, while exploring the cube, analysts are rapidly confronted by analyzing a huge number of visible cells to identify the most interesting ones. Coupling OLAP technologies and mining methods may help them by the automation of this tedious task. In the scope of discovery-driven exploration, this paper presents two methods to detect and highlight interesting cells within a cube slice. The cell's degree of interest is based on the calculation of either test-value or Chi-Square contribution. Indicators are computed instantaneously according to the user-defined dimensions drill-down. Their display is done by a colorcoding system. A proof of concept implementation on the ORACLE 10g system is described at the end of the paper.

However, the time that Fuzzy ARTMAP takes to converge to a solution increases rapidly as the number of patterns used for training is increased. In this paper we examine the time Fuzzy ARTMAP takes to converge to a solution and we propose a coarse grain parallelization technique, based on a pipeline approach, to speed-up the training process. In particular, we have parallelized Fuzzy ARTMAP without the match-tracking mechanism. We provide a series of theorems and associated proofs that show the characteristics of Fuzzy ARTMAP's, without matchtracking, parallel implementation. Results run on a BEOWULF cluster with three large databases show linear speedup as a function of the number of processors used in the pipeline. The databases used for our experiments are the Forrest CoverType database from the UCI Machine Learning repository and two artificial databases, where the data generated were 16-dimensional Gaussian distributed data belonging to two distinct classes, with different amounts of overlap (5% and 15%).

Its application to classification tasks implies the use of both labeled (training) data and unlabeled (working) data to build a classifier whose main goal is that of classifying (only) unlabeled data as accurately as possible. Unlike the classical inductive setting, no general rule valid for all possible instances is generated. Transductive learning is most suited for those applications where the examples for which a prediction is needed are already known when training the classifier. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature on building transductive classifiers from data stored in a single table of a relational database. Nonetheless, no attention has been paid to the application of the transduction principle in a (multi-) relational setting, where data are stored in multiple tables of a relational database. In this paper we propose a new transductive classifier, named TRANSC, which is based on a probabilistic approach to making transductive inferences from relational data. This new method works in a transductive setting and employs a principled probabilistic classification in multi-relational data mining to face the challenges posed by some spatial data mining problems. Probabilistic inference allows us to compute the class probability and return, in addition to result of transductive classification, the confidence in the classification. The predictive accuracy of TRANSC has been compared to that of its inductive counterpart in an empirical study involving both a benchmark relational dataset and two spatial datasets.

SpyCon: Emulating user activities to detect evasive spyware	2007 IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference, Vols 1 and 2	IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference	APR 11-13, 2007	New Orleans, LA	IEEE		associative rule mining; honeytokens; spyware; user activity		The success of any spyware is determined by its ability to evade detection. Although traditional detection methodologies employing signature and anomaly based systems have had reasonable success, new class of spyware programs emerge which blend in with user activities to avoid detection. One of the latest anti-spyware technologies consists of a local agent that generates honeytokens of known parameters (e.g., network access requests) and tricks spyware into assuming it to be legitimate activity. In this paper, as a first step, we address the deficiencies of static honeytoken generation and present an attack that circumvents such detection techniques. We synthesize the attack by means of data mining algorithms like associative rule mining. Next, we present a randomized honeytoken generation mechanism to address this new class of spyware. Experimental results show that (i) static honeytokens are detected with near 100% accuracy, thereby defeating the state-of-the-art anti-spyware technique, (ii) randomized honeytoken generation mechanism is an effective anti-spyware solution.

These studies try to address the interpretability and efficiency problems encountered by traditional frequent pattern mining methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, how to efficiently mine compact sequential patterns in a dynamic sequence database environment has not been explored yet. In this paper, we examine the problem how to mine closed sequential patterns incrementally. A compact structure CSTree is designed to keep the closed sequential patterns, and an efficient algorithm IMCS is developed to maintain the CSTree when the sequence database is updated incrementally. A thorough experimental study shows that IMCS outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms - PrefixSpan, CloSpan, BIDE and a recently proposed incremental mining algorithm IncSpan by about a factor of 4 to more than an order of magnitude.

Combining western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to heal CHD becomes especially necessary for medical society today. Since western medicine faces some problems, like high cost and more side effects. TCM can be a complementary alternative to overcome these defects. Identification of what syndrome a CHD patient caught has been a challenging issue for medical society because the core of TCM is syndrome. In this paper, we carry out a large-scale clinical epidemiology to collect data with 1069 cases, each of which must be a CHD instance but may be diagnosed as different syndromes. We take blood stasis syndrome (frequency is 69%) as an example, employ four distinct kinds of data mining algorithms: Bayesian model; Neural Network; Support vector machine and Decision trees to classify the data and compare their performance. The results indicated that neural network is the best identifier with 88.6% accuracy on the holdout samples. The next is support vector machine with 82.5% accuracy, a slight higher than Bayesian model with 82.0% counterpart. The decision tree performs the worst, only 80.4%. We conclude that in identifying syndromes in CHD, neural network can provide a best insight to clinical application.

The major challenge of data perturbation is balancing privacy protection and data quality, which are normally considered as a pair of contradictive factors. We propose that selectively preserving only the task/model specific information in perturbation would improve the balance. Geometric data perturbation, consisting of random rotation perturbation, random translation perturbation, and noise addition, aims at preserving the important geometric properties of a multidimensional dataset, while providing better privacy guarantee for data classification modeling. The preliminary study has shown that random geometric perturbation can well preserve model accuracy for several popular classification models, including kernel methods, linear classifiers, and SVM classifiers, while it also revealed some security concerns to random geometric perturbation. In this paper, we address some potential attacks to random geometric perturbation and design several methods to reduce the threat of these attacks. Experimental study shows that the enhanced geometric perturbation can provide satisfactory privacy guarantee while still well preserving model accuracy for the discussed data classification models.

Now feature selection is facing challenge in high dimension space, such as text categorization in information retrieval. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is an excellent dimensionality reduction method which transforms the original data into low-dimensional feature space. However, it changes the original physical features and makes,features uninterpretable, which motivates us to select but not transform features by LDA idea of preserving structure information of between-class and within-class for text categorization. In the paper; a new approach of feature selection based on Constrained LDA (CLDA) is proposed, which models feature selection as a search problem in subspace and finds optimal solution subject to some restrictions. Further; CLDA optimization problem is transformed into a process of scoring and sorting of features. Experiments on 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 show that CLDA is consistently better than information gain and chit-test with lower computational complexity.

For example, a research publication database can be constructed by automatically extracting titles, authors, and conference information from online papers. A common difficulty in consolidating data from multiple sources is that records are referenced in a variety of ways (e.g. abbreviations, aliases, and misspellings). Therefore, it can be difficult to construct a single, standard representation to present to the user. We refer to the task of constructing this representation as canonicalization. Despite its importance, there is little existing work on canonicalization. In this paper, we explore the use of edit distance measures to construct a canonical representation that is "central" in the sense that it is most similar to each of the disparate records. This approach reduces the impact of noisy records on the canonical representation. Furthermore, because the user may prefer different styles of canonicalization, we show how different edit distance costs can result in different forms of canonicalization. For example, reducing the cost of character deletions can result in representations that favor abbreviated forms over expanded forms (e.g. KDD versus Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining). We describe how to learn these costs from a small amount of manually annotated data using stochastic hill-climbing. Additionally, we investigate feature-based methods to learn ranking preferences over canonicalizations. These approaches can incorporate arbitrary textual evidence to select a canonical record. We evaluate our approach on a real-world publications database and show that our learning method results in a canonicalization solution that is robust to errors and easily customizable to user preferences.

In this paper, we consider a new kind of first order temporal pattern, specified in Allen's Temporal Interval Logic, where time is explicitly represented by intervals. We present the algorithm MILPRIT for mining temporal interval patterns, which uses variants of the classical level-wise search algorithms. MILPRIT allows a broad spectrum of constraints over temporal patterns to be incorporated in the mining process.

Indeed for spatial decision-makers, it is more important to identify and map problems than facts. Until now, chorems were made manually by geographers based on the own knowledge of the territory. So, an international project was launched in order to automatically discover spatial patterns and layout chorems starting from spatial databases. After examining some manually-made chorems some guidelines were identified. Then the architecture of a prototype system is presented based on a canonical database structure, a subsystem for spatial patterns discovery based on spatial data mining, a subsystem for chorem layout, and a specialized language to represent chorems.

On the other hand agents are often expected to be resource-bounded systems, which do not utilize much memory, disk space and CPU time. In this paper we present a novel framework for incremental, statistical learning, attempting to satisfy both requirements. The new method, called APS, runs in a cycle including such phases as: storing observations in a history, rule discovery using data mining algorithms, and knowledge base maintenance. Once processed, the old facts are removed from the history and in every subsequent learning run only the recent portion of observations is analysed in search of new rules. This approach can substantially save disk space and processing time as compared to batch learning methods.

However, additional background information (namely constraints) are available in some domains and must be considered in the clustering solutions. Recently, we have developed a new graph b-coloring clustering algorithm. It exhibits more important clustering features and enables to build a fine partition of the data set in clusters when the number of clusters is not pre-defined. In this paper, we propose an extension of this method to incorporate two types of Instance-Level clustering constraints (must-link and cannot-link constraints). In experiments with artificial constraints on benchmark data sets, we show improvements in the quality of the clustering solution and the computational complexity of the algorithm.

Hence, clustering solves two kinds of problems simultaneously, it partitions the datasets into cluster of objects that are similar to each other and describes the clusters by cluster prototypes to provide some information about the distribution of the data. In most of the cases these cluster prototypes describe the clusters as simple geometrical objects, like spheres, ellipsoids, lines, linear subspaces etc., and the cluster prototype defines a special distance function. Unfortunately in most of the cases the user does not have prior knowledge about the number of clusters and not even about the proper shape of prototypes. The real distribution of data is generally much more complex than these simple geometrical objects, and the number of clusters depends much more on how well the chosen cluster prototypes fit the distribution of data than on the real groups within the data. This is especially true when the clusters are used for local linear modeling purposes. The aim of this paper is not to define a new distance norm based on a problem dependent cluster prototype but to show how the so called geodesic distance that is based on the exploration of the manifold the data lie on, can be used in the clustering instead of the classical Euclidean distance. The paper presents how this distance measure can be integrated within fuzzy clustering and some examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed new methods.

This article analyze the power of AO as data mining tools applied on databases collected in several medical intervention domains, with the aim of verify their real effectiveness, compared with the regression models and the standard ANN models, in processing such kind of complex real-world data. These tools have been applied by the authors in independent applications on nineteen analyses carried out on thirteen databases collected in five main medical domains. The performance obtained by the ANNs coupled with AO shows a systematic significant increase in terms of the overall accuracy, compared with both the traditional statistic methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) and the Standard ANNs. The added value of AO over standard ANNs consisted in an average increase in overall accuracy of about 10% ( from 77.59% to 88.07% respectively), bringing to a 16 % difference versus classical statistics models. This increase in predictive capacity was obtained with an average 50% "intelligent" reduction of the input variables. The impact of AO approach in processing such kind of complex real-world data, is discussed emphasizing how the implementation of clinical diagnostic tools based on AO methods can be considered an added value for physicians in their clinical practice.

Isomap is a representative of manifold learning approaches for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. However, Isomap is an unsupervised learning algorithm and has no out-of-sample ability. Kernel Isomap (KIsomap) is an improved Isomap and has a generalization property by utilizing kernel trick. At first, considering class label, a Weighted Euclidean Distance (WED) is designed. Then, WED based kernel Isomap (WKIsomap) is proposed. As a supervised learning algorithm, WKIsomap can not only be used in data visualization, but also applied to feature extraction for pattern recognition. The experimental results show that WKIsomap is more robust than Isomap and Klsomap in data visualization. Moreover, when noise is added into data, WKIsomap based classifiers are more robust to noise than Klsomap based ones.

In this paper, built upon the existing literature on the max margin based learning, we develop a new max margin learning approach called Enhanced Max Margin Learning (EMML) framework. In addition, we apply EMML framework to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data turning problem in a multimedia database. The main contributions include: (1) we have developed a new max margin learning approach - the enhanced max margin learning framework that is much more efficient in learning with a much faster convergence rate, which is verified in empirical evaluations; (2) we have applied this EMML approach to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale, allowing facilitating a multimodal data mining querying to a very large scale multimedia database, and excelling many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all; this advantage is also supported through the complexity analysis as well as empirical evaluations against a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method from the literature. While EMML is a general framework, for the evaluation purpose, we apply it to the Berkeley Drosophila embryo image database, and report the performance comparison with a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method.

This paper proposes a method of automatically acquiring semantic annotations (AASA). In the AASA method, we employ a combination of data mining and optimization to acquire semantic annotations. Key features of AASA include combining association rules, inference mechanism, genetic algorithm and self-organizing map to create semantic annotations, and using the k-nearest-neighbor query combined with simulated annealing to maintain semantic annotations.

In recent years, many data mining algorithms have been enhanced with privacy-preserving feature: decision tree induction, frequent itemset counting, association analysis, k-means clustering, support vector machine, Naive Bayes classifier, Bayesian networks, and so on. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privacy-preserving self-organizing map for vertically partitioned data involving two parties. Self-organizing map (SOM) is a widely used algorithm for transforming data sets to a lower dimensional space to facilitate visualization. The challenges in preserving data privacy in SOM axe (1) to securely discover the winner neuron from data privately held by two parties; (2) to securely update weight vectors of neurons; and (3) to securely determine the termination status of SOM. We propose protocols to address the above challenges. We prove that these protocols are correct and privacy-preserving. Also, we prove that the intermediate results generated by these protocols do not violate the data privacy of the participating parties.

Distributed and shared memory algorithm for parallel mining of association rules	Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 18-20, 2007	Leipzig, GERMANY					The search for frequent patterns in transactional databases is considered one of the most important data mining problems. Several parallel and sequential algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Almost all of these algorithms make repeated passes over the dataset to determine the set of frequent itemsets, thus implying high I/O overhead. In the parallel case, most algorithms perform a sum-reduction at the end of each pass to construct the global counts, also implying high synchronization cost. We present a novel algorithm that exploits efficiently the trade-offs between computation, communication, memory usage and synchronization. The algorithm was implemented over a cluster of SNIP nodes combining distributed and shared memory paradigms. This paper presents the results of our algorithm on different data sizes experimented on different numbers of processors, and studies the effect of these variations on the overall performance.

The algorithm naturally extends the two class Gentle AdaBoost algorithm to multiclass classification by using the multiclass exponential loss and the multiclass response encoding scheme. Unlike other multiclass algorithms which reduce the K-class classification task to K binary classifications, GAMBLE handles the task directly and symmetrically, with only one committee classifier. We formally derive the GAM-BLE algorithm with the quasi-Newton method, and prove the structural equivalence of the two regression trees in each boosting step. To scale up to large datasets, we utilize the generalized Query By Committee (QBC) active learning framework to focus learning on the most informative samples. Our empirical results show that with QBC-style active sample selection, we can achieve faster training time and potentially higher classification accuracy. GAMBLE's numerical superiority, structural elegance and low computation complexity make it highly competitive with state-of-the-art multiclass classification algorithms.	[Huang, Jian; Giles, C.

It tries to minimize the complexity of fuzzy rule-based classifiers while maximizing their accuracy by selecting only a small number of fuzzy rules from a large number of candidate rules. One important issue in genetic fuzzy rule selection is the prescreening of candidate rules. If we use too many candidate rules, a large computation load is required to search for good rule sets. On the other hand, good rule sets will not be found when promising fuzzy rules are not included in the candidate rule set. It is essential for the success of genetic fuzzy rule selection to use a tractable number of promising fuzzy rules as candidate rules. In this paper, we propose an idea of using Pareto-optimal and near Pareto-optimal fuzzy rules as candidate rules in genetic fuzzy rule selection. Pareto-optimality is defined by two well-known data mining criteria: support and confidence. To extract not only Pareto-optimal but also near Pareto-optimal fuzzy rules, we modify Pareto dominance using a dominance margin c. Through computational experiments, we examine the effect of the proposed idea on multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection.

Confidence and coverage are often used as two objectives to evaluate each rule in the search for Pareto-optimal rules. Whereas all association rules satisfying the minimum support and confidence are usually extracted in data mining, only Pareto-optimal rules are searched for by an EMO algorithm in multiobjective data mining. On the other hand, accuracy and complexity are used to evaluate each rule set. The complexity of each rule set is often measured by the number of rules and the number of antecedent conditions. An EMO algorithm is used to search for Pareto-optimal rule sets with respect to accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we examine the relation between Pareto-optimal rules and Pareto-optimal rule sets in the design of fuzzy rule-based systems for pattern classification problems. More specifically, we check whether Pareto-optimal rules are included in Pareto-optimal rule sets through computational experiments using multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. A mixture of Pareto-optimal and non Pareto-optimal fuzzy rules are used as candidate rules in multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. We also examine the performance of selected rules when we use only Pareto-optimal rules as candidate rules.

Rough set theory is very useful to define dependency among attributes and extract decision rules from the set. One of our main aims of this paper is to propose a concept of rough ontology. A concept of rough ontology is extended concept of rough set, and it enables us to use flexible information system in the form of ontology. And rough ontology is useful to introduce concepts rough set theory in to ontology. In this paper we formulate a concept of rough ontology, which is extended concept of rough set theory.

Typical ensembles are often unsatisfactory. Meta-learning techniques can be much more powerful in composing optimal or close to optimal solutions to given tasks. Efficient meta-learning is possible only within a versatile and flexible data mining framework providing uniform procedures for dealing with different kinds of methods and tools for thorough analysis of learning processes and their results. We propose a methodology for information exchange between machines of different abstraction levels. Inter-machine communication is based on uniform representation of gained knowledge. Implemented in a general data mining framework, it provides tools for sophisticated analysis of adaptive processes of heterogeneous machines. The resulting meta-knowledge is a brilliant information source for further meta-learning.

This paper presents SNTS (Sensor Network Troubleshooting Suite), a tool that performs automated failure diagnosis in sensor networks. SNTS can be used to monitor network conditions using simple visualization techniques as well as to troubleshoot deployed distributed sensor systems using data mining approaches. It is composed of (i) a data collection front-end that records events internal to the network and (ii) a data processing back-end for subsequent analysis. We use data mining techniques to automate failure diagnosis on the back-end. The assumption is that the occurrence of execution conditions that cause failures (e.g., traversal of an execution path that contains a "bug" or occurrence of a sequence of events that a protocol was not designed to handle) will have a measurable correlation (by causality) with the resulting failure itself. Hence, by mining for network conditions that correlate with failure states the root causes of failure are revealed with high probability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, we have used it to troubleshoot a tracking system called EnviroTrack [4], which, although performs well most of the time, occasionally fails to track targets correctly. Results show that SNTS can identify the major causes of the problem and give developers useful hints on improving the performance of the tracking system.

For example, in a binary classification problem it is often the case that examples of one class are abundant, while examples of the other class are in short supply. Examples from one class, typically the positive class, can be limited due to the financial cost or time required to collect these examples. This work presents a comprehensive empirical study of learning when examples from one class are extremely rare, but examples of the other class(es) are plentiful. Specifically, we address the issue of how many examples from the abundant class should be used when training a classifier on data where one class is very rare. Nearly one million classifiers were built and evaluated to generate the results presented in this work. Our results demonstrate that the often used 'even distribution' is not optimal when dealing with such rare events.

Among the molecular diagnosis study, metabolomics has been a recently emerging field as promising tools for early detection of diseases. However, due to complexity and largeness of the metabolic profile data, data mining techniques have been essential to handle, process, and analyze the data, and also it is not obvious to apply the data mining techniques to such data, accordingly suggesting the need for suitable data mining strategies for the metabolomic data analysis. In this study, we propose required data mining procedures for effective metabolomics studies including description of current limit or future prospect and our approaches, consisting of preprocessing, dimension reduction, feature analysis and selection, classification, and automated data processing software.

Furthermore, for many such problems, multiple established ranking models have been well studied and it is desirable to combine their results into a joint ranking, a formalism denoted as rank aggregation. This work presents a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation (ULARA) which returns a linear combination of the individual ranking functions based on the principle of rewarding ordering agreement between the rankers. In addition to presenting ULARA, we demonstrate its effectiveness on a data fusion task across ad hoc retrieval systems.

In this work, we investigate how IDBs can support global models, such as decision trees. Our focus is on predictive clustering trees (PCTs). PCTs generalize decision trees and can be used for prediction and clustering, two of the most common data mining tasks. Regular PCT induction builds PCTs top-down, using a greedy algorithm, similar to that of C4.5. We propose a new induction algorithm for PCTs based on beam search. This has three advantages over the regular method: (a) it returns a set of PCTs satisfying the user constraints instead of just one PCT; (b) it better allows for pushing of user constraints into the induction algorithm; and (c) it is less susceptible to myopia. In addition, we propose similarity constraints for PCTs, which improve the diversity of the resulting PCT set.

Boosting algorithms are considered stronger than bagging and dagging on noise-free data. However, there are strong empirical indications that bagging and dagging are much more robust than boosting in noisy settings. For this reason, in this work we built an ensemble using a voting methodology of bagging, boosting and dagging ensembles with 8 sub-classifiers in each one. We performed a comparison with simple bagging, boosting and dagging ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers, as well as other well known combining methods, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique had better accuracy in most cases.

Identification of spatial outliers is an important task for data mining researchers and geographers. A number of algorithms have been developed to detect spatial anomalies in meteorological images, transportation systems, and contagious disease data. In this paper, we propose a set of graph-based algorithms to identify spatial outliers. Our method first constructs a graph based on k-nearest neighbor relationship in spatial domain, assigns the nonspatial attribute differences as edge weights, and continuously cuts high- weight edges to identify isolated points or regions that are much dissimilar to their neighboring objects. The proposed algorithms have two major advantages compared with the existing spatial outlier detection methods: accurate in detecting point outliers and capable of identifying region outliers. Experiments conducted on the US Housing data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

To search visual information on the basis of semantic concepts requires both their discovery and meaningful indexing. By analyzing the users' search, relevance feedback and selection patterns, we propose a method which allows semantic concepts to be discovered and migrated through an index hierarchy. Our method also includes a robust scoring mechanism that pen-nits faulty indexing to be rectified over time. These include: (i) repeated and sustained corroboration of specific index terms before installation, and (ii) the ability for the index score to be both incremented and decremented. Experimental results indicate that convergence to an optimum index level may be achieved in reasonable time periods through such dynamic index evolution.

Text data is firstly digitalized to database of transactions, and then training and prediction is actually conducted on the derived numerical dataset. This intuitive strategy has demonstrated quite good performance. However, it doesn't take into consideration the inherent characteristics of text data as much as possible, although it has to deal with some specific problems of text data such as lemmatizing and stemming during digitalization. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up strategy to adapt associative classification to text categorization, in which we take into account structure information of text. Experiments on Reuters-21578 dataset show that the proposed strategy can make use of text structure information and achieve better performance.

In this paper a survey of hybrid soft computing systems based on rough sets is provided in the field of data mining. These hybrid systems are summarized according to three different functions of rough sets: preprocessing data, measuring uncertainty and mining knowledge. General observations about rough sets based hybrid systems are presented. Some challenges of existing hybrid systems and directions for future research are also indicated.

An ANN queries return the object that minimizes an aggregate distance function with respect to a set of query points. Because of the multiple query points, ANN queries are much more complex than NN queries. For optimizing the query processing and improving the query efficiency, many ANN queries algorithms utilizes pruning strategies. In this paper, we propose two points projecting based ANN queries algorithms which can efficiently prune the data points without indexing. We project the query points into special "line", on which we analyses their distributing, then pruning the search space. Unlike many other algorithms based on the data index mechanisms, our algorithms avoid the curse of dimensionality and are effective and efficient in both high dimensional space and metric space. We conduct experimental studies using both real dataset and synthetic datasets to compare and evaluate their efficiencies.

In this approach we identify important features of the malicious and benign executables. These features are used by a classifier to learn a classification model that can distinguish between malicious and benign executables. We construct a novel combination of three different kinds of features: binary n-grams, assembly n-grams, and library function calls. Binary features are extracted from the binary executables, whereas assembly features are extracted from the disassembled executables. The function call features are extracted from the program headers. We also propose an efficient and scalable feature extraction technique. We apply our model on a large corpus of real benign and malicious executables. We extract the abovementioned features from the data and train a classifier using Support Vector Machine. This classifier achieves a very high accuracy and low false positive rate in detecting malicious executables. Our model is compared with other feature-based approaches, and found to be more efficient in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate.

In particular recognition of interesting patient pathways can lead to the discovery of important rules and patterns such as high probability pathways, groups of patients who incur exceptional high costs or pathways that are very long lasting. In the current paper we show how Morkov models can be used to identify such patient path ways. Using Markov modelling we show how patient pathways may be extracted and describe an algorithm based on branch and bound that we have developed to efficiently extract a number of interesting pathways, subject to the number of pathways required, or some other criterion being specified. The approach is illustrated using data on geriatric patients from an administrative database of a London hospital, and we identify interesting pathways for geriatric patients. Such an approach might be used in association with healthcare process improvement technologies, such as Lean Thinking or Six Sigma.

However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting or downplaying the popularity of an item. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, a few malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in recent work [5, 7]. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of spam profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work we provide a simple unsupervised algorithm, which exploits statistical properties of effective spam profiles to provide a highly accurate and fast algorithm for detecting spam.

This new problem arose from a particular need in learning on mass spectrometry data, but could easily apply to situations when data has been aggregated in order to maintain privacy. We provide a formal description of this new problem for both classification and regression. We then examine how k-nearest neighbor neural networks, and support vector machines can be adapted for this problem.

In this Chapter we present the analysis of a Web search engine query log from two different perspectives: the query session and the clicked document. In the first perspective, that of the query session, we process and analyze web search engine query and click data for the query session (query + clicked results) conducted by the user. We initially state some hypotheses for possible user types and quality profiles for the user session, based on descriptive variables of the session. In the second perspective, that of the clicked document, we repeat the process from the perspective of the documents (URUs) selected. We also initially define possible document categories and select descriptive variables to define the documents. We apply a systematic data mining process to click data, contrasting non-supervised (Kohonen) and supervised (C4.5) methods to cluster and model the data, in order to identify profiles and rules which relate to theoretical user behavior and user session "quality", from the point of view of user session, and to identify document profiles which relate to theoretical user behavior, and document (URL) organization, from the document perspective.

This paper investigates a class of compound classifiers called multi-level (or hierarchical) rough classifiers (MLRC). We present the most recent issues on the construction of such classifiers from data using concept ontology as an additional domain knowledge. The idea is based on the bottom-up manner to gradually synthesize the multi-layer rough classifier for the complex target concept from the simpler classifiers. We illustrate the proposed method by experiments on real-life data.

Reservoir characterization plays a crucial role in modern reservoir management. It helps to make sound reservoir decisions and improves the asset value of the oil and gas companies. It maximizes integration of multi-disciplinary data and knowledge and improves the reliability of the reservoir predictions. The ultimate product is a reservoir model with realistic tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty. Soft computing aims to exploit such a tolerance for solving practical problems. In reservoir characterization, these intelligent techniques can be used for uncertainty analysis, risk assessment, data fusion and data mining which are applicable to feature extraction from seismic attributes, well logging, reservoir mapping and engineering. The main goal is to integrate soft data such as geological data with hard data such as 3D seismic and production data to build a reservoir and stratigraphic model. While some individual methodologies (esp. neurocomputing) have gained much popularity during the past few years, the true benefit of soft computing lies on the integration of its constituent methodologies rather than use in isolation.

Their distinctive feature is the formulation of mixed integer programming problems aimed at deriving optimal separating hyperplanes with minimum empirical error and maximum generalization capability. A new family of discrete SVM is proposed in this paper, for which the hyperplane establishes a variable softening of the margin to improve the separation among distinct classes. Theoretical bounds are derived to finely tune the parameters of the optimization problem. Computational tests on benchmark datasets in the biolife science application domain indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, that appears dominating against traditional SVM in terms of accuracy and percentage of support vectors.

Data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to understand the structure of a website, and the use its users make of it, but they are still not easy to interpret and to understand Most of these metrics can also be combined, in order to discover new trends and patterns. We present a preliminary prototype of an exploratory search system for web mining which main goal is to provide a set of tools and visual representations that allow the user to explore and to decide how to represent the available data. This approach defines a system that will help us to evaluate the usability of the implemented interactions and visual metaphors.

The particularity of the method is that it provides an interpretation of a partition previously obtained on an ill-structured domain, starting from a hierarchical clustering. The methodology uses some statistical tools (as the boxplot multiple, introduced by Tukey, which in our context behave as a powerful tool for numeric variables) together with some machine learning methods, to learn the structure of the data; this allows extracting useful information (using the concept of characterizing variable) for the automatic generation of a set of useful rules for later identification of classes. In this paper the usefulness of CCEC for building domain theories as models supporting later decision-making is addressed.

This paper, we apply feature selection to several software engineering databases selecting attributes with the final aim that project managers can have a better global vision of the data they manage. In this paper, we make use of attribute selection techniques in different datasets publicly available (PROMISE repository), and different data mining algorithms for classification to defect faulty modules. The results show that in general, smaller datasets with less attributes maintain or improve the prediction capability with less attributes than the original datasets.

Simply keeping the most recent records offers no flexibility about which data is kept, and does not exploit even minimal redundancies in the data (a first step towards pattern discovery). This paper focuses in how to construct and maintain efficiently (in one pass) a compact summary for data such as web logs and text streams. The resulting structure is a prefix tree, with ordering criterion that changes with time, such as an activity time stamp or attribute frequency. A detailed analysis of the factors that affect its performance is carried out, including empirical evaluations using the well known 20 Newsgroups data set.

Still, today's constraints on high productivity and minor impact on the environment require that the processes be strictly controlled. Mathematical models can play a central role in achieving these goals. In cases where it is not possible, or economically feasible, to develop a mechanistic model of a process, an alternative is to use a data-driven approach, where a black-box model is built on historical process data. Feedforward neural networks have become popular modeling tools for this purpose, but the selection of relevant inputs and appropriate network structure are still challenging tasks. The work presented in this paper tackles these problems in the development of a model of the silicon content in hot metal produced in the ironmaking blast furnace. A pruning method is applied to find relevant inputs and their time lags, as well as an appropriate network connectivity, for solving the time-series problem at hand. In applying the model, an on-line learning of the upper-layer weights is proposed to adapt the model to changes in the input-output relations. The findings of the analysis show results in good agreement with practical metallurgical knowledge and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

The performance of these models, however, can be negatively affected by class imbalance and noise. Data sampling techniques have been proposed to alleviate the problem of class imbalance, but the impact of data quality on these techniques has not been adequately addressed. We examine the combined effects of noise and imbalance on classification performance when seven commonly-used sampling techniques are applied to software quality measurement data. Our results show that some sampling techniques are more robust in the presence of noise than others. Further, sampling techniques are affected by noise differently given different levels of imbalance.

It includes the records for finance, maintenance, inventory, progress reports etc. As the time progresses, the data keep on accumulating and the challenge is to extract the information from this data bank. Knowledge discovery from these large and complex databases is the key problem of this era. Data mining and machine learning techniques are needed which can scale to the size of the problems and can be customized to the application of business. For the development of accurate and required information for particular problem, business analyst needs to develop multidimensional models which give the reliable information so that they can take right decision for particular problem. If the multidimensional model does not possess the advance features, the accuracy cannot be expected. The present work involves the development of a Multidimensional data model incorporating advance features. The criterion of computation is based on the data precision and to include slowly change time dimension. The final results are displayed in graphical form.

During decision making support a large amount of raw data describing current situation, users preferences, found solutions and final decisions done by decision maker are accumulated in the repository. To make these data useful, methods of data mining can be applied. The goal of decision mining is to find "rules" explaining under which circumstances one activity is to be selected rather than the other one. The paper presents results of a research concerning mining of decisions stored in user profiles to find common preferences for different roles of decision makers participating in emergency response operations. These preferences could be used as a basis for building of decision trees allowing (semi)automatically selection of best decisions in a typical situation. Modeling of an emergency response management system implementing the research results has been done using software agents playing roles of different types of the system users. Case studies related to fire and accident response operations have been used.

The min-cut bipartitioning problem is a fundamental graph partitioning problem and is NP-Complete. In this paper, we present an effective multi-level algorithm based on simulated annealing for bisecting graph. The success of our algorithm relies on exploiting both the simulated annealing procedure and the concept of the graph core. Our experimental evaluations on 18 different graphs show that our algorithm produces encouraging solutions compared with those produced by MeTiS that is a state-of-the-art partitioner in the literature.

However, it is often plagued with model misfit (or inductive bias) incurred by its assumption. To address this issue, a novel Model Adjustment algorithm was proposed. The basic idea is to make use of some criteria to adjust Centroid Classifier model. In this work, the criteria include training-set errors as well as training-set margins. The empirical assessment indicates that proposed method performs slightly better than SVM classifier in prediction accuracy, as well as beats it in running time.

Particularly, when the input database is a collection of subsets of an itemset, the problem is called the frequent itemset mining problem, and has been extensively studied. In the real-world use, one of difficulties of frequent itemset mining is that real-world data is often incorrect, or missing some parts. It causes that some records which should include a pattern do not have it. To deal with real-world problems, one can use an ambiguous inclusion relation and find patterns which are mostly included in many records. However, computational difficulty have prevented such problems from being actively used in practice. In this paper, we use an alternative inclusion relation in which we consider an itemset P to be included in an itemset T if at most k items of P are not included in T, i.e., vertical bar P\T vertical bar <= k. We address the problem of enumerating frequent itemsets under this inclusion relation and propose an efficient polynomial delay polynomial space algorithm. Moreover, To enable us to skip many small non-valuable frequent itemsets, we propose an algorithm for directly enumerating frequent itemsets of a certain size.

Digital forensic investigators need powerful tools that can automate many of the analysis tasks that are currently being performed manually. This paper argues that forensic analysis can greatly benefit from re-search in knowledge discovery and data mining, which has developed powerful automated techniques for analyzing massive quantities of data to discern novel, potentially useful patterns. We use the term "evidence mining" to refer to the application of these techniques in the analysis phase of digital forensic investigations. This paper presents a novel approach involving the specialization of CRISP-DM, a cross-industry standard process for data mining, to CRISP-EM, an evidence mining methodology designed specifically for digital forensics. In addition to supporting forensic analysis, the CRISP-EM methodology offers a structured approach for defining the research gaps in evidence mining.

However, they usually can not flexibly obtain association rules or patterns from portions of data, consider problems with different aspects, or provide online decision support for users. We earlier developed an online mining approach for generation of association rules under multidimensional consideration. The multidimensional online mining approach may, however, get loose upper-bound support of candidate itemsets and thus cause excessive I/O and computation costs. In this paper, we attempt to apply the concept of a negative border to enlarge the mining information in the multidimensional pattern relation to help get tighter upper-bound, and thus reduce the number of candidate itemsets to consider. Based oh the extended multidimensional pattern relation, a corresponding online mining approach called Negative-Border Online Mining (NOM) is proposed to efficiently and effectively utilize the information of negative itemset in the negative border. Experiments for heterogeneous datasets are also performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Spatial knowledge discovery in spatial data repositories involves processes and activities that are heterogeneous, collaborative, and distributed in nature. The Grid is a profitable infrastructure that can be effectively exploited for handling distributed spatial data mining and knowledge discovery. We design a new architecture of spatial knowledge grid, which is on top of computational grid mechanisms. The spatial knowledge grid is a high-level framework providing Grid-based knowledge discovery tools and services. All of these services are currently being designed and implemented as Grid Services. This paper highlights design aspects and implementation of spatial knowledge grid services.

It is a crucial task in customer relationship management, data mining, and data integration. With the growing amount of XML data, approaches to effectively and efficiently clean XML are needed, an issue not addressed by existing data cleaning systems that mostly specialize on relational data. We present XClean, a data cleaning framework specifically geared towards cleaning XML data. XClean's approach is based on a set of cleaning operators, whose semantics is well-defined in terms of XML algebraic operators. Users may specify cleaning programs by combining operators by means of a declarative XClean/PL program, which is then compiled into XQuery. We describe XClean's operators, language, and compilation approach, and validate its effectiveness through a series of case studies.

Recently, it is shown that (a, k)anonymity is a feasible technique when we are given some sensitive attribute(s) and quasi- identifier attributes. In previous work, generalization of the given data table has been used for the anonymization. In this paper, we show that we can project the data onto two tables for publishing in such a way that the privacy protection for (a, k)-anonymity can be achieved with less distortion. In the two tables, one table contains the undisturbed non-sensitive values and the other table contains the undisturbed sensitive values. Privacy preservation is guaranteed by the lossy join property of the two tables. We show by experiments that the results are better than previous approaches.

However, the problem of finding structure and regularities in large image datasets is an area in which data mining is beginning to make fundamental contributions. In this work, we consider the new problem of discovering shape motifs, which are approximately repeated shapes within (or between) image collections. As we shall show, shape motifs can have applications in tasks as diverse as anthropology, law enforcement, and historical manuscript mining. Brute force discovery of shape motifs could be untenably slow, especially as many domains may require an expensive rotation invariant distance measure. We introduce an algorithm that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than brute force search, and demonstrate the utility of our approach with several real world datasets from diverse domains.

B	Xiao, L; Hung, E			IEEE	Xiao, Lurong; Hung, Edward			An efficient distance calculation method for uncertain objects	2007 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	APR 01-05, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			DATABASES	Recently the academic communities have paid more attention to the queries and mining on uncertain data. In the tasks such as clustering or nearest-neighbor queries, expected distance is often used as a distance measurement among uncertain data objects. Traditional database systems store uncertain objects using their expected (average) location in the data space. Distances can be calculated easily from the expected locations, but it poorly approximates the real expected distance values. Recent research work calculates the expected distance by calculating the weighted average of the pair-wise distances among samples of two uncertain objects. However the pair-wise distance calculations take much longer time than the the former method. In this paper, we propose an efficient method Approximation by Single Gaussian (ASG) to calculate the expected distance by a function of the means and variances of samples of uncertain objects. Theoretical and experimental studies show that ASG has both advantages of the latter method's high accuracy and the former method's fast execution time. We suggest that ASG plays an important role in reducing computational costs significantly in query processing and various data mining tasks such as clustering and outlier detection.

However, the complexity, noise and nonlinearity in tourism data bring many challenges for existing data mining techniques such as rough sets and neural networks. This paper makes an attempt to develop a data mining approach to tourist expenditure classification based on support vector machines (SVMs) with kernel principal component analysis. Compared with previous methods, the proposed approach not only makes use of the generalization ability of SVMs, which is usually superior to neural networks and rough sets, but also applies a KPCA-based feature extraction method so that the classification accuracy of business travelers can be improved. Utilizing the primary data collected from an Omnibus survey carried out in Hong Kong in late 2005, experimental results showed that the classification accuracy of the SVM model with KPCA is better than other approaches including the previous rough set method and a GA-based selective neural network ensemble method.

Data Mining is a stage in the entire process of KDD which applies an algorithm to extract interesting patterns. Usually, such algorithms generate huge volume of pattern!;. These patterns have to be evaluated by using interestingness measures to reflect the user requirements. Interestingness is defined in different ways, (i) Objective measures (ii) Subjective measures. Objective measures such as support and confidence extract meaningful patterns based on the structure of the patterns, while subjective measures such as unexpectedness and novelty reflect the user perspective. In this report, we try to brief the more widely spread and successful subjective measures and propose a new subjective measure of interestingness, i.e. shocking.

In this paper a new method called grey-rough reduction is proposed for decision tables containing non-interval data and interval data complexly called grey-decision tables. First of all, a grey-rough approximation is introduced after summarized grey numbers, their operations and functions. Two sorts of reduction based on grey-rough sets, a basic approach and advanced approach are proposed with several illustrative examples. Three experiments, compatibility with the classical model, an application of the basic approach to decision-making and influence of the parameter in the advanced approach are shown. The advantages of the proposal are (1) it is compatible with the classical reduction model for non-interval data, (2) it is useful for complex decision tables and (3) it provides a possible reduction of attributes with a parameter by the advanced approach.

Although these noise factors, which may not be controlled by manufacturing and cost reasons, are merged as a key problem of data mining (DM) and analysis, most DM methods may not discuss robustness of solutions either by considering noise factors or by incorporating specific statistical inferences. In order to address this problem, the primary objective of this paper is to propose a integrated approach, called surrogate variable-based data mining method (SVDM), which can conduct dimensionality reduction by exacting the significant factors from the row data sets by applying correlation-based feature selection (CFS). The proposed method then incorporates noise factor consideration to achieve robustness of an analysis by using the principle of surrogate variable. In addition, this proposed method is far more effective when a 100% inspection and a destructive characteristic/response are considered. Finally, response surface methodology (RSM), which is a statistical tool that is useful for modeling and analysis in situations where the response of interest is affected by several input factors, is used for further statistical analyses.

In this paper we introduce a novel local intrinsic dimension estimator, conical dimension, for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a data set consisting of points lying in the proximity of a manifold. Under minimal sampling assumptions, we show that the conical dimension of sample points in a manifold is equal to the dimension of the manifold. The conical dimension enjoys several desirable properties such as linear conformal invariance and it can also handle manifolds with self-intersections as well as detect the boundary of manifolds. We develop algorithms for computing the conical dimension paying special attention to the numerical robustness issues.

S	Yen, SJ; Lee, YS		Song, IY; Nguyen, TM		Yen, Show-Jane; Lee, Yue-Shi			Mining high utility quantitative association rules	DATA WAREHOUSING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery	SEP 03-07, 2007	Regensburg, GERMANY					Mining weighted association rules considers the profits of items in a transaction database, such that the association rules about important items can be discovered. However, high profit items may not always be high revenue products, since purchased quantifies of items would also influence the revenue for the items. This paper considers both profits and purchased quantities of items to calculate utility for the items. Mining high utility quantitative association rules is to discover that when some items are purchased on some quantities, the other items on some quantities are purchased too, which have high utility. In this paper, we propose a data mining algorithm to find high utility itemsets with purchased quantities, from which high utility quantitative association rules also can be generated. Our algorithm needs not generate candidate itemsets and just need to scan the original database twice. The experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient than the other algorithms which only discovered high utility association rules.

The industry recognizes the problem and is just now starting to act. Although prevention is the best way to reduce frauds, fraudsters are adaptive and will usually rind ways to circumvent such measures. Detecting fraud is essential once prevention mechanism has failed. Several data mining algorithms have been developed that allow one to extract relevant knowledge from a large amount of data like fraudulent financial statements to detect FSF. Detecting FSF is a new attempt; thus, several research questions have often being asked: (1) Can FSF be detected? How likely and how to do it? (2) What data features can be used to predict FSF? (3) What kinds of algorithm can be used to detect FSF? (4) How to measure the performance of the detection? And (5) How effective of these algorithms in terms of fraud detection? To help answer these questions, we conduct an extensive review on literatures. We present a generic framework to guide our analysis. Critical issues for FSF detection are identified and discussed. Finally, we share directions for future research.

There are many literatures focusing on misclassification cost and test cost at present. In real world application, however, the issue of time-sensitive should be considered in cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we regard the cost of time-sensitive in cost-sensitive learning as waiting cost (referred to WC), a novelty splitting criterion is proposed for constructing cost-time sensitive (denoted as CTS) decision tree for maximal decrease the intangible cost. And then, a hybrid test strategy that combines the sequential test with the batch test strategies is adopted in CTS learning. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the other ones with respect to decrease in misclassification cost.

Most of the current studies adopt an FP-growth-like approach which does not bring the candidate generation. However, the cost of recursively constructing each frequent item's conditional frequent pattern tree is high. In this paper, we propose a depth first algorithm for mining frequent patterns. Efficiency of mining is achieved with the following techniques: large database is compressed into a frequent pattern tree with a children table but not a header table, which avoids costly repeated database scans, on the other hand the mining algorithm adopts a depth first method which takes advantage of this tree structure and dynamically adjusts links instead of generating a lot of redundant sub trees, which can dramatically reduces the time and space needed for the mining process. The performance study shows that our algorithm is efficient and scalable for mining frequent patterns, and is an order of magnitude faster than Trie, FP_growth, H-mine and some recently reported new frequent patterns mining methods.

In turn, using a small random sample instead of the full set of results leads to efficient approximate algorithms for several applications, such as: Determining the set of categories in a given taxonomy spanned by the search results; Finding the range of metadata values associated with the result set in order to enable Bmulti-faceted search''; Estimating the size of the result set; Data mining associations to the query terms. We present and analyze efficient algorithms for obtaining uniform random samples applicable to any search engine that is based on posting lists and document-at-a-time evaluation. (To our knowledge, all popular Web search engines, for example, Google, Yahoo Search, MSN Search, Ask, belong to this class.) Furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to follow the modern object-oriented approach whereby posting lists are viewed as streams equipped with a next method, and the next method for Boolean and other complex queries is built from the next method for primitive terms. In our case we show how to construct a basic sample-next(p) method that samples term posting lists with probability p, and show how to construct sample-next(p) methods for Boolean operators (AND, OR, WAND) from primitive methods. Finally, we test the efficiency and quality of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data.

The visualization is aimed at exploration of properties of the data and selecting a small number of interesting items from the database. The method introduced here is a new development of the Reasonable Goals method, which has already been implemented on Internet in the form of the Web application server. Thus, the new method can be applied on Internet, too. It can be used for selection-aimed data mining in various fields including environmental planning, machinery design, financial planning (including credit operations), biology and medicine.

Our self-map tree has a value of self-map attribute in its internal node, and information based on dissimilarity between a pair of map sequences. Our method selects self-map which exists between data by exhaustive search based on relation and attribute information. Experimental results confirm that our improved method constructs comprehensive and accurate decision tree. Moreover, an example shows that our self-map decision tree is promising for data mining and knowledge discovery. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pekerskaya, I; Pei, J; Wang, K				Pekerskaya, Irene; Pei, Jian; Wang, Ke			Mining changing regions from access-constrained snapshots: a cluster-embedded decision tree approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; change mining; clustering; decision trees; spatial data mining; change detection; access-constrained data sets		Change detection on spatial data is important in many applications, such as environmental monitoring. Given a set of snapshots of spatial objects at various temporal instants, a user may want to derive the changing regions between any two snapshots. Most of the existing methods have to use at least one of the original data sets to detect changing regions. However, in some important applications, due to data access constraints such as privacy concerns and limited data online availability, original data may not be available for change analysis. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a simple yet effective model-based approach. In the model construction phase, data snapshots are summarized using the novel cluster-embedded decision trees as concise models. Once the models are built, the original data snapshots will not be accessed anymore. In the change detection phase, to mine changing regions between any two instants, we compare the two corresponding cluster-embedded decision trees. Our systematic experimental results on both real and synthetic data sets show that our approach can detect changes accurately and effectively.

Four prevalent denormalization strategies have been identified and examined under various scenarios to illustrate the conditions where they are most effective. The relational algebra, query trees, and join cost function are used to examine the effect on the performance of relational systems. The guidelines and analysis provided are sufficiently general and they can be applicable to a variety of databases, in particular to data warehouse implementations, for decision support systems.

Machines in the conversation: Detecting themes and trends in informal communication streams	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article								Data-mining techniques that detect trends and patterns in structured data are often ill-suited for analysis of unstructured text. information critical to business-and generated by groups such as employees, customers, and the public-appears in such forms as chats, electronic discussion forums, and blogs. This paper describes techniques developed to detect themes and trends in such informal communication streams. Our approach begins with unsupervised text clustering to create initial categories. A human analyst then refines the categories into easily understandable themes. To facilitate this process, we developed an interactive approach to text category creation and validation that aids the analyst in evaluating each category of a taxonomy and makes it possible to visualize relationships among categories. The resulting analysis can then be communicated to participants in real time. We report on the results of using these techniques in IBM companywide "Jam" events, during which tens of thousands of employees worldwide participated in electronic discussions of key business issues.

J	Abdullah, A; Hussain, A				Abdullah, Ahsan; Hussain, Amir			Data mining a new pilot agriculture extension data warehouse	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data warehouse; data mining; decision support system; agriculture; cotton; pest scouting		Pakistan is the world's fifth largest cotton producer. To monitor cotton growth, different government departments and agencies in Pakistan have been recording pest scouting, agriculture and metrological data for decades. Coarse estimates of just the cotton pest scouting data recorded stands at around 1.5 million records, and growing. The primary agro-met data recorded has never been digitized, integrated or standardized to give a complete picture, and hence cannot support decision making. In this paper, a complete life-cycle implementation of a novel Pilot Agriculture Extension Data Warehouse is discussed, followed by data analysis by querying the Data Warehouse and some interesting findings through data mining using an indigenous technique based on the crossing minimization paradigm. Actual cotton pest scouting data of 1,500+ farmers for years 2001 and 2002 for the Multan district was processed and used in the pilot project.

J	Taniguchi, T; Haraguchi, M				Taniguchi, Tsuyoshi; Haraguchi, Makoto			Discovery of hidden correlations in a local transaction database based on differences of correlations	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; correlation mining; itemset pairs; contrast sets; time series		Given a transaction database as a global set of transactions and its local database obtained by some conditioning of the global database, we consider pairs of itemsets whose degrees of correlation are higher in the local database than in the global one. A problem of finding paired itemsets with high correlation in one database is already known as discovery of correlation, and has been studied as the highly correlated itemsets are characteristic in the database. However, even noncharacteristic paired itemsets are also meaningful provided the degree of correlation increases significantly in the local database compared with the global one. They can be implicit and hidden evidences showing that something particular to the local database occurs, even though they were not previously realized to be characteristic. From this viewpoint, we have proposed measurement of the significance of paired itemsets by the difference of two correlations before and after the conditioning of the global database, and have defined a notion of DC pairs, whose degrees of difference of correlation are high. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for mining DC pairs and apply it to a transaction database with time stamp data. The problem of finding DC pairs for large databases is computationally hard in general, as the algorithm has to check even noncharacteristic paired itemsets. However, we show that our algorithm equipped with some pruning rules works successfully to find DC pairs that may be significant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, JY; Han, JW; Pei, J				Wang, JY; Han, JW; Pei, J			Closed constrained gradient mining in retail databases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; frequent closed itemset; association rule; gradient pattern	ITEMSETS	Incorporating constraints into frequent itemset mining not only improves data mining efficiency, but also leads to concise and meaningful results. In this paper, a framework for closed constrained gradient itemset mining in retail databases is proposed by introducing the concept of gradient constraint into closed itemset mining. A tailored version of CLOSET+, LCLOSET, is first briefly introduced, which is designed for efficient closed itemset mining from sparse databases. Then, a newly proposed weaker but antimonotone measure, top-X average measure, is proposed and can be adopted to prune search space effectively. Experiments show that a combination of LCLOSET and the top-X average pruning provides an efficient approach to mining frequent closed gradient itemsets.

Similarly, data-mining is becoming a popular technique to extract rules from the data available from the operation of a plant. In the work reported here knowledge was required to enable the supervisory control of an aluminium hot strip mill by the determination of mill set-points. A method was developed to fuse knowledge-elicitation and data-mining to incorporate the best aspects of each technique, whilst avoiding known problems. Utilisation of the knowledge was through an expert system, which determined schedules of set-points and provided information to human operators. The results show that the method proposed in this paper was effective in producing rules for the on-line control of a complex industrial process. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When performing data mining, traditional clustering algorithms which use distance-based measurements to calculate the difference between data are unsuitable for non-numeric attributes such as nominal, Boolean, and categorical data. Applying an unsuitable similarity measurement in clustering may cause some valuable information embedded in the data attributes to be lost, and hence low quality clusters will be created. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, referred to as MPM, for the clustering of non-numeric data. The goals of MPM are to retain the data features of interest while effectively grouping data objects into clusters with high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity. MPM achieves these goals through two principal methods: (1) the adoption of a novel similarity measurement which has the ability to capture the "characterized properties" of information, and (2) the application of matrix permutation and matrix participation partitioning to the results of the similarity measurement (constructed in the form of a similarity matrix) in order to assign data to appropriate clusters. This study also proposes a heuristic-based algorithm, the Heuristic_MPM, to reduce the processing times required for matrix permutation and matrix partitioning, which together constitute the bulk of the total MPM execution time.

An analysis has been made using historical data of several industrial projects and three different approaches: the first one relates metrics and maintainability based on techniques of descriptive statistics, and the other two are based on Data Mining techniques. A discussion on the results obtained with the three techniques is also presented, as well as a set of equations and rules for predicting the maintenance effort in this kind of programs. Finally, we have done experiments about the prediction accuracy of these methods by using new unseen data, which were not used to build the knowledge model. The results were satisfactory as the application of each technique separately provides useful perspective for the manager in order to get a complementary insight from data.

Post-processing of mined results is one of the key issues in a data mining process. However, it is difficult for human experts to evaluate many thousands of rules from a large dataset with noises completely. To reduce the costs of rule evaluation task, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which are obtained with objective indices of mined classification rules and evaluations of a human expert for each rule. To evaluate performances of learning algorithms for constructing rule evaluation models, we have done a case study on the meningitis data mining as an actual problem. Furthermore, we have also evaluated our method on four rulesets from the four kinds of UCI datasets.

Time-series data mining is one of key issues to get useful knowledge from databases. With mined time-series patterns, users can aware not only positive results but also negative result called risk after their observation period. However, users often face difficulties during time-series data mining process for data preprocessing method selection/construction, mining algorithm selection, and post-processing to refine the data mining process as other data mining processes. It is needed to develop a time-series data mining environment based on systematic analysis of the process. To get more valuable rules for domain experts from a time-series data mining process, we have designed an environment which integrates time-series pattern extraction methods, rule induction methods and rule evaluation methods with active human-system interaction. After implementing this environment, we have done a case study to mine time-series rules from blood and urine biochemical test database on chronic hepatitis patients. Then a physician has evaluated and refined his hypothesis on this environment. We discuss the availability of how much support to mine interesting knowledge for an expert.

These objects synthesize information concerning a group of individuals of a population, eventually stored in a relational database, and ensure confidentiality of original data. Classifying SOs is an important task in symbolic data analysis. In this paper a lazy-learning approach that extends a traditional distance weighted k-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm to SOs, is presented. The proposed method has been implemented in the system SO-NN (Symbolic Objects Nearest Neighbor) and evaluated on symbolic datasets.

Using this "bitmapped CAM," the time and area required for executing the subset operations fundamental to data mining can be significantly reduced. The bitmapped CAM architecture implementation on an FPGA-accelerated high performance workstation provides a performance acceleration of orders of magnitude over software-based systems. The bitmapped CAM utilizes redundancy within the candidate data to efficiently store and process many subset operations simultaneously. The efficiency of this operation allows 140 units to process about 2,240 subset operations simultaneously. Using industry-standard benchmarking databases, we have tested the bitmapped CAM architecture and shown the platform provides a minimum of 24x (and often much higher) time performance advantage over the fastest software Apriori implementations.

The parallel is drawn between the Natural Language processing and the Data Mining technology of information granulation. The formalism affords consistent representation of a well-known phenomenon of 'approximate' grammatical correctness of Natural Language statements. The ontology-based information structuring is a natural complement of the syntactical information granulation. The approach is validated on some simple Natural Language statements and the directions for the future development of the system are outlined. The paper focuses on conceptual framework only and, as such, is intended to stimulate further research into the various implementation considerations that are prerequisite of large-scale applications.

If such data mining queries operate on overlapping parts of the database, then their overall I/O cost can be reduced by integrating their dataset scans. The integration requires that data structures of many data mining queries are present in memory at the same time. If the memory size is not sufficient to hold all the data mining queries, then the queries must be scheduled into multiple phases of loading and processing. Since finding the optimal assignment of queries to phases is infeasible for large batches of queries due to the size of the search space, heuristic algorithms have to be applied. In this paper we formulate the problem of assigning the queries to phases as a particular case of hypergraph partitioning. To solve the problem, we propose and experimentally evaluate two greedy optimization algorithms.

VOGUE relies on a novel Variable-Gap Sequence mining method (VGS), to mine frequent patterns with different lengths and gaps between elements. It then uses these mined sequences to build the state machine. We applied VOGUE to the task of protein sequence classification on real data from the PROSITE protein families. We show that VOGUE yields significantly better scores than higher-order Hidden Markov Models. Moreover, we show that VOGUE's classification sensitivity outperforms that of HMMER, a state-of-the-art method for protein classification.

As a consequence, using this principle efficiently is crucial for the success of all these algorithms. Especially in the context of condensed representations, such as NDI, and in computing interesting measures, a quick inclusion-exclusion algorithm can be crucial for the performance. In this paper, we give an overview of several algorithms that depend on the inclusion-exclusion principle and propose an efficient algorithm to use it and evaluate its complexity. The theoretically obtained results axe supported by experimental evaluation of the quick IE technique in isolation, and of an example application.

These data mining methods enable us to identify the most common characteristics of the colorectal cancer patients. The knowledge discovered by data mining methods which are quite different from traditional survey approaches. Although it is heuristic, the data mining methods may identify risk groups for further epidemiological study, such as older patients living near health facilities yet seldom utilising those facilities, and with respiratory and circulatory diseases.

However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting, BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to BOC being perceived as being inefficient and because bagging and boosting consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: "Do we even need BOC in datamining?". We show that the answer to this question is "yes" by illustrating several recent efficient model averaging approximations to BOC can significantly outperform bagging and boosting in realistic situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems. That model averaging techniques outperform bagging and boosting in these situations has not been published in the machine learning, mining or statistical communities to our knowledge.

New perspectives for the biclustering problem	2006 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			MICROARRAY DATA; ALGORITHMS	Multimodal optimization algorithms inspired by the immune system are generally characterized by a dynamic control of the population size and by diversity maintenance along the search. One of these proposals, denoted copt-aiNet (artificial immune network for combinatorial optimization), is used to deal with combinatorial problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other permutation problems. In this paper, the copt-aiNet algorithm is extended and adapted to be applied to an important issue of modern data mining, the biclustering problem. The biclustering approach consists in simultaneously ordering the rows and columns of a given matrix, so that similar elements are grouped together. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, two bitmap images are scrambled and used as input to the algorithm, and the biclustering procedure tries to restore the original image by grouping the pixels according to the similarity of colors in a neighborhood. Additionally, copt-aiNet is applied to gene expression data clustering, a classical problem of the bioinformatics literature, and its performance is compared with a hierarchical biclustering algorithm.

This is a new dataset that combines object-oriented software quality metrics with the number of defects per code unit. We undertake a fuzzy cluster analysis of this dataset, which for the first time addresses the use of both hyperspherical and hyperellipsoidal fuzzy clusters (using the Gath-Geva algorithm) in software quality analysis. Using a Pareto analysis based on the fuzzy clusters, we were able to identify groups of modules having higher defect densities than would be found by merely ranking modules based on any single software metric.

One of the special challenges for spatial data mining is that information is usually not uniformly distributed in spatial datasets. Consequently, the discovery of regional knowledge is of fundamental importance for spatial data mining. This paper centers on discovering regional association rules in spatial datasets. In particular we introduce a novel framework to mine regional association rules relying on a given class structure. A reward-based regional discovery methodology is introduced, and a divisive, grid-based supervised clustering algorithm is presented that identifies interesting subregions in spatial datasets. Then, an integrated approach is discussed to systematically mine regional rules. The proposed framework is evaluated in a real-world case study that identifies spatial risk patterns from arsenic in the Texas water supply.

In fact, the privacy-preserving decision tree mining method explored in the pioneer paper Ill was recently showed to be completely broken, because its data perturbation technique is fundamentally flawed [2]. However, since the general framework presented in [1] has some nice and useful features in practice, it is natural to ask if it is possible to rescue the framework by, say, utilizing a different data perturbation technique. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by presenting such a data perturbation technique based on random substitutions. We show that the resulting privacy-preserving decision tree mining method is immune to attacks (including the one introduced in [2]) that are seemingly relevant. Systematic experiments show that it is also effective.

In particular, we are interested in identifying disjoint, contiguous regions that are unusual with respect to the distribution of a given class; i.e. a region that contains an unusually low or high number of instances of a particular class. This paper centers on the discussion of techniques, methodologies, and algorithms to discover such regions. A measure of interestingness and a supervised clustering framework are introduced for this purpose. Moreover, three supervised clustering algorithms are proposed in the paper: an agglomerative hierarchical supervised clustering named SCAH, an agglomerative, grid-based clustering method named SCHG, and lastly an algorithm named SCMRG which searches a multi-resolution grid structure top down for interesting regions. Finally, experimental results of applying the proposed framework and algorithms to the problem of identifying hotspots in spatial datasets are discussed.

Development of an integrated framework for protein structure determinations: A logical data model for NMR data analysis	Third International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Information Technology - New Generations (ITNG)	APR 10-OCT 12, 2006	Las Vegas, NV	Premier Hall Sci & Engn			BIOCHEMICAL-NOMENCLATURE; DATA-BANK; RECOMMENDATIONS; CHALLENGES; PROTEOMICS; ACIDS	Current approaches to the analysis of protein structure are time-consuming due to the lack of integration and incompatibility of data among the processing tools utilized. In addition, the enormous amount of experimental data generated is typically stored in flat file formals that cannot easily be managed or queried. Available databases that support the storage of protein structure data use data models that lack explicit definition of relationships between entities in the model necessary to support comprehensive querying and analysis. This paper presents a logical data model (LDM) for molecular structure determinations that utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as the methodology. The LDM serves as a core component in an integrated framework for the comprehensive analysis of protein structure. Two 'directed' data mining queries about protein structure were used to validate the utility of the LDM in a database implementation.

Especially, data mining on Grid is a challenge due to the lack of shared memory in Grid computing, which puts special attention to communication optimization. The aim of the DisDaMin project (Distributed Data Mining), descibed in the paper, is solving data mining problems by using new distributed algorithms intented for execution in Grid environments. The DisDaMin implements intelligent fragmentation of data by clustering methods and asynchronous collaborative processing adjusted to Grid environments. The DG-ADAJ environment Provides adaptive control of distributed applications written in Java for Desktop Grid. It constitutes a component-based middleware, which allows for optimized distribution of applications on clusters of Java Virtual Machines, monitoring of application execution and dynamic on-line balancing of processing and communication. The DG-ADAJ system provides a middleware Platform for Desktop Grid that could be used as a deployment base for DisDaMin algorithms. In this paper we propose static object placement optimization algorithms for fragmentation of data in the DisDaMin project. The algorithms use DG-ADAJ's object clustering methods to provide optimized localprocessing on each node with minimized inter-node communication.

Detection of interdomain routing anomalies based on higher-order path analysis	ICDM 2006: Sixth International Conference on Data Mining, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Anomalous interdomain Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) events including misconfigurations, attacks and large-scale power failures often affect the global routing infrastructure. Thus, the ability to detect and categorize such events is extremely useful. In this article we present a novel anomaly detection technique for BGP that distinguishes between different anomalies in BGP traffic. This technique is termed Higher Order Path Analysis (HOPA) and focuses on the discovery of patterns in higher order paths in supervised learning datasets. Our results demonstrate that not only worm events but also different types of worms as well as blackout events are cleanly separable and can be classified in real time based on our incremental approach. This novel approach to supervised learning has potential applications in cybersecurity/forensics and text/data mining in general.

New methods to encode large data sets compactly on DNA chips has been recently proposed in (Garzon & Deaton, 2004) [18]. The method consists of shredding the data into short oligonucleotides and pouring it over a DNA chip with spots populated by copies of a basis set of noncrosshybridizing strands. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the sensitivity, robustness, and capacity of the encodings. First, we provide preliminary experimental evidence of the degree of variability of the representation and show that it can be made robust despite reaction conditions and the uncertainty of the hybridization chemistry in vitro. Based on these simulations, we provide an empirical estimate of the capacity of the representation to store information. Second, we present a new theoretical model to analyze and estimate the sensitivity and capacity of a given DNA chip for information discrimination. Finally, we briefly discuss some potential applications, such as genomic analysis, classification problems, and data mining of massive amounts of data in abiotic form without the onerous cost of massive synthesis of DNA strands.

The system uses error-tolerant graph matching to find correspondences between the detected image information and the geospatial vector data. Spatial relations between objects are used to find a reliable object-to-object mapping. Graph matching is used as a flexible query mechanism to answer the spatial query. A condition based on the expected graph error has been presented which allows to determine the bounds of error tolerance and in this way characterizes the relevancy of a query solution. We show that the number of null labels is an important measure to determine relevancy. To be able to correctly interpret the matching results in terms of relevancy the derived bounds of error tolerance are essential.

New advances in medicine provide a broad range of diagnosis methods to cover all aspects of a disease. However, huge amounts of raw information may confuse clinicians and decrease decision accuracy. Computerized knowledge extraction is an active area of research in medical informatics. This paper suggests a new medical data mining approach using an advanced swarm intelligence data mining algorithm. Considering medical knowledge discovery difficulties, this approach addresses common issues such as missing value management and interactive rule extraction. Here, surgery candidate selection in temporal lobe epilepsy is the main target application. However, the general idea can be applied to other medical knowledge discovery problems. Experimental results show noticeable performance improvement in the final rule-set quality while the method is flexible and fast.

Traditionally, data-mining systems are designed to work on a single data set. However, with the increasing number of distributed database dispersed over many machines in WANS with geographically spread locations it is necessary to adopt new techniques to improve the overall system response. The development of Bayesian belief networks and associated algorithms made possible that probabilistic reasoning becomes a real option for a large variety of Artificial Intelligence applications. In this paper we present a methodology for machine learning using Bayesian belief network with practical exemplification for predicting arteriosclerosis cardiovascular disease.

Still, because this line of investigation is new, knowing exactly what to look for is difficult and important information could escape our notice. We therefore decided to bring data mining techniques to bear on our data, with two aims: primarily, to expand what is known about how males versus females make use of end-user debugging features, and secondarily, to find out whether data mining could bring new understanding to this research, given that we had already studied the data manually using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results suggested several new hypotheses in how males versus females go about end-user debugging tasks, the factors that play into their choices, and how their choices are associated with success.

DTW(Dynamic Time Warping) is a robust distance measure function for time series, which can handle time shifting and scaling. The main defect of DTW lies in its relatively high computational complexity of similarity search. In this paper, we develop a simple but efficient approximation technique for DTW to speed up the search process. Our method is based on a variation of the traditional histograms of the time series. This method can work with a time linear with the size of the database. In our experiment, we proved that the proposed technique is efficient and produces few false dismissals in most applications.

The huge amount of traffic data from ITS originally collected for the control of traffic signals can be a useful source to assist in transportation designing, planning, managing, and research by identifying major traffic patterns from the ITS data. The importance of data visualization as one of the useful data mining methods for reflecting the potential patterns of large sets of data has long been recognized in many disciplines. This paper will discuss several comprehensible and appropriate data visualization techniques, including line chart, bi-directional bar chart, rose diagram, and data image, as exploratory data analysis tools to explore traffic volume data intuitively and to discover the implicit and valuable traffic patterns. These methods could be applied at the same time to gain better and more comprehensive insights of traffic patterns and data relationships hidden in the massive data set. The visual exploratory analysis results could help transportation managers, engineers, and planners make more efficient and effective decisions on the design of traffic operation strategies and future transportation planning scientifically.

While cur-rent approaches use the complexity of the technical system as only indicator for estimation, a multidimensional key ratio scorecard is developed to enhance the quality of effort prediction. Key ratios from the technical dimension are extended towards service-oriented architectures as the upcoming, dominating architectural ERP concept. Within the organizational dimension, competencies of the project team are evaluated and quantified as key ratios. Key ratios from the situational dimension are used for approximating the expected degree of employee cooperation. As fuzzy key ratios cannot be manually derived from business requirements, an IT-based tool is designed, prototypically realized and empirically evaluated in order to be used for retrieval of defined key ratios in the scorecard.

So far a lot of classification tools which adopt the misclassification rate to evaluate how well the discrimination be achieved have been proposed and played a key role in the field of statistical learning or data mining. In the real world, however, we often encounter the cases that the misclassification rate remains considerably high no matter how carefully we search for the discriminating boundaries if we want to capture the points to some extent with rather simpler rules. In such a messy case, the optimization criterion in classification goes to obtaining the larger number of points of response 1, we are interested in, with a specified pureness rate. Such a region is called to be a bump or a hotspot. Our primary objective is to find the bumps. To use the information of the boundaries of the bumps with ease, it would be beneficial that the bumps have much simpler shapes of their boundaries such as the z-dimensional box located parallel to some explanation variable axes. The problem raised is, however, how to find such a boundary for some bump. The decision tree algorithms find the splitting point for an explanation variable to construct much purer sub-regions using the entropy or the Gini's index criterion, from the top node to the bottom leafs step by step. Regarding that to produce the purer regions is just the same as to exclude those regions, this splitting criterion may also be applicable to produce the denser region for response 1 including response 0 points to some extent. This paper deals with this point. Mimicking the real data case in a customer database of a correspondence course in Japan, we investigate the fundamental data cases such that the marginal distributions for response 1 are rather simple shaped, such as monotonic or unimodal, and those for response 0 is almost uniformly distributed. The unimodal and monotonic cases are studied by using the normal distributions located at the center of and on the corner of the uniform distributions, respectively. Under such restricted conditions, we have found that the Gini's index can detect the boundaries for the bumps as if eyes of human beings do so.

We present an efficient algorithm for mining associations between tree queries in a large graph. Tree queries are powerful tree-shaped patterns featuring existential variables and data constants. Our algorithm applies the theory of conjunctive database queries to make the generation of association rules efficient. We propose a practical, database-oriented implementation in SQL, and show that the approach works in practice through experiments on data about food webs, protein interactions, and citation analysis.

In his paper, we propose an online algorithm to continuously discover the current set of frequent tree patterns from the data stream. A novel and efficient technique is introduced to incrementally generate all candidate tree patterns without duplicates. Moreover, a framework for counting the approximate frequencies of the candidate tree patterns is presented. Combining these techniques, the proposed approach is able to compute frequent tree patterns with guarantees of completeness and accuracy.

Clustering is one of the data mining core techniques. In this paper, we propose a new visualized clustering approach, namely generalized visualization-induced self-organizing map (GViSOM), to cluster mixed, numeric and categorical, data. Our model integrates the ideas from SOM, GSOM, and ViSOM, and overcomes their shortcomings, including projection distortion on the maps and the incapability of handling mixed data. GViSOM can directly handle mixed data and preserves the topological structure of the original data as faithfully as possible. Experimental results of a synthetic and a real datasets demonstrate that GViSOM is able to cluster mixed data and better reveals the cluster structure than SOM, GSOM and ViSOM.

In this paper, we propose a novel template matching based method for header metadata extraction form semi-structured documents stored in PDF. In our approach, templates are defined, and the document is considered as strings with format. Templates are used to guide finite state automaton (FSA) to extract header metadata of papers. ne testing results indicate that our approach can effectively extract metadata, without any training cost and available to some special situation. This approach can effectively assist the automatic index creation in lots of fields such as digital libraries, information retrieval, and data mining.

Symbolic representations have proven to be a very effective way to reduce the dimensionality of time series even using simple aggregations over episodes of the same length and a fixed set of symbols. However, computing adaptive symbolic representations would enable more accurate representations of the dataset without compromising the dimensionality reduction. Therefore we propose a new generic framework to compute adaptive Segmentation Based Symbolic Representations (SBSR) of time series. SBSR can be applied to any model but we focus on piecewise constant models (SBSRLO) which are the most commonly used.

For the efficient maintenance of manufacturing process, precise diagnosis of the manufacturing process should be performed and the appropriate maintenance action should be executed when the current condition of the manufacturing system is diagnosed as being in abnormal condition. This paper suggests an intelligent manufacturing process diagnosis system using hybrid data mining. In this system, the cause-and-effect rules for the manufacturing process condition are inferred by hybrid decision tree/evolution strategies learning and the most effective maintenance action is recommended by a decision network and AHP (analytical hierarchy process). To verify the hybrid learning proposed in this paper, we compared the accuracy of the hybrid learning with that of the general decision tree learning algorithm (C4.5) and hybrid decision tree/genetic algorithm learning by using datasets from the well-known dataset repository at UCI (University of California at Irvine).

By evaluating interestingness value calculated from interestingness measures on association rules, a new approach based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient is proposed to answer the question: How we can capture the stable behaviors of interestingness measures on different datasets?. In this paper, a correlation graph is used to evaluate the behavior of 36 interestingness measures on two datasets.

We present a Decision Rule Acquisition Workbench (DRAW) that discovers symbolic decision rules, in CNF form, from un-annotated data-sets. Our rule-induction strategy involves three phases: (a) conceptual clustering to cluster and generate a conceptual hierarchy of the data-set; (b) rough sets based rule induction algorithm to generate decision rules from the emergent data clusters; and (c) attribute oriented induction to generalize the derived decision rules to yield high-level decision rules and a minimal rule-set size. We evaluate DRAW with five standard machine learning datasets and apply to derive decision rules to understand optic nerve images in the realm of glaucoma decision support.

This paper considers the problem of mining quantitative association rules without revealing the private information of parties who compute jointly and share distributed data. The issue is an area of Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) research. Some researchers have considered the case of mining Boolean association rules'. however, this method cannot be easily applied to quantitative rules mining. A new Secure Set Union algorithm is proposed in this paper, which unifies the input sets of Parties without revealing any element's owner and has lower time cost than existing algorithms. The new algorithm takes the advantages of both in privacy-preserving Boolean association rules mining and in privacy-preserving quantitative association mining. This paper also presents an algorithm for privacy-preserving quantitative association rules mining over horizontally portioned data, based on CF tree and secure sum algorithm: Besides, the analysis of the correctness, the security and the complexity of our algorithms are provided.

The proposed algorithm introduces the notion of Data Class Antigens, which is used to represent a class of data. The produced rules are evolved by a clonal selection algorithm, which extends the recently proposed CLONALG algorithm. In the present algorithm, among other new features, a receptor editing step has been incorporated. Moreover, the rules themselves are represented as antibodies, which are coded as GEP chromosomes, in order to exploit the flexibility and the expressiveness of such encoding. The algorithm is tested on some benchmark problems of the UCI repository, and in particular on the set of MONK problems and the Pima Indians Diabetes problem. In both problems, the results in terms of prediction accuracy are very satisfactory, albeit slightly less accurate than those obtained by a standard GEP technique. In terms of convergence rate and computational efficiency, however, the technique proposed here markedly outperforms the standard GEP algorithm.

Data mining researchers have studied subjective measures of interestingness to reduce the volume of discovered rules and to improve the overall efficiency of the knowledge discovery in databases process (KDD). The objective of this paper is to provide a framework that uses subjective measures of interestingness to discover interesting patterns from association rules algorithms. The framework works in an environment where the medical databases are evolving with time. In this paper we consider a unified approach to quantify interestingness of association rules. We believe that the expert mining can provide a basis for determining user threshold which will ultimately help us in finding interesting rules. The framework is tested on public datasets in medical domain and results are promising.

The previous approaches have mainly focused on feature selection of audit data and parameters optimization of intrusion detection models. However, feature selection and parameters optimization have been performed in separate way. Several hybrid approaches based on soft computing techniques are able to perform both of them together but they have more computational overheads. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Simultaneous Intrinsic Model Identification (SIMI), which enable one to perform both feature selection and parameters optimization together without any additional computational overheads. SIMI adopts Random Forest (RF) which is a promising machine learning algorithm and has been shown similar or better classification rates compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM). SIMI is able to model lightweight intrinsic intrusion detection model with optimized parameters and features. After determination of the intrinsic intrusion detection model, we visualize normal and attack patterns in 2 dimensional space using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset and validate the feasibility of our approach.

Clustering large data sets has always been a serious challenge for clustering algorithms, because huge data set makes the clustering process extremely costly. In this paper, we propose DGCL, an enhanced Density-Grid based Clustering algorithm for Large spatial database. The characteristics of dense area can be enhanced by considering the affection of the surrounding area. Dense areas are analytically identified as clusters by removing sparse area or outliers with the help of a density threshold. Synthetic datasets are used for testing and the result shows the superiority of our approach.

The goals of VUDM are to visualize social networks, patrons' distributions, and usage trends of NDLTD. The distinctive approach of this research is that we focus on analysis and visualization of users' implicit rating data, which was generated based on user tracking information, such as sending queries and browsing result sets - rather than focusing on explicit data obtained from a user survey, such as major, specialties, years of experience, and demographics. The VUDM interface uses spirals to portray virtual interest groups, positioned based on inter-group relationships. VUDM facilitates identifying trends related to changes in interest, as well as concept drift. A formative evaluation found that VUDM is perceived to be effective for five types of tasks. Future work will aim to improve the understandability and utility of VUDM.

An extensive research has been carried out mainly in discovering positive patterns. Recently, the generalized disjunction-free representation GDFLR of all frequent patterns both with and without negation has been proposed. There are cases, however, when a user is interested in patterns with a restricted number of negated items. In this paper, we offer the k-GDFLR representation as an adaptation of GDFLR, which represents all frequent patterns with at most k negated items. Algorithms discovering this representation are discussed as well. The experimental results show that k-GDFLR is more concise than GDFLR.

J	Kulathuramaiyer, N; Balke, WT				Kulathuramaiyer, Narayanan; Balke, Wolf-Tilo			Restricting the view and connecting the dots - Dangers of a Web search engine monopoly	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Web mining; search engines and information retrieval; social issues		Everyone realizes how powerful the few big Web search engine companies have become, both in terms of financial resources due to soaring stock quotes and in terms of the still hidden value of the wealth of information available to them. Following the common belief that "information is power" the implications of what the data collection of a de-facto monopolist in the field like Google could be used for should be obvious. However, user studies show that the real implications of what a company like Google can do, is already doing, and might do in a not too distant future, are not explicitly clear to most people. Based on billions of daily queries and an estimated share of about 49% of the total Web queries [Colburn, 2007], allows predicting with astonishing accuracy what is going to happen in a number of areas of economic importance. Hence, based on a broad information base and having the means to shift public awareness such a company could for instance predict and influence the success of products in the market place beyond conventional advertising or play the stock market in an unprecedented way far beyond mere time series analysis. But not only the mining of information is an interesting feature; with additional services such as Google Mail and on-line communities, user behavior can be analyzed on a very personal level. Thus, individual persons can be targeted for scrutiny and manipulation with high accuracy resulting in severe privacy concerns. All this is compounded by two facts: First, Google's initial strategy of ranking documents in a fair and objective way (depending on IR techniques and link structures) has been replaced by deliberatively supporting or ignoring sites as economic or political issues are demanding [Google Policy: Censor, 2007]. Second, Google's acquisition of technologies and communities together with its massive digitization projects such as [Burright, 2006] [Google Books Library, Project, 2006] enable it to combine information on issues and persons in a still more dramatic way. Note that search engines companies are not breaking any laws, but are just acting on the powers they have to increase shareholder value. The reason for this is that there are currently no laws to constrain data mining in any way. We contend that suitable internationally accepted laws are necessary. In their absence, mechanisms are necessary to explicitly ensure web content neutrality ( which goes beyond the net neutrality of [Berners-Lee, 2006]) and a balanced distribution of symbolic power [see Couldry, 2003]. In this paper we point to a few of the most sensitive issues and present concrete case studies to support our point. We need to raise awareness to the threat that a Web search engine monopoly poses and as a community start to discuss the implications and possible remedies to the complex problem.

Among those are the data "features"- variables or association rules that can be derived from them. Selecting the most interesting features is a classical data mining problem. That selection requires a large number of tests from which arise a number of false discoveries. An original non parametric control method is proposed in this paper. A new criterion, UAFWER, defined as the risk of exceeding a pre-set number of false discoveries, is controlled by BS_FD, a bootstrap based algorithm that can be used on one- or two-sided problems. The usefulness of the procedure is illustrated by the selection of differentially interesting association rules on genetic data.

In order to compare the measurements of a query trajectory to a set of stored trajectories. one needs to calculate similarity between two trajectories. In this paper an efficient algorithm for calculating the similarity is presented for a set of trajectories containing one increasing measurement dimension, for example time series data. An even more efficient version of the algorithm suitable for situations where all dimensions are increasing. such as many spatio-temporal data sets, is also presented. Furthermore, the similarity measurement technique nearly fulfills the requirements of a metric space, which is a clear improvement to the currently used procedure. The performance of the algorithm is validated first by using data measured from a hot strip mill and then by using synthetically generated trajectories. The new algorithm outperforms the currently used procedure by several orders of magnitude, depending on the context of usage.

In real applications, different items may have different support criteria to judge their importance, taxonomic relationships among items may appear, and data may have quantitative values. This paper thus proposes a fuzzy multiple-level mining algorithm for extracting knowledge implicit in quantitative transactions with multiple minimum supports of items. Items may have different minimum supports and the maximum-itemset minimum- taxonomy support constraint is adopted to discover the large itemsets. Under the constraint, the characteristic of downward-closure is kept, such that the original Apriori algorithm can be easily extended to find fuzzy large itemsets. The proposed algorithm adopts a top-down progressively deepening approach to derive large itemsets. It can also discover cross-level fuzzy association rules under the maximum-itemset minimum-taxonomy support constraint. An example is also given to demonstrate that the proposed mining algorithm can derive the multiple-level association rules under multiple item supports in a simple and effective way.

Clustering transactional data streams	AI 2006: Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	DEC 04-08, 2006	Hobart, AUSTRALIA					The challenge of mining data streams is three fold. Firstly, an algorithm for a particular data mining task is subject to the sequential one-pass constraint; secondly, it must work under bounded resources such as memory and disk space; thirdly, it should have capabilities to answer time-sensitive queries. Dealing with transactional data streams is even more challenging due to their high dimensionality and sparseness. In this paper, algorithms for clustering transactional data streams are proposed by incorporating the incremental clustering algorithm INCLUS into the equal-width time window model and the elastic time window model. These algorithms can efficiently cluster a transactional data stream in one pass and answer time sensitive queries at different granularities with limited resources.

J	Mamitsuka, H				Mamitsuka, H			Query-learning-based iterative feature-subset selection for learning from high-dimensional data sets	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						query learning; feature-subset selection; high-dimensional data set; uncertainty sampling; drug design	ONLINE	We propose a new data-mining method that is effective for learning from extremely high-dimensional data sets. Our proposed method selects a subset of features from a high-dimensional data set by a process of iterative refinement. Our selection of a feature-subset has two steps. The first step selects a subset of instances, to which predictions by hypotheses previously obtained are most unreliable, from the data set. The second step selects a subset of features whose values in the selected instances vary the most from those in all instances of the database. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with those of four other methods, including one of the latest feature-subset selection methods. The evaluation was performed on a real-world data set with approximately 140,000 features. Our results show that the performance of the proposed method exceeds those of the other methods in terms of prediction accuracy, precision at a certain recall value, and computation time to reach a certain prediction accuracy. We have also examined the effect of noise in the data and found that the advantage of the proposed method becomes more pronounced for larger noise levels.

Technologies of grid computing promise to be an effective tool to combine all these requirements into a single architecture. In this paper, we describe scenarios and future research directions related to grid-based knowledge discovery in clinico-genomic data, and introduce the approach taken by the recently launched ACGT project(1). The whole endeavor is considered in the context of biomedical informatics research and aims towards the realization of an integrated and grid-enabled biomedical infrastructure. The presented integrated clinico-genomics knowledge discovery (ICGKD) scenario and its process realization is based on a multi-strategy data-mining approach that seamlessly integrates three distinct data-mining components: clustering, association rules mining, and feature-selection. Preliminary experimental results are indicative of the rational and reliability of the approach.

In recent times, the prediction of properties of steel strip is an area of increased interest mainly because of its prospective benefits of reduction in testing cost, better control on properties, reduction of inventory, increase in yield, and improvement in delivery compliance. Prediction of mechanical properties is a complicated task, as it depends on the chemical composition of the steel, and a number of processing parameters. In general, a high degree of nonlinearity exists between the property and the factors influencing it. In the past only Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used, sometimes along with the variable reduction technique such as principle components / factor analysis. However, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) has never been used despite some of its known advantages over the ANN. In this work two predictive models have been developed - one based on ANN, and another, MARS. This paper discusses on the model development and the comparative performance analysis of these two. The analysis shows that the results from both the models are comparable. However, shorter training time and automatic selection of important predictor variables, give MARS an edge over ANN.

Two combination operators for the Multiple-Classifier System definition are also proposed. The classification methods used to generate classifiers for combination are chosen in terms of their representability and diversity and include the Instance-based Learning algorithm (IBL), Decision Tree learning algorithm (DT), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). An effective approach of combining class-wise expertise of diverse classifiers is proposed and evaluated on seven toxicity data sets. The experimental results show that the performance of the combined classifier based on our approach over seven data sets can achieve 69.24% classification accuracy on average, which is better than that of the best classifier (generated by MLP) and four combination schemes studied.

One of the research challenges posed by LBS is to support location management and spatial data mining on vehicle movement. In this paper, we introduce a method that investigates how to deduce future locations of mobile users. The idea is to employ the movement patterns of users in the past. All frequent patterns are enumerated, which are applied to produce movement rules, which are in turn employed to predict future location of moving object. Our proposed algorithms are quite efficient to enable push-driven LBS applications.			nhanvth@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr; khryu@dblab.chungbuk.ac.kr					CHUNG JD, 2002, DEXA, P331; Katsaros D, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2810, P319, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-45231-7_30; Liu G.Y., 1995, P IEEE INT C UN PERS, P268, DOI 10.1109/ICUPC.1995.496902; Liu T, 1998, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V16, P922; Mamoulis N., 2004, P KDD; MERATNIA N, 2002, P INT S GIS; OH YB, 2003, IC AI, P608; PFOSER D, 1999, 6 INT S SSD, P111; Rajagopal S., 2002, Proceedings 10th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON 2002).

The increasing automation and tighter quality constraints related to these processes make the operator's job more and more difficult. This makes decision support systems (DSSs) for the operator more important than ever before. A traditional operator support system (OSS) focuses only on specific tasks that are performed. In the case of complex processes, the design of an integrated information system is extremely important. The proposed data-warehouse-based OSS makes possible linking complex and isolated production units based on the integration of the heterogenous information collected from the production units of a complex production process. The developed OSS is based on a data warehouse designed by following the proposed focus-on-process data-warehouse-design approach, which means stronger focus on the material and information flow through the entire enterprise. The resulting,OSS follows the process through the organization instead of focusing separate tasks of the isolated process units. For human-computer interaction, front-end tools have been worked out, where exploratory data analysis and advanced multivariate statistical models are applied to extract the most informative features of the operation of the technology. The concept is illustrated by an industrial case study, where the OSS is designed for the monitoring and control of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant.

We do a critical analysis of two previously existing methods, Apriori and FP-growth, emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses; and based on this analysis, we propose an algorithm called Matrix Apriori combining the best features of both. Matrix Apriori utilizes simple structures such as matrices and vectors in the process of generating frequent patterns, and it also minimizes the number of candidate sets, thus achieving a more efficient computation than Apriori and FP-growth. The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate multiple minimal support defined by the user with the aim of improving method efficacy.

However, not many Web search engines-and content filtering applications learn the user preferences over time. In this study, we proposed two machine-learning approaches that can be used to learn consumer preferences to identify documents that are most relevant to the consumer. We test the proposed machine learning approaches on a few simulated data sets. The results of our study illustrate that data mining approaches can be used to design intelligent adaptive agents that can select the relevant Web pages, given query terms, for the user.

J	Qian, G; Zhu, Q; Xue, Q; Pramanik, S				Qian, G; Zhu, Q; Xue, Q; Pramanik, S			A space-partitioning-based indexing method for multidimensional non-ordered discrete data spaces	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						algorithms; performance	TREE; PERFORMANCE	There is an increasing demand for similarity searches in a multidimensional non-ordered discrete data space (NDDS) from application areas such as bioinformatics and data mining. The non-ordered and discrete nature of an NDDS raises new challenges for developing efficient indexing methods for similarity searches. In this article, we propose a new indexing technique, called the NSP-tree, to support efficient similarity searches in an NDDS. As we know, overlap causes a performance degradation for indexing methods ( e. g., the R-tree) for a continuous data space. In an NDDS, this problem is even worse due to the limited number of elements available on each dimension of an NDDS. The key idea of the NSP-tree is to use a novel discrete space-partitioning (SP) scheme to ensure no overlap at each level in the tree. A number of heuristics and strategies are incorporated into the tree construction algorithms to deal with the challenges for developing an SP-based index tree for an NDDS. Our experiments demonstrate that the NSP-tree is quite promising in supporting efficient similarity searches in NDDSs. We have compared the NSP-tree with the ND-tree, a data-partitioning-based indexing technique for NDDSs that was proposed recently, and the linear scan using different NDDSs.

However, current EP mining algorithms do not handle attributes whose values are asscociated with taxonomies (is-a hierarchies). Current EP mining techniques are restricted to using only the leaf-level attribute-values in a taxonomy. In this paper, we formally introduce the problem of mining generalised emerging patterns. Given a large data set, where some attributes are hierarchical, we find emerging patterns that consist of items at any level of the taxonomies. Generalised EPs are more concise and interpretable when used to describe some distinctive characteristics of a class of data. They are also considered to be more expressive because they include items at higher levels of the hierarchies, which have larger supports than items at the leaf level. We formulate the problem of mining generalised EPs, and present an algorithm for this task. We demonstrate that the discovered generalised patterns, which contain items at higher levels in the hierarchies, have greater support than traditional leaf-level EPs according to our experimental results based on ten benchmark datasets.

The problem of incremental mining of sequential patterns deserves as much attention. In this paper, we consider the problem of the incremental updating of sequential pattern mining when some transactions and/or data sequences are deleted from the original sequence database. We present a new algorithm, called IU_D, for mining frequent sequences so as to make full use of information obtained during an earlier mining process for reducing the cost of finding new sequential patterns in the updated database. The results of our experiment show that the algorithm performs significantly faster than the naive approach of mining the entire updated database from scratch.

Feature salience definition and estimation and its use in feature subset selection	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; feature subset selection; feature salience; decision tree	RANKING	In this paper we describe novel feature subset selection methods, based on the estimation of feature salience i.e. the quantification of the relative importance of individual features, in the presence of other features, for determining the classes of records in a dataset. We present a definition of what we mean by feature salience and a method for estimating this feature salience. Five synthetic datasets were used to demonstrate the utility of the salience estimation technique. It was found that the estimation techniques produced good approximations to the calculated saliencies in most cases. The use of feature salience as the basis of three methods of feature subset selection is described. These methods were evaluated on real world data sets by constructing classifiers using all features and comparing these with classifiers constructed using only a selected subset of features. It was found that the results compared well with other state of the art techniques and that the methods were simpler to implement and significantly faster to execute. On average, applying our best feature subset selection method resulted in trees that used only 49% of the features used by trees constructed with the full set of features. This reduction in number of features used was associated with a 1% improvement in classifier accuracy.

In particular, we used two datasets obtained from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) repository and created clusters using the M5 algorithm. Each cluster is associated with a linear model. We then compare the accuracy of the estimates so generated with the classical multivariate linear regression and least median squares. Results show that there is an improvement in the accuracy of the results when using clustering. Furthermore, these techniques can help us to understand the datasets better; such techniques provide some advantages to project managers while keeping the estimation process within reasonable complexity.

However researchers entering Medical Data Mining should be aware that in core clinical, dentistry and nursing, data mining is not welcomed as much as we believe and publication of results in these journals based on Data Mining algorithms is not easily possible. In this paper, in addition to presenting one of our "successful" KDD projects in Urology that did not get to anywhere, we back up our belief based on designed searches on PubMed and review literature based on these searches. Our findings suggest that few Data Mining algorithms made their ways into core clinical journals. The paper concludes by reasons we have collected through our experiences.

However, there are no perfect intrusion detection systems or mechanisms, because it is impossible for the intrusion detection systems to get all the packets in the network system. Current intrusion detection systems cannot fully detect novel attacks or variations of known attacks without generation of a large amount of false alerts. In addition, all the current intrusion detection systems focus on low-level attacks or anomalies. Consequently, the intrusion detection systems usually generate a large amount of alerts. And actual alerts may be mixed with false alerts and unmanageable. As a result, it is difficult for users or intrusion response systems to understand the intrusion behind the alerts and take appropriate actions. The standard format of alert messages is not yet defined. Alerts from heterogeneous sensors have different types although they are actually same. Also false alarms and frequent alarms can be used as Denial of Service attack as alarm messages by themselves and cause alert flooding. So we need to minimize false alarm rate and prevent alert flooding through analyzing and merging of alarm data. In this paper, we propose a data mining framework for the management of alerts in order to improve the performance of the intrusion detection systems. The proposed alert data mining framework performs alert correlation analysis by using mining tasks such as axis-based association rule, axis-based frequent episodes and order-based clustering. It also provides the capability of classifying false alarms in order to reduce false alarms from intrusion detection system. The final rules that were generated by alert data mining framework can be used to the real time response of the intrusion detection system and to the reduction of the volume of alerts.

In this study, we examine the effect of variable selection methods for intelligent bankruptcy prediction models. Moreover, an augmented stacked generalizer that utilizes diversified feature subsets during its learning phase is suggested as an effective ensemble method for promoting independencies among base prediction models. Empirical results show that the augmented stacked generalizer significantly improves overall predictability by reducing the more costly type-I error rate compared against both popular bagging and standard stacking procedures.

These systems combine information retrieval and data mining techniques to provide recommendations for products, based on suggestions of users with similar preferences. Nearest-neighbor CF process is influenced by several factors, which were not examined carefully in past work. In this paper we bring to surface these factors in order to identify existing false beliefs. Moreover by being able to view the "big picture" from the CF process, we propose new approaches that substantially improve the performance of CF algorithms. For instance, we obtain more than 40% percent increase in precision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation, with several real data sets, and produce results that invalidate some existing beliefs and illustrate the superiority of the proposed extensions.

Feature selection is of great importance in pattern classification, medical data processing, machine learning, and data mining applications. Therefore, a good feature selection method based on the number of features investigated for sample classification is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, predictive accuracy, and to avoid incomprehensibility. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machines (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for the classification problem. The proposed method is applied to five classification problems from the literature. Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and obtains a higher classification accuracy compared to the other feature selection methods.

One of the most well-known density based clustering algorithms for processing spatial data is Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) that uses learning parameters epsilon and minPts to define the density that will be sought in the data set while forming the clusters. The major drawbacks of the DBSCAN algorithm are its sensitivity to user input required to execute the algorithm, inability to recognize clusters with different densities, and computational complexity. In this study, we propose a three-level clustering method to address the second issue. The first level selects appropriate grids so that the density is homogeneous in each grid. The second stage merges cells with similar densities and identifies the most suitable values of C and minPts in each grid that remain after merging. The third step of the proposed method executes the DBSCAN method with these identified parameters in the dataset. The proposed method is tested in three artificial benchmark data sets to demonstrate that the clusters are correctly identified.

One of the most important features is the ability to preserve the topology in the projection. There are several measures that can be used to quantify the goodness of the map in order to obtain the optimal projection, including the average quantization error and many topological errors. Many researches have studied how the topology preservation should be measured. One option consists of using the topographic error which considers the ratio of data vectors for which the first and second best BMUs are not adjacent. In this work we present a study of the behaviour of the topographic error in different kinds of maps. We have found that this error devaluates the rectangular maps and we have studied the reasons why this happens. Finally, we suggest a new topological error to improve the deficiency of the topographic error.	[Uriarte, E. Arsuaga; Martin, F.

However, the success of the service delivery heavily relies on the QoS offered by the underlying networks. As the services operate in a heterogeneous networking environment, we argue that the generic information about the networks' offered-QoS may enable an anyhow mobile service delivery based on an intelligent (proactive) selection of 'any' network available in the user's context (location and time). Towards this direction, we develop a QoS-predictions service provider, which includes functionality for the acquisition of generic offered-QoS information and which, via a multidimensional processing and history-based reasoning, will provide predictions of the expected offered-QoS in a reliable and timely manner. We acquire the generic QoS-information from distributed mobile services' components quantitatively (actively and passively) measuring the application-level QoS, while the reasoning is based on statistical data mining and pattern recognition techniques.

There have been many studies on efficient discovery of frequent itemsets in privacy preserving data mining. However, it is nontrivial to maintain such discovered frequent itemsets because a database may allow frequent itemsets updates and such frequent itemsets may be turned into infrequent itemsets. In this paper, an incremental updating algorithm IPPFIM is proposed for efficient maintenance of discovered frequent itemsets when new transaction data are added to a transaction database in privacy preserving. The algorithm makes use of previous mining results to cut down the cost of finding new frequent itemsets In an updated database, the performance evaluation shows the efficiency of this method.

In this paper we propose a novel feature selection approach which integrates the feature score criterion with factor analysis to further improve the SVM-based classification performance of gene expression data. We examine two sets of published gene expression data to validate the novel feature selection method by means of SVM classifier with different parameters. Experiments show that the proposed hybrid method can select a small quantity of principal factors to represent a large number of genes and SVM has a superior classification performance with the common factors which are extracted from gene expression data. Moreover experiment results demonstrate successful cross-validation accuracy of 92% for the colon dataset and 100% for the leukemia dataset.

By this way, a record is denoted by only one binary number and so the size of the database is reduced sharply. If the database-encoding algorithm is used into some known modified algorithms, the efficiency will be improved remarkably. At the meantime, a new algorithm, anti-Apriori, which based on the proposed encoding method is introduced either. By using some properties of numbers, the itemsets of the database can be transformed into numerical fields. Different from the Apriori algorithm, the new one discovers the association rules from the largest frequent itemset at first, and then all sub itemset, which are also frequent, will be gained without any farther calculation, and all the other small frequent itemset that must be generated in the Apriori be omitted, and the times of the database scan is also reduced. Test results show the new algorithm based on the encoding database has a lower complexity of time and space.

Normal business users cannot easily use data mining tools to solve their business problems, because of the complexity of data mining process and data mining tools. In this paper, we propose a casebased data mining platform, which reuses the knowledge captured in past data mining cases to semi-automatically solve new similar problems. We first extend generic data mining model for knowledge reuse. Then we define data mining case. And then we introduce this platform in detail from its storage bases, functional modules, user interface, and application scenario. Theoretically, this platform can simplify data mining process, reduce the dependency on data mining professional, and shorten business decision time.

As an alternative to traditional ways of designing specific algorithm to mine certain kind of pattern directly from the data, our approach extracts the temporal structure of the time-series data by learning Markovian models, and then uses well established methods to efficiently mine a wide variety of patterns from the topology graph of the learned models. We consolidate the approach by explaining the use of some well-known Markovian models on mining several kinds of patterns. We then present a novel high-order hidden Markov model, the variable-length hidden Markov model (VLHMM), which combines the advantages of well-known Markovian models and has the superiority in both efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, it can mine a much wider variety of patterns than each of prior Markovian models. We demonstrate the power of VLHMM by mining four kinds of interesting patterns from 3D motion capture data, which is typical for the high-dimensionality and complex dynamics.

Aiming at the clustering of the mixed valued data, and a advanced kernel k-aggregate clustering algorithm is presented by combining the clustering analysis with kernel-based method. In this algorithm, the aggregate function (i.e. maximum entropy function) to approximate the maximum function and the categorical valued attributes decompose (CVAD) are applied in order to effectively define the computing scheme and the distance for categorical valued data. Like the fuzzy k-prototypes algorithm, the algorithm is also soft clustering, but it is more easier and insensitive to the selection of the aggregate parameter than the fuzzy one. So the algorithm is applied to the customer segmentation and gets a good clustering result which provides the managers guidance and evidence of different marketing strategies for corresponding subdivided markets. And in the clustering process the best clustering number is chosen by the significance test on five selected attributes.

These metrics contain the information of software and can be used to predict software quality in the early stage of software life cycle. Intelligent computing techniques such as data mining can be applied in the study of software quality by analyzing software metrics. Clustering analysis, which is one of data mining techniques, is adopted to build the software quality prediction models in early period of software testing. In this paper, three clustering methods, k-means, fuzzy c-means and Gaussian mixture model, are investigated for the analysis of two real-world software metric datasets. The experiment results show that the best method in predicting software quality is dependent on practical dataset, and clustering analysis technique has advantages in software quality prediction since it can be used in the case having little prior knowledge.

First, automatic cloud detection and tracking methods are proposed to identify the georeferenced cloud objects in satellite remote sensing images. Then, a data integration modeling mechanism is designed to collect meaningful properties of those detected clouds by integrating the heterogeneous satellite-observed data and imaging into a unified cloud database. Finally, based on the integrated global data schema, a two-phase data mining method employing the decision tree algorithm is implemented to analyze and forecast the meteorological activities of all the cloud objects. Experimental results have shown that the proposed data integration model can effectively extract and synthesize all the useful information from heterogeneous data sources to generate a unified view of knowledge, on the basis of which the evolvement trends of clouds can be analyzed properly.

Nowadays researchers focus on studying the relationship between music and listeners' emotions but they didn't consider users' differences. Therefore, we propose a Personalized Music Emotion Prediction (P-MEP) System to assist predicting listeners' music emotion concerning with users' differences. To analyze listeners' emotional response to music, the P-MEP rules will be generated in the analysis procedure consisting of 5 phases. During the application procedure, the P-MEP System predicts the new listener's emotional response to music. The result of the experiment shows that the generated P-MEP rules can be used to predict emotional response to music concerning with listeners' differences.

Mining co-evolving spatial event sets is computationally challenging due to the high computational cost of finding co-located event instances on continuous geographic space, large temporal space and a composite interest measure, i.e., the spatial prevalence time sequence of a co-located event set. We propose a novel method for mining co-evolving spatial event sets. We analyze the proposed algorithm in terms of correctness and completeness, and experimentally evaluate the algorithm.

Product managers have to take tough decisions regarding the product life cycle like choosing the right moment for a new release, modernization or system replacement. Under these conditions they have to continually monitor the time evolution of efforts and costs required for implementing and maintaining the software product. Software tools that are able to assess these activities constitute a great value for those who need to take product management decisions. In this paper we present an approach for measuring and monitoring maintenance efforts by focusing on measurements of coding related activities. We employ data mining techniques for classifying coding related effort and present a preliminary evaluation of using this approach.

It is important for data mining tasks to reasonably measure system uncertainty. Rough set theory is one of the most successful tools for measuring and handling uncertain information. Various methods based on rough set theory for measuring system uncertainty have been investigated. Their algebraic characteristics and quantitative relations are analyzed and disclosed in this paper. The results are helpful for selecting proper uncertainty measures or even developing new uncertainty measures for specific applications.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic procedure utilizing self-organizing maps and a Markov process for detecting and preventing customer defection that uses data of past and current customer behavior. The basic concept originates from empirical observations that identified that a customer has a tendency to change behavior (i.e. trim-out usage volumes) before eventual withdrawal and defection. Our explanatory model predicts when potential defectors are likely to withdraw. Two strategies are suggested to respond to the question of where to lead potential defectors for the next stage, based on anticipating when the potential defector will leave. Our model predicts potential defectors with little deterioration of prediction accuracy compared with that of the multilayer perceptron neural network and decision trees. Moreover, it performs reasonably well in a controlled experiment using an online game.

J	Gao, LK; Wang, XYS				Gao, LK; Wang, XYS			Continuous similarity-based queries on streaming time series	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						similarity search; data mining; data stream processing; time series analysis; nearest neighbor search; continuous query		In many applications, local or remote sensors send in streams of data, and the system needs to monitor the streams to discover relevant events/patterns and deliver instant reaction correspondingly. An important scenario is that the incoming stream is a continually appended time series, and the patterns are time series in a database. At each time when a new value arrives (called a time position), the system needs to find, from the database, the nearest or near neighbors of the incoming time series up to the time position. This paper attacks the problem by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently find the cross correlations of time series, which yields, in a batch mode, the nearest and near neighbors of the incoming time series at many time positions. To take advantage of this batch processing in achieving fast response time, this paper uses prediction methods to predict future values. When the prediction length is long, FFT is used to compute the cross correlations of the predicted series (with the values that have already arrived) and the database patterns, and to obtain predicted distances between the incoming time series at many future time positions and the database patterns. If the prediction length is short, the direct computation method is used to obtain these predicted distances to avoid the overhead of using FFT. When the actual data value arrives, the prediction error together with the predicted distances is used to filter out patterns that are not possible to be the nearest or near neighbors, which provides fast responses. Experiments show that with reasonable prediction errors, the performance gain is significant. Especially, when the long term predictions are available, the proposed method can handle incoming data at a very fast streaming rate.

The technique uses different attributes for clustering objects and building clustering trees. The similarity between objects will be determined using k-nearest neighbors graph, which allows both numerical and categorical attributes. The technique covers the convenience of unsupervised learning as well as the ability of prediction of decision trees. The technique is an unsupervised learning, making up of two steps: (a) constructing k-nearest neighbors graph; (b) building the clustering tree (Clus-Tree). We illustrate the use of our algorithm with an example. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An effective method to the discovery of temporal behavioral patterns in the data set is proposed in this paper. The method consists of a two-step approach which is applied recursively to the data set. First, a clustering algorithm is used to segment the data into classes. Then, hidden Markov models are employed to find the underlying temporal behavioral patterns. These steps are applied recursively to features extracted from the data set until convergence. The main objective is to minimize the misclassification of patient profiles into various classes. This results in a hierarchical tree model consisting of a number of classes; each class groups similar patient temporal behavioral patterns together. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated through the application to a subset of the Australian national health insurance data set. It is shown that the proposed method not only clusters data into various categories of interest, but it also automatically marks the periods in which similar temporal behavioral patterns occurred.

J	Bisbal, J; Grimson, J; Bell, D				Bisbal, J; Grimson, J; Bell, D			A formal framework for database sampling	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data cleaning; database sampling; integrity constraints; legacy systems; denotational semantics; undecidability		Database sampling is commonly used in applications like data mining and approximate query evaluation in order to achieve a compromise between the accuracy of the results and the computational cost of the process. The authors have recently proposed the use of database sampling in the context of populating a prototype database, that is, a database used to support the development of data-intensive applications. Existing methods for constructing prototype databases commonly populate the resulting database with synthetic data values. A more realistic approach is to sample a database so that the resulting sample satisfies a predefined set of integrity constraints. The resulting database, with domain-relevant data values and semantics, is expected to better support the software development process. This paper presents a formal study of database sampling. A Denotational Semantics description of database sampling is first discussed. Then the paper characterises the types of integrity constraints that must be considered during sampling. Lastly, the sampling strategy presented here is applied to improve the data quality of a (legacy) database. In this context, database sampling is used to incrementally identify the set of tuples which are the cause of inconsistencies in the database, and therefore should be the ones to be addressed by the data cleaning process.

J	Carvalho, DR; Freitas, AA				Carvalho, DR; Freitas, AA			Evaluating six candidate solutions for the small-disjunct problem and choosing the best solution via meta-learning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						classification; data mining; decision trees; genetic algorithms; instance-based learning		A set of classification rules can be considered as a disjunction of rules, where each rule is a disjunct. A small disjunct is a rule covering a small number of examples. Small disjuncts are a serious problem for effective classification, because the small number of examples satisfying these rules makes their prediction unreliable and error-prone. This paper offers two main contributions to the research on small disjuncts. First, it investigates six candidate solutions (algorithms) for the problem of small disjuncts. Second, it reports the results of a meta-learning experiment, which produced meta-rules predicting which algorithm will tend to perform best for a given data set. The algorithms investigated in this paper belong to different machine learning paradigms and their hybrid combinations, as follows: two versions of a decision-tree (DT) induction algorithm; two versions of a hybrid DT/genetic algorithm (GA) method; one GA; one hybrid DT/instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm. Experiments with 22 data sets evaluated both the predictive accuracy and the simplicity of the discovered rule sets, with the following conclusions. If one wants to maximize predictive accuracy only, then the hybrid DT/IBL seems to be the best choice. On the other hand, if one wants to maximize both predictive accuracy and rule set simplicity - which is important in the context of data mining - then a hybrid DT/GA seems to be the best choice.

J	Grothendieck, J				Grothendieck, J			Tracking changes in language	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						change detection; clustering; speech data mining		One problem that has arisen in recent years is the extraction of useful information from changes in a data stream including natural language. Statistical tests on single word occurrences can reveal many apparent differences. Understanding the reasons behind such changes in the data requires methods for discovering structure within the entire set of individual changed items. This work presents a methodology for understanding how a language model has altered based on utterance clustering and statistical tests on individual features. It further examines clustering of lexical items via profiles of changes in association scores. A machine using an analysis package based on these techniques can isolate novel portions of the data stream. Human inspection of such data then readily determines the nature of the observed change. We investigate several variants of this analysis upon data drawn from an automated call center.

Our approach is designed to take the noisy results of traditional data-mining tools and exploit causal knowledge about attacks to relate activities and uncover the intent underlying them. Identifying intent enables us to both prioritize and explain alert sets to analysts in a readily digestible format. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the approach can handle alert sets of as many as 20 elements and can readily distinguish between false and true alarms. We discuss the important opportunities for future work that will increase the cardinality of the alert sets to the level demanded by a deployable application. In particular, we outline the need to bring the analysts into the process and for heuristic improvements to the plan-recognition algorithm.

A data mining process discovers interesting information from the hidden data that can either be used for future prediction and/or intelligently summarising the details of the data. There are many achievements of applying data mining techniques to various areas such as marketing, medical, and financial, although few of them can be currently seen in software engineering domain. In this paper, a proposed data mining application in software engineering domain is explained and experimented. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of data mining techniques in software engineering domain and the potential benefits in applying data mining to this area.

J	Wang, JTL; Liu, JH; Wang, JH				Wang, JTL; Liu, JH; Wang, JH			XML clustering and retrieval through principal component analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						document clustering; information retrieval; data mining		XML is increasingly important in data exchange and information management. A great deal of efforts have been spent in developing efficient techniques for storing, querying, indexing and accessing XML documents. In this paper we propose a new approach to clustering XML data. In contrast to previous work, which focused on documents defined by different DTDs, the proposed method works for documents with the same DTD. Our approach is to extract features from documents, modeled by ordered labeled trees, and transform the documents to vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean space based on the occurrences of the features in the documents. We then reduce the dimensionality of the vectors by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster the vectors in the reduced dimensional space. The PCA enables one to identify vectors with co-occurrent features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the clustering. We also discuss an extension of our techniques to XML retrieval. Experimental results based on documents obtained from Wisconsin's XML data bank show the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed techniques.

J	Wang, X				Wang, X			Finding patterns on protein surfaces: Algorithms and applications to protein classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						KDD; classification; data mining; structural pattern discovery; biochemistry; medicine	HIERARCHICAL-CLASSIFICATION; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES; ACTIVE-SITES; RECONSTRUCTION; SEQUENCES; DATABASE; ACCESS	A successful application of data mining to bioinformatics is protein classification. A number of techniques have been developed to classify proteins according to important features in their sequences, secondary structures, or three-dimensional structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to protein classification based on significant patterns discovered on the surface of a protein. We define a notion called alpha-surface. We discuss the geometric properties of alpha-surface and present an algorithm that calculates the alpha-surface from a finite set of points in R-3. We apply the algorithm to extracting the alpha-surface of a protein and use a pattern discovery algorithm to discover frequently occurring patterns on the surfaces. The pattern discovery algorithm utilizes a new index structure called the Delta B+ tree. We use these patterns to classify the proteins. While most existing techniques focus on the binary classification problem, we apply our approach to classifying three families of proteins. Experimental results show the good performance of the proposed approach.

Traditional tools rely on ad hoc procedures. With these, determining which of the manifold system and workload parameters to examine is often a lengthy and highly speculative process. The analysis is often incomplete and, therefore, prone to revealing faulty conclusions and not uncovering useful tuning knowledge. We address this problem by introducing a data mining approach called ADMiRe ( Analyzer for Data Mining Results). In this scheme, regression analysis is first applied to performance data to discover correlations between various system and workload parameters. The results of this analysis are summarized in sets of regression rules. The user can then formulate intuitive algebraic expressions to manipulate these sets of rules to capture critical information. To demonstrate this approach, we use ADMiRe to analyze an Oracle database system running the TPC- C ( Transaction Processing Performance Council) benchmark. The results generated by ADMiRe were confirmed by Oracle experts. We also show that by applying ADMiRe to Microsoft Internet Information Server performance data, we can improve system performance by 20 percent.

Basically, these methodologies are general frameworks for representing non-linear mappings from several input variables to several output variables. Research into this problem occurs in applied mathematics (multivariate function approximation), statistics (nonparametric multiple regression) and computer science (neural networks). However, since these methodologies have been proposed in different fields, most of the previous papers treat them in isolation, ignoring contributions in the other areas. In this paper we consider five well known approaches for function approximation. Specifically we target polynomial approximation, general additive models (Gam), local regression (Loess), multivariate additive regression splines (Mars) and artificial neural networks (Ann). Neural networks can be viewed as models of real systems, built by tuning parameters known as weights. In training the net, the problem is to find the weights that optimize its performance (i.e. to minimize the error over the training set). Although the most popular method for Ann training is back propagation, other optimization methods based on metaheuristics have recently been adapted to this problem, outperforming classical approaches. In this paper we propose a short term memory tabu search method, coupled with path relinking and BFGS (a gradient-based local NLP solver) to provide high quality solutions to this problem. The experimentation with 15 functions previously reported shows that a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer, trained with our procedure, can compete with the best-known approximating methods. The experimental results also show the effectiveness of a new mechanism to avoid overfitting in neural network training.

The most important of such quantifiers are implicational ones widely used in data-mining procedures. On the other hand, there are operators of fuzzy implication introduced and studied in fuzzy logic. In the paper, two methods of construction of implicational quantifiers from fuzzy implications are described and formally justified. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In contrast, we are working to develop data mining techniques to discover patterns consisting of complex relationships between entities. Our research is particularly applicable to domains in which the data is event-driven or relationally structured. In this paper we present approaches to address two related challenges; the need to assimilate incremental data updates and the need to mine monolithic datasets. Many realistic problems are continuous in nature and therefore require a data mining approach that can evolve discovered knowledge over time. Similarly, many problems present data sets that are too large to fit into dynamic memory on conventional computer systems. We address incremental data mining by introducing a mechanism for summarizing discoveries from previous data increments so that the globally-best patterns can be computed by mining only the new data increment. To address monolithic datasets we introduce a technique by which these datasets can be partitioned and mined serially with minimal impact on the result quality. We present applications of our work in both the counter-terrorism and bioinformatics domains.

The issues of preventive and condition-based maintenance, online monitoring, system fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis are of increasing importance. This paper introduces a technique to detect faults in induction motors. Stator currents are measured by current meters and stored by time domain. The time domain is not suitable for representing current signals, so the frequency domain is used to display the signals. Fourier transform is used to convert the signals onto frequency domain. After the signals have been converted, the features of the signals are extracted by the signal processing methods like the wavelet analysis, spectrum analysis, and other methods. The discovered features are entered to a pattern classification model such as a neural network model, a polynomial neural network, a fuzzy inference model, or other models. This paper describes the results of detecting fault using Fourier and wavelet analysis.

However, a site requires more than a high-performance personalization algorithm: it needs to convince its users to input the data needed by the algorithm. Today's Web users are becoming increasingly privacy-conscious and less willing to disclose personal data. How can the advantages of personalization (and hence, of disclosure) be communicated effectively, and how can the success of such strategies be measured in terms of improved personalization quality? In this paper, we argue for a tighter integration of the HCI and computational issues involved in these questions. We first outline the problems for personalization that arise from the combination of users' privacy concerns and sites' current policies of dealing with privacy issues. We then describe the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of changes to a site's interface on users' willingness to disclose data for personalization. This is followed by an overview of studies of the sensitivity of mining algorithms to changes in the availability of these types of data. Based on this, we outline a research agenda for future evaluation studies and user agent design.

Automatic discovery of locally frequent itemsets in the presence of highly frequent itemsets	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; association rules; locally frequent itemsets; database partitions		Many alternatives have been proposed for the mining of association rules involving rare but 'interesting' itemsets in a dataset where there also exist highly frequent itemsets. Nevertheless, all the approaches thus far suggested that we knew which those interesting itemsets are, as well as which is the right support value for them. None of the approaches proposed a way of automatically discovering such items. In this work we introduce the notion of locally frequent itemsets and support their existence as the biggest and most frequently appearing category of rare but interesting itemsets especially at commercial applications, based on the opinion of field experts. Subsequently we propose two algorithms for finding and handling these itemsets. The main idea is to divide the database into partitions according to the problem needs and besides searching for itemsets which are frequent in the whole database to search also for itemsets which are frequent if considered within these partitions. Our approach proves very effective and also very efficient as compared to the traditional algorithms both in synthetic and real data.

Unfortunately, the process of analysis of such data represents a complex task also because data volumes grow exponentially so manual analysis and interpretation become impractical. Fortunately, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are powerful tools available to medical and research people for help them in explore data and discover useful knowledge. To assess the spread of DM and KDD in biomedicine and health care, we designed and performed a search database of biomedical and health-care scientific literature, for the year interval 1997-2004, and analyzed the obtained results. There has been an increase of application of DM methods in literature of bio-medical informatics research most of which in bioinformatics and genomic area.

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite.

In the Coach competition of RoboCup Soccer, offline opponent modeling can be adopted to train the coach learn about the opponent's behavior patterns. Data-mining techniques, particularly decision-tree construction can be applied in identifying interesting behavior patterns of the opponent. This research explores the use of the decision-tree algorithm C4.5 to generate classification rules that will embody the offensive and defensive strategies (plans) of the coach against its opponent(s). To achieve this objective, the SimSoccer Coach system is built.

There have been various methods to detect the spatial outliers based on spatial autocorrelations in statistics and data mining. These methods may be applied in detecting forest fire pixels in the MODIS imageries from NASA's AQUA satellite. This is because the forest fire detection can be referred to as finding spatial outliers using spatial variation of brightness temperature. This point is what distinguishes our approach from the traditional fire detection methods. In this paper, we propose a graph-based forest fire detection algorithm which is based on spatial outlier detection methods, and test the proposed algorithm to evaluate its applicability. For this the ordinary scatter plot and Moran's scatter plot were used. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, the results were compared with the MODIS fire product provided by the NASA MODIS Science Team, which showed the possibility of the proposed algorithm in detecting the fire pixels.

To perform the analysis and summarization, this paper proposes a new measure of statistical significance. The main reason for proposing the new measure of statistical significance is to have an essential closure property, which is exploited in the summarization stage of the data mining process. In addition to the closure property, the proposed measure of statistical significance has two other important properties. First, the proposed measure of statistical significance is more conservative than the well-known chi-square test in classical statistics and, therefore, inherits its statistical robustness. This paper does not simply employ the chi-square test due to lack of the desired closure property, which may lead to a precision problem in the summarization process. The second additional property is that, though the proposed measure of statistical significance is more conservative than the chi-square test, for most cases, the proposed measure yields a value that is almost equal to the z test, a conventional measurement of statistical significance based on the normal distribution. Based on the closure property addressed above, this paper develops an algorithm to summarize the results from performing statistical analysis in the data cube. Though the proposed measure of statistical significance avoids the precision problem due to having the closure property, its conservative nature may lead to a recall rate problem in the data mining process. On the other hand, if the chi-square test, which does not have the closure property, was employed, then the summarization process may suffer a precision problem. In this paper, we also show a possible application in bioinformatics. We applied the proposed mechanism on a microarray dataset, in order to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns in subspaces of feature space.

Besides, they are unable to discover potential correlations between secure messages. This research attempts to analyze security protocols using data mining. This is done by extending the idea of association rule mining and converting the verification of protocols into computing the frequency and confidence of inconsistent secure messages. It provides a novel and efficient way to analyze security protocols and find out potential correlations between secure messages. The conducted experiments demonstrate our approaches.

Since this inverse problem has been proven to be NP-complete, people ask "Are there reasonably efficient search strategies to find a compatible data set in practice?" [1].

Because it is one of the effective manner to discover the design knowledge in the multi-objective optimization problem which obtains large data. In the present study, two Data Mining techniques have been performed for a large-scale, real-world Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to provide knowledge regarding the design space. The MDO among aerodynamics, structures, and aeroelasticity of the regional-jet wing was carried out using high-fidelity evaluation models on Adaptive Range Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm. As a result, nine non-dominated solutions were generated and used for tradeoff analysis among three objectives. All solutions evaluated during the evolution were analyzed for the influence of design variables using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to extract key features of the design space. SOM and ANOVA compensated with the respective disadvantages, then the design knowledge could be obtained more clearly by the combination between them. Although the MDO results showed the inverted gull-wings as non-dominated solutions, one of the key features found by Data Mining was the non-gull wing geometry. When this knowledge was applied to one optimum solution, the resulting design was found to have better performance compared with the original geometry designed in the conventional manner.			chiba@chofu.jaxa.jp; jeong@edge.ifs.tohoku.ac.jp; obayashi@ieee.org					CHIBA K, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V3410, P621; Deboeck G.J., 1998, VISUAL EXPLORATIONS; JEONG S, 2004, 20046437 AIAA; Jones DR, 1998, J GLOBAL OPTIM, V13, P455, DOI 10.1023/A:1008306431147; Keane AJ, 2003, J AIRCRAFT, V40, P741, DOI 10.2514/2.3153; Kohonen Teuvo, 1995, SELF ORG MAPS; Murayama M., 2002, 20020122 AIAA; Obayashi S, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2632, P796; OYAMA A, 2000, CFD J, V8, P570; SASAKI D, J AEROSPACE COMPUTIN, V2, P44; Vesanto J, 2000, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V11, P586, DOI 10.1109/72.846731; YAMAZAKI W, 2004, 20040034 AIAA	12	2	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		0-7803-9363-5	IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT			2005							2333	2340				8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BCZ86	WOS:000232173100310

Understanding this structure is important in many domains - many quantitative approaches such as data mining have been proposed to address this issue. This paper presents a conceptual approach based on Formal Concept Analysis. Using software source code as an example of a complex structure we present a framework for conceptually analysing relational structures. In our framework, a browsable space of sub-contexts is automatically derived from a database of relations augmented by a rule engine and schema information. Operations are provided for the user to navigate between sub-contexts. We demonstrate how the use of these operations can lead to quick identification of an area of software source code that establishes an unecessary dependency between software parts.

Data integration is becoming as important as data mining for exploiting the value of laxge and distributed data sets that are available today. Distributed processing infrastructures such as Grids can be used for data integration on geographically distributed sites. This paper presents a framework for integrating heterogeneous XML data sources distributed among the nodes of a Grid. We propose a query reformulation algorithm to combine and query XML documents through a decentralized point-to-point mediation process among the different data sources based on schema mappings. The above cited XML integration formalism is exposed as a Grid Service within the GDIS architecture.

The ant system used is a MAX-MIN ant system which differs from the originally proposed ant systems in its ability to explore bigger parts of the solution space, yielding better performing rules. Furthermore, we are able to include intervals in the rules resulting in less and shorter rules. Our experiments show a significant improvement of the performance both in accuracy and comprehensibility, compared to previous data mining techniques based on ant systems and other state-of-the-art classification techniques.

In this paper, we investigate AIS, and in particular the clonal selection algorithm for Associative Classification (AC). To implement associative classification effectively, we need to tackle the problems on the very large search space of candidate rules during the rule mining process. This paper proposes a new approach known as AIS-AC for mining association rules effectively for classification. In AIS-AC, we treat the rule mining process as an optimization problem of finding an optimal set of association rules according to some predefined constraints. The proposed AIS-AC approach is efficient in dealing with the complexity problem on the large search space of rules. It avoids searching greedily for all possible association rules, and is able to find an effective set of associative rules for classification.

Unlike traditional clustering, supervised clustering is applied to classified examples and has the goal of identifying class-uniform clusters that have a high probability density. This paper focuses on how data mining techniques in general, and classification techniques in particular, can benefit from knowledge obtained through supervised clustering. We discuss how better nearest neighbor classifiers can be constructed with the knowledge generated by supervised clustering, and provide experimental evidence that they are more efficient and more accurate than a traditional 1-nearest-neighbor classifier. Finally, we demonstrate how supervised clustering can be used to enhance simple classifiers.

This paper introduces a novel approach to learn distance functions that maximizes the clustering of objects belonging to the same class. Objects belonging to a data set:are clustered with respect to a given distance function and the local class density information of each cluster is then used by a weight adjustment heuristic to modify the distance function so that the class density is increased in the attribute space. This process of interleaving clustering with distance function modification is repeated until a "good" distance function has been found. We implemented our approach using the k-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our approach using 7 UCI data sets for a traditional 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) classifier and a compressed 1-NN classifier, called NCC, that uses the learnt distance function and cluster centroids instead of all the points of a training set. The experimental results show that attribute weighting leads to statistically significant improvements in prediction accuracy over a traditional 1-NN classifier for 2 of the 7 data sets tested, whereas using NCC significantly improves the accuracy of the 1-NN classifier for 4 of the 7 data sets.

One of the simplest clustering approaches is the iterative k-means algorithm. The quality of k-means clustering suffers from being confined to run with fixed k rather than being able to dynamically alter the value of k. Moreover, it would be much more elegant if the user did not have to supply the number of clusters for the algorithm. In this paper we consider recently proposed autonomous versions of the k-means algorithm. We demonstrate some of their shortcomings and put forward solutions for their deficiencies. In particular, we examine the problem of automatically determining a good initial candidate as the number of clusters.

Therefore, they might want to share their data with each other to run data mining algorithms over the union of their data to get more accurate and representative results. During this process they do not want to reveal their data to each other due to the legal issues and competition. However, current systems do not consider privacy preservation in data sharing across private data sources. To satisfy this requirement, we propose a distributed middleware, ABACUS, to perform intersection, join, and aggregation queries over multiple private data warehouses in a privacy preserving manner.

They are spread in biomedical literature written in natural languages and they require much effort such as data mining for constructing well-structured data forms. As genomic research advances, knowledge discovery from a large collection of scientific papers is becoming more important for efficient biological and biomedical researches. In this paper, we present a relation kernel based interaction extraction method to resolve this problem. We extract gene/protein interactions of Yeast (S.cerevisiae) from text documents with relation kernel. Kernel for relation extraction is constructed with predefined interaction corpus and set of interaction patterns. Proposed relation kernel for interaction extraction only exploits shallow parsed documents. Experimental results show that the proposed kernel method achieves a recall rate of 78.3% and precision rate of 79.9% for gene/protein interaction extraction without full parsing efforts.

In the ESROM scheme the breeding value is estimated each semester by using BLUP animal model. In this paper we study the use of data mining techniques to deal with breeding value classification. The purpose of the paper is not to replace the use of BLUP in the ESROM, on the contrary, we intend to learn in a supervised way from the results produced by BLUP, and to use the learned models to provide preliminary information about the breeding value of an animal. We use standard classification techniques combined with feature subset selection in order to identify good (subsets of) predictors. We also show that the classifiers accuracy can be considerably improved by attribute construction.

The volatility of many real-world datasets has motivated the study of the evolution in the concept set under various modifications of the initial context. We believe this should be extended to the evolution of mingens. In the present paper, we build up on previous work about the incremental maintenance of the mingen family of a context to investigate the case of lattice merge upon context subposition. We first recall the theory underlying the singleton increment and show how it generalizes to lattice merge. Then we present the design of an effective merge procedure for concepts and mingens together with some preliminary experimental results about its performance.

It constructs a nonlinear probabilistic model w.r.t. behavior of a spacecraft by applying the relevance vector regression and autoregression to massive telemetry data, and then monitors the on-line telemetry data using the model and detects anomalies. A major advantage over conventional anomaly detection methods is that this approach requires little a priori knowledge on the system.

We developed a modified architecture and expanded it by showing refinements on every process of the clustering and knowledge discovery stages. We used the mentioned hierarchical clustering model to partition the data into smaller groups of attributes so that we would determine the data structure before applying the data mining tools. The experiment shows that the model using the clustering resulted to an isolated but imperative association rules based on clustered data, which in return could be practically explained for decision making purposes. Shorter processing time had been observed in computing for smaller clusters implying faster and ideal processing period than dealing with the entire dataset.

Guided by ethnographic research of these online communities, we have designed and implemented a visualization system for playful end-user exploration and navigation of large-scale online social networks. Our design builds upon familiar node-link network layouts to contribute customized techniques for exploring connectivity in large graph structures, supporting visual search and analysis, and automatically identifying and visualizing community structures. Both public installation and controlled studies of the system provide evidence of the system's usability, capacity for facilitating discovery, and potential for fun and engaged social activity.

However, most of the ANN-based rule extraction methods rely primarily on heuristics, and their underlying theoretical principles are not very deep. That is especially much true for methods extracting fuzzy logic rules, which usually allow to mix different logical connectives in such a way that extracted rules can not be correctly evaluated in any particular fuzzy logic model. This paper shows that mixing of connectives is not needed.

J	Huang, W; Nakamori, Y; Wang, S; Ma, T				Huang, Wei; Nakamori, Yoshiteru; Wang, Shouyang; Ma, Tieju			Mining scientific literature to predict new relationships	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery; medical informatics		It is compelling to process scientific literature to support the development of new science and technology. We propose a method to predict new relationships between a starting concept of interest and other concepts by mining scientific literature. In contrast to previous research, we measure the relationship between two concepts not only by their co-occurrence in scientific literature, but also by their sibling relationship in a hierarchical structure of concepts. Therefore, the predicted relationships of concepts obtained with our method are more pertinent to existing relationships within current scientific literature. By introducing a parent set, we propose a measure to evaluate the closeness of two concepts in a hierarchical structure of concepts. In order to deal with the combinatorial problems, we present two ways to limit the number of new relationships, which can be interactively enforced by the user. As in most of the previous research on literature-based discoveries, we choose biomedicine as the field in which to demonstrate our method. A comparison with related research shows that our method exhibits better performance, except in term of Recall. The new relationships predicted by this method can serve as candidates for new research themes, as impetus for inspiration, or as hypotheses to be tested in future.

Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is a useful approach to solve privacy preserving in distributed data mining. When data is vertically partitioned, scalar product is a feasible tool to securely discover frequent itemsets of association rule mining. We first show that several of the private scalar product protocols and analysis their insecurity. Then we develop a new and efficient protocol to perform two-party scalar product with an untrusted third party. The method is described in detail in this paper with complete analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. Our protocol maintains integrity and high security of the data sets of each party while keeping communication and computation cost low.

Various approaches to Intrusion Detection are currently being used, but they are relatively ineffective. Artificial Intelligence plays a driving role in security services. This paper proposes a dynamic model Intelligent Intrusion Detection System, based on specific AI approach for intrusion detection. The techniques that are being investigated includes neural networks and fuzzy logic with network profiling, that uses simple data mining techniques to process the network data. The proposed system is a hybrid system that combines anomaly, misuse and host based detection. Simple Fuzzy rules, allow us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. For host based intrusion detection we use neural-networks along with self organizing maps. Suspicious intrusions can be traced back to their original source path and any traffic from that particular source will be redirected back to them in future. Both network traffic and system audit data are used as inputs for both.

Though it has been proved to be useful in many problems, it is noted to have shortcomings such as feature weighting problems. In previous research, we proposed a hybrid system of case-based reasoning and neural network. In the system, the feature weights are extracted from the trained neural network, and used to improve retrieval accuracy of case-based reasoning. However, this system has worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. When the feature values are symbolic, nearest neighbor methods typically resort to much simpler metrics, such as counting the features that match. A more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required in symbolic domains. We propose another hybrid system of case-based reasoning and neural network, which uses value difference metric (VDM) for symbolic features. The proposed system is validated by datasets in symbolic domains.

This knowledge extraction system will consist of a library of distributed grid services controlled by a workflow system, compliant with standards emerging from the grid computing, web services, and virtual observatory communities. This new technology is being used to find high redshift quasars, study peculiar variable objects, search for transients in real time, and fit SDSS QSO spectra to measure black hole masses. Grist services are also a component of the "hyperatlas" project to serve high-resolution multi-wavelength imagery over the Internet. In support of these science and outreach objectives, the Grist framework will provide the enabling fabric to tie together distributed grid services in the areas of data access, federation, mining, subsetting, source extraction, image mosaicking, statistics, and visualization.

KNN (kappa-nearest neighbor) [11 has been intensively studied as an effective classification model in decades. However, its performance in ranking is unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the ranking performance of KNN. At first, we compare KNN and KNNDW (KNN with distance weighted) to decision trees and naive Bayes in ranking, measured by AUC (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). Then, we propose to improve the ranking performance of KNN by combining KNN with naive Bayes. The idea is that a naive Bayes is learned using the kappa nearest neighbors of the test instance as the training data and used to classify the test instance. A critical problem in combining KNN with naive Bayes is the lack of training data when k is small. We propose to deal with it using sampling to expand the training data. That is, each of the k nearest neighbors is "cloned" and the clones are added to the training data. We call our new model instance cloning local naive Bayes (simply ICLNB). We conduct extensive empirical comparison for the related algorithms in two groups in terms of AUC, using the 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka[2]. In the first group, we compare ICLNB with other types of algorithms C4.4[31, naive Bayes and NBTree[4]. In the second group, we compare ICLNB with KNN, KNNDW and LWNB[5]. Our experimental results show that ICLNB outperforms all those algorithms significantly. From our study, we have two conclusions. First, KNN-relates algorithms performs well in ranking. Second, our new algorithm ICLNB performs best among the algorithms compared in this paper, and could be used in the applications in which an accurate ranking is desired.

The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: We hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

The split is based on our previously developed data mining methods and a novel likelihood-based criterion. Such a split represents a highly intellectual activity thus the method is assumed to support the users, who are typically medical experts. Experiments with the chronic hepatitis data showed that our proposed method is effective and promising from various viewpoints.

It is often assumed that numeric data can simply be turned into symbolic data by means of discretisation. However, very few guidelines for successfully applying discretisation in MRDM exist. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the loss of information involved is negligible. In this paper, we consider different alternatives for dealing with numeric data in MRDM. Specifically, we analyse the adequacy of discretisation by performing a number of experiments with different existing discretisation approaches, and comparing the results with a procedure that handles numeric data dynamically. The discretisation procedures considered include an algorithm that is insensitive to the multi-relational structure of the data, and two algorithms that do involve this structure. With the empirical results thus obtained, we shed some light on the applicability of both dynamic and static procedures (discretisation), and give recommendations for when and how they can best be applied.

(2002) by the introduction of Principal Components Analysis to the inference process. We also extend the classifier from dealing with binomial (two-class) problems only to multinomial (multi-class) problems. The application to which the MML criterion has been applied in this paper is the classification of objects via a linear hyperplane, where the objects are able to come from any multi-class distribution. The inclusion of Principal Component Analysis to the original inference scheme reduces the bias present in the classifier's search technique. Such improvements lead to a method which, when compared against three commercial Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on Binary data, was found to be as good as the most successful SVM tested. Furthermore, the new scheme is able to classify objects of a multiclass distribution with just one hyperplane, whereas SVMs require several hyperplanes.

In this paper, we examine closely the problem of mining sequential patterns and propose a general evaluation method to assess the quality of the mined results. We propose four evaluation criteria, namely (1) recoverability, (2) the number of spurious patterns (3) the number of redundant patterns, and (4) the degree of extraneous items in the patterns, to quantitatively assess the quality of the mined results from a wide variety of synthetic datasets with varying randomness and noise levels. Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining. Furthermore, such evaluation is essential in understanding the performance of approximate solutions. In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. We demonstrate that the alternative approach is able to better recover the underlying patterns with little confounding information under all circumstances we examined, including those where the frequent sequential pattern model fails.

Eliminating such irrelevant features can significantly improve the performance of a data mining algorithm. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm that finds a set of Pareto-optimal feature subsets that works as a wrapper around a standard backpropagation algorithm. We also introduce a novel mechanism called the least-crowded selection algorithm that maximizes the diversity of the solutions returned by the algorithm. We justify the proposed method by theoretically and empirically comparing it to the backpropagation neural network and the simple genetic algorithm for feature selection.

To our best knowledge, the FP-growth algorithm which is based on the FP-tree to generate frequent itemsets is time-efficient. Currently, relevant studies are introduced to improve the FP-growth algorithm. However, they ignore the fact that the FP-tree construction may spend much time. Therefore, the goal of our research is to propose a fast algorithm called frequent pattern split, simply FP-split, for improving the process of the FP-tree construction. The proposed FP-sptit algorithm contains two main steps. The first step is to scan a transaction database only once for generating equivalence classes of frequent items. The second step is to sort these equivalence classes of frequent items in descending order so as to construct the FP-split tree. Through detailed experimental evaluations under various system conditions, our method shows excellent performance in terms of execution efficiency and scalability.

This paper presents design rationales and implementations of an alternative Web search environment called VisSearch. The VisSearch environment adopts visualization techniques to reduce various cognitive loads of iterative Web searches. It also employs a data mining algorithm to utilize Web search results of others. This paper describes in detail how these techniques can be used to facilitate efficient Web searches for ill-structured, open-ended questions, thereby fostering creation of a community of knowledge on the Web.

The elements and their arrangement in the document's hierarchy not only describe the document structure but also imply the data's semantic meaning, and hence provide valuable information to develop tools for manipulating XML documents. In this paper, we pursue a data mining approach to the problem of XML document clustering. We introduce a novel XML structural representation called common XPath (CXP), which encodes the frequently occurring elements with the hierarchical information, and propose to take the CXPs mined to form the feature vectors for XML document clustering. In other words, data mining acts as a feature extractor in the clustering process. Based on this idea, we devise a path-based XML document clustering algorithm called PBClustering which groups the documents according to their CXPs, i.e. their frequent structures. Encouraging simulation results are observed and reported.

While cluster discovery process is mainly unsupervised in nature, it can often be aided by a small amount of labeled data. A probabilistic model on the clustering structure is adopted and a novel unified energy equation for clustering that incorporates both labeled data and unlabeled data is introduced. This formulation is inspired by a force-field model integrating labeling constraint on labeled data and similarity information on unlabeled data for joint estimation. Experimental results show that good clusters can be identified using small amount of labeled data.

Although genetic programming (GP) technique has been applied to general classification, to our knowledge, it has not been exploited to address cost-sensitive classification in the literature, where the costs of misclassification errors are non-uniform. To investigate the applicability of GP to cost-sensitive classification, this paper first reviews the existing methods of cost-sensitive classification in data mining. We then apply GP to address cost-sensitive classification by means of two methods through: a) manipulating training data, and b) modifying the learning algorithm. In particular, a constrained genetic programming (CGP), a GP-based cost-sensitive classifier, has been introduced in this study. CGP is capable of building decision trees to minimize not only the expected number of errors, but also the expected misclassification costs through a novel constraint fitness function. CGP has been tested on the heart disease dataset and the German credit dataset from the UCI repository. Its efficacy with respect to cost has been demonstrated by comparisons with non-cost-sensitive learning methods and cost-sensitive learning methods in terms of the costs.

J	Li, JY; Wong, L				Li, Jinyan; Wong, Limsoon			Structural geography of the space of emerging patterns	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						space of emerging patterns; convexity; structure decomposition; medical treatment plan; PCL classifier	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; VERSION SPACES; GENE-THERAPY; CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; PREDICTION; SEARCH	Describing and capturing significant differences between two classes of data is an important data mining and classification research topic. In this paper, we use emerging patterns to describe these significant differences. Such a pattern occurs in one class of samples - its "home" class - with a high frequency but does not exist in the other class, so it can be considered as a characteristic property of its home class. We call the collection of all such patterns a space. Beyond the space, there are patterns that occur in both of the classes or that do not occur in any of the two classes. Within the space, the most general and most specific patterns bound the other patterns in a lossless convex way. We decompose the space into a terrace of pattern plateaus based on their frequency. We use the most general patterns to construct accurate classifiers. We also use these patterns in the bio-medical domain to suggest treatment plans for adjusting the expression levels of certain genes so that patients can be cured.

This paper studies the geometry of classifying convex clusters based on support functionals in the dual spaces. For the convex clusters that are to be classified, a combination of linear discriminant functions could solve the problem.

Along with the developing of computer technology, the technical trading rules are playing more and more important roles in the stock market trading system. However, there are many problems also occurred, such as the huge database, inefficiency, etc. So, the in-depth data mining technology is becoming a powerful tool to overcome the shortage of the current technologies. In this paper, we give some applications of in-depth data mining method: to find the optimal range, to find the stock-nile pair and rind the relationship between the number of pair and investment. This method can improve both efficiency and effectiveness.

Traditionally, such analysis is performed on data at a single location. However, one of the main motivational forces behind a virtual observatory is the distributed nature of both data and computational resources. Existing data-mining methods for distributed data are either communication-intensive or result in a loss of accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to supervised data mining that allows data to remain distributed, but still produces satisfactory results. We demonstrate by applying the approach to a number of astronomical datasets.

Various approaches have been presented for regression problem nowadays. However, many problems still exist, such as efficiency and model selection problem. This paper proposes a new approach to regression problem, visual regression problem (VRA) in order to resolve these problems. The core idea is to transfer the regression problem to classification problem based on Ancona theorem, which gives the mathematical equivalence between two problems; and then use visual classification approach, which is an efficient classification approach developed based on mimicking human sensation and perception principle, to solve the transformed classification problem and get an implicit regression function; and finally utilize some mathematical skills to obtain the explicit solution of the regression problem. We also provide a series of simulations to demonstrate that the proposed approach is not only effective but also efficient.

In this paper a new preprocessing algorithm-Clarifier Method (CM) is proposed to accelerate training of SVC especially when training data are of large mode. The core idea of CM is based on the fact that of all the training vectors of SVC, only support vectors have a most significant influence on the optimal result, meanwhile the other vectors can be not taken into account with little deviation of the final result. The approach can distinguish probable support vectors directly by the labels of training vectors in its neighborhood region. Then only these training vectors are preserved to form the training set of SVC. A series of artificial and real world simulation results show the efficiency and effectiveness of CM. The number of vectors in SVC training becomes much less and the training time is decreased without loss of the generalization capability of the SVC even in the case that noisy training samples are added in.

There are two prevalent approaches for building recommender systems - content-based recommending and collaborative filtering (CF). This study focuses on improving the performance of recommender systems by using data mining techniques. This paper proposes an SVM based recommender system. Furthermore this paper presents the methods for improving the performance of the SVM based recommender system in two aspects: feature subset selection and parameter optimization. GA is used to optimize both the feature subset and parameters of SVM simultaneously for the recommendation problem. The results of the evaluation experiment show the proposed model's improvement in making recommendations.

Frequent itemset mining fits in this category. Different approaches were proposed to handle or avoid somehow this problem. All of them have problems and limitations. In particular, most of them need the original data during the analysis phase, which is not feasible for data streams. The DWFIST (Data Warehouse of Frequent ItemSets Tactics) approach aims at providing a powerful environment for the analysis of itemsets and derived patterns, such as association rules, without accessing the original data during the analysis phase. This approach is based on a Data Warehouse of Frequent Itemsets.

In this work, the problem of embedding the given set of entities into a linear space with inner product by choosing an appropriate kernel function is considered as the major challenge in the featureless approach to estimating dependences in data sets of arbitrary kind. As a rule, several kernels may be heuristically suggested within the bounds of the same data analysis problem. We treat several kernels on a set of entities as Cartesian product of the respective number of linear spaces, each supplied with a specific kernel function as a specific inner product. The main requirement here is. to avoid discrete selection in eliminating redundant kernels with the purpose of achieving acceptable computational complexity of the fusion algorithm.

A publisher is a producer, a farmer or a food maker, etc, and submits its own product information on the web. An aggregator is a databank, a registry or a data broker, which retrieves and stores information of products. A subscriber is a seller, a distributor or a consumer, which acquires product information corresponding to the product code such as EAN/UCC Code or RFID. The proposed model improves the quality and quantity of product information service, and also gives opportunity to enjoy new services. It gives consumers new benefits of utilizing knowledge of products, discovering unknown facts of products, etc.	Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Reliabil Based Informat Syst Engn, Kagawa, Japan	Nakano, Y (reprint author), Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Reliabil Based Informat Syst Engn, Kagawa, Japan.						*JAP MIN HLTH LAB, 2001, ENF MIN ORD AM PORT; *WORLD WID WEB CON, 2003, RDF PRIM 6 1; 2001, RDF SITE SUMMARY 1 0; 2003, DUBLIN CORE METADATA	4	2	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		0-7803-9035-0				2005							147	151		10.1109/AMT.2005.1505292		5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics	Computer Science	BCR76	WOS:000230959600027

Furthermore, the advent of the ubiquitous computing paradigm has introduced a novel applications area, which offers new possibilities for further deepening this bond. Ubiquitous computing solutions are often designed for mobile environments, which poses additional requirements on practical solutions. Providing a distributed architecture enables the distribution of workload, while at the same time allowing the on-line processing of data. Such an architecture ensures the pervasiveness of privacy and security aspects in the overall design. In this paper we present an architecture for distributed data preprocessing in ubiquitous environments, which supports the full distribution of processing tasks and enables the encapsulation of privacy and security mechanisms within every component. As our second contribution we discuss more thoroughly the usefulness of the intelligent agent paradigm for context-aware systems.

We compared the evaluation results by a medical expert and those by selected sixteen kinds of interestingness measures for the rules discovered in a dataset on hepatitis. chi(2) measure, recall, and accuracy demonstrated the highest performance, and specificity and prevalence did the lowest. The interestingness measures showed a complementaxy relationship for each other. These results indicated that some interestingness measures have the possibility to predict really interesting rules at a certain level and that the combinational use of interestingness measures will be useful. We then discussed how to combinationally utilize interestingness measures and proposed a post-processing user interface utilizing them, which supports KDD through human-system interaction.

First, a relation between symbolic processing and non-symbolic processing is discussed. An intermediate form was introduced to represent both of them in the same framework and clarify the difference of these two. Characteristic of symbolic representation is to eliminate quantitative measure and also to inhibit mutual dependency between elements. Non-symbolic processing has opposite characteristics. Therefore there is a large gap between them. In this paper a quantitative measure is introduced in the syntax of predicate. It enables to measure the distance between symbolic and non-symbolic representations quantitatively. It means that even though there is no general way of translation from non-symbolic to symbolic representation, it is possible when there is some symbolic representation that has no or small distance from the given non-symbolic representation. It is to discover general rule from data. This paper discussed a way to discover implicative predicate in databases based on the above discussion. Finally the paper discusses some related issues. The one is on the way of generating hypothesis and the other is the relation between data mining and discovery.	Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan	Ohsuga, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Although there are many clustering algorithms, none of them is superior on all datasets. Typically these clustering algorithms while providing summary statistics on the generated set of clusters do not provide easily interpretable detailed descriptions of the set of clusters that are generated. Further for a given dataset, different algorithms may give different sets of clusters, and so it is never clear which algorithm and which parameter settings is the most appropriate. In this paper we propose the use of a decision tree (DT) based approach that involves the use of multiple performance measures for indirectly assessing cluster quality in order to determine the most appropriate set of clusters.

Among the data center activities, collection of experimental and theoretical results across the world has been of major importance. This includes the identification, relevance assessment and retrieval of journal articles, followed by the data extraction, data mining, format conversion and data input. The methodology of the process still largely relies on working groups of specialists and part-time human labor, in spite of recent modernization in journal publishing, especially the electronic journals newly available in subscription domain and the free-access online abstract databases. This work focuses on automating the above procedure to the maximum extent possible. In particular, we design a download robot that performs query search and abstract retrieval for the candidates of relevant articles over the internet at first stage,. followed by fultext retrieval (pdf format), text extraction and a deterministic relevance judgement. As a demonstration, we have also developed a bibliography database for electron-molecule collisions that automatically updates its contents over the internet in regular time intervals. The present work belongs to the project for evolutional data collecting system supported by a JSPS project which involves several research institutes.

This requires intelligent search and classification capabilities for users to find required information. It is especially true for repositories of scientific medical articles due to their extensive use, large size and number of new documents, and well maintained structure. This research aims to provide an automated method for classification of articles into the structure of medical document repositories, which would support currently performed extensive manual work. The proposed method classifies articles from the largest medical repository, MEDLINE, using state of the art data mining technology. The method is based on a novel associative classification technique which considers recurrent items and most importantly multi-label characteristic of the MEDLINE data. Based on large scale experiments that utilize 350,000 documents several different classification algorithms have been compared including both recurrent and non-recurrent associative classification. The algorithms are capable of assigning each medical document to several classes (multi-label classification) and are characterized by relatively high accuracy. We also investigate different measures of classification quality and point out pros and cons of each. Based on experimental result we show that recurrent item based associative classification demonstrates superior performance and propose three alternative setups that allow the user to obtain different desired classification qualities.

Objective measures are data-driven and domain-independent. Generally, they evaluate the rules based on their quality and similarity between them. Subjective measures, including unexpectedness, novelty [ 11], and actionability, are user-driven and domain-dependent. A rule is actionable if user can do an action to his/her advantage based on this rule ([2], [1], [3]). Action rules introduced in [7] and investigated further in [8] are constructed from actionable rules. To construct them, authors assume that attributes in a database are divided into two groups: stable and flexible. Flexible attributes provide a tool for making hints to a user what changes within some values of flexible attributes are needed for a given group of objects to re-classify these objects to another decision class. Ras and Gupta (see [10]) proposed how to construct action rules when information system is distributed with autonomous sites. Additionally, the notion of a cost and feasibility of an action rule is introduced in this paper. A heuristic strategy for constructing feasible action rules which have high confidence and possibly the lowest cost is also proposed. Interestingness of such action rules is the highest among actionable rules.

Recent studies have shown that certain weather factors have significant influence on air traffic. More than 50% of all delay accounts to weather and causes among others high costs to airlines and passengers. In this work we will show to what extent weather factors in the closer region of Frankfurt Airport have an impact on the delay of flights. Besides the results of a linear regression model we will also present the results of some modern data mining approaches, such as regression trees and fuzzy clustering techniques. With the clustering approach we will show that several weather conditions have a similar influence on the delay of flights. Our analyses focus on the delay that will be explicitly caused by weather factors in the vicinity of the airport, the so-called terminal management area (TMA). Thus, delay caused by weather at the departure airport or by other circumstances during the flight will not bias our results. With our methods it becomes possible to predict the delay of flights if certain weather factors are known. We will specify these factors and quantify their effects on delay.

It is quite effective and useful to discover such rules. However, it is a very time consuming and expensive task to mine the rules from these kinds of time ordered real valued continuous data sets with high dimensionality when they are enormous in size. This strongly motivates the need of efficient parallel processing techniques and algorithms. In this paper, we use parallel processing to discover dependency from the large amount of time series multi-stream data. We apply two parallel programming techniques (OpenMP and MPI) to implement this. The experimental results conducted in multiprocessor systems show the effectiveness of MPI over OpenMp.

Dynamic association rule mining using Genetic Algorithms	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; association rule mining; genetic algorithms; distributed data mining		A large volume of transaction data is generated everyday in a number of applications. These dynamic data sets have immense potential for reflecting changes in customer behaviour patterns. One of the strategies of data mining is association rule discovery which correlates the occurrence of certain attributes in the database leading to the identification of large data itemsets. This paper seeks to generate large itemsets in a dynamic transaction database using the principles of Genetic Algorithms. Intra Transactions, Inter Transactions and Distributed Transactions are considered for mining Association Rules. Further, we analyze the time complexities of single scan technique DMARG (Dynamic Mining of Association Rules using Genetic Algorithms), with Fast UPdate (FUP) algorithm for intra transactions and E-Apriori for inter transactions. Our study shows that the algorithm DMARG outperforms both FUP and E-Apriori in terms of execution time and scalability, without compromising the quality or completeness of rules generated.

There are also a lot of approaches designed for outlier detection. We observe that, in many situations, clusters and outliers are concepts whose meanings are inseparable to each other especially for those data sets with noise. Thus, it is necessary to treat clusters and outliers as concepts of the same importance in data analysis. In this paper we present a cluster-outlier iterative detection algorithm, tending to detect the clusters and outliers in another perspective for noisy data sets. In this algorithm, clusters are detected and adjusted according to the intra-relationship within clusters and the inter-relationship between clusters and outliers, and vice versa. The adjustment and modification of the clusters and outliers are performed iteratively until a certain termination condition is reached. This data processing algorithm can be applied in many fields such as pattern recognition, data clustering and signal processing. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Our proposed framework adopts the basic concepts from conditional probability theories and further develops an algorithm to facilitate the capability of handling both nominal and numerical values, which addresses the problem of the inability of handling both nominal and numerical values with a high degree of accuracy in the existing algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate that our framework provides a high accuracy when compared with most of the commonly used algorithms such as using the average value, using the maximum value, and using the minimum value to replace missing values.

This paper presents a first-Horizontal-last-Vertical scanning database Sequential pattern Mining algorithm (HVSM). HVSM considers a database as a vertical bitmap. The algorithm first extends itemsets horizontally, and digs out all one-large- sequence itemsets. It then extends the sequence vertically and generates candidate large sequence. The candidate large sequence is generated by taking brother-nodes as child-nodes. The algorithm counts the support by recording the first TID mark (1(st)-TID). Experiments show that HVSM algorithm can find frequent sequences faster than SPAM algorithm in mining the large transaction databases.

Data mining modules capable of online learning in dynamically changing environment are suggested. These modules provide for adaptive agent behavior in the form of the cognitive control systems that are able to self-tune in non-deterministic environment. Reinforcement learning is considered as the basic method for forming an agent behavior. A cognitive soccer agent for RoboCup Simulation League competitions capable of on-line learning has been developed and studied. Examples of shooting and teamwork are considered.

User/system access data are used as a basis for deriving statistically significant event patterns. These patterns could be considered as a user/system access signature. Signature-based approach employs a model discovery technique to derive a reference ground model accounting for the user/system access data. A unique characteristic of this reference ground model is that it captures the statistical characteristics of the access signature, thus providing a basis for reasoning the existence of a security intrusion based on comparing real time access signature with that embedded in the reference ground model. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated based on comparative performance using a publicly available data set that contains user masquerade.

However, generating rules is not an end in itself because their applicability is not so straightforward. Indeed, the user is often overwhelmed when faced with a large number of rules. In this paper, we propose an approach to lighten this burden when the user wishes to exploit such rules to decide which actions to do given an unsatisfactory situation. The method consists in comparing a situation to a set of classification rules. This is achieved using a suitable distance thus allowing to suggest action recommendations with minimal changes to improve that situation. We propose the algorithm DAKAR for learning action recommendations and we present an application to an environmental protection issue. Our experiment shows the usefulness of our contribution in decision-making but also raises concerns about the impact of the redundancy of a set of rules in learning action recommendations of quality.

In this paper an approach for grouping data sets that are indexed in the if, C space is proposed. It is based on the k-means algorithm and grid clustering. The former is the simplest and most commonly used clustering technique. A major problem with this algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partition. The latter is commonly used for grouping data that are indexed in the space. The goal in this paper is to overcome the high sensitivity of the k-means algorithm to the starting conditions by using the available spatial information. A semivariogram-based grid clustering is introduced. It uses the spatial correlation for determining the bin size. Since the bins are constrained to regular blocks while the spatial distribution of objects is not regular, we propose to combine this technique with a conventional k-means algorithm. By using the semivariogram an excellent initialization of the k-means is provided. Experimental results show that the final partition. preserves the spatial distribution of the objects.

However, in many situations it is very difficult to collect labels for all training samples. In this paper we explore methods that utilize unlabeled samples in supervised learning for thematic information extraction from remote sensing imagery. Our objectives are to understand the impact of parameter estimation with small learning samples on classification accuracy, and to augment the parameter estimation with unlabeled training samples to improve land cover predictions. We have developed a semi-supervised learning method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, and maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori classifiers. This scheme utilizes a small set of labeled and a large number of unlabeled training samples. We have conducted several experiments on multi-spectral images to understand the impact of unlabeled samples on the classification performance. Our study shows that though in general classification accuracy improves with the addition of unlabeled training samples, it is not guaranteed to get consistently higher accuracies unless sufficient care is exercised when designing a send-supervised classifier.

One strong case for DDM systems is the need to mine for patterns in very large databases. This requires mandatory partitioning or splitting of databases into smaller sets which can be mined locally over distributed hosts. Data Distribution implies communication costs associated with the need to combine the results from processing local databases. This paper considers the development of a DDM system on a cluster. In specific we approach the problem of data partitioning for data mining. We present a prototype system for DDM using a data partitioning mechanism based on Bayesian mixture modeling. Results from comparison with standard techniques show plausible support for our system and its applicability.

J	Vitoria, A				Vitoria, A			A framework for reasoning with rough sets	TRANSACTIONS ON ROUGH SETS IV	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article							WELL-FOUNDED SEMANTICS; KNOWLEDGE BASES; LOGIC PROGRAMS; MODEL; POWER	Rough sets framework has two appealing aspects. First, it is a mathematical approach to deal with vague concepts. Second, rough set techniques can be used in data analysis to find patterns hidden in the data. The number of applications of rough sets to practical problems in different fields demonstrates the increasing interest in this framework and its applicability. This thesis(1) proposes a language that caters for implicit definitions of rough sets obtained by combining different regions of other rough sets. In this way, concept approximations can be derived by taking into account domain knowledge. A declarative semantics for the language is also discussed. It is then shown that programs in the proposed language can be compiled to extended logic programs under the paraconsistent stable model semantics. The equivalence between the declarative semantics of the language and the declarative semantics of the compiled programs is proved. This transformation provides the computational basis for implementing our ideas. A query language for retrieving information about the concepts represented through the defined rough sets is also discussed. Several motivating applications are described. Finally, an extension of the proposed language with numerical measures is presented.

Despite the significant research, these methods remain only loosely related. In this paper, we give theoretically an explicit relation between spectral clustering and weighted kernel principal component analysis (WKPCA). We show that spectral clustering is not only a method for data clustering, but also for feature extraction. We are then able to reinterpret the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of WKPCA and propose our spectral feature analysis (SFA) method. The spectral features extracted by SFA can capture the distinguishing information of data from different classes effectively. Finally some experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.

For example, through data mining, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information or even patterns, from nonsensitive information or unclassified data. There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. The first type of privacy is that the data is altered so that the mining result will preserve certain privacy. The second type of privacy is that the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected. Given specific rules to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association, classification and clustering rules have been proposed. However, to specify hidden rules, entire data mining process needs to be executed. For some applications, we are only interested in hiding certain sensitive predicative rules that contain given items. In this work, we assume that only sensitive items are given and propose two algorithms, ISL (Increase Support of LHS) and DSR (Decrease Support of RHS), to modify data in database so that sensitive predicative rules containing specified items on the left hand side of rule cannot be inferred through association rule mining. Examples illustrating the proposed algorithms are given. The characteristics of the algorithms are analyzed. The efficiency of the proposed approach is further compared with Verykios etc [9,23] approach. It is shown that our approach required less number of databases scanning and prune more number of hidden rules. However, our approach must hide all rules containing the hidden items on the left hand side, where Verykios etc approach can hide any specific rule.

We do so within a framework of a General Data Mining Model (definition 4) which is a model for Data Mining viewed as a generalization process and sets standards for defining syntax and semantics and its relationship for any Data Mining method. In particular, we define the notion of truthfulness, or a degree of truthfulness of syntactic descriptions obtained by any classification algorithm, represented within the Semantic Classification Model by a classification operator. We use our framework to prove (theorems 1 and 3) that for any classification operator (method, algorithm) the set of all discriminant rules that are fully true form semantically the lower approximation of the class they describe. The set of characteristic rules describes semantically its upper approximation. Similarly, the set of all discriminant rules for a given class that are partially true is semantically equivalent to approximate lower approximation of the class. The notion of the approximate lower approximation extends to any classification operator (method, algorithm) the ideas first expressed in 1986 by Wong, Ziarko, Ye [9], and in the VPRS model of Ziarko [10].

Fuzzy c-means clustering model was developed for mining traffic flow-speed-occupancy relationships, then to extrapolate traffic information. The hybrid grey-based recurrent neural network (G-RNN) was developed for traffic parameter forecasting. G-RNN integrates grey modeling into recurrent neural networks that is capable of dealing with both randomness and spatial-temporal properties in trajfic data implicitly. Field data from Taiwan national freeway was used as an example for testing the proposed models. Study results were shown that the G-RNN model is capable of predicting traffic parameters with a high degree of accuracy. The application presents three clusters built from data and recognized three types of traffic conditions. Study results also showed feasibility of the method for advanced traffic information systems.

In this paper, we study several layered net surface (LNS) problems captured by an interesting type of geometric graphs called ordered multi-column graphs in the d-D discrete space (d >= 3). The LNS problems model the simultaneous detection of multiple mutually related surfaces in three or higher dimensional medical images. Although we prove that the d-D LNS problem (d >= 3) on a general ordered multi-column graph is NP-hard, the (special) ordered multi-column graphs that model medical image segmentation have the self-closure structures, and admit polynomial time exact algorithms for solving the LNS problems. Our techniques also solve the related net surface volume (NSV) problems of computing well-shaped geometric regions of an optimal total volume in a d-D weighted voxel grid. The NSV problems find applications in medical image segmentation and data mining. Our techniques yield the first polynomial time exact algorithms for several high dimensional medical image segmentation problems. The practical efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms are showcased by experiments based on real medical data.

In this paper, a more general statistical model for meta-analysis is proposed to integrate heterogeneous medical researches efficiently. The novel model, named mixture random effect model (MREM), is constructed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and unifies the existing fixed effect model and random effect model. The parameters of the proposed model are estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Not only can MREM discover underlying structure and intrinsic heterogeneity of meta datasets, but also can imply reasonable subgroup division. These merits embody the significance of our methods for heterogeneity assessment. Both simulation results and experiments on real medical datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed model.

However, constructing and maintaining a misuse detection system is very labor-intensive since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized, and the corresponding rules and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded Thus, data mining can be used to ease this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple-level hybrid classifier, an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers and clustering algorithms to detect intrusions. Performance of this new algorithm is compared to other popular approaches such as MWAM ID and 3-level tree classifiers, and significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate.

A quantitative presence of noise in a given dataset is often reflective of the quality of the data. Data noise is generally categorized into two groups: mislabeling errors (class noise) and attribute noise. In the literature, noise detection techniques such as Ensemble Filter, Partitioning Filter, Data Polishing, etc. have been proposed. However, several of these techniques lack adequate noise detection accuracy. In addition, they simply filter instances as noisy without providing a relative sense of noise among those instances. A novel approach for noise detection - Partitioning- and Rule-Based Filter is proposed. The approach functions by aggregating four unique mechanisms to achieve high-accuracy in noise detection and to provide a relative noise-based ranking of instances. These mechanisms include: repeated data partitioning, inclusive evaluation, un-weighted voting, and dual-two-class- classifiers. The proposed approach is evaluated using datasets obtained from the UCI data repository. Empirical studies with simulated (artificial) noise injected into clean or benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent noise detection performance - in many cases, a perfect or near-perfect performance is observed. In addition, the proposed approach depicted significantly better noise detection rates in detecting class noise than a proven existing approach, Partitioning Filter.

We propose a sparsified Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method for data distortion. We also put forth a few metrics to measure the difference between the distorted dataset and the original dataset.

Due to the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, machine learning and data mining methods have been widely employed to optimize the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). However, the results of existing work still need to be improved both in accuracy and in computational efficiency. In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning approach is presented for host-based intrusion detection using sequences of system calls. A Markov reward process model is introduced for modeling the behaviors of system call sequences and the intrusion detection problem is converted to predicting the value functions of the Markov reward process. A temporal different learning algorithm using linear basis functions is used for value function prediction so that abnormal temporal behaviors of host processes can be predicted accurately and efficiently. The proposed method has advantages over previous algorithms in that the temporal property of system call data is well captured in a natural and simple way and better intrusion detection performance can be achieved. Experimental results on the MIT system call data illustrate that compared with previous work, the proposed method has better detection accuracy with low training costs.

Modeling semi-structured data as labeled ordered trees, we present an efficient algorithm for discovering frequent substructures from a large collection of semi-structured data. By extending the enumeration technique developed by Bayardo (SIGMOD'98) for discovering long itemsets, our algorithm scales almost linearly in the total size of maximal tree patterns contained in an input collection depending mildly on the size of the longest pattern. We also developed several pruning techniques that significantly speed-up the search. Experiments on Web data show that our algorithm runs efficiently on real-life datasets combined with proposed pruning techniques in the wide range of parameters.

J	Feng, L; Lu, HJ				Feng, Ling; Lu, Hongjun			Managing Multiuser Database Buffers Using Data Mining Techniques	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multiuser database systems; Placement; Replacement; Prefetch; Data mining		In this paper, we propose a data-mining-based approach to public buffer management for a multiuser database system, where database buffers are organized into two areas - public and private. While the private buffer areas contain pages to be updated by particular users, the public buffer area contains pages shared among different users. Unlike traditional buffer management strategies where limited knowledge of user access patterns is used, the proposed approach discovers knowledge from page access sequences of user transactions and uses it to guide public buffer placement and replacement. A prefetch strategy is exploited based on the discovered page access knowledge. In practice, to make such a data-mining-based buffer management approach tractable, we present a soft variation to approximate our absolute best buffer replacement solution. The knowledge to be discovered and the discovery methods are discussed in the paper. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated through a simulation study. The results indicate that with the help of the discovered knowledge, the public buffer hit ratio can be improved significantly, while the added computational complexity, compared to the achievement in buffer hit ratio, is less. In some situations, the time cost of the data-mining-based buffer management policy is even lower than that of the simplest buffer management policy.

A set of transcription factors which bind to target sites regulate the gene transcription cooperatively. This motivates us to discover the site associations of known transcription factor binding sites and certain repetitive elements. Those over-represented repetitive elements in the promoter regions of functionally related genes are predicted as putative regulatory elements. The study is to analyze how the differential site associations of the known regulatory sites and putative regulatory elements are distributed in the promoter regions of groups of functionally related genes. The functional-specific site associations are discovered by a statistical approach and the over-represented repetitive elements involving in the site associations are possible to be transcription factor binding sites. The site associations facilitate to predict functional-specific putative regulatory elements and to identify genes potentially co-regulated by the putative regulatory elements. Our proposed approach is applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the promoter regions of yeast ORFs.

J	Aggarwal, CC				Aggarwal, CC			An efficient subspace sampling framework for high-dimensional data reduction, selectivity estimation, and nearest-neighbor search	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						high dimensions; dimensionality reduction; nearest-neighbor search; selectivity estimation		Data reduction can improve the storage, transfer time, and processing requirements of very large data sets. One of the challenges of designing effective data reduction techniques is to be able to preserve the ability to use the reduced format directly for a wide range of database and data mining applications. In this paper, we propose the novel idea of hierarchical subspace sampling in order to create a reduced representation of the data. The method is naturally able to estimate the local implicit dimensionalities of each point very effectively and, thereby, create a variable dimensionality reduced representation of the data. Such a technique is very adaptive about adjusting its representation depending upon the behavior of the immediate locality of a data point. An important property of the subspace sampling technique is that the overall efficiency of compression improves with increasing database size. Because of its sampling approach, the procedure is extremely fast and scales linearly both with data set size and dimensionality. We propose new and effective solutions to problems such as selectivity estimation and approximate nearest-neighbor search. These are achieved by utilizing the locality specific subspace characteristics of the data which are revealed by the subspace sampling technique.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM; Giles, K				Osei-Bryson, KM; Giles, K			An exploration of a set of entropy-based hybrid splitting methods for decision tree induction	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						data mining; decision trees; entropy; machine learning; splitting methods	CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS; CRITERIA	Decision tree (DT) induction is among the more popular of the data mining techniques. An important component of DT induction algorithms is the splitting method, with the most commonly used method being based on the Conditional Entropy family. However it is well known that there is no single splitting method that will give the best performance for all problem instances. In this paper, we develop and explore hybrid splitting methods from two entropy-based families: the Conditional Entropy family and another family that is based on the Class-Attribute Mutual Information (CAMI). We compare conventional splitting methods based on single measures with hybrid splitting methods based on multiple measures. The results suggest that the hybrid methods could be competitive in terms of classification accuracy and are thus worthy of future research.

In graph-theoretic terms, this lattice can be viewed as the lattice of maximal bicliques of the bipartite graph obtained by symmetrizing the object-attribute pairs of the input formal context. We find that a rooted breadth-first search decomposition of a graph-connected formal context leads to a closely related partition of the concept lattice, and we provide some details of this relationship. The main result is used to describe how the concept lattice can be unfolded, according to the information gathered during the breadth first search. We discuss potential uses of the results in data mining applications that employ concept lattices, specifically those involving association rules.

Use of objective measures of interestingness in popular data mining algorithms often leads to another data mining problem, although of reduced complexity. The reduction in the volume of the discovered rules is desirable in order to improve the efficiency of the overall KDD process. Subjective measures of interestingness are required to achieve this. In this paper we study novelty of the discovered rules as a subjective measure of interestingness. We propose a framework to quantify novelty of the discovered rules in terms of their deviations from the known rules. The computations are carried out using the importance that the user gives to different deviations. The computed degree of novelty is then compared with the user given threshold to report novel rules to the user. We implement the proposed framework and experiment with some public datasets. The experimental results are quite promising.

The agents are capable of data mining and cross-correlation tasks using online catalogues and databases and, if necessary, requesting additional data and follow-up observations from the telescopes on the network. We discuss how the agent technologies used in the eSTAR prototype have matured and have now been deployed in the field on research class telescopes that on first inspection don't fit into the autonomous robotic telescope paradigm.

The structure may contain high dimensional clusters that are related in complex ways. Furthermore, real data sets may contain several outliers. Vector quantization techniques has been successfully applied as a data mining tool. In particular the Neural Gas (NG) is a variant of the Self Organizing Map (SOM) where the neighborhoods are adaptively defined during training through the ranking order of the distance of prototypes from the given training sample. Unfortunately, the learning algorithm of the NG is sensitive to the presence of outliers as we will show in this paper Due to the influence of the outliers in the learning process, the topology of the employed network does not conserve the topology of the manifold of the data which is presented. In this paper we propose to robustify the learning algorithm where the parameter estimation process is resistant to the presence of outliers in the data. We call this algorithm Robust Neural Gas (RNG). We will illustrate our technique on synthetic and real data sets.

In our previous research, an attempt to optimize the ABCD formula using the LEM2 rule induction algorithm was successful. This time we decided to replace LEM2 by C4.5, a tree generating data mining system. The final conclusion is that, most likely, for C4.5 the original ABCD formula is already optimal and no further improvement is possible.

The first one is to download only a sample of each database. The second option is to mine each distributed database remotely and to download the resulting models to a central site and then aggregate these models. In this paper, we present an overview of the most common sampling techniques. We then present a new technique of distributed data-mining based on rule set models, where the aggregation technique is based on a confidence coefficient associated with each rule and on very small samples from each database. Finally, we present a comparison between the best sampling techniques that we found in the literature, and our approach of model aggregation.

It is a novel method to exploit fractal dimension to reduce dimension of feature spaces. The most famous one is the fractal dimension based feature selection algorithm FDR proposed by Traina Jr et al. This paper proposes an optimized algorithm, OptFDR, which scans the dataset only once and avoids the efficiency problems of multiple scanning large dataset in the algorithm FDR. The performance experiments are made for evaluating OptFDR algorithm using real-world image feature dataset and synthetic dataset with fractal characteristics. The experimental results show that OptFDR algorithm outperforms FDR algorithm.

Most Discretization methods are local and easy to lose valuable information under the situation of small samples. Moreover, features gathered to identify objects are often not all useful or equally informative and some of them may be redundant or irrelevant. In this paper, a hybrid and rough sets based method with inconsistency checking is presented to facilitate the discretization for continuous attributes and feature selection in evaluation. After a quick review on basic notions of rough sets, general procedures of the method are illustrated by an example, which shows the method's validity.

This emphasis has led to remarkable progress - current algorithms allow an incredibly rich and varied set of hidden patterns to be efficiently elicited from massive datasets, even under the burden of NP-hard problem definitions and disk-resident or distributed data. But this progress has come at a cost. In our single-minded drive towards maximum performance, we have often neglected and in fact hindered the important role of discovery in the knowledge discovery and data-mining (KDD) process. In this paper, I propose various strategies for applying constraints within algorithms for itemset and rule mining in order to escape this pitfall(1).

Based on the results of the polarisation operator technique of Bowman et al [10], we computed the dependence of joint entropy and mutual information estimates on the sample size in terms of asymptotic series. These expressions enabled us to control the bias of the estimates caused by finite sample sizes and obtain an expression for the accuracies. The result is important in data mining when joint entropy and mutual information are used to find interdependencies within large data sets with unknown underlying structures.

Chemical reactions are the main elements on which relies synthesis in organic chemistry, and this is why chemical reactions databases are of first importance. From a problem-solving process point of view, synthesis in organic chemistry must be considered at several levels of abstraction: mainly a strategic level where general synthesis methods are involved, and a tactic level where actual chemical reactions are applied. The research work presented in this paper is aimed at discovering general synthesis methods from chemical reaction databases in order to design generic and reusable synthesis plans. The knowledge discovery process relies on frequent levelwise itemset search and association rule extraction, but also on chemical knowledge involved within every step of the knowledge discovery process. Moreover, the overall process is supervised by an expert of the domain. The principles of this original experiment on mining chemical reaction databases and its results are detailed and discussed.

At the end of data mining process, we obtained clusters that have similar temperature trends. These clusters have been used to categorize Turkey into regions according to climatic characteristics. Statistical methods are widely used in meteorology; however they need extreme computing power. Data mining methods provide more performance and reliability than statistical methods.

Inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have had considerable success on a variety of multi-relational rule mining tasks, however, most ILP systems do not scale to very large datasets. In this paper we present two extensions to a popular ILP system, FOIL, that improve its scalability. (i) We show how to interface FOIL directly to a relational database management system. This enables FOIL to run on data sets that previously had been out of its scope. (ii) We describe estimation methods, based on histograms, that significantly decrease the, computational cost of learning a set of rules. We present experimental results that indicate that on a set of standard ILP datasets, the rule sets learned using our extensions are equivalent to those learned with standard FOIL but at considerably less cost.

Anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used, making many proposed data mining techniques less suitable. ADWICE (Anomaly Detection With fast Incremental Clustering) uses the first phase of the existing BIRCH clustering framework to implement fast, scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. We extend the original clustering algorithm and apply the resulting detection mechanism for analysis of data from IP networks. The performance is demonstrated on the KDD data set as well as on data from a test network at a telecom company. Our experiments show a good detection quality (95 %) and acceptable false positives rate (2.8 %) considering the online, real-time characteristics of the algorithm. The number of alarms is then further reduced by application of the aggregation techniques implemented in the Safeguard architecture.

We advocate that integrity constraints can be used in this context as an abstract concept to encompass common data mining tasks such as the detection of corrupted data or of patterns that contradict the expert beliefs. To illustrate this possibility we propose a form of constraints called association map constraints to specify authorized confidence variations among the association rules. These constraints are easy to read and thus can be used to write clear specifications. We also present experiments showing that their satisfaction can be tested in practice.

It is theoretically based on the Mode Directed Inverse Entailment and has several distinguishing features that makes it adequate for a wide range of applications. To search efficiently through large hypothesis spaces, IndLog uses original features like lazy evaluation of examples and Language Level Search. IndLog is applicable in numerical domains using the lazy evaluation of literals technique and Model Validation and Model Selection statistical-based techniques. IndLog has a MPI/LAM interface that enables its use in parallel or distributed environments, essential for Multi-relational Data Mining applications. Parallelism may be used in three flavours: splitting of the data among the computation nodes; parallelising the search through the hypothesis space and; using the different computation nodes to do theory-level search. IndLog has been applied successfully to major ILP literature datasets from the Life Sciences, Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Economics, Time-Series modelling to name a few.

Classification is driven by spatial association rules discovered at multiple granularity levels. Classification is probabilistic and is based on an extension of naive Bayes classifiers to multi-relational data. The method is implemented in a Data Mining system tightly integrated with an object relational spatial database. It performs the classification at different granularity levels and takes advantage from domain specific knowledge in form of rules that support qualitative spatial reasoning. An application to real-world spatial data is reported. Results show that the use of different levels of granularity is beneficial.

In order to meet high expectation on quality target, quick identification of root cause that makes defects is an essential issue. In this paper, we will refer to a typical algorithm of mining association rules and propose a novel interestingness measurement to provide an effective and accurate solution. First, the manufacturing defect detection problem of analyzing the correlation between combinations of machines and the result of defect is defined. Then, we propose an integrated processing procedure RMI (Root cause Machine Identifier) to discover the root cause in this problem. Finally, the results of experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of RMI are both well with real manufacturing cases.

These summaries enable more expensive analysis techniques to be applied efficiently with little loss in accuracy. Recent work in this area has resulted in the use of discrete linear algebraic transforms to construct such summaries efficiently. This paper addresses the problem of constructing summaries of distributed datasets. Specifically, the problem can be stated as follows: given a set of n discrete attributed vectors distributed across p sites, construct a summary of k << n vectors such that each of the input vectors is within given bounded distance from some output vector. In addition to being algorithmically efficient (i.e., must do no more work than corresponding serial algorithm), the distributed formulation must have low parallelization overheads. We present here, CONQUEST, a tool that achieves excellent performance and scalability for summarizing distributed datasets. In contrast to traditional parallel techniques that distribute the kernel operations, CONQUEST uses a less aggressive parallel formulation that relies on the principle of sampling to reduce communication overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, each individual site computes its local patterns independently. Various sites cooperate within dynamically orchestrated workgroups to construct consensus patters from these local patterns. Individual sites then decide to participate in the consensus or leave the group. Experimental results on a set of Intel Xeon servers demonstrate that this strategy is capable of excellent performance in terms of compression time, ratio, and accuracy with respect to postprocessing tasks. The communication overhead associated with CONQUEST is also shown to be minimal, making it ideally suited to wide-area deployment.

At the present time, the Google can index more than 3.3 billion pages and allows users to search the whole pages. Keeping pace with the intense expansion of information, a lot of studies have been researched to improve the quality of search results so that some algorithms capable of ranking web pages according to the concept of links such as HITS and PageRank were introduced Actually, search engines based on the web page ranking algorithm on the ground of the concept of links show much better performance than others. It is clear that the number of hits to a certain site can severely vary by positions in which a hyperlink to the site is situated and the size of the hyperlink Current text-based web robots can trace the position of certain contents within a file, but cannot within a web browser, which displays those contents. This paper introduces a system to analyze the position and size of hyperlinks displayed in web pages, and represents the analysis result of page views using a web data mining system that can analyze logs in order to survey utilization for certain web pages.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for mining association rules from relations. The new algorithm is an enhanced version of the SETM algorithm [3], and it reduces the number of candidate itemsets considerably. We implemented and evaluated the new algorithm on a parallel NCR Teradata database system. The new algorithm is much faster than the SETM algorithm, and its performance is quite scalable.

Besides, some data-mining algorithms can be implemented as Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications, which are composed of parallel, independent tasks. Due to its own nature, the adaptation of BoT applications for the grid is straightforward. In this sense, this work proposes a scheduling algorithm for running BoT data mining applications on grid platforms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by means of several experiments, and the obtained results show that it improves both scalability and performance of such applications.

And discretization based on rough set has some particular characteristics. Consistency need to be satisfied and cuts Set for discretization is expected to be as small as possible. Consistent and minimal discretization problem, is NP-complete. A genetic algorithm for consistent and minimal discretization of decision system is proposed. In the genetic algorithm, chromosome is represented as a binary string, whose length is the same as the number of the candidate cuts. The fitness function is designed elaborately and two weight factors are introduced into the definition of fitness function to handle the consistency and minimum. Experiments show that the algorithm is better than the greedy method and the famous ChiMerge method. The algorithm can solve the consistent and minimal discretization of decision system preferably.

Association rule mining searches for interesting relationships amongst items for a given dataset based mainly on the support and confidence measures. Support is used for filtering out infrequent rules, while confidence measures the implication relationships from a set of items to one another. However, one of the main drawbacks of the confidence measure is that it presents the absolute value of implication that does not reflect truthfully the relationships amongst items. For example, if two items have a very high frequency, then they will probably form a rule with a high confidence even if there is no relationship between them at all. In this paper, we propose a new measure known as relative confidence for mining association rules, which is able to reflect truthfully the relationships of items. The effectiveness of the relative confidence measure is evaluated in comparison with the confidence measure in mining interesting relationships between terms from textual documents and in associative classification.

Unfortunately, support vector machine (SVM) algorithms provide only the support vectors used as "black box" to efficiently classify the data with a good accuracy. This paper presents a cooperative approach using SVM algorithms and visualization methods to gain insight into a model construction task with SVM algorithms. We show how the user can interactively use cooperative tools to support the construction of SVM models and interpret them. A pre-processing step is also used for dealing with large datasets. The experimental results on Delve, Statlog, UCI and bio-medical datasets show that our cooperative tool is comparable to the automatic LibSVM algorithm, but the user has a better understanding of the obtained model.

J	Domingo-Ferrer, J; Torra, V				Domingo-Ferrer, J; Torra, V			Selecting potentially relevant records using re-identification methods	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						chance discovery; knowledge discovery in databases; data mining; multi-database mining; re-identification algorithms; record selection; record linkage	LINKAGE	This work proposes re-identification algorithms to select records that are interesting from the point of view of giving new information. Instead of focusing on re-identified elements, we focus on non re-identified records (non linked records) as they are the ones that potentially supply new and relevant information. Moreover, these relevant characteristics can correspond to chances for improving the knowledge of a system. To evaluate our approach, we have applied it to a example using publicly available data from the UCI repository. We have used the data of the ionosphere data, base to build a re-identification problem for 35 non-common variables. We show that the use of a simple heuristic rule base can effectively select potentially interesting records.

The proposed approach uses feature transformations and distance measures for content-based media access and similarity measurement. The first innovation is that distance space is visualised in a 3D user interface: 2D representations of media objects are shown on the image plane. The floor plane is used to show their distance relationships. Queries can interactively be defined by browsing through the 3D space and selecting media objects as positive or negative examples. Each selection operation defines hyper-clusters that are used for querying, and causes query execution and distance space adaptation in a background process. In order to help the user understanding distance space, descriptions are visualised in diagrams and associated with media objects. Changes in distance space are visualised by tree-like graphs. Furthermore, the user is enabled to select subspaces of distance space and select new distance metrics for them. This allows dealing with multiple similarity judgements in one retrieval process. The proposed components for visual data mining will be implemented in the visual information retrieval project VizIR. All VizIR components can be arbitrarily combined to sophisticated retrieval applications.

A desirable property of a classifier is noise tolerance. Emerging Patterns (EPs) are itemsets whose supports change significantly from one data class to another. In this paper, we first introduce Chi Emerging Patterns (Chi EPs), which are more resistant to noise than other kinds of EPs. We then use Chi EPs in a probabilistic approach for classification. The classifier, Bayesian Classification by Chi Emerging Patterns (BCCEP), can handle noise very well due to the inherent noise tolerance of the Bayesian approach and high quality patterns used in the probability approximation. The empirical study shows that our method is superior to other well-known classification methods such as NB, C4.5, SVM and JEP-C in terms of overall predictive accuracy, on "noisy" as well as "clean" benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Out of the 116 cases, BCCEP wins on 70 cases, NB wins on 30, C4.5 wins on 33, SVM wins on 32 and JEP-C wins on 21.

Detecting calcifications in mammograms is a difficult task because of their size and the high content of similar patterns in the image. This brings the necessity of creating automatic tools to find whether a mammogram presents calcifications or not. In this paper we introduce the combination of machine vision and data-mining techniques to detect calcifications (including micro-calcifications) in mammograms that achieves an accuracy of 92.6% with decision trees and 94.3% with a backpropagation neural network. We also focus in the data-mining task with decision trees to generate descriptive patterns based on a set of characteristics selected by our domain expert. We found that these patterns can be used to support the radiologist to confirm his diagnosis or to detect micro-calcifications that he could not see because of their reduced size.

We use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for the analysis of very large datasets. One example is the analysis of semiconductor fabrication process data, which demands very high performance in order to achieve acceptable simulation times. Our system consists of Processing Elements (PEs) working completely in parallel on the task of SOM simulation. We will show the scalability of the system concerning precision and number of PEs, as well as the flexibility of the system regarding size and shape of the simulated maps. The possibility of emulating virtual maps (one PE emulates more than one neuron) enables the computation of maps with more neurons than PEs. Benchmarking results of our FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based implementation of the system show the high performance of our accelerator.

The investigation generated improved association rules using the model described here. The evaluations showed that more association patterns were generated in which the algorithm for missing data was used; this suggested more rules generated than by simply ignoring them. This implies that the model offer more precise and important association rules that is more valuable when applied for business decision making. With the discovery of accurate association rules or business patterns, approach for better market plans can be prepared and implemented to improve marketing schemes. One best-related application of handling missing data is for detecting fraud or devious database entries.

In this paper, parallel pattern is proposed, which describes the movement trend patterns of mobile users. Parallel pattern aims to find out the trend of movement based on physical location as detected by the wireless access point. The performance testing of this paper shows that as the number of different mobile user increases, under random distribution, the number of parallel pattern found decreases. Therefore, it is important to adjust the size of the window depending on the amount of mobile users surrounding the particular wireless network access point.

These algorithms have been used to solve classification problems with millions of points. ASVM is perhaps the fastest among them. This paper compares a new projection-based SVM algorithm with ASVM on a selection of real and synthetic data sets. The new algorithm seems competitive in terms of speed and testing accuracy.

K-means requires several passes on the entire dataset, which can make it very expensive for large disk-resident datasets. In view of this, a lot of work has been done on various approximate versions of k-means, which, require only one or a,small number of passes on the entire dataset. In this paper we present a new algorithm which typically requires only, one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset, and provably produces the same cluster centers as reported by the original k-means algorithm. The algorithm uses sampling to create initial cluster centers, and then takes one or more passes over the entire dataset to adjust these cluster centers.. We provide theoretical analysis to show that the cluster centers thus reported are the same as the ones computed by the original k-means algorithm. Experimental results from a number of real and synthetic datasets show speedup between a factor of 2 and 4.5, as compared to k-means.

This paper describes one such extension, where database technology is used to implement path queries over a graph view of relational data. Partial-path information is pre-computed and stored in a compressed binary format in an SQL data type. Path querying is implemented using SQL table functions, thus enabling the retrieved path tables to be manipulated within SQL queries in the same way as standard relational tables. The functions are evaluated with particular reference to response time, storage requirements and shortest-path optimality, using road system data representing relationships between over 2.8 million entities.

In this paper, we propose a method, AOIWD, of acquiring ontology information from Web documents. The AOIWD method employs data mining techniques combined with inference engine techniques to develop ontology. One key feature of AOIWD is that it employs association rules and inference mechanism to create association instances of ontology classes. Another key feature of AOIWD is that it employs clustering to create ontology class hierarchy. The method can discover more meaningful relationships and has less human intervention.

Transactions in real-world applications, however, usually consist of quantitative values. This paper thus proposes a fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. A GA-based framework for finding membership functions suitable for mining problems is proposed. The fitness of each set of membership functions is evaluated using the fuzzy-supports of the linguistic terms in the large 1-itemsets and the suitability of the derived membership functions. The proposed framework thus maintains multiple populations of membership functions, with one population for one item's membership functions. The final best set of membership functions gathered from all the populations is used to effectively mine fuzzy association rules.

Some systems are not efficient enough because of the huge on-line computational demand. In this paper, we propose a personal documents recommendation system that effectively filters the on-line news on WWW for each individual user The proposed system recommends useful news 41, employing the profiling techniques of modified content- and collaborative-based filtering.

SPIE-DM consists of two phases: in Phase 1, we develop a Scalable and Portable IE method (SPIE) to extract the protein-protein interaction from the biomedical literature. These extracted protein-protein interactions form a scale-free network graph. In Phase 2, we apply a novel clustering method SFCluster to mine the protein-protein interaction network. The clusters in the network graph represent some potential protein complexes, which are very important for biologist to study the protein functionality. The clustering algorithm considers the characteristics of the scale-free network graphs and is based on the local density of the vertex and its neighborhood functions that can be used to rind more meaningful clusters at different density levels. The experiments of SPIE-DM on around 1600 chromatin proteins indicate that our system is very promising for extracting and mining from biomedical literature databases.

Most of previous studies on association rules are on mining intra- transaction association, which consider only relationship among the item in the same transaction. However, intra- transaction association rules are not a suitable for trend prediction. Therefore, inter- transaction association is introduced, which consider the relationship among itemset of multiple time instants. In this paper, we present PROWL, an efficient algorithm for mining inter-transaction rules. By using projected window method and depth first enumeration approach, we can discover all frequent patterns quickly. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic database shows that PROWL significantly outperforms previous method.

For window-sliding, Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping (DTW) are always used as subsequence matching, but they have the drawbacks of sensitivity and expensive computational load respectively. Recently, the model based method is introduced into the field of online pattern detection, especially, the segmental semi-Markov model shows better performance than sliding methods in many aspects. However, it has some limitations, e.g., it is difficult to estimate the parameters of the model, and nowaday methods are too rough, etc. In this paper the advanced segmental semi-Markov model is proposed to improve the existed segmental semi-Markov model. And it is successfully demonstrated on real data sets, including financial and medical data.

In this paper we adopt this principle to build classification models through interactively clustering a training data set to construct a tree of clusters. The leaf clusters of the tree are selected as decision clusters to classify new data based on a distance function. We consider the feature weights in calculating the distances between a new object and the center of a decision cluster. The new algorithm, W-k-means, is used to automatically calculate the feature weights from the training data. The Fastmap technique is used to handle outliers in selecting decision clusters. This step increases the stability of the classifier. Experimental results on public domain data sets have shown that the models built using this clustering approach outperformed some popular classification algorithms.

Automatic text extraction is a crucial stage for multimedia data mining. We present an artificial neural network(ANNs)-based approach for text extraction in complex images, which uses a combined method of ANNs and non-negative matrix factorization(NMF)-based filtering. An automatically constructed ANN-based classifier can increase recall rates for complex images with small amount of user intervention. NMF-based filtering enhances the precision rate without affecting overall performance. As a result, a combination of two learning mechanism leads to not only robust but also efficient text extraction.

Some of the systems are semiautomatic, requiring user input to begin processing, and others are fully automatic, producing output from the input corpus without guidance. For each Emerging Trend Detection (ETD) system we describe components including linguistic and statistical features, learning algorithms, training and test set generation, visualization, and evaluation. We also provide a brief overview of several commercial products with capabilities of detecting trends in textual data, followed by an industrial viewpoint describing the importance of trend detection tools, and an overview of how such tools are used. This review of the literature indicates that much progress has been made toward automating the process of detecting emerging trends, but there is room for improvement. All of the projects we reviewed rely on a human domain expert to separate the emerging trends from noise in the system. Furthermore, we discovered that few projects have used formal evaluation methodologies to determine the effectiveness of the systems being created. Development and use of effective metrics for evaluation of ETD systems is critical. Work continues on the semiautomatic and fully automatic systems we are developing at Lehigh University [HDD]. In addition to adding formal evaluation components to our systems, we are also researching methods for automatically developing training sets and for merging machine learning and visualization to develop more effective ETD applications.

The task of managing distributed and heterogeneous project knowledge is very important in increasing the knowledge assets of enterprises. Accordingly, this work presents a project-based knowledge map system to properly organize project knowledge into topic maps, from which users can obtain in-depth concepts to facilitate further project development. A two-phase data mining approach involving the ISO/ISEC 13250 topic maps and Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to establish the proposed system, which can determine knowledge patterns from previous projects and transform these patterns into a navigable knowledge map. The map can help users to locate required information and also offers subject-related information easily and rapidly over the Internet.

While there have been-a number of efficient moving sequential pattern mining algorithms reported, this paper concentrates on the maintenance of mined maximal moving sequential patterns. In particular, we developed an incremental approach, where maximal moving sequential patterns are stored in prefix trees, and new moving sequences can be easily combined with the existing patterns. A performance study indicated that the proposed approach performs significantly faster than straightforward approaches that mine from the whole updated database.

An important application of spatial data mining methods is the extraction of knowledge from a Geographic Information System (GIS). INGENS (INductive GEographic iNformation System) is a prototype GIS which integrates data mining tools to assist users in their task of topographic map interpretation. The spatial data mining process is aimed at a user who controls the parameters of the process by means of a query written in a mining query language. In this paper, we present SDMOQL (Spatial Data Mining Object Query Language), a spatial data mining query language used in INGENS, whose design is based on the standard OQL (Object Query Language). Currently, SDMOQL supports two data mining tasks: inducing classification rules and discovering association rules. For both tasks the language permits the specification of the task-relevant data, the kind of knowledge to be mined, the background knowledge and the hierarchies, the interestingness measures and the visualization for discovered patterns. Some constraints on the query language are identified by the particular mining task. The syntax of the query language is described and the application to a real repository of maps is briefly reported.

On the other hand, a statistical user is inclined to data mining, that is, to disclose pieces of information that are implicit in the (explicit) answers to his queries. A key task for both is to find data that is derivable from given summary statistics. We show that this task is easy if data is additive and the set of given summary statistics can be modelled by a graph.

Rule extraction overcomes a major disadvantage of neural networks which is concerned with making the comprehensibilty of the learned internal model more open to scrutiny. Having extracted the symbolic rules we show how they are assessed and ranked for interesting or novel features. Two such techniques are presented here, the first is a data driven approach that uses objective mathematical measures to identify interesting patterns or features. The second is a goal driven method that uses subjective measures obtained from the user. The measures are applied to rules extracted from RBF neural networks trained on several data sets including benchmark sets from the UCI repository and a large real-world industrial data set.

These two reasoning patterns start from some general knowledge about reality, expressed by true implication, "if Phi then Psi". Then basing on true premise Phi we arrive at true conclusion Psi (MP), or from negation of true conclusion Psi we get negation of true premise Phi (MT). In reasoning from data (data mining) we also use rules "if Phi then Psi'', called decision rules, to express our knowledge about reality, but in this case the meaning of the expression is different. It does not express general knowledge but refers to partial facts. Therefore decision rules are not true or false but probable (possible) only. In this paper we compare inference rules and decision rules in the context of decision networks, proposed by the author as a new approach to analyze reasoning patterns in data.

This is realized by applying personalization techniques to the well-known concept of Web Directories. The Web directory is viewed as a concept hierarchy which is generated by a content-based document clustering method. Personalization is realized by constructing community models on the basis of usage data collected by the proxy servers of an Internet Service Provider. For the construction of the community models, a new data mining algorithm, called Community Directory Miner, is used. This is a simple cluster mining algorithm which has been extended to ascend a concept hierarchy, and specialize it to the needs of user communities. The data that are mined present a number of peculiarities such as their large volume and semantic diversity. Initial results presented in this paper illustrate the use of the methodology and provide an indication of the behavior of the new mining method.

The main goal is to reduce the call dropping probability and the call blocking probability and to maximize the bandwidth utilization. Mining the previous movements of the mobile users, generates local and global profiles, which are utilized effectively in prediction of the future path of the mobile user. This scheme is based on high level of prediction of the next base stations for the mobile user. The simulation is used to compare the performance of the proposed technique with other two techniques: FR-CAT2 and PR-CAT4. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a significantly better performance (in average about 25%) compared to the other two schemes.

In this technique, the behavior of the user is recorded over a period of time and analyzed to generate the mobility models (profiles) of the users. The generated mobility models are used to predict the future movement of the users in order to perform the call admission and the resource reservation. A local mobility model can be generated for the individual user and a global mobility model can be generated for a group of users. We used the combination between the local and the global mobility; models to compare the performance of this technique with other techniques. In this paper, we focus on studying the performance of PCAC-RR technique comparing three types of mobility models: 1) the local mobility model only, 2) the global mobility model only, and 3) the combination between local and global mobility models. Also, in this paper we explain the simulation environment in details and how to study the performance of the presented technique using each of these mobility models. Simulation results show that using the hierarchical structure of local and global mobility, models improves the performance significantly.

As an example, the analysis of frequent patterns in biomedical observations could allow to perform diagnosis and/or prognosis. Moreover, the efficient discovery of frequent patterns may play an important role in several data mining tasks such as association rule discovery, clustering and classification. However, in order to identify interesting repetitions, it is necessary to allow errors in the matching patterns; in this context, it is difficult to select one pattern particularly suited to represent the set of similar ones, whereas modelling this set with a single model could be more effective. In this paper we present an approach for deriving representative models in a time series. Each model represents a set of similar patterns in the time series. The approach presents the following peculiarities: (i) it works on discretized time series but its complexity does not depend on the cardinality of the alphabet exploited for the discretization; (ii) derived models allow to express the distribution of the represented patterns; (iii) all interesting models are derived in a single scan of the time series. The paper reports the results of some experimental tests and compares the proposed approach with related ones.

There is a huge amount of data that can help to solve many of these problems. However, data is geographically distributed in various locations and belongs to several organizations. Furthermore, it is stored in different kind of systems and it is represented in many formats. In this paper, different techniques have been studied to make easier the data mining process in a distributed environment. Our approach proposes the use of grid to improve the data mining process due to the features of this kind of systems. In addition, we show a flexible architecture that allows data mining applications to be dynamically configured according to their needs. This architecture is made up of generic, data grid and specific data mining grid services.

Different from most current MMORPGs, the new scheme tries to bridge the gap between a real social world with a virtual RPG social world by introducing social relationship, social structure, and avatar personality into the game play. Adaptation of social network analysis to MMORPG virtual world design is also discussed. The objective is to increase a game's long term appeal to players. Moreover, the paper also proposes a method to use data mining technique for intelligently selecting dynamically synthesized tasks so that the tasks will be most likely interesting to the players. The paper represents an endeavor to forge a common research ground for virtual world game design, social network analysis, artificial intelligence, and traditional data mining research.

B	Shi, Y; Zhang, AD		Hatzopoulos, M; Manolopoulos, Y		Shi, Y; Zhang, AD			A shrinking-based dimension reduction approach for multi-dimensional data analysis	16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management	JUN 21-23, 2004	Santorini, GREECE	Emporiki Bank, Microsoft, Alpha Bank				In this paper we present continuous research on data analysis based on our previous work on the shrinking approach. Shrinking[2] is a novel data preprocessing technique which optimizes the inner structure of data inspired by the Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation[1] in the real world. It can be applied in many data mining fields. Following our previous work on the shrinking method for multidimensional data analysis in full data space, we propose a shrinking-based dimension reduction approach which tends to solve the dimension reduction problem from a new perspective. In this approach data are moved along the direction of the density gradient, thus making the inner structure of data more prominent. It is conducted on a sequence of grids with different cell sizes. Dimension reduction process is performed based on the difference of the data distribution projected on each dimension before and after the data-shrinking process. Those dimensions with dramatic variation of data distribution through the data-shrinking process are selected as good dimension candidates for further data analysis. This approach can assist to improve the performance of existing data analysis approaches. We demonstrate how this shrinking-based dimension reduction approach affects the clustering results of well known algorithms.

B	Silva, IR; Souza, JN; Santos, KS		Bernardino, J; Desai, BC		Silva, IR; Souza, JN; Santos, KS			Dependence among terms in vector space model	INTERNATIONAL DATABASE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS 04)	JUL 07-09, 2004	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Inst Super Engenharia Coimbra, Univ Coimbra, Ctr Informat & Syst, Oracle Portugal, Byte Press, Camara Municipal Coimbra, Crit Software, S A, IEEE Comp Soc				The vector space model is a mathematical-based model that represents terms, documents and queries by vectors and provides a ranking. In this model, the subspace of interest is formed by a set of pairwaise orthogonal term vectors, indicating that terms are mutually independent. However, this is a simplification that doesn't correspond to the reality. Based on this scenery, we present, in this work, an extension to the vector space model to take into account the correlation between terms. In the proposed model, term vectors are rotated in space geometrically reflecting the dependence semantics among terms. We rotate terms based on a data mining technique called association rules. The retrieval effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated and the results shows that our model improves in average precision, relative to the standard vector space model, for all collections evaluated, leading to a gain up to 31%.

This representation enables recognition to proceed successfully despite changes in scale, viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. Vector quantization of these descriptors then enables efficient matching on the scale of an entire feature film. We show two applications. The first is to efficient object retrieval where the technology of text retrieval, such as inverted file systems, can be employed at run time to return all shots containing the object in a manner, and with a speed, similar to a Google search for text. The object is specified by a user outlining it in an image, and the object is then delineated in the retrieved shots. The second application is to data mining. We obtain the principal objects, characters and scenes in a video by measuring the reoccurrence of these spatial configurations of viewpoint covariant regions. The applications are illustrated on two full length feature films.
