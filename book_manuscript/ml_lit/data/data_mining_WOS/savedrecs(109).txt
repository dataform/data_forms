J	Grzymala-Busse, JW; Grzymala-Busse, WJ; Goodwin, LK				Grzymala-Busse, JW; Grzymala-Busse, WJ; Goodwin, LK			A comparison of three closest fit approaches to missing attribute values in preterm birth data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								One of the main problems of data mining is imperfection of input data. Such data may be uncertain, vague, and incomplete. In our data set, describing preterm birth, many attribute values were missing, that is, the input data set was incomplete. The main approach to solving the missing attribute value problem was based on a closest fit: a missing attribute value in a case was replaced by the existing attribute value in the best candidate, a case that fits as closely as possible (resembles the most) the case with the missing attribute value. We experimented with three methods based on the idea of the closest fit: looking for the best candidate among the set of all cases, among the cases that belong to the same concept (cases within the same class as the case with missing attribute values), and a special method, where the set of all attributes was restricted to a single attribute with the missing attribute value. In the last method, the missing attribute value was replaced by the most common value within the concept for symbolic attributes, and by the average value of all attribute values of the same concept for numerical attributes.

J	Li, ST				Li, ST			A web-aware interoperable data mining system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; interoperability; distributed object computing; self-organizing map networks	ORGANIZING NEURAL NETWORKS; PARADIGM; MAP	The development of web-aware data mining systems has received a a eat deal of attention in recent years. It plays a key enabling role for competitive businesses in the E-commerce era. One of the challenges in developing web-aware data mining systems is to integrate and coordinate existing data mining applications in a seamless manner so that cost-effective systems can be developed without the need of costly proprietary products. In this paper we present an approach for developing an interoperable web-aware data mining system to achieve this purpose. This approach applies Remote Method Invocation and high level code wrapper of Java distributed object computing to address the issues of interoperability in heterogeneous environments, which includes programming language, platform, and visual object model. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through the integration and enhancement of the two well-known standalone data mining tools, SOM_PAK and Nenet, and runs with the iris data and air pollution data.

A (rectangular) tiling of A is a collection of rectangular portions. A[l...r, t...b], called tiles, such that no two tiles overlap e h entry A[i, j] is contained in a tile. The weight of a tile is the sum of all array entries in it. In the MAX-MIN problem, we are given a weight bound W and our goal is to find a tiling such that (a) each tile is of weight at least W (the MIN condition) and (b) the number of tiles is maximized (the MAX condition). In the MIN-MAX problem, we are given a weight bound W again and our goal is to find a tiling such that (a) each tile has weight at most W and (b) the number of tiles is minimized. These two basic problems have many variations depending on the weight functions, whether some areas of A must not be covered, or whether some portion of A may be discarded, etc. These problems are not only natural combinatorial problems, but also arise in a plethora of applications, e.g., in databases and data mining, video compression, load balancing, building index structures, manufacturing and so forth. Both the above tiling problems (as well as all of their variations relevant to this paper) axe known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present approximations algorithms for solving these problems based on epicurean methods : variations of a basic slice-and-dice technique. Surprisingly, these simple algorithms yield small constant factor approximations for all these problems. For some of the problems, our results are the first known approximations; for others, our results improve the known algorithms significantly in approximation bounds and/or running time. Of independent interest are the tight bounds we show for sizes of the binary space partition trees for isothetic rectangles.

This approach finds patterns in one or more sequences that precede the occurrence of patterns in other sequences, with respect to user-specified constraints. In addition to the traditional frequency and support constraints in sequential data mining, this approach uses separate antecedent and consequent inclusion constraints. Moreover, separate antecedent and consequent maximum window widths are used to specify the antecedent and consequent patterns that are separated by the maximum time lag. We use multiple time series drought risk management data to show that our approach can be effectively employed in real-life problems. The experimental results validate the superior performance of our method for efficiently finding relationships between global climatic episodes and local drought conditions. We also compare our new approach to existing methods and show how they complement each other to discover associations in a drought risk management decision support system.

These tools routinely visit 10(3) to 10(5) fully simulated circuit solution candidates. What might we do, with all this circuit data? We show how to adapt recent ideas from large-scale data mining to build models that capture significant regions of this visited performance space, parameterized by variables manipulated by synthesis, trained by the data points visited during synthesis. Experimental results show that we can automatically build useful nonlinear regression models for large analog design spaces.

These objects, informally defined as "aggregated data" because they synthesize information concerning a group of individuals of a population, ensure confidentiality of original data, nevertheless they pose new problems which finds a solution in symbolic data analysis. A by-product of working with aggregate data is the possibility of dealing with data from complex questionnaires, where multiple answers are possible or constraints among different answers exists. Comparing SOs is an important step of symbolic data analysis. It can be useful either to cluster some SOs or to discriminate between them, or even to order SOs according to their degree of generalization. This paper presents a comparative study aiming at evaluating the degree of dissimilarity between the objects of a restricted class of symbolic data, namely Probabilistic Symbolic Objects. To define a ground truth for the empirical evaluation, a data set with understandable and explainable properties has been selected. In the experiment, only two dissimilarity measures, among the seven ones we have studied, seems to have a more stable behaviour.

To analyze the scientific and engineering components of Medical Informatics. A clear characterization of these components should be undertaken to categorize different areas of Medical Informatics and create a research agenda for the future. Methods: We have adapted a classical ACM and IEEE report on computing to analyze Medical Informatics from three different viewpoints: Theory, Abstraction, and Design. Results. We suggest that Medical Informatics can be considered from these three perspectives: (1) Theory, from which medical informaticians formally characterize the properties of the objects of study, creating new theories or using and adopting existing theories (e.g., from mathematics), (2) Abstraction, from which medical informaticians deal with all aspects of medical information and create new abstractions, methods, and technology-independent models, which can be experimentally verified, and (3) Design, from which medical informaticians develop systems or act as information brokers or advisors between medical and technology professionals, to improve the quality of computer applications in medicine. Conclusion. Based on this framework, we suggest that Medical Informatics has an independent scientific character, different from other applied informatics areas.

We propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) based on the wrapper approach to discover the best subset of attributes for a given classification algorithm, namely C4.5, a well-known decision-tree algorithm. The two objectives to be minimized are the error rate and the size of the tree produced by C4.5. The proposed GA is a multi-objective method in the sense that it discovers a set of non-dominated solutions (attribute subsets), according to the concept of Pareto dominance.

This work extends the tree representation of GP to evolve multiple comprehensible IF-THEN classification rules. In the paper, we introduce a concept mapping technique for fitness evaluation of individuals. A covering algorithm that employs an artificial immune system-like memory vector is utilized to produce multiple rules as well as to remove redundant rules. The proposed GP classifier is validated upon nine benchmark datasets and the simulation results confirm the viability and effectiveness of the GP approach for solving data mining problems in a wide spectrum of application domains.

Using a data set from a large tertiary care hospital, we provide strong empirical evidence that data enhancement by the introduction of new attributes along with judicious aggregation of existing attributes results in higher quality knowledge discovery. Interestingly, we also found that there is a differential impact of data set enhancements on the performance of different mining algorithms. We define and use several measures including entropy, rule complexity, and resonance to evaluate the quality and usefulness of knowledge discovered.

J	Gluck, M				Gluck, M			Multimedia exploratory data analysis for geospatial data mining: The case for augmented seriation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; MAPS	The amount of spatial data collected from satellites, aerial photography, and land-based stations continues to grow at astounding rates. In this article, the role of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for spatial data mining is reviewed and a case study addressing environmental risk assessments in New York State is presented to illustrate the feasibility and usability of augmenting seriation for spatial data analysis. For this project, seriation, a univariate EDA technique, is augmented with a class of multimedia tools including iconic matrices, choropleth mapping, graphic interactions, and sound to exploit spatial datasets to better understand the relationships among spatial, temporal, and human variables. Additional software enhancements such as three-dimensional matrices, multivariate choropleth mapping, and tonal sonification are proposed to further improve these user-based tools for spatial data analysis.

J	Cook, DJ; Holder, LB; Galal, G; Maglothin, R				Cook, DJ; Holder, LB; Galal, G; Maglothin, R			Approaches to parallel graph-based knowledge discovery	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article								The large amount of data collected today is quickly overwhelming researchers' abilities to interpret the data and discover interesting patterns. Knowledge discovery and data mining systems contain the potential to automate the interpretation process, but these approaches frequently utilize computationally expensive algorithms. In particular, scientific discovery systems focus on the utilization of richer data representation, sometimes without regard for scalability. This research investigates approaches for scaling a particular knowledge discovery-data mining system, SUBDUE, using parallel and distributed resources. SUBDUE has been used to discover interesting and repetitive concepts in graph-based databases from a variety of domains, but requires a substantial amount of processing time. Experiments that demonstrate scalability of parallel versions of the SUBDUE system are performed using CAD circuit databases, satellite images, and artificially-generated databases, and potential achievements and obstacles are discussed.

In such databases, similarity queries in the form of range queries or k-nearest-neighbor queries are the most important query types. In traditional query processing, single queries are issued independently by different users. In many data mining applications, however, the database is typically explored by iteratively asking similarity queries for answers of previous similarity queries. In this paper, we introduce a generic scheme for such data mining algorithms and we investigate two orthogonal approaches, reducing I/O cost as well as CPU cost, to speed-up the processing of multiple similarity queries. The proposed techniques apply to any type of similarity query and to an implementation based on an index or using a sequential scan. Parallelization yields an additional impressive speed-up. An extensive performance evaluation confirms the efficiency of our approach.

Researchers have extensively studied clustering since it arises in many application domains in engineering and social sciences. In the last years the availability of huge transactional and experimental data sets and the arising requirements for data mining created needs for clustering algorithms that scale and can be applied in diverse domains. This paper surveys clustering methods and approaches available in literature in a comparative way. It also presents the basic concepts, principles and assumptions upon which the clustering algorithms are based. Another important issue is the validity of the clustering schemes resulting from applying algorithms. This is also related to the inherent features of the data set under concern. We review and compare clustering validity measures available In the literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the issues that are under-addressed by the recent algorithms and we address new research directions.

These techniques assume that the similarity matrix for the data set under consideration is symmetric. However there are many interesting problems where asymmetric proximities arise, like text mining problems are. In this work we propose modified versions of SOM and SM to deal with data where the proximity matrix is asymmetric. The algorithms are tested using a real document database, and performance is reported using appropriate measures. As a result, the asymmetric algorithms proposed outperform their symetric counterparts.

This goal is accomplished through an analysis of net primary production of phytomass (NPP), which is used to classify the Siberian ecoregions into compact and cohesive NPP performance classes. Rough Sets (RS) analysis is used as a data mining methodology for the evaluation of the Siberian forest database. In order to interpret relationships between various forest characteristics, relationships known as interesting rules are generated on a basis of a reduced problem description.

We show that the hypergraphs of all multiple and all partial transversals are dual- bounded in the sense that in both cases, the size of the dual hypergraph is bounded by a polynomial in the cardinality and the length of description of the input hypergraph. Our bounds are based on new inequalities of extremal set theory and threshold logic, which may be of independent interest. We also show that the problems of generating all multiple and all partial transversals of an arbitrary hypergraph are polynomial-time reducible to the well-known dualization problem of hypergraphs. As a corollary, we obtain incremental quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for both of the above problems, as well as for the generation of all the minimal Boolean solutions for an arbitrary monotone system of linear inequalities. Thus, it is unlikely that these problems are NP-hard.

PCA is frequently used in data mining applications. This paper considers PCA in the context of the emerging network-based computing environments. It offers a technique to perform PCA from distributed and heterogeneous data sets with relatively small communication overhead. The technique is evaluated against different data sets, including a data set for a web mining application. This approach is likely to facilitate the development of distributed clustering, associative link analysis, and other heterogeneous data mining applications that frequently use PCA.

Existing systems that employ this approach are anomaly detectors, meaning that they model a program's normal behavior and signal deviations from that behavior. Unfortunately, many program-based exploits of NT systems use specialized malicious executables. Anomaly detection systems cannot deal with such programs because there is no standard of "normalcy" that they deviate from. This paper is a preliminary report on an attempt to remedy that situation. We report on a prototype system that learns to identify specific program behaviors. Though the goal is to identify malicious behavior, in this paper we report on experiments seeking to identify the behavior of the web-browser, since we did not have enough exemplars of malicious behavior to use as training data. Using automatically generated finite automata, we search for features in execution traces that allow us to distinguish browsers from other programs. In our experiments, we find that this technique does, in fact, allow us to distinguish traces Internet Explorer from traces of programs that are not web browsers, after training with Netscape and a different set of non-browsers.

The platforms can be very general, e.g., ships, planes, robots, land based facilities, etc. Potential foes the platforms deal with can also be general. This paper describes data mining activities related to development of the resource manager with a focus on genetic algorithm based optimization. A genetic algorithm requires the construction of a fitness function, a function that must be maximized to give optimal or near optimal results. The fitness functions are in general non-differentiable at many points and highly non-linear, neither property providing difficulty for a genetic algorithm. The fitness functions are constructed using insights from geometry, physics, engineering, and military doctrine. Examples are given as to how fitness functions are constructed including how the fitness function is averaged over a database of military scenarios. The use of a database of scenarios prevents the algorithm from having too narrow a range of behaviors, i.e., it creates a more robust solution.

This paper investigates the generic modelling of these rules and the utility of deriving rules from the results of other data mining routines, that it;, mining from rulesets (or meta-mining). It is argued that this approach has three significant advantages. Firstly, with the expansion of dataset size, the tractability of mining from the complete dataset may be difficult on a regular basis, secondly, changes in observations (and therefore in the observed system) call be more easily discovered by inspecting changes in extracted rules over time (or over any other sequential progression), and finally, the nature of the rules extracted by this process are that they contain different higher order semantics from that exhibited by first order discovery process. We argue that, in many cases, such rules are closer to the sorts of rule frequently used to describe everyday phenomena.

J	Cheung, DW; Xiao, YQ				Cheung, DW; Xiao, YQ			Effect of data distribution in parallel mining of associations	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						association rules; data mining; data skewness; workload balance; parallel mining; parallel computing		Association rule mining is an important new problem in data mining. It has crucial applications in decision support and marketing strategy. We proposed an efficient parallel algorithm for mining association rules on a distributed share-nothing parallel system. Its efficiency is attributed to the incorporation of two powerful candidate set pruning techniques. The two techniques, distributed and global prunings, are sensitive to two data distribution characteristics: data skewness and workload balance. The prunings are very effective when both the skewness and balance are high. We have implemented FPM on an IBM SP2 parallel system. The performance studies show that FPM outperforms CD consistently, which is a parallel version of the representative Apriori algorithm (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994). Also, the results have validated our observation on the effectiveness of the two pruning techniques with respect to the data distribution characteristics. Furthermore, it shows that FPM has nice scalability and parallelism, which can be tuned for different business applications.

The proposed belief network contains hidden variables that play a role similar to nodes in decision trees and each of their states either corresponds to a class label or to a single attribute test. As a major difference with respect to decision trees, the selection of the attribute to be tested is probabilistic. Thus, the model can be used to assess the probability that a tuple belongs to some class, given the predictive attributes. Unfolding the network along the hidden states dimension yields a trellis structure having a signal flow similar to second order connectionist networks. The network encodes context specific probabilistic independencies to reduce parametric complexity. We present a custom tailored inference algorithm and derive a teaming procedure based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. We propose decision trellises as an alternative to decision trees in the context of tuple categorization in databases, which is an important step for building data mining systems. Preliminary experiments on-standard machine learning databases are reported, comparing the classification accuracy of decision trellises and decision trees induced by C4.5. In particular, we show that the proposed model can offer significant advantages for sparse databases in which many predictive attributes are missing.

Both problems need to be addressed in a generic manner, since the stated requirements of end-users cover a range of data mining paradigms, DBMS, and (parallel) platforms. In this paper we present a family of generic, set-based, primitive operations for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We show how a number of well-known KDD classification metrics, drawn from paradigms such as Bayesian classifiers, Rule-Induction/Decision Tree algorithms, Instance-Based Learning methods, and Genetic Programming, can all be computed via our generic primitives. We then show how these primitives may be mapped into SQL and, where appropriate, optimised for good performance in respect of practical factors such as client-server communication overheads. We demonstrate how our primitives can support C4.5, a widely-used rule induction system. Performance evaluation figures are presented for commercially available parallel platforms, such as the IBM SP/2. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Scott, PD; Wilkins, E				Scott, PD; Wilkins, E			Evaluating data mining procedures: techniques for generating artificial data sets	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; artificial data sets; pseudo-random generators		In this article, we discuss the need to evaluate the performance of data mining procedures and argue that tests done with real data sets cannot provide all the information needed for a thorough assessment of their performance characteristics. We argue that artificial data sets are therefore essential. After a discussion of the desirable characteristics of such artificial data, we describe two pseudo-random generators. The first is based on the multi-variate normal distribution and gives the investigator full control of the degree of correlation between the variables in the artificial data sets. The second is inspired by fractal techniques for synthesizing artificial landscapes and can produce data whose classification complexity can be controlled by a single parameter. We conclude with a discussion of the additional work necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of a method of matching data sets to the most appropriate data mining technique.

Using Monte-Carlo simulations, it takes into account all the potential causes of blackouts, slow and fast dynamics, and modeling uncertainties. A large number of scenarios are simulated in parallel by time-domain numerical integration, and the relevant parameters of the resulting system trajectories are stored in a database. Data-mining tools are used to identify the most important system weaknesses and possible improvements. The approach is tested on a large-scale study on the South-Eastern part of the extra-high-voltage system of Electricite de France. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regarding spatially referenced data, analysis by means of data mining can be aptly complemented by visual exploration of the data presented on maps as well as by cartographic visualization of results of data mining procedures. We propose an integrated environment for exploratory analysis of spatial data that equips an analyst with a variety of data mining tools and provides the service of automated mapping of source data and data mining results. The environment is built on the basis of two existing systems, Kepler for data mining and Descartes for automated knowledge-based visualization. It is important that the open architecture of Kepler allows to incorporate new data mining tools, and the knowledge-based architecture of Descartes allows to automatically select appropriate presentation methods according to characteristics of data mining results. The paper presents example scenarios of data analysis and describes the architecture of the integrated system.

The main goals achieved are the low effort spent in parallelizing the code, the machine independence of the application produced, source code portability and performance portability.

Evolutionary search is used for learning polynomials represented as non-linear multivariate trees. Optimal search performance is pursued with balancing the statistical bias and the variance of iGP. We reduce the bias by extending the set of basis polynomials for better agreement with the examples. Possible overfitting due to the reduced bias is conteracted by a variance component, implemented as a regularizing factor of the error in an MDL fitness function. Experimental results demonstrate that regularized iGP discovers accurate, parsimonious, and predictive polynomials when trained on practical data mining tasks.

The matter of 'making sense' or 'understanding' is described in terms of knowing three types of relationships and being able to keep such knowledge in mind. The paper argues that both matters, obtaining the knowledge, and keeping it in mind, available for use, would be facilitated by mapping the N-dimensional space to 2-dimensional space or 3-dimensional space, in a topologically meaningful manner. A 'ratio-conserving' mapping procedure is described and compared with some other previously proposed methods. A body of 5-dimensional semiconductor materials composition and properties data is used for illustration purposes. Three types of 'meaning' are discussed and it is shown that 'ratio-conserving' mapping does provide a way of obtaining and retaining a visualization of the meaning of large bodies of complex multivariate data.

The number of resulting intervals obtained by discretization depends only on the data; the number of groups corresponds to the number of classes. Since both discretization and grouping is done with respect to the goal classes, the algorithms are suitable only for classification/prediction tasks. As a side effect of the off-line processing, the number of objects in the datasets and number of attributes may be reduced. It should be also mentioned that although the original idea of the discretization procedure is proposed to the KEX system, the algorithms show good performance together with other machine learning algorithms.

This paper proposes instead a tightly coupled architecture, where data mining is integrated within a classical SQL server. The premise of this work is a SQL-like operator, called MINE RULE, introduced in a previous paper. We show how the various syntactic features of the operator can be managed by either a SQL engine or a classical data mining engine; our main objective is to identify the border between typical relational processing, executed by the relational server, and data mining processing, executed by a specialized component. The resulting architecture exhibits portability at the SQL level and integration of inputs and outputs of the data mining operator with the database, and provides the guidelines for promoting the integration of other data mining techniques and systems with SQL servers.

In this paper, we consider a range of criteria which may be applied to determine if some data should be segmented into two or regions. We develop a information theoretic criterion (MML) for the segmentation of univariate data with Gaussian errors. We perform simulations comparing segmentation methods (MML, AIC, MDL and BIG) and conclude that the MML criterion is the preferred criterion. We then apply the segmentation method to financial time series data.

This causes difficulty for users to find relevant pieces of information on the Web. Search engines and robots (spiders) are two popular techniques developed to address this problem. Search engines are indexing facilities over searchable databases. As the Web continues to expand, search engines are becoming redundant because of the large number of Web pages they return for a single search. Robots are similar to search engines; rather than indexing the Web, they traverse (''walk through'') the Web, analyzing and storing relevant documents. The main drawback of these robots is their high demand on network resources that results in networks being overloaded. This paper proposes an alternate way in assisting users in finding information on the Web. Since the Web is made up of many Web servers, instead of searching all the Web servers, we propose that each server does its own housekeeping. A software agent named SiteHelper is designed to act as a housekeeper for the Web server and as a helper for a Web user to find relevant information at a particular site. In order to assist the Web user finding relevant information at the local site, SiteHelper interactively and incrementally learns about the Web user's areas of interest and aids them accordingly. To provide such intelligent capabilities, SiteHelper deploys enhanced HCV with incremental learning facilities as its learning and inference engines. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

While Bayesian networks and Markov networks from probabilistic graphical modelling are well-known for a couple of years, the field of possibilistic graphical modelling occurs as a new promising area of research. Possibilistic networks provide an alternative approach compared to probabilistic networks, whenever it is necessary to model uncertainty and imprecision as two different kinds of imperfect information. Imprecision in the sense of set-valued data has often to be considered in situations where data are obtained from human observations or non-precise measurement units. In this contribution we present a comparison of the background and perspectives of probabilistic and possibilistic graphical models, and give an overview on the current state of the art of possibilistic networks with respect to propagation and learning algorithms, applicable to data mining and data fusion problems.

Relationships and patterns within this data could provide new medical knowledge. Unfortunately, few methodologies have been developed and applied to discover this hidden knowledge. In this study, the techniques of data mining (also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases) were used to search for relationships in a large clinical database. Specifically, data accumulated on 3,902 obstetrical patients were evaluated for factors potentially contributing to preterm birth using exploratory factor analysis. Three factors were identified by the investigators for further exploration. This paper describes the processes involved in mining a clinical database including data warehousing, data query and cleaning, and data analysis.

The semantics is illustrated on a real-world application requiring such reasoning. Optimizations and approximations of the semantics are shown so as to make the semantics amenable to very large scale real-world applications, We finally prove that the semantics is probabilistic and reduces to the usual fixpoint semantics of stratified Datalog if all information is certain. We implemented various knowledge discovery systems which automatically generate such probabilistic decision rules. In collaboration with a bank in Hong Kong we use one such system to forecast currency exchange rates.		WUTHRICH, B (reprint author), HONG KONG UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,KOWLOON,HONG KONG.						APT K.

J	Christen, P				Christen, Peter			A Survey of Indexing Techniques for Scalable Record Linkage and Deduplication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data linkage; data matching; entity resolution; index techniques; blocking; experimental evaluation; scalability	BLOCKING; SPACE	Record linkage is the process of matching records from several databases that refer to the same entities. When applied on a single database, this process is known as deduplication. Increasingly, matched data are becoming important in many application areas, because they can contain information that is not available otherwise, or that is too costly to acquire. Removing duplicate records in a single database is a crucial step in the data cleaning process, because duplicates can severely influence the outcomes of any subsequent data processing or data mining. With the increasing size of today's databases, the complexity of the matching process becomes one of the major challenges for record linkage and deduplication. In recent years, various indexing techniques have been developed for record linkage and deduplication. They are aimed at reducing the number of record pairs to be compared in the matching process by removing obvious nonmatching pairs, while at the same time maintaining high matching quality. This paper presents a survey of 12 variations of 6 indexing techniques. Their complexity is analyzed, and their performance and scalability is evaluated within an experimental framework using both synthetic and real data sets. No such detailed survey has so far been published.

Data Mining of Protein-Binding Profiling Data Identifies Structural Modifications that Distinguish Selective and Promiscuous Compounds	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							ACTIVITY-CLIFFS; ACTIVITY LANDSCAPES; CHEMOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS; SMALL MOLECULES; DRUG DISCOVERY; CHEMICAL SPACE; LIBRARIES; DIVERSITY; COMPLEXITY; INHIBITORS	Activity profiling of compound collections across multiple targets is increasingly being used in probe and drug discovery. Herein, we discuss an approach to systematically analyzing the structure-activity relationships of a large screening profile data with emphasis on identifying structural changes that have a significant impact on the number of proteins to which a compound binds. As a case study, we analyzed a recently released public data set of more than 15 000 compounds screened across 100 sequence-unrelated proteins. The screened compounds have different origins and include natural products, synthetic molecules from academic groups, and commercial compounds. Similar synthetic structures from academic groups showed, overall, greater promiscuity differences than do natural products and commercial compounds. The method implemented in this work readily identified structural changes that differentiated highly specific from promiscuous compounds. This approach is general and can be applied to analyze any other large-scale protein-binding profile data.

Owing to the non-linear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, visual inspection and interpretation of these signals are tedious, time-consuming, error-prone, and subjected to inter-observer variabilities. Therefore, several Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) based studies have adopted non-linear techniques to study the normal, interictal, and ictal activities in EEGs. In this paper, we present a novel automatic technique based on data mining for epileptic activity classification. In order to compare our study with the results of relative studies in the literature, we used the widely used benchmark dataset from Bonn University for evaluation of our proposed technique. Hundred samples each in normal, interictal, and ictal categories were used. We decomposed these segments into wavelet coefficients using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), and extracted eigenvalues from the resultant wavelet coefficients using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Significant eigenvalues, selected using the ANOVA test, were used to train and test several supervised classifiers using the 10-fold stratified cross validation technique. We obtained 99% classification accuracy using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier. The proposed technique is capable of classifying EEG segments with clinically acceptable accuracy using less number of features that can be extracted with less computational cost. The technique can be written as a software application that can be easily deployed at a low cost and used with almost no expert training. We foresee that this software can, in the future, evolve into an efficient adjunct tool that cannot only classify epileptic activities in EEG signals but also automatically monitor the onset of seizures and thereby aid the doctors in providing better and timely care for the patients suffering from epilepsy.

Both certain and uncertain rules are unraveled from different regions partitioned by approximations. In real-life applications, an information system may evolve with time by different factors such as attributes, objects, and attribute values. How to update approximations efficiently becomes vital in data mining related tasks. Dominance-based rough set approaches deal with the problem of ordinal classification with monotonicity constraints in multi-criteria decision analysis. Data missing frequently appears in the Incomplete Ordered Decision Systems (IODSs). Extended dominance characteristic relation-based rough set approaches process the IODS with two cases of missing data, i.e., "lost value" and "do not care". This paper focuses on dynamically updating approximations of upward and downward unions while attribute values coarsening or refining in the IODS. Under the extended dominance characteristic relation based rough sets, it presents the principles of dynamically updating approximations w.r.t. attribute values' coarsening and refining in the IODS and algorithms for incremental updating approximations of an upward union and downward union of classes. Comparative experiments from datasets of UCI and empirical results show the proposed method is efficient and effective in maintenance of approximations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ji, JC; Pang, W; Zhou, CG; Han, X; Wang, Z				Ji, Jinchao; Pang, Wei; Zhou, Chunguang; Han, Xiao; Wang, Zhe			A fuzzy k-prototype clustering algorithm for mixed numeric and categorical data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy clustering; Data mining; Mixed data; Dissimilarity measure; Attribute significance		In many applications, data objects are described by both numeric and categorical features. The k-prototype algorithm is one of the most important algorithms for clustering this type of data. However, this method performs hard partition, which may lead to misclassification for the data objects in the boundaries of regions, and the dissimilarity measure only uses the user-given parameter for adjusting the significance of attribute. In this paper, first, we combine mean and fuzzy centroid to represent the prototype of a cluster, and employ a new measure based on co-occurrence of values to evaluate the dissimilarity between data objects and prototypes of clusters. This measure also takes into account the significance of different attributes towards the clustering process. Then we present our algorithm for clustering mixed data. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by a series of experiments on four real world datasets in comparison with that of traditional clustering algorithms.

J	Gomez, JC; Boiy, E; Moens, MF				Gomez, Juan Carlos; Boiy, Erik; Moens, Marie-Francine			Highly discriminative statistical features for email classification	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Email classification; Feature extraction; Feature selection	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; SPAM; MACHINE; LSA	This paper reports on email classification and filtering, more specifically on spam versus ham and phishing versus spam classification, based on content features. We test the validity of several novel statistical feature extraction methods. The methods rely on dimensionality reduction in order to retain the most informative and discriminative features. We successfully test our methods under two schemas. The first one is a classic classification scenario using a 10-fold cross-validation technique for several corpora, including four ground truth standard corpora: Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, PU1, and a subset of the TREC 2007 spam corpus, and one proprietary corpus. In the second schema, we test the anticipatory properties of our extracted features and classification models with two proprietary datasets, formed by phishing and spam emails sorted by date, and with the public TREC 2007 spam corpus. The contributions of our work are an exhaustive comparison of several feature selection and extraction methods in the frame of email classification on different benchmarking corpora, and the evidence that especially the technique of biased discriminant analysis offers better discriminative features for the classification, gives stable classification results notwithstanding the amount of features chosen, and robustly retains their discriminative value over time and data setups. These findings are especially useful in a commercial setting, where short profile rules are built based on a limited number of features for filtering emails.

J	Diosan, L; Rogozan, A; Pecuchet, JP				Diosan, Laura; Rogozan, Alexandrina; Pecuchet, Jean-Pierre			Improving classification performance of Support Vector Machine by genetically optimising kernel shape and hyper-parameters	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification problems; Kernel of kernels; Multiple kernel; SVM; Hyper-parameters optimisation; Hybrid model; Genetic programming	MODEL SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION; NETWORKS; MATRIX; BOUNDS; ERROR	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications and are now established as one of the standard tools for machine learning and data mining. A key problem of these methods is how to choose an optimal kernel and how to optimise its parameters. The real-world applications have also emphasised the need to consider a combination of kernels-a multiple kernel-in order to boost the classification accuracy by adapting the kernel to the characteristics of heterogeneous data. This combination could be linear or non-linear, weighted or un-weighted. Several approaches have been already proposed to find a linear weighted kernel combination and to optimise its parameters together with the SVM parameters, but no approach has tried to optimise a non-linear weighted combination. Therefore, our goal is to automatically generate and adapt a kernel combination (linear or non-linear, weighted or un-weighted, according to the data) and to optimise both the kernel parameters and SVM parameters by evolutionary means in a unified framework. We will denote our combination as a kernel of kernels (KoK). Numerical experiments show that the SVM algorithm, involving the evolutionary kernel of kernels (eKoK) we propose, performs better than well-known classic kernels whose parameters were optimised and a state of the art convex linear and an evolutionary linear, respectively, kernel combinations. These results emphasise the fact that the SVM algorithm could require a non-linear weighted combination of kernels.

In the past, consumers were divided into those who rely on agents and those who do not. In this study, we use two processes (pre-process and post-process) to select suitable rules, and to explore into the relationship among attributes. In the pre-process, we utilized factor analysis (FA) to choose the variable and rough set theory (RST) that found decision table to construct the decision rules, and approach to data mining and knowledge discovery based on information flow distribution in a flow graph. The post-process applies the formal concept analysis (FCA) from these suitable rules to explore the attribute relationship and the most important factors affecting the preference of customers for deciding whether to choose companies or agents. The degree of the customers' dependence on agents was affected by the TCA, customer satisfaction and loyalty. The principal findings were that the different degrees of dependence of customers have various characteristics. The RST and FCA were two complementary mathematical tools for data analysis. Following an empirical analysis, we use two hit testes that incorporate 30 and 36 validated sample object into the decision rule. The hitting rate of two testes, were reached 90%. The results of the empirical study indicate that the generated decision rules can cover most new objects. Consequently, we believe that the result can be fully applied in financial research.

J	Tsai, CF; Cheng, KC				Tsai, Chih-Fong; Cheng, Kai-Chun			Simple instance selection for bankruptcy prediction	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Instance selection; Outlier detection; Data mining; Bankruptcy prediction; Clustering	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OUTLIER DETECTION; ALGORITHMS; MODEL	Instance selection or outlier detection is an important task during data mining, which focuses on filtering out bad data from a given dataset. However, there is no rigid mathematical definition of what constitutes an outlier and an outlier is not a binary property. Therefore, different volumes of outliers may be detected depending on the setting of the threshold for what constitutes an outlier, e.g., the distance in distance-based outlier detection. In this study, we examine bankruptcy prediction performance achieved after removal of different outlier volumes from four widely used datasets, namely the Australian, German, Japanese, and UC Competition datasets. Specifically, a simple distance-based clustering outlier detection method is used. In addition, four popular classification techniques are compared, artificial neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines. Experiments are conducted to examine (1) the prediction performance of the bankruptcy prediction models with and without instance selection, (2) the stability of bankruptcy prediction models after the removal of outliers from the testing set, and (3) the characteristics of these four different datasets. The results show that with the German dataset it is much more difficult for the prediction models to provide high rates of accuracy after outlier removal, while it is easier with the UC Competition dataset. Removing 50% of the outliers can lead to optimal performance of these four models. In addition, using the removed outliers to test the prediction accuracy of these models, we find that it is support vector machines (SVM) that provide the highest rate of prediction accuracy and perform with much more stability and good noise tolerance than the other three prediction models. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the SVM model followed by instance selection is similar to the one without instance selection (i.e., the SVM baseline). In other words, the difference in performance between the SVM and the SVM baseline is the least of the three models in comparison with their corresponding baselines. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Czarnowski, I				Czarnowski, Ireneusz			Cluster-based instance selection for machine classification	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; Data mining; Instance selection; Multi-agent system	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; PROTOTYPE REDUCTION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS	Instance selection in the supervised machine learning, often referred to as the data reduction, aims at deciding which instances from the training set should be retained for further use during the learning process. Instance selection can result in increased capabilities and generalization properties of the learning model, shorter time of the learning process, or it can help in scaling up to large data sources. The paper proposes a cluster-based instance selection approach with the learning process executed by the team of agents and discusses its four variants. The basic assumption is that instance selection is carried out after the training data have been grouped into clusters. To validate the proposed approach and to investigate the influence of the clustering method used on the quality of the classification, the computational experiment has been carried out.

Taking a very broad view, we use the term information mining to refer to the organization and analysis of structured or unstructured data that can be quantitative, textual, and/or pictorial in nature. The key question, in our view, is, "How can we transform data (in the very broad sense of this term) into 'actionable knowledge', knowledge that we can use in pursuit of a specified objective(s)." After detailing a set of key components of information mining, we introduce each of the papers in this volume and detail the focus of their contributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As predictive performance evaluation is a multidimensional problem, single scalar summaries such as error rate, although quite convenient due to its simplicity, can seldom evaluate all the aspects that a complete and reliable evaluation must consider. Due to this, various graphical performance evaluation methods are increasingly drawing the attention of machine learning, data mining, and pattern recognition communities. The main advantage of these types of methods resides in their ability to depict the trade-offs between evaluation aspects in a multidimensional space rather than reducing these aspects to an arbitrarily chosen (and often biased) single scalar measure. Furthermore, to appropriately select a suitable graphical method for a given task, it is crucial to identify its strengths and weaknesses. This paper surveys various graphical methods often used for predictive performance evaluation.

J	Tsumoto, S; Hirano, S				Tsumoto, Shusaku; Hirano, Shoji			Detection of risk factors using trajectory mining	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Trajectory clustering; Multiscale comparison; Temporal data mining	SCALE-SPACE	This paper proposes a method for grouping trajectories as two-dimensional time-series data. Our method employed a two-stage approach. Firstly, it compared two trajectories based on their structural similarity, and determines the best correspondence of partial trajectories. Then, it calculated the value-based dissimilarity for the all pairs of matched segments, and outputs their total sum as the dissimilarity of two trajectories. We evaluated this method on two data sets. Experimental results on the Australia sign language dataset and chronic hepatitis dataset demonstrate that our method could capture the structural similarity between trajectories even in the presence of noise and local differences, and could provide better proximity for discriminating objects.

J	Wu, CM; Huang, YF				Wu, Chieh-Ming; Huang, Yin-Fu			Generalized association rule mining using an efficient data structure	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Generalized association rules; Frequent itemsets; Frequent closed itemsets; FCET; GMAR; GMFI	DATABASES	The goal of this paper is to use an efficient data structure to find the generalized association rules between the items at different levels in a taxonomy tree under the assumption that the original frequent itemsets and association rules were generated in advance. The primary challenge of designing an efficient mining algorithm is how to make use of the original frequent itemsets and association rules to directly generate new generalized association rules, rather than rescanning the database. In the paper, we used an efficient data structure called the frequent closed enumeration table (FCET) to store the relevant information. It stores only maximal itemsets, and can be used to derive the information of the subset itemsets in a maximal itemset through a hash function. In the proposed algorithms GMAR and GMFI, we used join methods and/or pruning techniques to generate new generalized association rules. Through several comprehensive experiments, we found that both algorithms are much better than BASIC and Cumulate algorithms also using the efficient data structure (FCET), owing to fewer candidate itemsets generated by GMAR and GMFI. Furthermore, the GMAR algorithm prunes a large amount of irrelevant rules based on the minimum confidence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using data mining techniques for multi-diseases prediction modeling of hypertension and hyperlipidemia by common risk factors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Health evaluation center; Cardiovascular disease; Multi-feature selection; MARS	BLOOD-PRESSURE	Many previous studies have employed predictive models for a specific disease, but fail to note that humans often suffer from not only one disease, but associated diseases as well. Because these associated multiple diseases might have reciprocal effects, and abnormalities in physiological indicators can indicate multiple associated diseases, common risk factors can be used to predict the multiple associated diseases. This approach provides a more effective and comprehensive forecasting mechanism for preventive medicine. This paper proposes a two-phase analysis procedure to simultaneously predict hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Firstly, we used six data mining approaches to select the individual risk factors of these two diseases, and then determined the common risk factors using the voting principle. Next, we used the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method to construct a multiple predictive model for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. This study uses data from a physical examination center database in Taiwan that includes 2048 subjects. The proposed analysis procedure shows that the common risk factors of hypertension and hyperlipidemia are Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Triglycerides, Uric Acid (UA), Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT), and gender. The proposed multi-diseases predictor method has a classification accuracy rate of 93.07%. The results of this paper provide an effective and appropriate methodology for simultaneously predicting hypertension and hyperlipidemia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The resulting algorithm takes into account the distribution of energy deposit induced by ionising particles and a damage probability function that depends on the total energy deposit amount. Proton track simulations were carried out in small micrometric volumes representing small DNA containments. The algorithm was used to determine the damage concentration clusters and thus to deduce the DSB/SSB ratios created by protons between 500 key and 50 MeV. The obtained results are compared to other calculations and to available experimental data of fibroblast and plasmid cells irradiations, both extracted from literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A process will be controlled based on information obtained during or after a process, including metrology values of wafers. Those metrology values, however, are usually available for only a small fraction of sampled wafers. In order to overcome the limitation, one can use virtual metrology (VM) to predict metrology values of all wafers, based on sensor data from production equipments and actual metrology values of sampled wafers. In this paper, we develop VM prediction models using various data mining techniques. We also develop a VM embedded R2R control system using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme. The experiments consist of two parts: (1) verifying VM prediction models with actual production equipments data, and (2) conducting simulations of the R2R control system. Our VM prediction models are found to be accurate enough to be directly implemented in actual manufacturing processes. The simulation results show that the VM embedded R2R control system improves productivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, P; Zhu, QS				Yang, Peng; Zhu, Qingsheng			Finding key attribute subset in dataset for outlier detection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Key attribute subset; Outlying reduction; Data mining; High dimensional dataset	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; FUZZY-ROUGH SETS; REDUCTION; SYSTEMS	Detection of outlier from high dimensional dataset have found important applications in many fields, yet the unexpected time consumption is likely to hinder its practical use. Thus, it makes sense to build an efficient method for finding meaningful outliers and analyzing their intentional knowledge. In this paper, we utilize the concept of rough set to construct a method for outlying reduction, based on an outlier detection and analysis system. By defining outlying partition similarity, we can mine outliers on the key attribute subset rather than on the full dimensional attribute set of dataset, as long as the similarity between outlying partitions produced on them is large enough. For this purpose, we propose a novel method for finding the key attribute subset in dataset, which starts by seeking all outliers on the full attribute set, and then searches through all outlying attribute subsets for these points. After that, it turns out to be able to determine the key attribute subset in accordance with the similarity between outlying partitions. By experiments, we show that our method allows more efficient seeking of key attribute subset than the previous methods, thereby improving the feasibility of outlier detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

How to identify variables related to patient safety among accumulated data has been viewed as a main issue. The purpose of this study was to identify critical factors related to patient falls through the application of data mining to available data through a hospital information system. Method: Data on a total of 725 patient falls were obtained from a web-based nursing incident reporting system at a medical center in Taiwan. In the process of data mining, feature selection was applied as the first step, after which 10 critical factors were selected to predict the dependent variables (injury versus non-injury). An artificial neural network (ANN) analysis was applied to develop a predictive model and a multivariate stepwise logistic regression was performed for comparison purposes. Results: The ANN model produced the following results: a Receiver-Operating-Character (ROC) curve indicated 77% accuracy, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 68%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 72%; while the multivariate stepwise logistic regression only identified 3 variables (fall assessment, anti-psychosis medication and diuretics) as significant predictors with ROC curve of 42%, PPV of 26.24%, and NPV of 87.12%. Conclusion: In addition to medication use such as anti-psychotic and diuretics, nursing intervention where a fall assessment is conducted could represent a critical factor related to outcomes of fall incidence.

We extend such classifiers to handle data with uncertain information. Value uncertainty arises in many applications during the data collection process. Example sources of uncertainty include measurement/quantization errors, data staleness, and multiple repeated measurements. With uncertainty, the value of a data item is often represented not by one single value, but by multiple values forming a probability distribution. Rather than abstracting uncertain data by statistical derivatives (such as mean and median), we discover that the accuracy of a decision tree classifier can be much improved if the "complete information" of a data item (taking into account the probability density function (pdf)) is utilized. We extend classical decision tree building algorithms to handle data tuples with uncertain values. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show that the resulting classifiers are more accurate than those using value averages. Since processing pdfs is computationally more costly than processing single values (e.g., averages), decision tree construction on uncertain data is more CPU demanding than that for certain data. To tackle this problem, we propose a series of pruning techniques that can greatly improve construction efficiency.

If the hospitalization rate of a hemodialysis center is high, its service quality will be low. Therefore, decreasing hospitalization rate is a crucial problem for health care centers. This study combines temporal abstraction with data mining techniques for analyzing dialysis patients' biochemical data to develop a decision support system. The mined temporal patterns are helpful for clinicians to predict hospitalization of hemodialysis patients and to suggest immediate treatments to avoid hospitalization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Various techniques have been developed with great successes on dealing with missing values in data sets with homogeneous attributes (their independent attributes are all either continuous or discrete). This paper studies a new setting of missing data imputation, i.e., imputing missing data in data sets with heterogeneous attributes (their independent attributes are of different types), referred to as imputing mixed-attribute data sets. Although many real applications are in this setting, there is no estimator designed for imputing mixed-attribute data sets. This paper first proposes two consistent estimators for discrete and continuous missing target values, respectively. And then, a mixture-kernel-based iterative estimator is advocated to impute mixed-attribute data sets. The proposed method is evaluated with extensive experiments compared with some typical algorithms, and the result demonstrates that the proposed approach is better than these existing imputation methods in terms of classification accuracy and root mean square error (RMSE) at different missing ratios.

J	Dorn, M; de Souza, ON				Dorn, Marcio; de Souza, Osmar Norberto			A3N: An artificial neural network n-gram-based method to approximate 3-D polypeptides structure prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						A3N; 3-D protein structure prediction; Pattern recognition; Data mining	PROTEIN-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; DATA-BANK; SIMULATION; RECOGNITION; DATABASE; ROSETTA; CHAIN; LINUS	A long standing problem in computational molecular biology is to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of a protein when only a sequence of amino acids residues is given. Some protein structure prediction methods utilize structural information from protein templates in order to build the structure of unknown proteins. Examining structural protein motifs in detail is highly difficult since the task of mapping from a local sequence of amino acid residues to a local 3-D protein structure is very complex. This study presents a new statistical fragment-based method to acquire structural information from small protein template samples (A3N - Artificial Neural Network n-gram-based). Structural data obtained from protein templates were used in order to train an artificial neural network. Afterwards, approximative 3-D polypeptides structures are built through the use of a sequence-to-structure mapping function. The efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated in four case studies of polypeptides whose sizes vary from 19 to 34 amino acids residues. As indicated by the RMSD values and Ramachandran Plot values, the results show that the predicted structures adopt a fold similar to the experimental structures. Thus, they can be used as input structures in refinement methods based on molecular mechanics (MM), e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The search space is expected to be greatly reduced and the ab initio methods can demand a much reduced computational time to achieve a more accurate polypeptide structure. We also discuss the results, future works and limitations of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kurt, A; Oktay, AB				Kurt, Atakan; Oktay, Aye Betuel			Forecasting air pollutant indicator levels with geographic models 3 days in advance using neural networks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						SO(2); CO; PM(10); Neural networks; Air pollution; Air quality; Forecasting; Prediction; Data mining; Geographic forecasting; Spatial classification; Environmental expert systems	PREDICTION	An early warning system for air quality control requires an accurate and dependable forecasting of pollutants in the air. In this study methods based on geographic forecasting models using neural networks (GFM_NN) are presented. The air pollutant data from 10 different air quality monitoring stations in Istanbul was used in forecasting sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM(10)) levels 3 days in advance for the Besiktas district. Daily meteorological forecasts as well as the air pollutant indicator values were used as input to feed-forward back-propagation neural networks. The experimental verification of the models was conducted in one-year period between August 2005 and August 2006. The observed and forecasted bands were used to compute the forecasting error. The simplest geographic model proposed uses the observed air pollution indicator values from a selected neighboring district. Where as the second model uses two neighboring districts instead of one. A third model considers the distance between the triangulating districts and the district whose air pollutant level is being forecasted. Each model is tested with at least two different sets of sites. The findings are quite satisfactory. When the right neighboring districts are chosen, the geographic models always yield lower error than non-geographic models. The distance-based geographic model produces considerably lower error than the non-geographic plain model. We argue that models proposed here can be used in urban air pollution forecasting.

J	Weber, RJM; Viant, MR				Weber, Ralf J. M.; Viant, Mark R.			MI-Pack: Increased confidence of metabolite identification in mass spectra by integrating accurate masses and metabolic pathways	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Metabolite identification; Mass error; Data mining	SPECTROMETRY DATA; ASSIGNMENT; NETWORKS; FORMULAS	Metabolite identification is of central importance to metabolomics as it provides the route to new knowledge. Automated identification of the thousands of peaks detected by high resolution mass spectrometry is currently not possible, largely due to the finite mass accuracy of the spectrometer and the complexity that one peak can be assigned to one or more empirical formula(e) and each formula maps to one or more metabolites. Biological samples are not, however, composed of random metabolite mixtures, but instead comprise of thousands of compounds related through specific chemical transformations. Here we evaluate if prior biological knowledge of these transformations can improve metabolite identification accuracy. Our identification algorithm - which uses metabolite interconnectivity from the KEGG database to putatively identify metabolites by name - is based on mapping an experimentally-derived empirical formula difference for a pair of peaks to a known empirical formula difference between substrate-product pairs derived from KEGG, termed transformation mapping (TM). To maximize identification accuracy, we also developed a novel semi-automated method to calculate a mass error surface associated with experimental peak-pair differences. The TM algorithm with mass error surface has been extensively validated using simulated and experimental datasets by calculating false positive and false negative rates of metabolite identification. Compared to the traditional identification method of database searching accurate masses on a single-peak-by-peak basis, the TM algorithm reduces the false positive rate of identification by >4-fold, while maintaining a minimal false negative rate. The mass error surface, putative identification of metabolite names, and calculation of false positive and false negative rates collectively advance and improve upon related previous research on this topic [1, 2]. We conclude that inclusion of prior biological knowledge in the form of metabolic pathways provides one route to more accurate metabolite identification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shen, JJ; Ren, JM				Shen, Jau-Ji; Ren, Jia-Min			A robust associative watermarking technique based on vector quantization	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Association rules; Digital image; Digital watermarking; Vector quantization (VQ)	IMAGE WATERMARKING; ALGORITHM; COMPRESSION; DOMAIN	In this paper, the concepts of vector quantization (VQ) and association rules in data mining are employed to propose a robust watermarking technique. Unlike ordinary or traditional watermarking techniques, our approach hides association rules of the watermark, instead of the whole watermark: in other words, the embedded information is the association rules of the watermark. First. VQ encoding is performed on the original image and watermark to generate the index tables, and from which association rules are further mined. Subsequently, by embedding the association rules of the watermark into the association rules of the original image, the purpose for watermarking is accomplished. Finally, VQ decoding technique is applied to reconstruct the watermarked image from the watermarked index table. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves effective resistance against several image processings such as blurring, sharpening, adding in Gaussian noise, cropping, and JPEG lossy compression. Moreover, the embedding capacity is also significantly increased, so any a complex watermark image is still acceptable in this method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Shi, Y				Shi, Yong			Multiple criteria optimization-based data mining methods and applications: a systematic survey	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Multi-criteria programming; Fuzzy programming; Regression; Credit scoring; Bioinformatics; Network intrusion detection; Bankruptcy prediction	CREDIT CARDHOLDER BEHAVIOR; FINANCIAL RATIOS; CLASSIFICATION; SVM; PREDICTION; BANKRUPTCY; MODELS	Support Vector Machine, an optimization technique, is well known in the data mining community. In fact, many other optimization techniques have been effectively used in dealing with data separation and analysis. For the last 10 years, the author and his colleagues have proposed and extended a series of optimization-based classification models via Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (MCLP) and Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP). These methods are different from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to review the basic concepts and frameworks of these methods and promote the research interests in the data mining community. According to the evolution of multiple criteria programming, the paper starts with the bases of MCLP. Then, it further discusses penalized MCLP, MCQP, Multiple Criteria Fuzzy Linear Programming (MCFLP), Multi-Class Multiple Criteria Programming (MCMCP), and the kernel-based Multiple Criteria Linear Program, as well as MCLP-based regression. This paper also outlines several applications of Multiple Criteria optimization-based data mining methods, such as Credit Card Risk Analysis, Classification of HIV-1 Mediated Neuronal Dendritic and Synaptic Damage, Network Intrusion Detection, Firm Bankruptcy Prediction, and VIP E-Mail Behavior Analysis.

J	Loekito, E; Bailey, J; Pei, JA				Loekito, Elsa; Bailey, James; Pei, Jian			A binary decision diagram based approach for mining frequent subsequences	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sequential pattern mining; Frequent subsequences; Binary decision diagram; Sequence binary decision diagram; SeqBDD	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; MANIPULATION; CONSTRAINTS; SEQUENCES; GROWTH; TREE	Sequential pattern mining is an important problem in data mining. State of the art techniques for mining sequential patterns, such as frequent subsequences, are often based on the pattern-growth approach, which recursively projects conditional databases. Explicitly creating database projections is thought to be a major computational bottleneck, but we will show in this paper that it can be beneficial when the appropriate data structure is used. Our technique uses a canonical directed acyclic graph as the sequence database representation, which can be represented as a binary decision diagram (BDD). In this paper, we introduce a new type of BDD, namely a sequence BDD (SeqBDD), and show how it can be used for efficiently mining frequent subsequences. A novel feature of the SeqBDD is its ability to share results between similar intermediate computations and avoid redundant computation. We perform an experimental study to compare the SeqBDD technique with existing pattern growth techniques, that are based on other data structures such as prefix trees. Our results show that a SeqBDD can be half as large as a prefix tree, especially when many similar sequences exist. In terms of mining time, it can be substantially more efficient when the support is low, the number of patterns is large, or the input sequences are long and highly similar.

The first is a method for explaining classifiers' predictions, which provides the user with additional information about the decision-making process of a classifier. The second is a reliability estimation methodology for regression predictions, which helps the users to decide to what extent to trust a particular prediction. Both methods are successfully applied to a novel breast cancer recurrence prediction data set and the results are evaluated by expert oncologists.

Application of Data Mining on Partial Discharge Part I: Predictive Modelling Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article						Partial discharge; data mining; neural network; self-organizing map; support vector machine	SOLID INSULATION SYSTEMS; ADVANCED PD INFERENCE; ON-FIELD MEASUREMENTS; NEURAL NETWORK; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; NOISE	Innovations in computer technology have made possible continuous on-line monitoring of partial discharge (PD) activities. The power industry aims to assess the condition of power system equipment through on-line monitoring of PD activities. This involves long-term continuous data recording and it is very difficult to extract useful information from such a large amount of raw data, particularly if it is done manually. Instead, data mining can be applied in solving this problem. Data mining can be categorized into predictive modelling and descriptive modelling. In this paper, work was mainly focused on predictive data mining, which is classification of PD. The back propagation neural network (BPN), self-organizing map (SOM) and support vector machine (SVM) were used for classification and compared. Results indicate SVM is the best method in terms of classification accuracy and processing speed.	[Lai, K. X.; Phung, B. T.; Blackburn, T.

In the past, many algorithms were proposed for mining association rules, most of which were based on items with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. In this paper, the frequent fuzzy pattern tree (fuzzy FP-tree) is proposed for extracting frequent fuzzy itemsets from the transactions with quantitative values. When extending the FP-tree to handle fuzzy data, the processing becomes much more complex than the original since fuzzy intersection in each transaction has to be handled. The fuzzy FP-tree construction algorithm is thus designed, and the mining process based on the tree is presented. Experimental results on three different numbers of fuzzy regions also show the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xiang, EW; Cao, B; Hu, DH; Yang, Q				Xiang, Evan Wei; Cao, Bin; Hu, Derek Hao; Yang, Qiang			Bridging Domains Using World Wide Knowledge for Transfer Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; transfer learning; cross-domain; text classification; Wikipedia		A major problem of classification learning is the lack of ground-truth labeled data. It is usually expensive to label new data instances for training a model. To solve this problem, domain adaptation in transfer learning has been proposed to classify target domain data by using some other source domain data, even when the data may have different distributions. However, domain adaptation may not work well when the differences between the source and target domains are large. In this paper, we design a novel transfer learning approach, called BIG (Bridging Information Gap), to effectively extract useful knowledge in a worldwide knowledge base, which is then used to link the source and target domains for improving the classification performance. BIG works when the source and target domains share the same feature space but different underlying data distributions. Using the auxiliary source data, we can extract a "bridge" that allows cross-domain text classification problems to be solved using standard semisupervised learning algorithms. A major contribution of our work is that with BIG, a large amount of worldwide knowledge can be easily adapted and used for learning in the target domain. We conduct experiments on several real-world cross-domain text classification tasks and demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform several existing domain adaptation approaches significantly.

J	Delen, D; Oztekin, A; Kong, Z				Delen, Dursun; Oztekin, Asil; Kong, Zhenyu (James)			A machine learning-based approach to prognostic analysis of thoracic transplantations	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining; Machine learning; UNOS; Thoracic Transplantation; Survival analysis; Prognostic index	SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION; HEART-TRANSPLANTATION; NETWORK; REGRESSION; RECIPIENTS; MODELS; SINGLE; GRAFT	Objective: The prediction of survival time after organ transplantations and prognosis analysis of different risk groups of transplant patients are not only clinically important but also technically challenging. The current studies, which are mostly linear modeling-based statistical analyses, have focused on small sets of disparate predictive factors where many potentially important variables are neglected in their analyses. Data mining methods, such as machine learning-based approaches, are capable of providing an effective way of overcoming these limitations by utilizing sufficiently large data sets with many predictive factors to identify not only linear associations but also highly complex, non-linear relationships. Therefore, this study is aimed at exploring risk groups of thoracic recipients through machine learning-based methods. Methods and material: A large, feature-rich, nation-wide thoracic transplantation dataset (obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS) is used to develop predictive models for the survival time estimation. The predictive factors that are most relevant to the survival time identified via, (1) conducting sensitivity analysis on models developed by the machine learning methods, (2) extraction of variables from the published literature, and (3) eliciting variables from the medical experts and other domain specific knowledge bases. A unified set of predictors is then used to develop a Cox regression model and the related prognosis indices. A comparison of clustering algorithm-based and conventional risk grouping techniques is conducted based on the outcome of the Cox regression model in order to identify optimal number of risk groups of thoracic recipients. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed to validate the discrimination among the identified various risk groups. Results: The machine learning models performed very effectively in predicting the survival time: the support vector machine model with a radial basis Kernel function produced the best fit with an R(2) value of 0.879, the artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron-MLP-model) came the second with an R2 value of 0.847, and the M5 algorithm-based regression tree model came last with an R(2) value of 0.785. Following the proposed method, a consolidated set of predictive variables are determined and used to build the Cox survival model. Using the prognosis indices revealed by the Cox survival model along with a k-means clustering algorithm, an optimal number of "three" risk groups is identified. The significance of differences among these risk groups are also validated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the integrated machine learning method to select the predictor variables is more effective in developing the Cox survival models than the traditional methods commonly found in the literature. The significant distinction among the risk groups of thoracic patients also validates the effectiveness of the methodology proposed herein. We anticipate that this study (and other AI based analytic studies like this one) will lead to more effective analyses of thoracic transplant procedures to better understand the prognosis of thoracic organ recipients. It would potentially lead to new medical and biological advances and more effective allocation policies in the field of organ transplantation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They retrieve a set of interesting points from a potentially large set of data points. A point is said to be interesting if it is not dominated by any other point. Skyline cube (skycube) consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for computing skycube using bitmaps that are derivable from indexes. The Point-based skycube algorithm is an improvement over the existing Bitmap algorithm, extended to compute skycube. The Point-based algorithm processes one point at a time to check for skylines in all subspaces. The Domain-based skycube algorithm views points as value combinations and probes entire search space for potential skyline points. It significantly reduces bitmap access for low cardinality, dimensions. Our experimental study shows that the two algorithms strictly dominate, or at least comparable to, the current skycube algorithm in most of the cases, suggesting that such an approach could be a useful addition to the set of skyline query processing techniques.

J	Feng, QR; Miao, DQ; Cheng, Y				Feng, Qinrong; Miao, Duoqian; Cheng, Yi			Hierarchical decision rules mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multidimensional data model; Concept hierarchy; Hierarchical decision rules mining; Certain rules; Uncertain rules; Separate-and-conquer strategy	ROUGH SETS; DISCOVERY; REDUCTION; MODEL	Decision rules mining is an important technique in machine learning and data mining. It has been studied intensively during the past few years. However, most existing algorithms are based on flat dataset, from which a set of decision rules mined may be very large for large scale data. Such a set of rules is not easily understandable and really useful for users. Moreover, too many rules may lead to over fitting. Thus, an approach to hierarchical decision rules mining is provided in this paper. It can mine decision rules from different levels of abstraction. The aim of this approach is to improve the quality and efficiency of decision rules mining by combining the hierarchical structure of multidimensional data model and the techniques of rough set theory. The approach follows the so-called separate-and-conquer strategy. It can not only provide a method of hierarchical decision rules mining, but also the most important is that it can reveal the fact that there exists property-preserving among decision rules mined from different levels, which can further improve the efficiency of decision rules mining.

J	Kisilevich, S; Rokach, L; Elovici, Y; Shapira, B				Kisilevich, Slava; Rokach, Lior; Elovici, Yuval; Shapira, Bracha			Efficient Multidimensional Suppression for K-Anonymity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; k-anonymity; deindentified data; decision trees	PRIVACY	Many applications that employ data mining techniques involve mining data that include private and sensitive information about the subjects. One way to enable effective data mining while preserving privacy is to anonymize the data set that includes private information about subjects before being released for data mining. One way to anonymize data set is to manipulate its content so that the records adhere to k-anonymity. Two common manipulation techniques used to achieve k-anonymity of a data set are generalization and suppression. Generalization refers to replacing a value with a less specific but semantically consistent value, while suppression refers to not releasing a value at all. Generalization is more commonly applied in this domain since suppression may dramatically reduce the quality of the data mining results if not properly used. However, generalization presents a major drawback as it requires a manually generated domain hierarchy taxonomy for every quasi-identifier in the data set on which k-anonymity has to be performed. In this paper, we propose a new method for achieving k-anonymity named K-anonymity of Classification Trees Using Suppression (kACTUS). In kACTUS, efficient multidimensional suppression is performed, i.e., values are suppressed only on certain records depending on other attribute values, without the need for manually produced domain hierarchy trees. Thus, in kACTUS, we identify attributes that have less influence on the classification of the data records and suppress them if needed in order to comply with k-anonymity. The kACTUS method was evaluated on 10 separate data sets to evaluate its accuracy as compared to other k-anonymity generalization-and suppression-based methods. Encouraging results suggest that kACTUS' predictive performance is better than that of existing k-anonymity algorithms. Specifically, on average, the accuracies of TDS, TDR, and kADET are lower than kACTUS in 3.5, 3.3, and 1.9 percent, respectively, despite their usage of manually defined domain trees. The accuracy gap is increased to 5.3, 4.3, and 3.1 percent, respectively, when no domain trees are used.

To demonstrate the proposed methodology, two parameters of the wind turbine have been selected for modeling, namely, power output and rotor speed. A virtual model for each of the two parameters is developed and tested with data collected at a wind farm. Both models consider controllable and noncontrollable parameters of the wind turbine, as well as the delay effect of wind speed and other parameters. To mitigate data bias of each virtual model and ensure its robustness, a training set is assembled from ten randomly selected turbines. The performance of a virtual model is largely determined by the input parameters selected and the data mining algorithms used to extract the model. Several data mining algorithms for parameter selection and model extraction are analyzed. The research presented in the paper is illustrated with computational results.

A significant amount of work has been done ill this field, and in them. Soft Computing techniques have showed good performance Generally most of these works can be divided into two categories One is to predict the future trend or price: another is to construct decision support system which call give certain buy/sell signals. In this paper. we propose a new intelligent trading system based on oscillation box prediction by combining stock box theory and support vector machine algorithm The box theory believes a successful stock buying/selling generally Occurs when the price effectively breaks out the original oscillation box into another new box. In the system, two SVM estimators are first utilized to make forecasts of the tipper bound and lower bound of the price oscillation box. Then a trading strategy based oil the two bound forecasts is constructed to make trading decisions.

Clustering, as a widely used data mining approach, has been used to discover phenotypes from the raw expression data. However traditional clustering algorithms have limitations since they can not identify the substructures of samples and features hidden behind the data. Different from clustering, biclustering is a new methodology for discovering genes that are highly related to a subset of samples. Several biclustering models/methods have been presented and used for tumor clinical diagnosis and pathological research. In this paper, we present a new biclustering model using Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF). BMF is a new variant rooted from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We begin by proving a new boundedness property of NMF. Two different algorithms to implement the model and their comparison are then presented. We show that the microarray data biclustering problem can be formulated as a BMF problem and can be solved effectively using our proposed algorithms. Unlike the greedy strategy-based algorithms, our proposed algorithms for BMF are more likely to find the global optima. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the advantages of BMF over existing biclustering methods. Besides the attractive clustering performance, BMF can generate sparse results (i.e., the number of genes/features involved in each biclustering structure is very small related to the total number of genes/features) that are in accordance with the common practice in molecular biology.

Although such analysis can facilitate better understanding of sociological, behavioral, and other interesting phenomena, there is a growing concern about personal privacy being breached, thereby requiring effective anonymization techniques. In this paper, we consider edge weight anonymization in social graphs. Our approach builds a linear programming (LP) model which preserves properties of the graph that are expressible as linear functions of the edge weights. Such properties form the foundations of many important graph-theoretic algorithms such as shortest paths, k-nearest neighbors, minimum spanning tree, etc. Off-the-shelf LP solvers can then be used to find solutions to the resulting model where the computed solution constitutes the weights in the anonymized graph. As a proof of concept, we choose the shortest paths problem, and experimentally evaluate the proposed techniques using real social network data sets.

V., Univ Amsterdam	Univ Amsterdam	3D Fast Wavelet Transform; parallel programming; GPU; multicore	GRAPHICS HARDWARE	GPUs have recently attracted our attention as accelerators on a wide variety of algorithms, including assorted examples within the image analysis field. Among them, wavelets are gaining popularity as solid tools for data mining and video compression, though this comes at the expense of a high computational cost. After proving the effectiveness of the GPU for accelerating the 2D Fast Wavelet Transform [1], we present in this paper a novel implementation on manycore GPUs and multicore CPUs for a high performance computation of the 3D Fast Wavelet Transform (3D-FWT). This algorithm poses a challenging access pattern on matrix operators demanding high sustainable bandwidth, as well as mathematical functions with remarkable arithmetic intensity on ALUs and FPUs. On the GPU side, we focus on CUDA programming to develop methods for an efficient mapping on manycores and to fully exploit the memory hierarchy, whose management is explicit by the programmer. On multicore CPUs, OpenMP and Pthreads are used as counterparts to maximize parallelism, and renowned techniques like tiling and blocking are exploited to optimize the use of memory. Experimental results on an Nvidia Tesla C870 GPU and an Intel Core 2 Quad Q6700 CPU indicate that our implementation runs three times faster on the Tesla and up to fifteen times faster when communications are neglected, which enables the GPU for processing real-time videos in many applications where the 3D-FWT is involved.

Six common algorithms comprising two neural network algorithms, two decision trees for regression, linear regression, and support vector machine were used to construct ensemble models. All algorithms were employed to real-world datasets derived from the cadastral system and the registry of real estate transactions. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate the differences between ensembles and original models were conducted. The results obtained show there is no single algorithm which produces the best ensembles and it is worth to seek an optimal hybrid multi-model solution.

One of the techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm repair is Endovascular Repair. The long-term outcome of this surgery is usually difficult to predict in the absence of clearly visible signs, such as leaks, in the images. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines data extracted from radiological images and data extracted from the Electronic Patient Record in order to assess the evolution of the aneurysm after the intervention. The results show that the system proposed by this approach yields valuable qualitative and quantitative information for follow-up of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm patients after Endovascular Repair.

SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2010	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies				The performance of similarity measures for search, indexing, and data mining applications tends to degrade rapidly as the dimensionality of the data increases. The effects of the so-called 'curse of dimensionality' have been studied by researchers for data sets generated according to a single data distribution. In this paper, we study the effects of this phenomenon on different similarity measures for multiply-distributed data. In particular, we assess the performance of shared-neighbor similarity measures, which are secondary similarity measures based on the rankings of data objects induced by some primary distance measure. We find that rank-based similarity measures can result in more stable performance than their associated primary distance measures.

A decision rule-based method for feature selection in predictive data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Feature subset search; Predictive data mining		Algorithms for feature selection in predictive data mining for classification problems attempt to select those features that are relevant, and are not redundant for the classification task. A relevant feature is defined as one which is highly correlated with the target function. One problem with the definition of feature relevance is that there is no universally accepted definition of what it means for a feature to be 'highly correlated with the target function or highly correlated with the other features'. A new feature selection algorithm which incorporates domain specific definitions of high, medium and low correlations is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm conducts a heuristic search for the most relevant features for the prediction task. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Lutu, Patricia E.

However, it is not always easy for nonexpert users to harness these systems effectively. A large workload composed in what seems to be the obvious way by a naive user may accidentally abuse shared resources and achieve very poor performance. To address this problem, we argue that campus grids should provide end users with high-level abstractions that allow for the easy expression and efficient execution of data-intensive workloads. We present one example of an abstraction-All-Pairs-that fits the needs of several applications in biometrics, bioinformatics, and data mining. We demonstrate that an optimized All-Pairs abstraction is both easier to use than the underlying system, achieve performance orders of magnitude better than the obvious but naive approach, and is both faster and more efficient than a tuned conventional approach. This abstraction has been in production use for one year on a 500 CPU campus grid at the University of Notre Dame and has been used to carry out a groundbreaking analysis of biometric data.

J	Dudek, D				Dudek, Damian			RMAIN: Association rules maintenance without reruns through data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Association rules; Incremental maintenance; Approximate methods; Knowledge-based systems	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; GENERATION	Association rules are well recognised as a data mining tool for analysis of transactional data, currently going far beyond the early basket-based applications. A wide spectrum of methods for mining associations have been proposed up to date, including batch and incremental approaches. Most of the accurate incremental methods minimise, but do not completely eliminate reruns through processed data. In this paper we propose a new approximate algorithm RMAIN for incremental maintenance of association rules, which works repeatedly on subsequent portions of new transactions. After a portion has been analysed, the new rules are combined with the old ones, so that no reruns through the processed transactions are performed in the future. The resulting set of rules is kept similar to the one that would be achieved in a batch manner. Unlike other incremental methods, RMAIN is fully separated from a rule mining algorithm and this independence makes it highly general and flexible. Moreover, it operates on rules in their final form, ready for decision support, and not on intermediate representation (frequent itemsets), which requires further processing. These features make the RMAIN algorithm well suited for rule maintenance within knowledge bases of autonomous systems with strongly bounded resources and time for decision making. We evaluated the algorithm on synthetic and real datasets, achieving promising results with respect to either performance or quality of output rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to the complexity of the problem and the size of the dataset, obtaining quality solutions within reasonable CPU time and memory requirements becomes the central challenge. In this paper, we solve the clustering problem as a large scale p-median model, using a new approach based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic. Using a highly efficient data structure and local updating procedure taken from the OR literature, our VNS procedure is able to tackle large datasets directly without the need for data reduction or sampling as employed in certain popular methods. Computational results demonstrate that our VNS heuristic outperforms other local search based methods such as CLARA and CLARANS even after upgrading these procedures with the same efficient data structures and local search. We also obtain a bound on the quality of the solutions by solving heuristically a dual relaxation of the problem, thus introducing an important capability to the solution process.

Discovered sequence reveals the chronological relation between items and provides valuable information to aid in developing marketing strategies. Nevertheless, we can hardly know whether the buying is cyclic and how long the interval between the two consecutive items in the sequential pattern is. To solve this problem, in this paper, data mining skills and the fundamentals of statistics are combined to develop a set of algorithms to unearth the cyclic properties of discovered sequential patterns. The algorithms, coupled with the sequential pattern mining process, constitute a thorough scheme to analyze and predict likely consumer behavior. The proposed algorithms are implemented and applied to test against real data collected from a consumer goods company. The experimental results illustrate how the model can be used to predict likely purchases within a certain time frame. Consequently, marketing professionals can execute campaigns to favorably impact customers' behaviors.

ILP-based concept discovery in multi-relational data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ILP; Data mining; MRDM; Concept discovery; Aggregate predicate		Multi-relational data mining has become popular due to the limitations of propositional problem definition in structured domains and the tendency of storing data in relational databases. Several relational knowledge discovery systems have been developed employing various search strategies, heuristics, language pattern limitations and hypothesis evaluation criteria, in order to cope with intractably large search space and to be able to generate high-quality patterns. In this work, an ILP-based concept discovery method, namely Confidence-based Concept Discovery (C(2)D), is described in which strong declarative biases and user-defined specifications are relaxed. Moreover, this new method directly works on relational databases. In addition to this, a new confidence-based pruning is used in this technique. We also describe how to define and use aggregate predicates as background knowledge in the proposed method. In order to use aggregate predicates, we show how to handle numerical attributes by using comparison operators on them. Finally, we analyze the effect of incorporating unrelated facts for generating transitive rules on the proposed method. A set of experiments are conducted on real-world problems to test the performance of the proposed method. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kavurucu, Y.; Senkul, P.; Toroslu, I.

J	Liao, SH; Ho, HH; Yang, FC				Liao, Shu-hsien; Ho, Hsu-hui; Yang, Feng-chich			Ontology-based data mining approach implemented on exploring product and brand spectrum	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ontology; Data mining; Apriori algorithm; Clustering analysis; Product spectrum; Brand spectrum	SYSTEM	In physics, a spectrum is, the series of colored bands diffracted and arranged in the order of their respective wave lengths by the passage of white light through a prism or other diffracting medium. Outside of physics, a spectrum is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary infinitely within a continuum. In commerce, an effective visualization tool, especially for stakeholders or managers, is a brand spectrum diagram highlighting where the company's brands and products are situated compared to other competitors. This paper investigates the research issues on product and brand spectrum in the beverage product market of Taiwan, which proposes using the Apriori algorithm of association rules, and clustering analysis based on an ontology-based data mining approach, for mining customer and product knowledge from the database. Knowledge extracted from data-mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, and maps in order to propose suggestions and solutions to beverage firms for possible product development, promotion, and marketing.

In this paper we discuss the design and security requirements for large-scale privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) systems in a fully distributed setting, where each client possesses its own records of private data. To this end we argue in favor of using some well-known cryptographic primitives, borrowed from the literature on Internet elections. More specifically, our framework is based on the classical homomorphic election model, and particularly on an extension for supporting multi-candidate elections. We also review a recent scheme [Z. Yang, S. Zhong, R.N. Wright, Privacy-preserving classification of customer data without loss of accuracy, in: SDM' 2005 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, 2005] which was the first scheme that used the homomorphic encryption primitive for PPDM in the fully distributed setting. Finally, we show how our approach can be used as a building block to obtain Random Forests classification with enhanced prediction performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mining frequent itemsets in data streams using the weighted sliding window model	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Data stream; Weighted sliding window model; Association rule; Frequent itemset	DATABASES	In recent years, data stream mining has become an important research topic. With the emergence of new applications, the data we process are not again static, but the continuous dynamic data stream. Examples include network traffic analysis, Web click stream mining, network intrusion detection, and on-line transaction analysis. In this paper, we propose a new framework for data stream mining, called the weighted sliding window model. The proposed model allows the user to specify the number of windows for mining, the size of a window, and the weight for each window. Thus users can specify a higher weight to a more significant data section, which will make the mining result closer to user's requirements. Based on the weighted sliding window model, we propose a single pass algorithm, called WSW, to efficiently discover all the frequent itemsets from data streams. By analyzing data characteristics, an improved algorithm, called WSW-Imp, is developed to further reduce the time of deciding whether a candidate itemset is frequent or not. Empirical results show that WSW-Imp outperforms WSW under the weighted sliding window model. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, SY; Chen, YL				Wu, Shin-Yi; Chen, Yen-Liang			Discovering hybrid temporal patterns from sequences consisting of point- and interval-based events	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; Hybrid temporal pattern; Temporal pattern; Sequential pattern; Hybrid event sequences	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; LARGE DATABASES; KNOWLEDGE; GROWTH; MAINTENANCE; PREFIXSPAN	Previous sequential pattern mining studies have dealt with either point-based event sequences or interval-based event sequences. In some applications, however, event sequences may contain both point-based and interval-based events. These sequences are called hybrid event sequences. Since the relationships among both kinds of events are more diversiform, the information obtained by discovering patterns from these events is more informative. In this study we introduce a hybrid temporal pattern mining problem and develop an algorithm to discover hybrid temporal patterns from hybrid event sequences. We carry out an experiment using both synthetic and real stock price data to compare our algorithm with the traditional algorithms designed exclusively for mining point-based patterns or interval-based patterns. The experimental results indicate that the efficiency of our algorithm is satisfactory. In addition, the experiment also shows that the predicting power of hybrid temporal patterns is higher than that of point-based or interval-based patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, we introduce a new exact concise representation of frequent itemsets. This representation is based on an exploration of the disjunctive search space. The disjunctive itemsets convey information about the complementary occurrence of items in a dataset. A novel closure operator is then devised to suit the characteristics of the explored search space. The proposed operator aims at mapping many disjunctive itemsets to a unique one, called a disjunctive closed itemset. Hence, it permits to drastically reduce the number of handled itemsets within the targeted re-presentation. Interestingly, the proposed representation offers direct access to the disjunctive and negative supports of frequent itemsets while ensuring the derivation of their exact conjunctive supports. We conclude from the experimental results reported and discussed here that our representation is effective and sound in comparison with different other concise representations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies dealing with this problem either set time constraints to restrict the patterns discovered or define time-intervals between two successive items to provide time information. Accordingly, the first approach falls short in providing clear time-interval information while the second cannot discover time-interval information between two non-successive items in a sequential pattern. To provide more time-related knowledge, we define a new variant of time-interval sequential patterns, called multi-time-interval sequential patterns, which can reveal the time-intervals between all pairs of items in a pattern. Accordingly, we develop two efficient algorithms, called the MI-Apriori and MI-PrefixSpan algorithms, to solve this problem. The experimental results show that the MI-PrefixSpan algorithm is faster than the MI-Apriori algorithm. but the MI-Apriori algorithm has better scalability in long sequence data.

Their strengths are the ability to first provide a result after a very short initialization and second to improve their result with additional time. Therefore, anytime algorithms have so far been used when the available processing time varies, e.g., on varying data streams. In this paper we propose to employ anytime algorithms on constant data streams, i.e., for tasks with constant time allowance. We introduce two approaches that harness the strengths of anytime algorithms on constant data streams and thereby improve the over all quality of the result with respect to the corresponding budget algorithm. We derive formulas for the expected performance gain and demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel approaches using existing anytime algorithms on benchmark data sets.

Our proposed algorithm consists of three phases. First, we transform each time-series sequence in a transaction into a symbolic sequence. Second, we scan the transformed database to find frequent patterns of length one. Third, for each frequent pattern found in the second phase, we recursively enumerate frequent patterns by a frequent pattern tree in a depth-first search manner. During the process of enumeration, we apply several efficient pruning strategies to remove frequent but non-closed patterns. Thus, the CMP-Miner algorithm can efficiently mine the closed patterns from a time-series database. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the modified Apriori and BIDE algorithms. (C)2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lee, Anthony J.

However, generating and storing the co-locations and table instances is costly. A novel order-clique-based approach for mining maximal co-locations is proposed in this paper. The efficiency of the approach is achieved by two techniques: (1) the spatial neighbor relationships and the size-2 prevalence co-locations are compressed into extended prefix-tree structures, which allows the order-clique-based approach to mine candidate maximal co-locations and co-location instances; and (2) the co-location instances do not need to be stored after computing some characteristics of the corresponding co-location, which significantly reduces the execution time and space required for mining maximal co-locations. The performance study shows that the new method is efficient for mining both long and short co-location patterns, and is faster than some other methods (in particular the join-based method and the join-less method).

This sparsity of defect occurrence within the software system impedes training and performance of software quality estimation models. Data sampling approaches presented in data mining and machine learning literature can be used to address the imbalance problem. We present a novel genetic algorithm-based data sampling method, named Evolutionary Sampling, as a solution to improving software quality modeling for high-assurance systems. The proposed solution is compared with multiple existing data sampling techniques, including random undersampling, one-sided selection, Wilson's editing, random oversampling, cluster-based oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique ( SMOTE), and Borderline-SMOTE. This paper involves case studies of two real-world software systems and builds C4.5- and RIPPER-based software quality models both before and after applying a given data sampling technique. It is empirically shown that Evolutionary Sampling improves performance of software quality models for high-assurance systems and is significantly better than most existing data sampling techniques.

Simplified fuzzy if-then rules have been widely used in function approximation problems due to no complicated defuzzification is required. The proposed simplified fuzzy rule-based classification system, whose number of output is equal to the number of different classes, approximates an unknown mapping from input to desired output for each discriminant function. Not only a fuzzy data mining method is proposed to find simplified fuzzy if-then rules from training data, but also the genetic algorithm is employed to determine some user-specified parameters. To evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method, computer simulations are performed on some well-known datasets, showing that the generalization ability of the proposed method is comparable to the other fuzzy or nonfuzzy methods.

J	Jacquenet, F; Largeron, C				Jacquenet, Francois; Largeron, Christine			Discovering unexpected documents in corpora	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Text mining; Unexpected patterns; Information retrieval	UNDIRECTED DISCOVERY; EXCEPTION RULES; PATTERNS; EXTRACTION; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS	Text mining is widely used to discover frequent patterns in large corpora of documents. Hence, many classical data mining techniques, that have been proven fruitful in the context of data stored in relational databases, are now successfully used in the context of textual data. Nevertheless, there are many situations where it is more valuable to discover unexpected information rather than frequent ones. In the context of technology watch for example, we may want to discover new trends in specific markets, or discover what competitors are planning in the near future, etc. This paper is related to that context of research. We have proposed several unexpectedness measures and implemented them in a prototype, called UnexpectedMiner, that can be used by watchers, in order to discover unexpected documents in large corpora of documents (patents, datasheets, advertisements, scientific papers, etc.). UnexpectedMiner is able to take into account the structure of documents during the discovery of unexpected information. Many experiments have been performed in order to validate our measures and show the interest of our system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Factors critical to liability attributions commonly identified theoretically and practically were first selected. Both SOM and DM models were then generated for frontal, side. and rear collisions of two-vehicle crashes. Appropriateness of all generated models was evaluated and confirmed. Finally, a decision support tool was developed using active server pages.

Part II: Selection of hemodynamic features using computational intelligence	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Congenital heart disease; Computational intelligence; Data mining; Decision tree; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Periventricular leukomalacia	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; GEAR FAULT-DETECTION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; HYPOCAPNIA; INFANTS; DISEASE; MODELS	Objective: The objective of Part II is to analyze the dataset of extracted hemodynamic features (Case 3 of Part I) through computational intelligence (CI) techniques for identification of potential prognostic factors for periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) occurrence in neonates with congenital heart disease. Methods: The extracted features (Case 3 dataset of Part I) were used as inputs to CI based classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) in combination with genetic algorithms (GA) for selection of the most suitable features predicting the occurrence of PVL. The selected features were next used as inputs to a decision tree (DT) algorithm for generating easily interpretable rules of PVL prediction. Results: Prediction performance for two CI based classifiers, MLP and PNN coupled with GA are presented for different number of selected features. The best prediction performances were achieved with 6 and 7 selected features. The prediction success was 100% in training and the best ranges of sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC) in test were 60-73%, 74-84% and 71-74%, respectively. The identified features when used with the DT algorithm gave best SN, SP and AC in the ranges of 87-90% in training and 80-87%, 74-79% and 79-82% in test. Among the variables selected in CI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and pCO(2) figured prominently similar to Part I. Decision tree based rules for prediction of PVL occurrence were obtained using the Cl selected features. Conclusions: The proposed approach combines the generalization capability of CI based feature selection approach and generation of easily interpretable classification rules of the decision tree. The combination of Cl techniques with DT gave substantially better test prediction performance than using CI and DT separately. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tseng, VS; Lee, CH				Tseng, Vincent S.; Lee, Chao-Hui			Effective temporal data classification by integrating sequential pattern mining and probabilistic induction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM		Temporal data; Classification; Sequential pattern; Scoring method; Data mining		Data classification is an important topic in the field of data mining due to its wide applications. A number of related methods have been proposed based on the well-known learning models such as decision tree or neural network. Although data classification was widely discussed, relatively few studies explored the topic of temporal data classification. Most of the existing researches focused oil improving the accuracy of classification by using statistical models, neural network, or distance-based methods. However, they can,lot interpret the results of classification to users. In many research cases, such as gene expression of microarray, users prefer the classification information above a classifier only with a high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-based data mining method, namely classify-by-sequence (CBS), for classifying large temporal datasets. The main methodology behind the CBS is integrating sequential pattern mining with probabilistic induction. The CBS has the merit of simplicity in implementation and its pattern-based architecture call supply clear classification information to users. Through experimental evaluation, the CBS was shown to deliver classification results with high accuracy under two real time series datasets. In addition, we designed a simulator to evaluate the performance of CBS under datasets with different characteristics. The experimental results show that CBS call discover the hidden patterns and classify data effectively by utilizing the mined sequential patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By introducing novel extensions, we integrate two elemental methods-the N-gram model and Angluin's machine learning algorithm into an ethological data mining framework. This allows us to obtain the minimized automaton-representation of behavioral rules that accept (or generate) the smallest set of possible behavioral patterns from sequential data of animal behavior. With this method, we demonstrate how the ethological data mining works using real birdsong data; we use the Bengalese finch song and perform experimental evaluations of this method using artificial birdsong data generated by a computer program. These results suggest that our ethological data mining works effectively even for noisy behavioral data by appropriately setting the parameters that we introduce. In addition, we demonstrate a case study using the Bengalese finch song, showing that our method successfully grasps the core structure of the singing behavior such as loops and branches.

J	Sadoddin, R; Ghorbani, AA				Sadoddin, Reza; Ghorbani, Ali A.			An incremental frequent structure mining framework for real-time alert correlation	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Online alert correlation; Intrusion detection; Network security; Stream data mining; Graph mining; Attack scenario extraction; False positive analysis; FP tree; DDoS attack; Tilted-time window model		With the large volume of alerts produced by low-level detectors, management of intrusion alerts is becoming more challenging. Manual analysis of a large number of raw alerts is both time consuming and labor intensive. Alert Correlation addresses this issue by finding similarity and causality relationships between raw alerts to provide a condensed, yet more meaningful view of the network from the intrusion standpoint. While some efforts have been made in the literature by researchers to find the relationships between alerts automatically, not much attention has been given to the issue of real-time correlation of alerts. Previous learning-based approaches either fail to cope with a large number of generated alerts in a large-scale network or do not address the problem of concept drift directly. In this paper, we propose a framework for real-time alert correlation which incorporates novel techniques for aggregating alerts into structured patterns and incremental mining of frequent structured patterns. Our approach to aggregation provides a reduced view of developed patterns of alerts. At the core of the proposed framework is a new algorithm (FSP-Growth) for mining frequent patterns of alerts considering their structures. In the proposed framework, time-sensitive statistical relationships between alerts are maintained in an efficient data structure and are updated incrementally to reflect the latest trends of patterns. The results of experiments conducted with the DARPA 2000 dataset as well as artificial data clearly demonstrate the efficiency of proposed techniques. A promising reduction ratio of 96% is achieved on the DARPA 2000 dataset. The running time of the FSP-Growth algorithm scales linearly with the size of artificial datasets. Moreover, testing the proposed framework with alert logs of a real-world network shows its ability to extract interesting patterns among the alerts. The ability to answer useful time-sensitive queries regarding pattern co-occurrences is another advantage of the proposed method compared to other approaches.

J	Yi, X; Zhang, YC				Yi, Xun; Zhang, Yanchun			Privacy-preserving naive Bayes classification on distributed data via semi-trusted mixers	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy-preserving distributed data mining; Classification; Data security		Distributed data mining applications, such as those dealing with health care, finance, counter-terrorism and homeland defense, use sensitive data from distributed databases held by different parties. This comes into direct conflict with an individual's need and right to privacy. It is thus of great importance to develop adequate security techniques for protecting privacy of individual values used for data mining. In this paper, we consider privacy-preserving naive Bayes classifier for horizontally partitioned distributed data and propose a two-party protocol and a multi-party protocol to achieve it. Our multi-party protocol is built on the semi-trusted mixer model, in which each data site sends messages to two semi-trusted mixers, respectively, which run our two-party protocol and then broadcast the classification result. This model facilitates both trust management and implementation. Security analysis has showed that our two-party protocol is a private protocol and our multi-party protocol is a private protocol as long as the two mixers do not conclude. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Adnan, M; Alhajj, R				Adnan, Muhaimenul; Alhajj, Reda			DRFP-tree: disk-resident frequent pattern tree	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Frequent pattern; Association rules; Data mining; FP-growth; FP-tree; DRFP-growth; DRFP-tree		Frequent itemset mining methods basically address time scalability and greatly rely on available physical memory. However, the size of real-world databases to be mined is exponentially increasing, and hence main memory size is a serious bottleneck of the existing methods. So, it is necessary to develop new methods that do not fully rely on physical memory; new methods that utilize the secondary storage in the mining process should be the target. This motivates the work described in this paper; we mainly propose (Disk Resident Frequent Pattern) DRFP-Growth as a disk based approach similar to FP-Growth. DRFP-growth uses DRFP-tree, which is treated exactly as FP-tree when constructed in main memory and gets into a modified structure when it turns into disk resident to overcome the main memory bottleneck. This way, we are able to mine for frequent itemsets from databases of arbitrary sizes without being restricted by the available physical memory. In other words, we initially try to mine the database using the original FP-growth; we expand into the secondary memory only if we run out of physical memory. So, DRFP-growth is very comparable to FP-growth for small databases and high support threshold values. On the other hand, using DRFP-growth, we are still able to mine huge databases for low support threshold values (the only limitation is the available secondary storage rather than physical memory). The reported test results demonstrate how the proposed approach succeeds for cases where main memory based approaches fail.

The DisDaMin (Distributed Data Mining) project addressed distributed discovery and knowledge discovery through parallelization of data mining tasks. DisDaMin algorithms are based on the DG-ADAJ (Desktop-Grid Adaptive Application in Java), a middleware platform for Desktop Grid used as a deployment mechanism for DisDaMin algorithms. On the top of DG-ADAJ, SOA specific components could be employed to provide additional features and to improve current operation. An ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) built On the top of DG-ADAJ is going to provide improved availability, solve interoperability issues by exposing services through well established interfaces, and offer a loosely coupled infrastructure. An additional enactment layer is going to improve the performance of intelligent fragmentation of data, offering at the same time the necessary support for the execution of data workflows.

Projected outlier detection in high-dimensional mixed-attributes data set	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Data mining; High-dimensional spaces; Mixed-attribute data sets	FRAUD DETECTION; ALGORITHM	Detecting outlier efficiently is an active research issue in data mining, which has important applications in the field of fraud detection, network intrusion detection, monitoring criminal activities in electronic commerce, etc. Because of the sparsity of high dimensional data, it is reasonable and meaningful to detect the outliers in suitable projected subspaces. We call such subspace and outliers in the subspace as anomaly subspace and projected outlier respectively. Many efficient algorithms have already been proposed for outlier detection based on different approaches, but there are few literatures on projected outlier detection for high dimensional data sets with mixed continuous and categorical attributes. In this paper, a novel projected outlier detection algorithm is proposed to detect projected outliers in high-dimensional mixed attribute data set. Our main contributions are: (1) combined with information entropy, a novel measure of anomaly subspace is proposed. In this anomaly subspace, meaningful outliers could be detected and explained. Unlike the previous projected outlier detection methods, the dimension of anomaly subspace is not decided beforehand; (2) theoretical analysis about this measure is presented; (3) bottom-up method is proposed to find the interesting anomaly subspaces; (4) the outlying degree of projected outlier is defined, which has good explanations; (5) the data set with mixed data type is handled; (6) experiments on synthetic and real data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach are performed.

J	Tao, SH; Chen, DZ; Zhao, WX				Tao, Shaohui; Chen, Dezhao; Zhao, Weixiang			Fast pruning algorithm for multi-output LS-SVM and its application in chemical pattern classification	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pattern classification; LS-SVM; Sparseness; Fast pruning strategy; Kernel matrix; Linear correlation analysis; Information transferring	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFIERS	Classification is an important problem in chemometrics field, and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), which is a simplified version of standard support vector machine (SVM), is a powerful tool for classification problems. However LS-SVM loses the sparseness of ordinary SVM, which would decrease its classification speed and limit its application to chemical data mining. To keep sparseness for LS-SVM, several pruning algorithms were proposed. But few of the existent pruning algorithms can be directly applied to an LS-SVM with multiple outputs. In this paper, a new fast pruning algorithm is proposed for a multi-output LS-SVM. The support vector (SV) selection is done by linear correlation analysis based on the principal component analysis (PCA) or the classification correlative component analysis (CCCA) of kernel matrix, then the information contained in non-SV data points is transferred to SV data points, so sparseness is imposed to LS-SVM. The tests on several real-life classification problems show that the proposed sparse LS-SVM not only has an equivalently good classification performance to the standard LS-SVM but also keeps a high sparseness in model structure. How the information transferring process ensures the performance stability during pruning and the difference of SV distribution between the LS-SVM pruned by Suykens' pruning algorithm and the proposed sparse LS-SVMs are also illustrated.

J	Angiulli, F; Fassetti, F				Angiulli, Fabrizio; Fassetti, Fabio			DOLPHIN: An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Distance-Based Outliers in Very Large Datasets	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Data mining; outlier detection; distance-based outliers		In this work a novel distance-based outlier detection algorithm, named DOLPHIN, working on disk-resident datasets and whose I/O cost corresponds to the cost of sequentially reading the input dataset file twice, is presented. It is both theoretically and empirically shown that the main memory usage of DOLPHIN amounts to a small fraction of the dataset and that DOLPHIN has linear time performance with respect to the dataset size. DOLPHIN gains efficiency by naturally merging together in a unified schema three strategies, namely the selection policy of objects to be maintained in main memory, usage of pruning rules, and similarity search techniques. Importantly, similarity search is accomplished by the algorithm without the need of preliminarily indexing the whole dataset, as other methods do. The algorithm is simple to implement and it can be used with any type of data, belonging to either metric or nonmetric spaces. Moreover, a modification to the basic method allows DOLPHIN to deal with the scenario in which the available buffer of main memory is smaller than its standard requirements. DOLPHIN has been compared with state-of-the-art distance-based outlier detection algorithms, showing that it is much more efficient.

We show how an evolutionary algorithm ( EA) can be used to optimize radial basis function (RBF) neural networks used for classification tasks. First, input features will be chosen from a set of possible input features (feature selection). Second, the number of hidden neurons is adapted (model selection). It is known that interpretable (fuzzy-type) rule sets may be extracted from RBF networks. We show how appropriate training algorithms for RBF networks and penalty terms in the fitness function of the EA may improve the understandability of the extracted rules. The properties of our approach are set out by means of two industrial application examples (process identification and quality control). (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Learning weighted linguistic fuzzy rules by using specifically-tailored hybrid estimation of distribution algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Linguistic fuzzy systems; COR; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Weighted fuzzy rules; Soft computing; Hybrid systems; Data mining	INCONSISTENT RULES; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEMS; INTERPRETABILITY; ACCURACY; DESIGN; MODELS	The WCOR methodology makes use of metaheuristic algorithms to find the best set of rules, as well as their weights, when learning weighted linguistic fuzzy systems from data. Although in early work based on this approach the search was carried out by means of a genetic algorithm, any other technique can be used. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a family of evolutionary algorithms in which the variation operator consists of a probability distribution that is learnt from the best individuals in a population and sampled to generate new ones. There are several possibilities for including problem domain knowledge in EDAs in order to make the search more efficient. In particular, this study examines specifically-designed EDAs which incorporate the information available about the WCOR problem into the probabilistic graphical model used to factorize the probability distribution. The experiments carried out with real and artificial datasets show an improvement in both the results obtained and the computational effort required by the search process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Efficient mining of sequential patterns with time constraints: Reducing the combinations	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time constraints; Sequential patterns; Levelwise algorithms		In this paper we consider the problem of discovering sequential patterns by handling time constraints as defined in the Gsp algorithm. While sequential patterns could be seen as temporal relationships between facts embedded in the database where considered facts are merely characteristics of individuals or observations of individual behavior, generalized sequential patterns aim to provide the end user with a more flexible handling of the transactions embedded in the database. We thus propose a new efficient algorithm, called GTC (Graph for Time Constraints) for mining such patterns in very large databases. It is based oil the idea that handling time constraints in the earlier stage of the data mining process can be highly beneficial. One of the most significant new feature of our approach is that handling of time constraints can be easily taken into account in traditional levelwise approaches since it is carried out prior to and separately from the Counting step of a data sequence. Our test shows that the proposed algorithm performs significantly faster than a state-of-the-art sequence mining algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Montana, G; Triantafyllopoulos, K; Tsagaris, T				Montana, Giovanni; Triantafyllopoulos, Kostas; Tsagaris, Theodoros			Flexible least squares for temporal data mining and statistical arbitrage	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Temporal data mining; Flexible least squares; Time-varying regression; Algorithmic trading system; Statistical arbitrage	VARYING LINEAR-REGRESSION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS	A number of recent emerging applications call for studying data streams, potentially infinite flows of information updated in real-time. When multiple co-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how these streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns without imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence. In this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version of ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression coefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating application is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits patterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is algebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take advantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest a more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a FLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are reported. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tsai, CJ; Lee, CI; Yang, WP				Tsai, Cheng-Jung; Lee, Chien-I.; Yang, Wei-Pang			Mining decision rules on data streams in the presence of concept drifts	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Decision tree; Data stream; Concept drift	DISCRETIZATION	In a database, the concept of all example might change along with time, which is known as concept drift. When the concept drift occurs, the classification model built by using the old dataset is not suitable for predicting a new dataset. Therefore, the problem of concept drift has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Although many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, they have not been able to provide users with a satisfactory solution to concept drift. That is, the current research about concept drift focuses only on updating the classification model. However, real life decision makers might be very interested in the rules of concept drift. For example, doctors desire to know the root causes behind variation in the causes and development of disease. In this paper, we propose a concept drift rule mining tree, called CDR-Tree, to accurately discover the underlying rule governing concept drift. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) we address the problem of mining concept-drifting rules which has not been considered in previously developed classification schemes; (b) we develop a method that call accurately mine rules governing concept drift: (c) we develop a method that should classification models be required, call efficiently and accurately generate such models via a simple extraction procedure rather than constructing them anew; and (d) we propose two strategies to reduce the complexity of concept-drifting, rules mined by our CDR-Tree.

To extract significant factors for breast tumors, two methods - analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and information measurement - are used; then, the results show that human papillomavirus (HPV) is not significant factor. Further, genetic algorithm (GA)-based data mining was submitted to obtain the rule between other DNA viruses and breast cancer/fibroadenoma. The GA rule shows that the effect of breast cancer includes {herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (-), human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 (-,+)}, {HSV-1(-)}, or {HHV-8(-)}, and that the effect of fibroadenoma includes {HSV-1(+), HHV-8(+)}, {HSV-1(+)}, or {HHV-8(+)}. Furthermore, the Mantel-Haenszel test shows that GA rules make a distinction between breast cancer and fibroadenoma. Finally, regarding diagnosis cost and accuracy, this study suggests that considering HSV-1 alone or with HHV-8 is optimal, but considering only HHV-8 yields less accurate results.

J	Xu, X; Law, R; Wu, T				Xu, Xin; Law, Rob; Wu, Tao			Support Vector Machines with Manifold Learning and Probabilistic Space Projection for Tourist Expenditure Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						SVMs; Tourism data analysis; Manifold learning; ISOMAP; Feature projection; Scale transformation; Data mining	BUSINESS TRAVELERS; CLASSIFICATION	The significant economic contributions of the tourism industry in recent years impose an unprecedented force for data mining and machine learning methods to analyze tourism data. The intrinsic problems of raw data in tourism are largely related to the complexity, noise and nonlinearity in the data that may introduce many challenges for the existing data mining techniques such as rough sets and neural networks. In this paper, a novel method using SVM-based classification with two nonlinear feature projection techniques is proposed for tourism data analysis. The first feature projection method is based on ISOMAP (Isometric Feature Mapping), which is a class of manifold learning approaches for dimension reduction. By making use of ISOMAP, part of the noisy data can be identified and the classification accuracy of SVMs can be improved by appropriately discarding the noisy training data. The second feature projection method is a probabilistic space mapping technique for scale transformation. Experimental results on expenditure data of business travelers show that the proposed method can improve prediction performance both in terms of testing accuracy and statistical coincidence. In addition, both of the feature projection methods are helpful to reduce the training time of SVMs.	[Xu, Xin; Wu, Tao] Natl Univ Def Technol, Inst Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Law, Rob] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Xu, X (reprint author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Inst Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.	xuxin_mail@263.net			Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [PolyU 4631/06H]	The work described in this paper was fully supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 4631/06H).

Misconfigurations can compromise the security of an entire network or even cause global disruptions to Internet connectivity. Several solutions have been proposed. They can detect a number of problems in real configuration files. However, these solutions share a common limitation: they are based on rules which need to be known beforehand. Violations of these rules are deemed misconfigurations. As policies typically differ among networks, these approaches are limited in the scope of mistakes they can detect. In this paper, we address the problem of router misconfigurations using data mining. We apply association rules mining to the configuration files of routers across an administrative domain to discover local, network-specific policies. Deviations from these local policies are potential misconfigurations. We have evaluated our scheme on configuration files from a large state-wide network provider, a large university campus and a high-performance research network. In this evaluation, we focused on three aspects of the configurations: user accounts, interfaces and BGP sessions. User accounts specify the users that can access the router and define the authorized commands. Interfaces are the ports used by routers to connect to different networks. Each interface may support a number of services and run various routing protocols. BGP sessions are the connections with neighboring autonomous systems (AS). BGP sessions implement the routing policies which select the routes that are filtered and the ones that are advertised to the BGP neighbors. We included the routing policies in our study. The results are promising. We discovered a number of errors that were confirmed and corrected by the network administrators. These errors would have been difficult to detect with current predefined rule-based approaches.

The presented approach is aimed at suggesting the solutions for few unhandled exceptions of the Decision tree induction algorithms such as (i) the situation in which the majority voting makes incorrect decision (generating two different types of rules for same data), and (ii) in case of dimensionality reduction by decision tree induction algorithms, the determination of appropriate attribute at a node where two or more attributes have equal highest information gain. Exception due to majority voting is handled with the help of Naive Bayes algorithm and also novel solutions are given for dimensionality reduction. As a result, the classification accuracy has drastically improved. An extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic databases shows that ID6NB is a state-of-the-art classification algorithm that outperforms well than other methods of decision tree learning.

MISR is a special case of the classical Maximum Independent Set problem, where the input is restricted to intersection graphs of axis-parallel rectangles. Due to its many applications, ranging from map labeling to data mining, MISR has received a significant amount of attention from various research communities. Since the problem is NP-hard, the main focus has been on the design of approximation algorithms. Several groups of researches have independently suggested O(log n)-approximation algorithms for MISR, and this remained the best currently known approximation factor for the problem. The main result of our paper is an O(log log n)-approximation algorithm for MISR. Our algorithm combines existing approaches for solving special cases of the problem, in which the input set of rectangles is restricted to containing specific intersection types, with new insights into the combinatorial structure of sets of intersecting rectangles in the plane. We also consider a generalization of MISR to higher dimensions, where rectangles are replaced by d-dimensional hyper-rectangles. Our results for MISR imply an O((log n)(d-2) log log n)-approximation algorithm for this problem, improving upon the best previously known O((log)(d-1))-approximation.

J	Liu, L; Huang, LH; Lai, MY; Ma, CQ				Liu, Lian; Huang, Lihong; Lai, Mingyong; Ma, Chaoqun			Projective ART with buffers for the high dimensional space clustering and an application to discover stock associations	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Neural network; Data mining; Clustering; Buffer management; PART; Bayes rule; Stock concurrence association	PART FILTERING METHOD; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS	Unlike to traditional hierarchical and partitional clustering algorithms which always fail to deal with very large databases, a neural network architecture, projective adaptive resonance theory (PART), is developed for the high dimensional space clustering. However, the success of the PART algorithm depends on both accurate parameters and satisfied orders of input data sets. These disadvantages prevent PART from being applied to realtime databases. In this paper, we propose an improved method, PART with buffer management, to overcome these disadvantages. The major contributions of our method are introducing a buffer management and a new similar degree function and buffer checkout process. The buffer management mechanism allows data sets not to be immediately clustered to one cluster. The purpose of the average similar degree is to successfully work with high similar noise data sets and partly achieve an order-independent objective without correct parameters. And the average similar degree has a good attribute, the parameter-tolerance. Namely, the clustering result does not depend on the precise choice of input parameters, and different parameter values have close clustering results including dimensions associated with clusters. The buffer checkout process call handle a huge amount of input data sets by a small buffer space. Also, simulations and comparisons in high dimensional spaces are reported, and an application by using our algorithm to find stock concurrence association rules is given finally.

J	Plaza, B				Plaza, Beatriz			Monitoring web traffic source effectiveness with Google Analytics An experiment with time series	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Internet; User studies; Worldwide web; Systems analysis; Data mining	SEARCH	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to develop a new user-friendly in-house tracking methodology for academics to analyse the effectiveness of visits (return visit behaviour and length of sessions) depending on their traffic source: direct visits, referring site entries and search engine visits. In other words, how deep do visitors navigate into the web site? Which is their internal performance depending on their traffic source? Design/methodology/approach - This paper addresses these questions by time series analysis of Google Analytics data. Some statistical matters with regard to the use of Google Analytics data in combination with time series methodology are fine-tuned. Findings - Return visits are the main engine for nurturing session length, but which type of traffic source nurtures these return visits? In order to answer this question, an important distinction must be made between "total return visits" and "marginal return visits". Site entries stay longer to the extent their "marginal return effectiveness" is higher. For our particular web site direct visits are the most effective ones, followed by search engine visits and only thirdly link-entries. Research limitations/implications - This methodology is critical for an effective web site traffic source monitoring and benchmarking that may lead to better web site strategies. Originality/value - The importance of this paper is not the particular web site but the new methodology tested to arrive at these results, an experiment that could be repeated with different web sites.

However, most algorithms typically just find a single (possibly non-novel/actionable) interpretation of the data even though alternatives could exist. The problem of finding an alternative to a given original clustering has received little attention in the literature. Current techniques (including our previous work) are unfocused/unrefined in that they broadly attempt to find an alternative clustering but do not specify which properties of the original clustering should or should not be retained. In this work, we explore a principled and flexible framework in order to find alternative clusterings of the data. The approach is principled since it poses a constrained optimization problem, so its exact behavior is understood. It is flexible since the user can formally specify positive and negative feedback based on the existing clustering, which ranges from which clusters to keep (or not) to making a trade-off between alternativeness and clustering quality.

As an important branch of spatial data mining, spatial outlier detection aims to discover the objects whose non-spatial attribute values are significantly different from the values of their spatial neighbors. These objects, called spatial outliers, may reveal important phenomena in a number of applications including traffic control, satellite image analysis, weather forecast, and medical diagnosis. Most of the existing spatial outlier detection algorithms mainly focus on identifying single attribute outliers and could potentially misclassify normal objects as outliers when their neighborhoods contain real spatial outliers with very large or small attribute values. In addition, many spatial applications contain multiple non-spatial attributes which should be processed altogether to identify outliers. To address these two issues, we formulate the spatial outlier detection problem in a general way, design two robust detection algorithms, one for single attribute and the other for multiple attributes, and analyze their computational complexities. Experiments were conducted on a real-world data set, West Nile virus data, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

J	Karakasis, VK; Stafylopatis, A				Karakasis, Vasileios K.; Stafylopatis, Andreas			Efficient Evolution of Accurate Classification Rules Using a Combination of Gene Expression Programming and Clonal Selection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Artificial immune systems; clonal selection principle; data mining; gene expression programming	SYSTEM	A hybrid evolutionary technique is proposed for data mining tasks, which combines a principle inspired by the immune system, namely the clonal selection principle, with a more common, though very efficient, evolutionary technique, gene expression programming (GEP). The clonal selection principle regulates the immune response in order to successfully recognize and confront any foreign antigen, and at the same time allows the amelioration of the immune response across successive appearances of the same antigen. On the other hand, gene expression programming is the descendant of genetic algorithms and genetic programming and eliminates their main disadvantages, such as the genotype-phenotype coincidence, though it preserves their advantageous features. In order to perform the data mining task, the proposed algorithm introduces the notion of a data class antigen, which is used to represent a class of data. the produced rules are evolved by our clonal selection algorithm (CSA), which extends the recently proposed CLONALG algorithm. In CSA, among other new features, a receptor editing step has been incorporated. Moreover, the rules themselves are represented as antibodies that are coded as GEP chromosomes in order to exploit the flexibility and the expressiveness of such encoding. The proposed hybrid technique is tested on a set of benchmark problems in comparison to GEP. In almost all problems considered, the results are very satisfactory and outperform conventional GEP both in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Earlier work on mining generalized association rules, however, required the taxonomies to be static, ignoring the fact that the taxonomies of items cannot necessarily be kept unchanged. For instance, some items may be reclassified from one hierarchy tree to another for more suitable classification, abandoned from the taxonomies if they will no longer be produced, or added into the taxonomies as new items. Additionally, the analysts might have to dynamically adjust the taxonomies from different viewpoints so as to discover more informative rules. Under these circumstances, effectively updating the discovered generalized association rules is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose two novel algorithms, called Diff_ET and Diff_ET2, to update the discovered frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are very effective and have good linear scale-up characteristics.

Since learning functions have been widely applied, we take this group of functions as an example to demonstrate the proposed procedure. Based on the concept of Support Vector Machine (SVM), three major stages of preliminary pruning, fitting function, and refining are proposed to discover a subset that possess the characteristics of some learning function from the given large data set. Three models were used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed pruning procedure and the results have shown to be promising in application.

The study compares alternative data mining techniques in combination with traditional regression methods and uses propensity scoring to differentiate the predictive power of various models. The study demonstrates that data mining methods can be applied to large, complex, public-use Medicare insurance claims files to reveal insights such as geographic variation in healthcare delivery practice patterns for lung cancer. The results indicate that decision trees and artificial neural networks, particularly when used in combination, can produce better predictive and descriptive models than regression alone to guide healthcare decisions.

J	Talia, D; Trunfio, P; Verta, O				Talia, Domenico; Trunfio, Paolo; Verta, Oreste			The Weka4WS framework for distributed data mining in service-oriented Grids	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						Grid computing; distributed data mining; Web services resource framework	TOOLKIT	The service-oriented architecture paradigm can he exploited for the implementation of data and knowledge based I applications in distributed environments. The Web services resource framework (WSRF) has recently emerged as the standard for the implementation of Grid services and applications. WSRF can be exploited for developing high-level services for distributed data mining applications. This paper describes Weka4WS, a framework that extends the widely used open source Weka toolkit to support distributed data mining on WSRF-enabled Grids. Weka4WS adopts the WSRF technology for running remote data mining algorithms and managing distributed computations. The Weka4WS user interface supports the execution of both local and remote data mining tasks. On every computing node, a WSRF-compliant Web service is used to expose all the data mining algorithms provided by the Weka library. The paper describes the design and implementation of Weka4WS using the WSRF libraries and services provided by Globus Toolkit 4. A performance analysis of Weka4WS for executing distributed data mining tasks in different network scenarios is presented. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The analysis of this research will be based on data collected from questionnaires and the correlation analysis between the factors from five experiential marketing modules, Internet involvement degree, demographic variables and customers' loyalty and praise. The results show that, firstly, female bloggers are more impressed by think experiential module than male bloggers, and male bloggers are more impressed by act experiential module than female bloggers. Secondly, the sense experiential module will affect the visiting willingness of bloggers. Thirdly, the sense and relate experiential module will influence the loyalty and praise of bloggers. Finally, if we emphasis the marketing factors in act and relate experiential module, it will attract more visit from bloggers with high loyalty and praise. The major contribution of this research is to outline the factors that affect the integration of experiential marketing and Blogs for Internet marketing.			jjsheu@mail.ndhit.edu.tw					Andoh-Baidoo FK, 2007, EXPERT SYST APPL, V32, P703, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.01.020; Cios KJ, 2002, ARTIF INTELL MED, V26, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0933-3657(02)00049-0; COHEN H, 2005, BLOG MARKETING STRAT; Dick A.

J	Hu, HL; Chen, YL				Hu, Hui-Ling; Chen, Yen-Liang			Mining typical patterns from databases	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Typical patterns mining; data mining; clustering	FUZZY; SYSTEM; SETS	There have been many approaches used to discover useful information patterns from databases, such as concept description, associations, sequential patterns, classification, clustering. and deviation detection. This paper proposes a new type of information pattern, called a typical pattern, which is a small subset of objects selected from a large dataset that provides a compact and Suitable representation of the original dataset. The Typical Patterns Mining (TPM) algorithm is developed to mine typical patterns from databases. Extensive experiments are carried out using a real dataset to demonstrate the usefulness of typical patterns in practical situations. The experimental results indicate that TPM is a computationally efficient method and that typical patterns can provide a compact and suitable representation of the original dataset.

Mining data streams is more difficult than mining static databases because the huge, high-speed and continuous characteristics of streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new one-pass algorithm called DSM-MFI (stands for Data Stream Mining for Maximal Frequent Itemsets), which mines the set of all maximal frequent itemsets in landmark windows over data streams. A new summary data structure called summary frequent itemset forest (abbreviated as SFI-forest) is developed for incremental maintaining the essential information about maximal frequent itemsets embedded in the stream so far. Theoretical analysis and experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable for mining the set of all maximal frequent itemsets over the entire history of the data streams.

J	Richardson, M				Richardson, Matthew			Learning about the World through Long-Term Query Logs	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB			English	Article						Algorithms; Measurement; Experimentation; Human Factors; query logs; knowledge discovery; user behavior; data mining		In this article, we demonstrate the value of long-term query logs. Most work on query logs to date considers only short-term (within-session) query information. In contrast, we show that long-term query logs can be used to learn about the world we live in. There are many applications of this that lead not only to improving the search engine for its users, but also potentially to advances in other disciplines such as medicine, sociology, economics, and more. In this article, we will show how long-term query logs can be used for these purposes, and that their potential is severely reduced if the logs are limited to short time horizons. We show that query effects are long-lasting, provide valuable information, and might be used to automatically make medical discoveries, build concept hierarchies, and generally learn about the sociological behavior of users. We believe these applications are only the beginning of what can be done with the information contained in long-term query logs, and see this work as a step toward unlocking their potential.

J	Weiss, GM; Tian, Y				Weiss, Gary M.; Tian, Ye			Maximizing classifier utility when there are data acquisition and modeling costs	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; induction; decision trees; utility-based data mining; cost-sensitive learning; active learning		Classification is a well-studied problem in data mining. Classification performance was originally gauged almost exclusively using predictive accuracy, but as work in the field progressed, more sophisticated measures of classifier utility that better represented the value of the induced knowledge were introduced. Nonetheless, most work still ignored the cost of acquiring training examples, even though this cost impacts the total utility of the data mining process. In this article we analyze the relationship between the number of acquired training examples and the utility of the data mining process and, given the necessary cost information, we determine the number of training examples that yields the optimum overall performance. We then extend this analysis to include the cost of model induction-measured in terms of the CPU time required to generate the model. While our cost model does not take into account all possible costs, our analysis provides some useful insights and a template for future analyses using more sophisticated cost models. Because our analysis is based on experiments that acquire the full set of training examples, it cannot directly be used to find a classifier with optimal or near-optimal total utility. To address this issue we introduce two progressive sampling strategies that are empirically shown to produce classifiers with near-optimal total utility.

This paper presents a novel approach for revealing neglected conditions that integrates static program analysis and advanced data mining techniques to discover implicit conditional rules in a code base and to discover rule violations that indicate neglected conditions. The approach requires the user to indicate minimal constraints on the context of the rules to be sought, rather than specific rule templates. To permit this generality, rules are modeled as graph minors of enhanced procedure dependence graphs (EPDGs), in which control and data dependence edges are augmented by edges representing shared data dependences. A heuristic maximal frequent subgraph mining algorithm is used to extract candidate rules from EPDGs and a heuristic graph matching algorithm is used to identify rule violations. We also report the results of an empirical study in which the approach was applied to four open source projects (openssl, make, procmail, amaya). These results indicate that the approach is effective and reasonably efficient.

Dynamic data assigning assessment clustering of streaming data	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						objective function-based clustering; incremental clustering; noise clustering	COMPUTER VISION	Discovering interesting patterns or substructures in data streams is an important challenge in data mining. Clustering algorithms are very often applied to identify single substructures although they are designed to partition a data set. Another problem of clustering algorithms is that most of them are not designed for data streams. This paper discusses a recently introduced procedure that deals with both problems. The procedure explores ideas from cluster analysis, but was designed to identify single clusters without the necessity to partition the whole data set into clusters. The new extended version of the algorithm is an incremental clustering approach applicable to stream data. It identifies new clusters formed by the incoming data and updates the data space partition. Clustering of artificial and real data sets illustrates the abilities of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Detecting word substitutions in text	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						textual analysis; counterterrorism; word frequencies; data mining; pointwise mutual information; co-occurrence		Searching for words on a watchlist is one way in which large-scale surveillance of communication can be done, for example, in intelligence and counterterrorism settings. One obvious defense is to replace words that might attract attention to a message with other more innocuous words. For example, the sentence "the attack will be tomorrow" might be altered to "the complex will be tomorrow," since "complex" is a word whose frequency is close to that of "attack." Such substitutions are readily detectable by humans since they do not make sense. We address the problem of detecting such substitutions automatically by looking for discrepancies between words and their contexts and using only syntactic information. We define a set of measures, each of which is quite weak, but which together produce per-sentence detection rates around 90 percent with false positive rates around 10 percent. Rules for combining per-sentence detection into per-message detection can reduce the false positive and false negative rates for messages to practical levels. We test the approach using sentences from the Enron e-mail and Brown corpora, representing informal and formal text, respectively.

Although there are methods from data mining and social network analysis focusing on finding patterns or central nodes from networks or numerical data sets, there has been little work aimed at discovering abnormal instances in large complex semantic graphs, whose nodes are richly connected with many different types of links. In this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised framework to identify such instances. Besides discovering abnormal instances, we believe that to complete the process, a system has to also provide users with understandable explanations for its findings. Therefore, in the second part of the paper, we describe an explanation mechanism to automatically generate human-understandable explanations for the discovered results. To evaluate our discovery and explanation systems, we perform experiments on several different semantic graphs. The results show that our discovery system outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised network algorithms used to analyze the 9/11 terrorist network and other graph-based outlier detection algorithms by a significant margin. Additionally, the human study we conducted demonstrates that our explanation system, which provides natural language explanations for the system's findings, allowed human subjects to perform complex data analysis in a much more efficient and accurate manner.

For example, each value observed at a given time- stamp from environmental sensors may have an associated type ( e. g., temperature, humidity, etc.) as well as location. Time- stamp, type and location are the three aspects, which can be modeled using a tensor ( highorder array). However, the time aspect is special, with a natural ordering, and with successive time- ticks having usually correlated values. Standard multiway analysis ignores this structure. To capture it, we propose 2 Heads Tensor Analysis ( 2- heads), which provides a qualitatively different treatment on time. Unlike most existing approaches that use a PCA- like summarization scheme for all aspects, 2- heads treats the time aspect carefully. 2- heads combines the power of classic multilinear analysis with wavelets, leading to a powerful mining tool. Furthermore, 2- heads has several other advantages as well: ( a) it can be computed incrementally in a streaming fashion, ( b) it has a provable error guarantee and, ( c) it achieves significant compression ratio against competitors. Finally, we show experiments on real datasets, and we illustrate how 2- heads reveals interesting trends in the data.

J	Yin, JS; Hu, DW; Zhou, ZT				Yin, Junsong; Hu, Dewen; Zhou, Zongtan			Noisy manifold learning using neighborhood smoothing embedding	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Neighbor Smoothing Embedding (NSE); manifold learning; locally linear embedding (LLE); local linear surface estimator	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FACE RECOGNITION; SURFACES	Manifold learning is an important dimensionality reduction tool that discovers the structure of high dimensional data and provides understanding of multidimensional patterns in data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Several manifold learning algorithms are applied to extract the intrinsic features of different prototypes in high dimensional space by preserving the local geometric characteristics. However, due to the locality geometry preservation, these manifold learning methods, including locally linear embedding (LLE), are sensitive to noise. To solve the noisy manifold learning problem, this paper proposes a Neighbor Smoothing Embedding (NSE) for noisy points sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Based on LLE and local linear surface estimator, the NSE smoothes the neighbors of each manifold data and then computes the reconstruction matrix of the projections on the principal surface. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real world patterns demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can efficiently maintain an accurate low-dimensional representation of the noisy manifold data with less distortion, and give higher average classification rates compared to others.

Particularly the analysis of concurrent and multidimensional sequences poses new challenges in finding clusters of arbitrary length and varying number of attributes.

Since the k-medoid problem is NP-hard, all existing work deals with approximate solutions on relatively small datasets. This paper aims at efficient methods for very large spatial databases, motivated by: (1) the high and ever increasing availability of spatial data, and (2) the need for novel query types and improved services. The proposed solutions exploit the intrinsic grouping properties of a data partition index in order to read only a small part of the dataset. Compared to previous approaches, we achieve results of comparable or better quality at a small fraction of the CPU and I/O costs (seconds as opposed to hours, and tens of node accesses instead of thousands). In addition, we study medoid-aggregate queries, where k is not known in advance, but we are asked to compute a medoid set that leads to an average distance close to a user-specified value. Similarly, medoid-optimization queries aim at minimizing both the number of medoids k and the average distance. We also consider the max version for the aforementioned problems, where the goal is to minimize the maximum (instead of the average) distance between any object and its closest medoid. Finally, we investigate bichromatic and weighted medoid versions for all query types, as well as, maximum capacity and dynamic medoids.

J	Zhang, JJ				Zhang, Jiji			Causal reasoning with ancestral graphs	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						ancestral graphs; causal Bayesian network; do-calculus; intervention	MARKOV EQUIVALENCE; MODELS	Causal reasoning is primarily concerned with what would happen to a system under external interventions. In particular, we are often interested in predicting the probability distribution of some random variables that would result if some other variables were forced to take certain values. One prominent approach to tackling this problem is based on causal Bayesian networks, using directed acyclic graphs as causal diagrams to relate post-intervention probabilities to pre-intervention probabilities that are estimable from observational data. However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams ( rather than a single one). This paper is concerned with causal reasoning given an equivalence class of causal diagrams, represented by a (partial) ancestral graph. We present two main results. The first result extends Pearl (1995)'s celebrated do-calculus to the context of ancestral graphs. In the second result, we focus on a key component of Pearl's calculus-the property of invariance under interventions, and give stronger graphical conditions for this property than those implied by the first result. The second result also improves the earlier, similar results due to Spirtes et al. (1993).

Most of this data is multiattribute ( multidimensional) and temporal in nature. Data mining and business intelligence techniques are often used to discover patterns in such data; however, mining temporal relationships typically is a complex task. We propose a new data analysis and visualization technique for representing trends in multiattribute temporal data using a clustering-based approach. We introduce Cluster-based Temporal Representation of EveNt Data (C-TREND), a system that implements the temporal cluster graph construct, which maps multiattribute temporal data to a two-dimensional directed graph that identifies trends in dominant data types over time. In this paper, we present our temporal clustering-based technique, discuss its algorithmic implementation and performance, demonstrate applications of the technique by analyzing data on wireless networking technologies and baseball batting statistics, and introduce a set of metrics for further analysis of discovered trends.

J	Pach, FP; Gyenesei, A; Abonyi, J				Pach, Ferenc Peter; Gyenesei, Attila; Abonyi, Janos			Compact fuzzy association rule-based classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						input partitioning; fuzzy clustering; associative classification		Classification is one of the most popular data mining techniques applied to many scientific and industrial problems. The efficiency of a classification model is evaluated by two parameters, namely the accuracy and the interpretability of the model. While most of the existing methods claim their accurate superiority over others, their models are usually complex and hardly understandable for the users. In this paper, we propose a novel classification model that is based on easily interpretable fuzzy association rules and fulfils both efficiency criteria. Since the accuracy of a classification model can be largely affected by the partitioning of numerical attributes, this paper discusses several fuzzy and crisp partitioning techniques. The proposed classification method is compared to 15 previously published association rule-based classifiers by testing them on five benchmark data sets. The results show that the fuzzy association rule-based classifier presented in this paper, offers a compact, understandable and accurate classification model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhan, J				Zhan, Justin			Privacy-preserving collaborative data mining	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article								Data collection is a necessary step in data raining process. Due to privacy reasons, collecting data from different paries becomes difficult. Privacy concerns may prevent the parties from directly sharing the data and some types of information about the data. How multiple parties collaboratively conduct data mining without breaching data privacy presents a challenge. The objective of this paper is to provide solutions for privacy-preserving collaborative data mining problems. In particular, we illustrate how to conduct privacy-preserving naive Bayesian classification which is one of the data mining tasks. To measure the privacy level for privacy-preserving schemes, we propose a definition of privacy and show that our Solutions preserve data privacy.

In recent years, Artificial Intelligence techniques are widely being used in data mining applications where conventional statistical methods were used such as Regression and classification. The aim of this work is to show the applicability of Gene Expression Programming (GEP), a recently developed AI technique, for hydraulic data prediction and to evaluate its performance by comparing it with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Both GEP and MLR were used to model the hydraulic jump over a roughened bed using very large series of experimental data that contain all the important flow and roughness parameters such as the initial Froude number, the height of roughness ratio, the length of roughness ratio, the initial length ratio (from the gate) and the roughness density. The results show that GEP is a promising AI approach for hydraulic data prediction.

A neural network job-shop scheduler	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						artificial neural networks; scheduling; job-shop; machine learning; genetic algorithms		This paper focuses on the development of a neural network (NN) scheduler for scheduling job-shops. In this hybrid intelligent system, genetic algorithms (GA) are used to generate optimal schedules to a known benchmark problem. In each optimal solution, every individually scheduled operation of a job is treated as a decision which contains knowledge. Each decision is modeled as a function of a set of job characteristics (e.g., processing time), which are divided into classes using domain knowledge from common dispatching rules (e.g., shortest processing time). A NN is used to capture the predictive knowledge regarding the assignment of operation's position in a sequence. The trained NN could successfully replicate the performance of the GA on the benchmark problem. The developed NN scheduler was then tested against the GA, Attribute-Oriented Induction data mining methodology and common dispatching rules on a test set of randomly generated problems. The better performance of the NN scheduler on the test problem set compared to other methods proves the feasibility of NN-based scheduling. The scalability of the NN scheduler on larger problem sizes was also found to be satisfactory in replicating the performance of the GA.

In information fusion and data mining, a mathematical tool is needed to aggregate contributions from each predictive attribute to the target. Essentially, it is a mapping from a higher dimensional space (sample space) to a lower dimensional space (decision space). The mapping, of course, depends on the nonadditive set function. Such a tool is generally called an integral. Due to the nonadditivity of the set function, the integral is a nonlinear functional defined on the set of the so-called nonnegative measurable functions, where each function is a point in the sample space. The upper integral, the lower integral, and the Choquet integral are some special types of nonlinear integrals. When the set of attributes is finite, all nonlinear integrals are generally called indeterminate integrals. In this case, the upper integral and the lower integral are two extreme specified indeterminate integrals. A way for calculating the newly defined integrals is shown in this paper when the universal set (the set of attributes) is finite. Recalling the concept of indeterminate integral, the value of any specified indeterminate integral of a given function can be expressed as a convex combination of the values of its upper integral and lower integral. In such a point of view, the inverse problem of the indeterminate integral with respect to a given nonadditive set function is rather easy to be solved. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Preisach, C; Schmidt-Thieme, L				Preisach, Christine; Schmidt-Thieme, Lars			Ensembles of relational classifiers	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						relational data mining; ensemble classification; sparse graphs; relational autocorrelation		Relational classification aims at including relations among entities into the classification process, for example taking relations among documents such as common authors or citations into account. However, considering more than one relation can further improve classification accuracy. Here we introduce a new approach to make use of several relations as well as both, relations and local attributes for classification using ensemble methods. To accomplish this, we present a generic relational ensemble model that can use different relational and local classifiers as components. Furthermore, we discuss solutions for several problems concerning relational data such as heterogeneity, sparsity, and multiple relations. Especially the sparsity problem will be discussed in more detail. We introduce a new method called PRNMultiHop that tries to handle this problem. Furthermore we categorize relational methods in a systematic way. Finally, we provide empirical evidence, that our relational ensemble methods outperform existing relational classification methods, even rather complex models such as relational probability trees (RPTs), relational dependency networks (RDNs) and relational Bayesian classifiers (RBCs).

J	Sohn, SY; Kim, Y				Sohn, So Young; Kim, Yoonseong			Searching customer patterns of mobile service using clustering and quantitative association rule	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; clustering; association rules; mobile telecommunication	MARKET-SEGMENTATION	This study presents the patterns of use for additional services that are currently provided to mobile telecommunication subscribers in Korea. Factor analysis, clustering and quantitative association rules are used to find the service adoption patterns of segmented groups. From the analysis, three types of user groups are identified. The first group consists of a new generation of customers who utilize chargeable additional services using the 'direct button', for leisure and entertainment. The younger generation use their mobile phones more frequently than the older generation, and tend to display higher usage patterns for a variety of additional services. The second group utilizes practical additional services that are low-priced or free such as 'data service' and 'phone-to-phone service' via 'Caller ID request service'. The customers in the final group are people who have no general usage characteristics. This paper utilizes the association rules found in each cluster to provide strategic guidance to enhance mobile service market of the corresponding group. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thabtah, F; Cowling, P				Thabtah, Fadi; Cowling, Peter			Mining the data from a hyperheuristic approach using associative classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						associative classification; classification; data mining; hyperheuristic; scheduling		Associative classification is a promising classification approach that utilises association rule mining to construct accurate classification models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of associative classifiers as well as other traditional classifiers such as decision trees and rule inducers in solutions (data sets) produced by a general-purpose optimisation heuristic called the hyperheuristic for a personnel scheduling problem. The hyperheuristic requires us to decide which of several simpler search neighbourhoods to apply at each step while constructing a solutions. After experimenting 16 different solution generated by a hyperheuristic called Peckish using different classification approaches, the results indicated that associative classification approach is the most applicable approach to such kind of problems with reference to accuracy. Particularly, associative classification algorithms such as CBA, MCAR and MMAC were able to predict the selection of low-level heuristics from the data sets more accurately than C4.5, RIPPER and PART algorithms, respectively.

Some simple explanations to this phenomenon are the intellectual complexity presented by this domain, as well as the dominant industry market share of healthcare. Following in AI's tracks, case-based reasoning (CBR) has been abundantly applied to the health sciences domain and has produced an excellent as well as varied set of publications, which has fostered CBR research innovation to answer some of the research issues associated with this intricate domain. Some notable examples are synergies with other AI methodologies, and in particular with ontologies [8] and with data mining, the study of the temporal dimension in CBR, the processing of multimedia cases, and novel tasks for CBR such as parameter setting. However CBR has a major endeavor to take on in the health sciences: how to position itself with regard to statistics for studying data? Some claim that CBR proposes an alternative viewpoint on the concept of evidence in biomedicine; others that CBR and statistics complement one another in this domain. In any case, an interesting question to study is whether CBR could become one day as fundamental to the health sciences as statistics is today? This question in particular broadens the health sciences challenge to a universal scope.

Reducing uninteresting spatial association rules in geographic databases using background knowledge: a summary of results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						spatial data mining; spatial association rules; background knowledge; frequent pattern mining; geographic databases; knowledge discovery		Many association rule-mining algorithms have been proposed in the last few years. Their main drawback is the huge amount of generated patterns. In spatial association rule mining, besides the large amount of rules, many are well-known geographic domain associations explicitly represented in geographic database schemas. Existing algorithms have only considered the data, while the schema has not been considered. The result is that also the associations explicitly represented in geographic database schemas are extracted by association rule-mining algorithms. With the aim to reduce the number of well-known patterns and association rules, this paper presents a summary of results of a novel approach to extract patterns from geographic databases. A two step-pruning method is presented to avoid the generation of association rules that are previously known to be uninteresting. Experiments with real geographic databases show a considerable time reduction in both geographic data pre-processing and spatial association rule mining, with a very significant reduction in the total number of rules.

The majority of the work done concerning finite mixture models has focused on mixtures for continuous data. However, many applications involve and generate discrete data for which discrete mixtures are better suited. In this paper, we investigate the problem of discrete data modeling using finite mixture models. We propose a novel mixture that we call the multinomial generalized Dirichlet mixture.

J	Chen, H; Jiang, G; Yoshihira, K				Chen, Haifeng; Jiang, Guofei; Yoshihira, Kenji			Monitoring high-dimensional data for failure detection and localization in large-scale computing systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						failure detection; manifold learning; statistics; data mining; information system; Internet applications	NOVELTY DETECTION; REDUCTION	It is a major challenge to process high-dimensional measurements for failure detection and localization in large-scale computing systems. However, it is observed that in information systems, those measurements are usually located in a low-dimensional structure that is embedded in the high-dimensional space. From this perspective, a novel approach is proposed to model the geometry of underlying data generation and detect anomalies based on that model. We consider both linear and nonlinear data generation models. Two statistics, that is, the Hotelling T-2 and the squared prediction error ( SPE), are used to reflect data variations within and outside the model. We track the probabilistic density of extracted statistics to monitor the system's health. After a failure has been detected, a localization process is also proposed to find the most suspicious attributes related to the failure. Experimental results on both synthetic data and a real e-commerce application demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and localizing failures in computing systems.

The relevant features of non-stationary time series data from power network disturbances are extracted using a multiresolution S-transform which can be treated either as a phase corrected wavelet transform or a variable window short-time Fourier transform. After extracting the relevant features from the time series data, an integrated LVQ neural network and various feed-forward neural network architectures are used for pattern recognition of disturbance waveform data. The fuzzy MLP outperforms all the other different connectionist models and is used in the final stage for encoding knowledge in the connection weights that are used to generate rules for fuzzy inferencing of the disturbance patterns. Overall pattern classification accuracy of 99% is achieved for power signal time series data. The knowledge discovery from the data has then been presented for selected patterns using the new quantification procedures. The approach presented in this paper is a general one and can be applied to any time series data sequence for mining for similarities in the data. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Out, protocols achieve full simulation-based security in the presence of malicious adversaries, and call be run oil very large inputs. We present protocols for secure set intersection, oblivious database search and more. We have also implemented out, set intersection protocol in order to show that it is truly practical: on sets of size 30,000 elements takes 20 seconds for one party and 30 minutes for the other (where the latter can be parallelized to further reduce the time). This demonstrates that in setting as where physical smartcards can be sent between parties (as in the case of private data mining tasks between security and governmental agencies), it is possible to use secure protocols with proven simulation-based security.

We use a swarm intelligence algorithm to select the type of classification algorithm to be used at each "classifier node" in a classifier tree. These classifier nodes are used in a top-down divide and conquer fashion to classify the examples from hierarchical data sets. In this paper we propose a swarm intelligence based approach which attempts to mitigate a major drawback with a recently proposed local search-based, greedy algorithm. Our swarm intelligence based approach is able to take into account classifier interactions whereas the greedy algorithm is not. We evaluate our proposed method against the greedy method in four challenging bioinformatics data sets and find that, overall, there is a significant increase in performance.

A saying holds true in regard to knowledge management systems (KMS) "no measurement-no management". Without accurate measurement it is impossible to gauge the actual performance and value of KMS. In this study, we have used a survey to investigate the effects of KMS for disease classification in a major Taiwanese medical center. Structural modeling techniques were applied to the data collected by questionnaires from 163 KMS system users. The results exhibited a good fit with the data and appeared to be superior in explaining the effectiveness and influence of KMS adoption.

Anomaly detection using temporal data mining in a smart home environment	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						machine learning; smart homes; anomaly detection; temporal relations		Objectives: To many people, home is a sanctuary. With the maturing of smart home technologies, many people with cognitive and physical disabilities can lead independent lives in their own homes for extended periods of time. In this paper, we investigate the design of machine learning algorithms that support this goal. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can be designed to automatically learn models of resident behavior in a smart home, and that the results can be used to perform automated health monitoring and to detect anomalies. Methods: Specifically, our algorithms draw upon the temporal nature of sensor data collected in a smart home to build a model of expected activities and to detect unexpected, and possibly health-critical, events in the home. Results: We validate our algorithms using synthetic data and real activity data collected from volunteers in an automated smart environment. Conclusions: The results from our experiments support our hypothesis that a model can be learned from observed smart home data and used to report anomalies, as they occur, in a smart home.

Since its inception, a number of significant FIM algorithms have been developed to speed up mining performance. Unfortunately, when the dataset size is huge, both the memory use and computational cost can still be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose to parallelize the FP-Growth algorithm (we call our parallel algorithm PFP) on distributed machines. PFP partitions computation in such a way that each machine executes an independent group of mining tasks. Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies between machines, and thereby communication between them. Through empirical study on a large dataset of 802, 939 Web pages and 1, 021, 107 tags, we demonstrate that PFP can achieve virtually linear speedup. Besides scalability, the empirical study demonstrates that PFP to be promising for supporting query recommendation for search engines.

It particularly explores the probabilistic inferencing problem in the context of a distributed Boltzmann machine-based framework for monitoring the network. The paper offers a variational mean-field approach to develop communication-efficient local algorithm for variational inferencing in distributed environments (VIDE). It compares the performance of the proposed approximate variational technique with respect to the exact and centralized techniques. It shows that the VIDE offers a much more communication-efficient solution at very little cost in terms of the accuracy. It also offers experimental results in order to substantiate the scalability of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are robust and have a good tolerance to noise, which makes them suitable for mining very noisy data. Although they may achieve high classification accuracy, they have the well-known disadvantage of having black-box nature and not discovering any high-level rule that can be used as a support for human understanding. The main challenge in using ANN in DM applications is to get explicit knowledge from these models. For this purpose, a study on knowledge acquirement from trained ANNs for classification problems is presented. The proposed method uses Touring Ant Colony Optimization (TACO) algorithm for extracting accurate and comprehensible rules from databases via trained artificial neural networks. The suggested algorithm is experimentally evaluated on different benchmark data sets. Results show that the proposed approach has a potential to generate accurate and concise rules.

This method does not require the expansion of dimensionality of the input vectors used in time series, compared to other methods which multiply inputs. The proposed classifier uses the dynamical systems as its core and nonlinear Kalman filtering as its learning algorithm. Presented herein results are the performance tests of proposed classifier applied in a real life problem - bankruptcy, prediction, which is one of the fundamentals application of data mining in finance. The results achieved by the presented method were compared to other very popular classifiers and these experiments prove greater classification accuracy of the proposed method.

This situation is natural when data is collected by channels that are physically separated. For distributed prediction, we show that a technique called attribute ensembles is simple, predicts almost as well as a centralized predictor, reduces the amount of communication required, distributes computation and data access well, and allows each local site to keep its raw data private. We show how to extend attribute ensembles to data that is partitioned both horizontally and vertically. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Skillicorn, D. B.; McConnell, S.

The RF distance matrix represents a tremendous data-mining opportunity for helping biologists understand the evolutionary relationships depicted among their trees. The novelty of our work results from using a variety of different architecture and implementation-independent measures (i.e., percentage of bipartition sharing, number of bipartition comparisons, and memory usage) in addition to CPU time to explore practical algorithmic performance. Overall, our study concludes that HashRF performs better across the various performance measures than its competitor, PGM-Hashed. Thus, the HashRF algorithm provides scientists with a fast approach for understanding the evolutionary relationships among a set of trees.

However, it still requires two database scans which are not applicable to processing data streams. In this paper, we present a novel tree structure, called CP-tree (Compact Pattern tree), that captures database information with one scan (Insertion phase) and provides the same mining performance as the FP-growth method (Restructuring phase) by dynamic tree restructuring process. Moreover, CP-tree can give full functionalities for interactive and incremental mining. Extensive experimental results show that the CP-tree is efficient for frequent pattern mining, interactive, and incremental mining with single database scan.

However, most of those techniques have annoying obstacles in precise pattern recognition. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm termed G-TREACLE, which can fulfill numerous clustering requirements in data mining applications. As a hybrid approach that adopts grid-based concept, the proposed algorithm recognizes the solid framework of clusters and, then, identifies the arbitrary edge of clusters by utilization of a new density-based expansion process, which named "tree-alike pattern". Experimental results illustrate that the new algorithm precisely recognizes the whole cluster, and efficiently reduces the problem of high computational time. It also indicates that the proposed new clustering algorithm performs better than several existing well-known approaches such as the K-means, DBSCAN, CLIQUE and GDH algorithms, while produces much smaller errors than the K-means, DBSCAN, CLIQUE and GDH approaches in most the cases examined herein.

Bayesian networks for imputation in classification problems	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						missing values; Bayesian networks; data mining	EM ALGORITHM; MISSING DATA; CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES; FEATURE-SELECTION; INDUCTION; MIXTURES	Missing values are an important problem in data mining. In order to tackle this problem in classification tasks, we propose two imputation methods based on Bayesian networks. These methods are evaluated in the context of both prediction and classification tasks. We compare the obtained results with those achieved by classical imputation methods (Expectation-Maximization, Data Augmentation, Decision Trees, and Mean/Mode). Our simulations were performed by means of four datasets (Congressional Voting Records, Mushroom, Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Adult), which are benchmarks for data mining methods. Missing values were simulated in these datasets by means of the elimination of some known values. Thus, it is possible to assess the prediction capability of an imputation method, comparing the original values with the imputed ones. In addition, we propose a methodology to estimate the bias inserted by imputation methods in classification tasks. In this sense, we use four classifiers (One Rule, Naive Bayes, J4.8 Decision Tree and PART) to evaluate the employed imputation methods in classification scenarios. Computing times consumed to perform imputations are also reported. Simulation results in terms of prediction, classification, and computing times allow us performing several analyses, leading to interesting conclusions. Bayesian networks have shown to be competitive with classical imputation methods.

In this paper, we formalize a set-theoretic model for computing such a similarity measure. Roughly speaking, in this model we have k > 1 partitions (clusters) of the same data set each containing the same number of sets and the goal is to align the sets in each partition to minimize a similarity measure. For k = 2, a polynomial-time solution was proposed by Gusfield (Information Processing Letters 82 (2002) 159-164). In this paper, we show that the problem is MAX-SNP-hard for k = 3 even if each partition in each cluster contains no more than 2 elements and provide a 2-2/k-approximation algorithm for the problem for any k.

With them biologists can have a powerful new tool to analyse the complex dynamical process of living organisms. These technologies are challenging traditional scientific disciplines, including Computer Science and Statistics. The reason of this challenge is based on the novel type of large-scale data mining applications. A typical microarray experiment is very costly and, due to budget limitations, the ratio of experiments to genes is generally on the order of 1/100. As a consequence, we rely on combinatorial optimization formalisms to develop robust feature selection methods. In this paper we demonstrate their usefulness in selecting genes that allow a molecular classijication of cancer samples when we are given as labels their assumed origin (Colon, Melanoma, etc.). We present some results on five types of cancer presented on a public domain dataset which will allow for the reproducibility of our results.

Internet-based remote supervision of industrial processes using self-organizing maps	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						self-organizing maps; internet-based supervision; three-layer architecture; visualization and data mining techniques; remote supervision	METRICS; SYSTEM	In upcoming years, the strategies for maintenance, traceability, management and operation of productive processes will demand the use of novel information and communication technologies. Supervisory systems in these new scenarios will have to be able to integrate large volumes of information and knowledge coming both from local and remote points of large processes. These systems will therefore require new tools for management and integration of information and knowledge. In this work, the authors present an internet-based remote supervision system of industrial processes that incorporates powerful data and knowledge visualization tools based on self-organizing maps (SOM). This architecture adds an intermediate layer (database) to the well-known client and server layers, that isolates the client part from the industrial process, allowing to incorporate the required data management and neural network processing tasks. Remote users have access to advanced information visualization tools based on SOM, including both static visualizations, such as component planes or distance maps, and dynamical ones, such as residuals and state trajectory, allowing the interpretation of knowledge extracted by the SOM as well as the analysis and detection of possible abnormal conditions. This architecture has been validated through the supervision of an industrial pilot plant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shih, DH; Chiang, HS; Lin, B				Shih, Dong-Her; Chiang, Hsiu-Sen; Lin, Binshan			A generalized associative Petri net for reasoning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						ontology; Petri net; reasoning; association rule; data mining	MALICIOUS CODE; ONTOLOGIES; INFERENCE	The application of fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs) to the development of intelligent systems has received increasing attention recently. However, the fuzzy production rules are rather limited if the determination of certainty factor for each proposition is subjective. Unfortunately, this is the case for many existing FPNs. This paper proposes a generalized associative Petri net (APN) model with associative degree and knowledge representation of a rule-based system. Based on the generalized APN model, an efficient reasoning algorithm is proposed. The ontology mapping and the associative reasoning algorithm are described formally in details. An example of malicious e-mail reasoning is also included as an illustration.

More and more literatures have researched the application of data mining technology in customer segmentation, and achieved sound effectives. But most of them segment customer only by single data mining technology from a special view, rather than from systematical framework. Furthermore, one of the key purposes of customer segmentation is customer retention. Although previous segment methods may identify which group needs more care, it is unable to identify customer churn trend for taking different actions. This paper focus on proposing a customer segmentation framework based on data mining and constructs a new customer segmentation method based on survival character. The new customer segmentation method consists of two steps. Firstly, with K-means clustering arithmetic, customers are clustered into different segments in which customers have the similar survival characters (churn trend). Secondly, each cluster's survival/hazard function is predicted by survival analyzing, the validity of clustering is tested and customer churn trend is identified. The method mentioned above has been applied to a dataset from China Telecom, which acquired some useful management measures and suggestions. Some propositions for further research is also suggested.

Distributed computation of the knn graph for large high-dimensional point sets	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						nearest neighbors; approximate nearest neighbors; knn graphs; range queries; metric spaces; robotics; distributed and parallel algorithms	APPROXIMATE NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; SIMILARITY QUERIES; PARALLEL; MOTION; TREE; ALGORITHM; ROADMAP; SEARCH; ROBOTS; SPACES	High-dimensional problems arising from robot motion planning, biology, data mining, and geographic information systems often require the computation of k nearest neighbor (knn) graphs. The knn graph of a data set is obtained by connecting each point to its k closest points. As the research in the above-mentioned fields progressively addresses problems of unprecedented complexity, the demand for computing knn graphs based on arbitrary distance metrics and large high-dimensional data sets increases, exceeding resources available to a single machine. In this work we efficiently distribute the computation of knn graphs for clusters of processors with message passing. Extensions to our distributed framework include the computation of graphs based on other proximity queries, such as approximate knn or range queries. Our experiments show nearly linear speedup with over 100 processors and indicate that similar speedup can be obtained with several hundred processors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, DH; Kim, YS; Park, SC; Lee, CS; Han, YK				Wang, Dianhui; Kim, Yong-Soo; Park, Seok Cheon; Lee, Chul Soo; Han, Yoon Kyung			Learning based neural similarity metrics for multimedia data mining	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						semantic images; clustering and classification; learning pseudo metrics; neural networks	RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION	Multimedia data mining refers to pattern discovery, rule extraction and knowledge acquisition from multimedia database. Two typical tasks in multimedia data mining are of visual data classification and clustering in terms of semantics. Usually performance of such classification or clustering systems may not be favorable due to the use of low-level features for image representation, and also some improper similarity metrics for measuring the closeness between multimedia objects as well. This paper considers a problem of modeling similarity for semantic image clustering. A collection of semantic images and feed-forward neural networks are used to approximate a characteristic function of equivalence classes, which is termed as a learning pseudo metric (LPM). Empirical criteria on evaluating the goodness of the LPM are established. A LPM based k-Mean rule is then employed for the semantic image clustering practice, where two impurity indices, classification performance and robustness are used for performance evaluation. An artificial image database with 11 semantics is employed for our simulation studies. Results demonstrate the merits and usefulness of our proposed techniques for multimedia data mining.

Improving the performance of the RBF neural networks trained with imbalanced samples	COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks	JUN 20-22, 2007	San Sebastian, SPAIN				CLASSIFICATION	Recently, the class imbalance problem in neural networks, is receiving growing attention in works of machine learning and data mining. This problem appears when the samples of some classes are much smaller than those in the other classes. The classes with small size can be ignored in the learning process and the convergence of these classes is very slow. This paper studies empirically the class imbalance problem in the context of the RBF neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. We propose to introduce a cost function in the training process to compensate imbalance class and one strategy to reduce the impact of the cost function in the data probability distribution.

Temporal Data Mining with temporal constraints	Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME 2007)	JUL 07-11, 2007	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS		Univ Amsterdam		KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; EVENTS	Nowadays, methods for discovering temporal knowledge try to extract more complete and representative patterns. The use of qualitative temporal constraints can be helpful in that aim, but its use should also involve methods for reasoning with them (instead of using them just as a high level representation) when a pattern consists of a constraint network instead of an isolated constraint. In this paper, we put forward a method for mining temporal patterns that makes use of a formal model for representing and reasoning with qualitative temporal constraints. Three steps should be accomplished in the method: 1) the selection of a model that allows a trade off between efficiency and representation; 2) a preprocessing step for adapting the input to the model; 3) a data mining algorithm able to deal with the properties provided by the model for generating a representative output. In order to implement this method we propose the use of the Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network (FTCN) formalism and of a temporal abstraction method for preprocessing. Finally, the ideas of the classic methods for data mining inspire an algorithm that can generate FTCNs as output. Along this paper, we focus our attention on the data mining algorithm.

Time spent using an e-Learning system is not quality time if the learner is not engaged. Tracking the student disengagement would give the possibility to intervene for motivating the learner at appropriate time. In previous research we showed the possibility to predict engagement from log files using a web-based e-Learning system. In this paper we present the results obtained from another web-based system and compare them to the previous ones. The similarity of results across systems demonstrates that our approach is system-independent and that engagement can be elicited from basic information logged by most e-Learning systems: number of pages read, time spent reading pages, number of tests/ quizzes and time spent on test/ quizzes.

Health applications often require classifiers that minimize the total cost, including misclassifications costs and test costs. In fact, there are many reasons for considering costs in medicine, as diagnostic tests are not free and health budgets are limited. Our aim with this work was to define, implement and test a strategy for cost-sensitive learning. We defined an algorithm for decision tree induction that considers costs, including test costs, delayed costs and costs associated with risk. Then we applied our strategy to train and evaluate cost-sensitive decision trees in medical data. Built trees can be tested following some strategies, including group costs, common costs, and individual costs. Using the factor of "risk" it is possible to penalize invasive or delayed tests and obtain decision trees patient-friendly.

Since the number of frequent itemsets is usually extremely large and unmanageable for a, human user, recent, works have sought to define condensed representations of them, e.g. closed or maximal frequent itemsets. We argue that not, only these methods often still fall short in sufficiently reducing of the output size, but they also output many redundant, itemsets. In this paper we propose a philosophically new approach that resolves both these issues in a computationally tractable way. We present and empirically validate a statistically founded approach called MINI, to compress the set of frequent itemsets down to a list of informative and non-redundant itemsets.

However, as processor technology evolves, said algorithms are often unable to derive the maximum achievable performance on these modern architectures. In this paper, we examine the performance of frequent pattern mining algorithms on a modern processor. A detailed performance study reveals that even the best frequent pattern mining implementations, with highly efficient memory managers, still grossly under-utilize a modern processor. The primary performance bottlenecks are poor data locality and low instruction level parallelism (ILP). We propose a cache-conscious prefix tree to address this problem. The resulting tree improves spatial locality and also enhances the benefits from hardware cache line prefetching. Furthermore, the design of this data structure allows the use of path tiling, a novel tiling strategy, to improve temporal locality. The result is an overall speedup of up to 3.2 when compared with state of the art implementations. We then show how these algorithms can be improved further by realizing a non-naive thread-based decomposition that targets simultaneously multi-threaded processors (SMT). A key aspect of this decomposition is to ensure cache re-use between threads that are co-scheduled at a fine granularity. This optimization affords an additional speedup of 50%, resulting in an overall speedup of up to 4.8. The proposed optimizations also provide performance improvements on SMPs, and will most likely be beneficial on emerging processors.

J	Huang, JP; Chen, SJ; Kuo, HC				Huang, Jen-Peng; Chen, Show-Ju; Kuo, Huang-Cheng			An efficient incremental mining algorithm-QSD	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; association rule; frequent itemset	ASSOCIATION RULES	The generation of frequent itemsets is an essential and time-consuming step in mining association rules. Most of the studies adopt the Apriori-based approach, which has great effort in generating candidate itemsets and needs multiple database accesses. Recent studies indicate that FP-tree approach has been utilized to avoid the generation of candidate itemsets and scan transaction database only twice, but they work with more complicated data structure. Besides, it needs to adjust the structure of FP-tree when it applied to incremental mining application. It is necessary to adjust the position of an item upward or downward in the structure of FP-tree when a new transaction increases or decreases the accumulation of the item. The process of the adjustment of the structure of FP-tree is the bottlenecks of the FP-tree in incremental mining application. Therefore, algorithms for efficient mining of frequent patterns are in urgent demand. This paper aims to improve both time and space efficiency in mining frequent itemsets and incremental mining application. We propose a novel QSD (Quick Simple Decomposition) algorithm using simple decompose principle which derived from minimal heap tree, we can discover the frequent itemsets quickly under one database scan. Meanwhile, QSD algorithm doesn't need to scan database and reconstruct data structure again when database is updated or minimum support is varied. It can be applied to on-line incremental mining applications without any modification. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the QSD algorithm outperforms previous algorithms.

Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled experiments with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses. Based on our extensive practical experience with multiple systems and organizations, we share key lessons that will help practitioners in running trustworthy controlled experiments.

Our first evaluation is based on a limited exemplary test set of 10 different audio reference signals recorded as mono audio data by four microphones in 10 different rooms with 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 16 bit quantisation. Note that, of course, a generalisation of the results cannot be achieved. Motivated by the syntactical and semantical analysis of information and in particular by known audio steganalysis approaches, a first set of specific features are selected for classification to evaluate, whether this first feature set can support correct classifications. The idea was mainly driven by the existing steganalysis features and the question of applicability within a first and limited test set. In the tests presented in this paper, all inter-device analysis with different device characteristics is perforated while intra-device evaluations (identical microphone models of the same manufacturer) are not considered. For classification the data mining tool WEKA with K-means as a clustering and Naive Bayes as a classification technique are applied with the goal to evaluate their classification in regard to the classification accuracy on known audio steganalysis features. Our results show, that for our test set, the used classification techniques and selected steganalysis features, microphones call be better classified than environments. These first tests show promising results but of course are based on a limited test and training set as well a specific test set generation. Therefore additional and enhanced features with different test set generation strategies are necessary to generalise the findings.

This approach is targeted towards the use of data mining in highly-automated vertical business applications, where the data is stored on one or more relational database systems, and an independent set of high-performance compute servers or a network of low-cost, commodity processors is used to improve the application performance and overall workload management. The goal of this paper is to describe an algorithmic decomposition of data mining kernels between the data storage and compute grids, which makes it possible to exploit the parallelism on the respective grids in a simple way, while minimizing the data transfer between these grids. This approach is compatible with existing standards for data mining task specification and results reporting, so that larger applications using these data mining algorithms do not have to be modified to benefit from this grid-based approach.

When a web server is overloaded there is a significant loss of throughput when we compare finished sessions and the number of responses per second; longer sessions are usually the ones ending in sales but also the most sensitive to load failures. Session-based admission control systems maintain a high QoS for a limited number of sessions, but does not maximize revenue as it treats all non-logged sessions the same. We present a novel method for learning to assign priorities to sessions according to the revenue that will generate. For this, we use traditional machine learning techniques and Markov-chain models. We are able to train a system to estimate the probability of the user's purchasing intentions according to its early navigation clicks and other static information. The predictions can be used by admission control systems to prioritize sessions or deny them if no resources are available, thus improving sales throughput per unit of time for a given infrastructure. We test our approach on access logs obtained from a high-traffic online travel agency, with promising results.

Recently, in the view of special needs for domain ontology building and maintenance, the problem returns with a higher demand. In the presented paper, we present a novel text mining approach to discovering synonyms or close meaning terms. The offered measures of closeness of terms (or their contexts) are expressed by means of data mining notions; namely, frequent termsets and association rules. The measures can be calculated by using data mining techniques, such as the well known Apriori algorithm. The approach is domain-independent and large-scale. It is, however, restricted to the recognition of parts of speech. In that sense the approach is language dependent, up to the language dependency of the parts of speech tagging process. The experimental results obtained with the approach are presented.

They can be seen as an application of data mining process. In this paper, a new recommender system based on multi-features is introduced. Demographic and psychographic features are used to asses similarities between users. The model is built on a collaborative filtering method and addresses three problems: sparsity, scalability and cold-star. The sparsity problem is tackled by integrating users-documents relevant information within meta-clusters. The scalability and the cold-start problems are considered by using a suitable probability model calculated on meta-cluster information. Moreover, a weight similarity measure is introduced in order to take into account dynamic human being preferences behaviour. A prediction score for generating recommendations is proposed based on the target user previous behaviour and his/her neighbourhood preferences on the target document.

The magnitude of this threat is evident from the increasing rate of cyber attacks against computers and critical infrastructure. Weblogs, or blogs, have also rapidly gained in numbers over the past decade. Weblogs may provide up-to-date information on the prevalence and distribution of various cyber security threats as well as terrorism events. In this paper, we analyze weblog posts for various categories of cyber security threats related to the detection of cyber attacks, cyber crime, and terrorism. Existing studies on intelligence analysis have focused on analyzing news or forums for cyber security incidents, but few have looked at weblogs. We use probabilistic latent semantic analysis to detect keywords from cyber security weblogs with respect to certain topics. We then demonstrate how this method can present the blogosphere in terms of topics with measurable keywords, hence tracking popular conversations and topics in the blogosphere. By applying a probabilistic approach, we can improve information retrieval in weblog search and keywords detection, and provide an analytical foundation for the future of security intelligence analysis of weblogs.

The skyline query, as an important operator for multiple criteria decision making and data mining, plays an important role in many sensing applications. Though skyline queries have been well-studied in traditional database system, the existing solutions designed for data stored in a centralized site are not directly applicable to sensor environment due to the unique characteristics of wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient algorithm, called Sliding Window Skyline Monitoring Algorithm (SWSMA), to continuously maintain sliding window skylines over a wireless sensor network. Specifically, SWSMA employs two types of filters within each sensor to reduce the amount of data transferred and save the energy consumption as a consequence. In addition to SWSMA, a set of optimization mechanisms are also discussed to improve the performance of SWSMA. Our extensive simulation studies show that SWSMA together with the optimization techniques performs effectively on reducing communication cost and saving the energy on monitoring sliding window skylines.

Data warehouses (DWs) can help users to analyze stored data, because they contain preprocessed data for analysis purposes. Furthermore, the multidimensional (MD) model of DWs, intuitively represents the system underneath. However, most of the clustering data mining are applied at a low-level of abstraction to complex unstructured data. While there are several approaches for clustering on DWs, there is still not a conceptual model for clustering that facilitates modeling with this technique on the multidimensional (MD) model of a DW. Here, we propose (i) a conceptual model for clustering that helps focusing on the data-mining process at the adequate abstraction level and (ii) an extension of the unified modeling language (UML) by means of the UML profiling mechanism allowing us to design clustering data-mining models on top of the MD model of a DW. This will allow us to avoid the duplication of the time-consuming preprocessing stage and simplify the clustering design on top of DWs improving the discovery of knowledge.

Data mining requirements for customized goods and services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	278th Xiangshan Sciences Forum on Frontier Studies on Data Technology and Knowledge Economy	MAY 22-24, 2006	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Comm Xiangshan Sci, Western Union Financial Serv		supply chain; demand chain; real-time management; mass customization; data mining; goods; services	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; DEMAND; TIME; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Customized goods and services occur when their respective supply and demand chains are managed in a simultaneous and real-time manner. From a research perspective, we classify the methods that axe employed in the management of these chains, based on whether supply and/or demand are flexible or fixed. Interestingly, our classification scheme highlights a critical and rewarding research area at which both supply and demand are flexible, thus manageable. Simultaneous management of supply and demand chains sets the stage for mass customization which is concerned with meeting the needs of an individualized customer market. Simultaneous and real-time management of supply and demand chains, in turn, set the stage for real-time mass customization (e.g. wherein a tailor first laser scans an individual's upper torso and then delivers a uniquely fitted jacket within a reasonable period, while the individual is waiting). The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as products and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced in real-time, resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage. Customized goods and services can only be achieved through sophisticated data mining techniques that can define the customization requirements from both a supply and a demand chain perspective, techniques that can obtain pertinent information from the mass of non-homogeneous data, in order to make informed customization decisions.

J	Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD				Zhu, Xingquan; Wu, Xindong			Class noise handling for effective cost-sensitive learning by cost-guided iterative classification filtering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; classification; cost-sensitive learning; noise handling		Recent research in machine learning, data mining, and related areas has produced a wide variety of algorithms for cost-sensitive (CS) classification, where instead of maximizing the classification accuracy, minimizing the misclassification cost becomes the objective. These methods often assume that their input is quality data without conflict or erroneous values, or the noise impact is trivial, which is seldom the case in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a Cost-guided Iterative Classification Filter (CICF) to identify noise for effective CS learning. Instead of putting equal weights on handling noise in all classes in existing efforts, CICF puts more emphasis on expensive classes, which makes it attractive in dealing with data sets with a large cost-ratio. Experimental results and comparative studies indicate that the existence of noise may seriously corrupt the performance of the underlying CS learners and by adopting the proposed CICF algorithm, we can significantly reduce the misclassification cost of a CS classifier in noisy environments.

While most of the existing algorithms are developed for efficient mining of frequent patterns, it has been noted recently that some of the infrequent patterns, such as indirect associations, provide useful insight into the data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, called HI-mine, based on a new data structure, called HI-struct, for mining the complete set of indirect associations between items. Our experimental results show that HI-mine's performance is significantly better than that of the previously developed algorithm for mining indirect associations on both synthetic and real world data sets over practical ranges of support specifications.

Data streams consist of mostly numeric data but what is more interesting are the events derived from the numerical data that need to be monitored. The events obtained from streaming data form event streams. Event streams have similar properties to data streams, i.e., they are seen only once in a fixed order as a continuous stream. Events appearing in the event stream have time stamps associated with them at a certain time granularity, such as second, minute, or hour. One type of frequently asked queries over event streams are count queries, i.e., the frequency of an event occurrence over time. Count queries can be answered over event streams easily, however, users may ask queries over different time granularities as well. For example, a broker may ask how many times a stock increased in the same time frame, where the time frames specified could be an hour, day, or both. Such types of queries are challenging especially in the case of event streams where only a window of an event stream is available at a certain time instead of the whole stream. In this paper, we propose a technique for predicting the frequencies of event occurrences in event streams at multiple time granularities. The proposed approximation method efficiently estimates the count of events with a high accuracy in an event stream at any time granularity by examining the distance distributions of event occurrences. The proposed method has been implemented and tested on different real data sets including daily price changes in two different stock exchange markets. The obtained results show its effectiveness.

The rules mined can describe associations among temporally annotated events and questionnaire or summary data; e.g., the likelihood that an occurrence of a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage during the second 100 sleep epochs of the night is associated with moderate caffeine intake. We use chi(2) analysis to ensure statistical significance of the mined rules, at the level P < 0.05. Our results, obtained by mining sleep-related data from 242 human subjects, reveal clinically interesting associations among the polysomnographic and summary variables. Our experience suggests that association mining may also be useful for selection of variables prior to using logistic regression.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM; Giles, K				Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata; Giles, Kendall			Splitting methods for decision tree induction: An exploration of the relative performance of two entropy-based families	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						decision trees; entropy; splitting methods; classification; machine learning	CLASSIFICATION TREES; CRITERIA	Decision tree (DT) induction is among the more popular of the data mining techniques. An important component of DT induction algorithms is the splitting method, with the most commonly used method being based on the Conditional Entropy (CE) family. However, it is well known that there is no single splitting method that will give the best performance for all problem instances. In this paper we explore the relative performance of the Conditional Entropy family and another family that is based on the Class-Attribute Mutual Information (CAMI) measure. Our results suggest that while some datasets are insensitive to the choice of splitting methods, other datasets are very sensitive to the choice of splitting methods. For example, some of the CAMI family methods may be more appropriate than the popular Gain Ratio (GR) method for datasets which have nominal predictor attributes, and are competitive with the GR method for those datasets where all predictor attributes are numeric. Given that it is never known beforehand which splitting method will lead to the best DT for a given dataset, and given the relatively good performance of the CAMI methods, it seems appropriate to suggest that splitting methods from the CAMI family should be included in data mining toolsets.

J	Yu, H; Kim, W; Hatzivassiloglou, V; Wilbur, J				Yu, Hong; Kim, Won; Hatzivassiloglou, Vasileios; Wilbur, John			A large scale, corpus-based approach for automatically disambiguating biomedical abbreviations	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						algorithms; languages; word-sense disambiguation; machine learning; data mining; information retrieval	INFORMATION	Abbreviations and acronyms are widely used in the biomedical literature and many of them represent important biomedical concepts. Because many abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g., CAT denotes both chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and computed axial tomography, depending on the context), recognizing the full form associated with each abbreviation is in most cases equivalent to identifying the meaning of the abbreviation. This, in turn, allows us to perform more accurate natural language processing, information extraction, and retrieval. In this study, we have developed supervised approaches to identifying the full forms of ambiguous abbreviations within the context they appear. We first automatically assigned multiple possible full forms for each abbreviation; we then treated the in-context full-form prediction for each specific abbreviation occurrence as a case of word-sense disambiguation. We generated automatically a dictionary of all possible full forms for each abbreviation. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms for disambiguation. Because some of the links between abbreviations and their corresponding full forms are explicitly given in the text and can be recovered automatically, we can use these explicit links to automatically provide training data for disambiguating the abbreviations that are not linked to a full form within a text. We evaluated our methods on over 150 thousand abstracts and obtain for coverage and precision results of 82% and 92%, respectively, when performed as tenfold cross-validation, and 79% and 80%, respectively, when evaluated against an external set of abstracts in which the abbreviations are not defined.

The research in this field was inspired by several European projects. We have proposed a mathematical meta-description of a flexible information storage model based on the experience gathered in cooperation in those projects. In this model, we use two basic structures called a knowledge base and data files. We describe those two structures using the graph theory concepts. Furthermore, we use logical formulas to express conditions that should be valid. Additionally, we present a description of a global system architecture of a 3-tier EHR application with interfaces based on the latest technologies; predominately on Web Services, SOAP, XML, HTTP, CORBA, etc. According to our experience and test results gained from the MUDR EHR usage, we describe an open universal solution, which can be applied as the EHR kernel of hospital information systems. To realize this approach in a daily practice for health professionals we have started a co-operative project with clinical information systems developers. Within that project we are developing a new system for continual shared health care. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show that use of compressed bitmap indexing can quickly answer queries in an interactive visual data analysis application, and compare its performance with two alternatives for serial and parallel filtering/querying on 2.5 billion records' worth of network connection data collected over a period of 42 weeks. Our approach to visual network connection data exploration centers oil two primary factors: interactive ad-hoc and multiresolution query forinulation and execution over n dimensions and visual display of the n-dimensional histogram results. This combination is applied ill a case study to detect a distributed network scan and to then identify the set of remote hosts participating in the attack. Our approach is sufficiently general to be applied to a diverse set of data understanding problems as well as used in conjunction with a diverse set of analysis and Visualization tools.

Adaptive blocking: Learning to scale up record linkage	ICDM 2006: Sixth International Conference on Data Mining, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Many data mining tasks require computing similarity between pairs of objects. Pairwise similarity computations are particularly important in record linkage systems, as well as in clustering and schema mapping algorithms. Because the number of object pairs grows quadratically with the size of the dataset, computing, similarity between all pairs is impractical and becomes prohibitive for large datasets and complex similarity functions. Blocking methods alleviate this problem by efficiently selecting approximately similar object pairs for subsequent. distance computations, leaving out the remaining pairs as dissimilar Previously proposed blocking methods require manually constructing an index-based similarity function or selecting a set of predicates, followed by hand-tuning of parameters. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive framework for automatically learning blocking functions that are efficient and accurate. We describe two predicate-based formulations of learnable blocking functions and provide learning algorithms for training them. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on real and simulated datasets, on which they prove to be more accurate than non-adaptive blocking methods.

It has emerged as a kind of promising data mining applications. Due to practical complexities in the real-world pairs mining such as mining high dimensional data and considering user preference, it is challenging to mine pairs of interest to traders in business situations. This paper presents fuzzy genetic algorithms to deal with these issues. We introduce a fuzzy genetic algorithm framework to mine pairs relationship, and propose strategies for the fuzzy aggregation and ranking of identified pairs to generate final optimum pairs for decision making. The proposed approaches are illustrated through mining stock pairs and stock-trading rule pairs in stock market. The performance shows that the proposed approach is promising for mining pairs helpful for real trading decision making.

Microaggregation arises in connection with anonymization of statistical databases for privacy protection (k-anonymity), where points are assimilated to database records. A usual group homogeneity criterion is within-groups sum of squares minimization SSE. For multivariate points, optimal microaggregation, i.e. with minimum SSE, has been shown to be NP-hard. Recently, a polynomial-time O(k(3))-approximation heuristic has been proposed (previous heuristics in the literature offered no approximation bounds). The special case k = 2 (2-microaggregation) is interesting in privacy protection scenarios with neither internal intruders nor outliers, because information loss is lower: smaller groups imply smaller information loss. For 2-microaggregation the existing general approximation can only guarantee a 54-approximation. We give here a new polynomial-time heuristic whose SSE is at most twice the minimum SSE (2-approximation).

Our methodology was based on data mining (rule induction) using rough set theory. We used a novel methodology based on rule generations and cumulative rule sets. The final rule set contained only eight rules, using some combinations of eight genes. All cases from the training data set and all but one cases from the testing data set were correctly classified. Moreover, six out of eight genes found by us are well known in the literature as relevant to leukemia.

It can provide a large variety of different methods and techniques for handling and analyzing temporal data generated by smart-home environments. Temporal data mining in general fits into a two level architecture, where initially a transformation technique reduces data dimensionality in the first level and indexing techniques provide efficient access to the data in the second level. This infrastructure of temporal data mining provides the basis for high-level data mining operations such as clustering, classification, rule discovery and prediction. These operations can form the basis for developing different smart-home applications, capable of addressing a number of situations occurring within this environment. This paper outlines the main temporal data mining techniques available and provides examples of where they can be applied within a smart home environment.

For this purpose, a specific data mining tool has been developed, which discovers relevant relationships between data about how students use a course. Unlike others data mining approaches applied to education, which focus on the student, this method is aimed professors and how to help them improve the structure and contents of an e-learning course by making recommendations. We also use a rule discovery algorithm without parameters in order to be easily used by non-expert users in data mining. The results of experimental tests performed on an online course are also presented, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology and algorithm.

Other more heuristic methods seek to utilize more general features, with some degree of success. In this paper, we present a data mining approach that conducts an exhaustive feature search on a set of computer viruses and strives to obviate over-fitting. We also evaluate the predictive power of a classifier by taking into account dependence relationships that exist between viruses, and we show that our classifier yields high detection rates and can be expected to perform as well in real-world conditions.

Detection of spatial outliers helps reveal valuable information from large spatial data sets. In many real applications, spatial objects can not be simply abstracted as isolated points. They have different boundary, size, volume, and location. These spatial properties affect the impact of a spatial object on its neighbors and should be taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose two spatial outlier detection methods which integrate the impact of spatial properties to the outlierness measurement. Experimental results on a real data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Previously we had introduced a new class of similarity measures based on entropic graphs to estimate Renyi's alpha-entropy, alpha-Jensen difference divergence, alpha-mutual information, and other divergence measures for image registration. Entropic graphs such as the minimum spanning tree (MST) and k-Nearest neighbor (kNN) graph allow the estimation of such similarity measures in higher dimensional feature spaces. A major drawback of histogram-based estimates of such measures is that they cannot be reliably constructed in higher dimensional feature spaces. In this article, we shall briefly extrapolate upon the use of entropic graph based divergence measures mentioned above. Additionally, we shall present estimates of other divergence viz the Geometric-Arithmetic mean divergence and Henze-Penrose affinity. We shall present the application of these measures for pairwise image registration using features derived from independent component analysis of the images. An extension of pairwise image registration is to simultaneously register multiple images, a challenging problem that arises while constructing atlases of organs in medical imaging. Using entropic graph methods we show the feasibility of such simultaneous registration using graph based higher dimensional estimates of entropy measures. Finally we present a new nonlinear correlation measure that is invariant to nonlinear transformations of the underlying feature space and can be reliably constructed in higher dimensions. We present an image clustering experiment to demonstrate the robustness of this measure to nonlinear transformations and contrast it with the clustering performance of the linear correlation coefficient.

Many of the functions of the system, such as routing decisions, search strategies, data cleansing, and the assignment of mutual trust, depend on the global status. Therefore, it is essential that the system be able to detect, and react to, changes in its global status. Computing global predicates in such systems is usually very costly. Mainly because of their scale, and in some cases (e.g., sensor networks) also because of the high cost of communication. The cost further increases when the data changes rapidly (due to state changes, node failure, etc.) and computation has to follow these changes. In this paper we describe a two step approach for dealing with these costs. First, we describe a highly efficient local algorithm which detect when the L2 norm of the average data surpasses a threshold. Then, we use this algorithm as a feedback loop for the monitoring of complex predicates on the data such as the data's k-means clustering. The efficiency of the L2 algorithm guarantees that so long as the clustering results represent the data (i.e., the data is stationary) few resources are required. When the data undergoes an epoch change a change in the underlying distribution and the model no longer represents it, the feedback loop indicates this and the model is rebuilt. Furthermore, the existence of a feedback loop allows using approximate and "best-effort" methods for constructing the model; if an ill-fit model is built the feedback loop would indicate so, and the model would be rebuilt.			ranw@cs.umbc.edu; kanishk1@cs.umbc.edu; hillol@cs.umbc.edu					BANYOPADHYAY S, INFORM SCI IN PRESS; BAWA M, 2004, P SIGMOD; BOYD S, 2005, P IEEE INFOCOM 05; CHEUNG D, 1996, P ICDE; CLEMENTE J, 2003, P PDCS; Eugster PT, 2004, COMPUTER, V37, P60, DOI 10.1109/MC.2004.1297243; Hulten G., 2001, P SIGKDD; KARAVAR S, 2003, P WWW; KEMPE D, 2003, P FOCS; KOWALCZYK W, 2003, P BNAIC; KRIVITSKI D, 2005, P DCOSS; Kullback S., 1968, INFORM THEORY STAT; KUTTEN S, 1995, P PODC; LINIAL N, 1992, SIAM J COMPUT, V21, P193, DOI 10.1137/0221015; MacQueen J.B., 1967, P 5 BERK S MATH STAT, V1, P281, DOI DOI 10.1234/12345678; THOMAS S, 1997, P SIGKDD; WOLFF R, 2003, P ICDM	17	6	7	SIAM	PHILADELPHIA	3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA		978-0-89871-611-5	SIAM PROC S			2006							430	441				12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BUJ09	WOS:000289491100038

In an effort towards practical algorithms for privacy-preserving data mining solutions, we analyze and implement solutions to an important primitive: the privacy-preserving scalar product of two vectors held by different parties. Privacy-preserving scalar products are an important component of privacy-preserving data mining algorithms, particularly when data is vertically partitioned between two or more parties. We examine a cryptographically secure privacy-preserving data mining solution in different computational settings. Our experimental results show that in the absence of special-purpose hardware accelerators or practical optimizations, the computational complexity, rather than the communication complexity, is the performance bottleneck. We also evaluate several practical optimizations to improve the efficiency.

They are usually defined based on structural characteristics or statistical information about; the rules. The meaningfulness of each measure was interpreted based either on intuitive arguments or mathematical properties. There does not exist a framework in which one is able to represent; the user judgement explicitly, precisely, and formally. Since the usefulness of discovered rules must be eventually judged by users, a framework that takes user preference or judgment into consideration will be very valuable. The objective of this paper is to propose Such a framework based on the notion of user preference. The results are useful in establishing a measurement-theoretic foundation of rule interestingness evaluation.

Frequently, DM analysts need to classify large amounts of data using many attributes. Thus, data warehouses (DW) can play an important role in the DM process, because they can easily manage huge quantities of data. There are two approaches used to model mining techniques: the Common Warehouse Model (CWM) and the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), both focused on metadata interchanging and sharing, respectively. These standards do not take advantage of the underlying semantic rich multidimensional (MD) model which could save development time and cost. In this paper, we present a conceptual model for Classification and a UML profile that allows the design of Classification on MD models. Our goal is to facilitate the design of these mining models in a DW context by employing an expressive conceptual model that can be used on top of a MD model. Finally, using the designed profile, we implement a case study in a standard database system and show the results.

J	Etzion, O; Fisher, A; Wasserkrug, S				Etzion, O; Fisher, A; Wasserkrug, S			e-CLV: A modeling approach for customer lifetime evaluation in e-Commerce domains, with an application and case study for online auction	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						customer lifetime value; e-commerce recency frequency monetary; markov chain		e-Commerce companies acknowledge that customers are their most important asset and that it is imperative to estimate the potential value of this asset. In conventional marketing, one of the widely accepted methods for evaluating customer value uses models known as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). However, these existing models suffer from two major shortcomings: They either do not take into account significant attributes of customer behavior unique to e-Commerce, or they do not provide a method for generating specific models from the large body of relevant historical data that can be easily collected in e-Commerce sites. This paper describes a general modeling approach, based on Markov Chain Models, for calculating customer value in the e-Commerce domain. This approach extends existing CLV models, by taking into account a new set of variables required for evaluating customers value in an e-Commerce environment. In addition, we describe how data-mining algorithms can aid in deriving such a model, thereby taking advantage of the historical customer data available in such environments. We then present an application of this modeling approach-the creation of a model for online auctions-one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative types of e-Commerce. The article also describes a case study, which demonstrates how our model provides more accurate predictions than existing conventional CLV models regarding the future income generated by customers.

J	Zhou, L; Shi, Y; Feng, JJ; Sears, A				Zhou, L; Shi, Y; Feng, JJ; Sears, A			Data mining for detecting errors in dictation speech recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						document retrieval; speech data mining; speech recognition	NETWORKS	The efficiency promised by a dictation speech recognition (DSR) system is lessened by the need for correcting recognition errors. Error detection is the precursor of error correction. Developing effective techniques for error detection can thus lead to improved error correction. Current research on error detection has focused mainly on transcription and/or domain-specific speech. Error detection in DSR has been studied less. We propose data mining models for detecting errors in DSR. Instead of relying on internal parameters from DSR systems, we propose a loosely coupled approach to error detection based on features extracted from the DSR output. The features mainly came from two sources: confidence scores and linguistics parsing. Link grammar was innovatively applied to error detection. Three data mining techniques, including Naive Bayes, neural networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), were evaluated on 5M DSR corpora. The experimental results showed that significant performance was achieved in that F-measures for error detection ranged from 55.3 % to 62.5 %. This study provided insights into the merit of different data-mining techniques and different types of features in error detection.

However, the construction of such scenarios directly from medical expertise is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we present a methodology for data abstraction and for the extraction of specific events (data mining) to eventually construct such scenarios. Data abstraction and data mining are based on the management of three key concepts, data, information and knowledge, which are instantiated via an ontology specific of our medical domain application. After a detailed description of the proposed methodology, we apply it to the supervision of patients hospitalized in intensive care units. We report the results obtained for the extraction of typical abstracted pattern sequences during the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Copyright &COPY; 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It allows different species to be evolved cooperatively and simultaneously, while the computational workload is shared among multiple computers over the Internet. Through the intercommunications among different species of rules and rule sets in a distributed manner, the concurrent processing and computational speed of the coevolutionary classifiers are enhanced. The advantage and performance of the proposed DCC are validated upon various datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. It is shown that the predicting accuracy of DCC is robust and the computation time is reduced as the number of remote engines increases. Comparison results illustrate that the DCC produces good classification rules for the datasets, which are competitive as compared to existing classifiers in literature.

Because mobile devices can often be disconnected from the host server and due to the low bandwidth of wireless networks, it is more efficient to store query results from a mobile device in the cache. For more personal use of mobile devices, we use a data mining technique to determine the pattern from a record of previous queries. Then the data, which will be retrieved by the user, are prefetched and stored in the cache, thus, improving the query efficiency. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach with experiments using simulation. Comparison of our approach with a standard approach indicates that there is a significant advantage to using mobile data warehouse systems.

J	Laffan, SW; Nielsen, OM; Silcock, H; Hegland, M				Laffan, SW; Nielsen, OM; Silcock, H; Hegland, M			Sparse grids: a new predictive modelling method for the analysis of geographic data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						spatial analysis; geographic data; predictive modelling; sparse grids; bauxite	SPATIAL ASSOCIATION; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; NEURAL-NETWORK; WILD GOOSE; STATISTICS; REGRESSION; VEGETATION	We introduce in this paper a new predictive modelling method to analyse Geographic data known as sparse grids. The sparse grids method has been developed for data-mining applications. It is a machine-learning approach to data analysis and has great applicability to the analysis and understanding of geographic data and processes. Sparse gi grids are a subset of grid-based predictive modelling approaches. The advantages they have over other grid-based methods are that they use fewer parameters and are less susceptible to the curse of dimensionality. These mean that they can be applied to many geographic problems and are readily adapted to the analysis of geographically local samples. We demonstrate the utility of the sparse grids system using a large and spatially extensive data set of regolith samples from Weipa, Australia. We apply both global and local analyses to find relationships between the regolith data and a set of geomorphometric, hydrologic and spectral variables. The results of the global analyses are much better than those generated using an artificial neural network, and the local analysis results are better than those generated using moving window regression for the same analysis window size. The sparse grids system provides a potentially powerful tool for the analysis and understanding of geographic processes and relationships.

In particular, the emphasis is devoted to heuristic search methods able to discover patterns that are hard or impossible to detect using standard query mechanisms and classical statistical techniques. In this paper an evolutionary system capable of extracting explicit classification rules is presented. Special interest is dedicated to find easily interpretable rules that may be used to make crucial decisions. A comparison with the findings achieved by other methods on a real problem, the breast cancer diagnosis, is performed.

J	Hetland, ML; Saetrom, P				Hetland, ML; Saetrom, P			Evolutionary rule mining in time series databases	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						sequence mining; knowledge discovery; time series; genetic programming; specialized hardware	DISCOVERY	Data mining in the form of rule discovery is a growing field of investigation. A recent addition to this field is the use of evolutionary algorithms in the mining process. While this has been used extensively in the traditional mining of relational databases, it has hardly, if at all, been used in mining sequences and time series. In this paper we describe our method for evolutionary sequence mining, using a specialized piece of hardware for rule evaluation, and show how the method can be applied to several different mining tasks, such as supervised sequence prediction, unsupervised mining of interesting rules, discovering connections between separate time series, and investigating tradeoffs between contradictory objectives by using multiobjective evolution.

We focus on the exploration of spatially distributed time-series data, i.e. values of numeric attributes referring to different moments in time and locations in space. After considering appropriate interactive visualization techniques, we propose several methods of exploration based on user-controlled data transformation and aggregation, easy-to-understand calculations, and dynamic linking of data displays. The proposed methods are potentially scalable, i.e. they can be applied to large data sets without overcrowding the displays and loosing interactivity.

This cost becomes even more prohibitive when queries access very large volumes of data. To improve response time, data warehouse administrators generally use indexing techniques such as star join indexes or bitmap join indexes. This task is nevertheless complex and fastidious. Our solution lies in the field of data warehouse auto-administration. In this framework, we propose an automatic index selection strategy. We exploit a data mining technique; more precisely frequent itemset mining, in order to determine a set of candidate indexes from a given workload. Then, we propose several cost models allowing to create an index configuration composed by the indexes providing the best profit. These models evaluate the cost of accessing data using bitmap join indexes, and the cost of updating and storing these indexes.

As a result, the interest in heuristics and meta-heuristics is still growing. In this paper, we present a very recent metaheuristic introduced to solve a 3-sat problem. This metaheuristic can be classified as an evolutionary algorithm. It is based on the process of bees' reproduction. We adapted it for the resolution of the Max-Sat problem. We tested it on a medical benchmark obtained from a data-mining problem that we translated into a Max-Sat problem.

Summarizing such massive data requires fast, small space algorithms to support post-hoc queries and mining. An important observation is that such streams are rarely uniform, and real data sources typically exhibit significant skewness. These are well modeled by Zipf distributions, which are characterized by a parameter, z, that captures the amount of skew. We present a data stream summary that can answer point queries with epsilon accuracy and show that the space needed is only O(epsilon(-) min{1,1/z}). This is the first o(1/epsilon) space algorithm for this problem, and we show it is essentially tight for skewed distributions. We show that the same data structure can also estimate the L-2 norm of the stream in o(1/epsilon(2)) space for z > 1/2, another improvement over the existing Omega(1/epsilon(2)) methods. We support our theoretical results with an experimental study over a large variety of real and synthetic data. We show that significant skew is present in both textual and telecommunication data. Our methods give strong accuracy, significantly better than other methods, and behave exactly in line with their analytic bounds.

These challenges include the limitations of computational resources, especially because mining streams of data most likely be done on a mobile device with limited resources. Also due to the continuality of data streams, the algorithm should have only one pass or less over the incoming data records. In this article, our Algorithm Output Granularity (AOG) approach in mining data streams is discussed. AOG is a novel adaptable approach that can cope with the challenging inherent features of data streams. We also show the results for AOG based clustering in a resource constrained environment.

By playing automatically and continuously, it helps to speed up the game character's levelup process. However, the auto-playing programs, either software or hardware, do harm to games servers in various ways including abuse of resources. In this paper, we propose a way of detecting the auto programs by analyzing the window event sequences produced by the game players. In our proposed method, the event sequences are transformed into a set of attributes, and various leaming algorithms are applied to classify the data represented by the set of attribute values into human or auto player. The results from experiments with several MMORPGs show that the Decision Tree learning with proposed method can identify the auto-playing programs with high accuracy.

The idea of semi-supervised learning is to learn not only from the labeled training data, but to exploit also the structural information in additionally available unlabeled data. In this paper we review existing semi-supervised approaches, and propose an evolutionary algorithm suited to learn interpretable fuzzy if-then classification rules from partially labeled data. Feasibility of our approach is shown on artificial datasets, as well as on a real-world image analysis application. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Briefly, in PISC, Client wants to know the support of her itemset in Server's database with the usual privacy guarantees. First, we show that if the number of attributes is small, then a communication-efficient PISC protocol can be constructed from a communication-efficient oblivious transfer protocol. The converse is also true: any communication-efficient PISC protocol gives rise to a communication-efficient oblivious transfer protocol. Second, for the general case, we propose a computationally efficient PISC protocol with linear communication in the size of the database. Third, we show how to further reduce the communication by using various tradeoffs and random sampling techniques.

We propose a method, namely Mrs-SMOTI, that takes advantage from a tight-integration with spatial databases and mines regression models in form of trees in order to partition the sample space. The method is characterized by three aspects. First, it is able to capture both spatially global and local effects of explanatory attributes. Second, explanatory attributes that influence the response attribute do not necessarily come from a single layer. Third, the consideration that geometrical representation and relative positioning of spatial objects with respect to a reference system implicitly define both spatial relationships and properties. An application to real-world spatial data is reported.

However, even if many works have dealt with sequential pattern mining, none of them considers frequent sequential patterns involving several dimensions in the general case. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called M(2)Sp, to mine multidimensional sequential patterns. The main originality of our proposition is that we obtain not only intra-pattern sequences but also inter-pattern sequences. Moreover, we consider generalized multidimensional sequential patterns, called jokerized patterns, in which some of the dimension values may not be instanciated. Experiments on synthetic data are reported and show the scalability of our approach.

As with all data mining problems, the key to effective and scalable algorithms is choosing the right representation of the data. Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining. In this work, we introduce a new technique based on a bit level approximation of the data. The representation has several important advantages over existing techniques. One unique advantage is that it allows raw data to be directly compared to the reduced representation, while still guaranteeing lower bounds to Euclidean distance. This fact can be exploited to produce faster exact algorithms for similarly search. In addition, we demonstrate that our new representation allows time series clustering to scale to much larger datasets.

The search is guided by a so-called utility function, trading the size of subsets (coverage) against their statistical unusualness. By choosing the utility function accordingly, subgroup discovery is well suited to find interesting rules with much smaller coverage and bias than possible with standard classifier induction algorithms. Smaller subsets can be considered local patterns, but this work uses yet another definition: According to this definition global patterns consist of all patterns reflecting the prior knowledge available to a learner, including all previously found patterns. All further unexpected regularities in the data are referred to as local patterns. To address local pattern mining in this scenario, an extension of subgroup discovery by the knowledge-based sampling approach to iterative model refinement is presented. It is a general, cheap way of incorporating prior probabilistic knowledge in arbitrary form into Data Mining algorithms addressing supervised learning tasks.

This concept was introduced by Rosenfeld in 1979 and used with success in image segmentation; here we extend this approach to clustering and demonstrate its effectiveness in intrusion detection. Starting with a single or a few seed points in each cluster, all the data points are dynamically assigned to the cluster that has the highest fuzzy connectedness value (strongest connection). With an efficient heuristic algorithm, the time complexity of the clustering process is O(NlogN), where N is the number of data points. The value of fuzzy connectedness is calculated using both the Euclidean distance and the statistical properties of clusters. This unsupervised learning method allows the discovery of clusters of any shape. Application of the method in intrusion detection demonstrates that it can detect not only known intrusion types, but also their variants. Experimental results on the KDD-99 intrusion detection data set show the efficiency and accuracy of this method. A detection rate above 94% and a false alarm rate below 4% are achieved, outperforming major competitors by at least 5%.

However, a competency model usually contains too many intended competencies to be implemented. Recently, some scholars and experts argue that eight is the maximum for managers to assess. Hence, how to simplify the manager competency model is becoming an important issue. Well known as data mining techniques, the rough sets theory is a relatively new approach and good at data reduction in qualitative analysis, so that the rough set approach is suitable for dealing with the qualitative problem in simplifying the competency model. The aim of this paper is to mining the minimal set of competencies through using the rough set approach to help companies for better utilizing the competency model. The results show that the "self-management" competency is the most indispensable portion to a manager competency model.

We propose a novel FSS method for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) based on Common Principal Components, termed CLeVer. It utilizes the properties of the principal components to retain the correlation information among original features while traditional FSS techniques, such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), may lose it. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our selected subset of features, classification is employed as the target data mining task. Our experiments show that CLe Ver outperforms RFE and Fisher Criterion by up to a factor of two in terms of classification accuracy, while requiring up to 2 orders of magnitude less processing time.

J	Zhang, WR; Zhang, LL				Zhang, WR; Zhang, LL			A multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach to brain modeling and neurofuzzy control	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						multiagent data warehousing and mining; agent similarity and orthogonality; neurofuzzy agents; mining agent association in first-order logic; brain modeling; robot control		Based oil the hypothesis that the brain is a society of semiautonomous neural agents and full autonomy is the result of coordination of semiautonomous functionalities, a multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach is presented I-or brain modeling and illustrated with robot motion control. An algorithm named Neighbor-Miner is proposed for MADWH and MADM. The algorithm is defined in an evolving dynamic environment with semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents. Instead of mining frequent itemsets from customer transactions, the new algorithm discovers new neurofuzzy agents and mines agent associations ill first-order logic for coordination that was once considered impossible in traditional data mining. While the Apriori algorithm uses frequency as a priori threshold, Neighbor-Miner uses agent similarity as a priori knowledge. The concept of agent similarity leads to the notions of agent cuboid, orthogonal MADWH, and MADM. Based on agent similarities and action similarities, Neighbor-Miner is presented and illustrated with brain modeling for robot control. The novelty of a multiagent data warehouse lies in its ability to systematically combine neurofuzzy systems, multiagent systems, database systems, machine learning, data mining, information theory, neuroscience, decision, cognition, and control all together into a modern multidimensional information system architecture that is ideal for brain modeling of different animal species with manageable complexity. Although examples in robot control are used to illustrate the basic ideas, the new approach is generally suitable for data mining tasks where knowledge can be discovered collectively by a set of similar semiautonomous or autonomous agents from a geographically, geometrically, or timely distributed environment, especially in high-dimensional scientific and engineering data environments.

This problem is important since improvements in data collection times in many applications such as wide-area upload applications, high-performance computing applications, and data mining applications are crucial to performance of those applications. Often, due to congestion conditions, the paths chosen by the network may have poor throughput. By choosing an alternate route at the application level, we may be able to obtain substantially faster completion time. This data collection problem is a nontrivial one because the issue is not only to avoid congested link(s), but to devise a coordinated transfer schedule which would afford maximum possible utilization of available network resources. Our approach for computing coordinated data collection schedules makes no assumptions about knowledge of the topology of the network or the capacity available on individual links of the network. This approach provides significant performance improvements under various degrees and types of network congestions. To show this, we give a comprehensive comparison study of the various approaches to the data collection problem which considers performance, robustness, and adaptation characteristics of the different data collection methods. The adaptation to network conditions characteristics are important as the above applications are long lasting, i.e., it is likely changes in network conditions will occur during the data transfer process. In general, our approach can be used for solving arbitrary data movement problems over the Internet. We use the Bistro platform to illustrate one application of our techniques.

J	Sinha, AP; May, JH				Sinha, AP; May, JH			Evaluating and tuning predictive data mining models using receiver operating characteristic curves	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						binary classification; credit evaluation; data mining; decision analysis; misclassification costs; performance evaluation and tuning; predictive models; ROC curves		In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of the performance of five popular data mining methods-neural networks, logistic rearession, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, and nearest neighbor-on two binary classification problems from the credit evaluation domain. Whereas most studies comparing data mining methods have employed accuracy as a performance measure, we argue that, for problems such as credit evaluation, the focus should be on minimizing misclassification cost. We first generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the classifiers and use the area under the curve (AUC) measure to compare aggregate performance of the five methods over the spectrum of decision thresholds. Next. using the ROC results, we propose a method for tuning the classifiers by identifying optimal decision thresholds. We compare the methods based on expected costs across a range of cost-probability ratios. In addition to expected cost and AUC, we evaluate the models on the basis of their generalizability to unseen data, their scalability to other problems in the domain, and their robustness against changes in class distributions. We found that the performance of logistic regression and neural network models was superior under most conditions. In contrast. decision tree and nearest neighbor models yielded higher costs, and were much less generalizable and robust than the other models. An important finding, of this research is that the models can be effectively tuned post hoc to make them cost sensitive, even though they were built without incorporating misclassification costs.

J	Vityaev, EE; Kovalerchuk, BY				Vityaev, EE; Kovalerchuk, BY			Discovery of empirical theories based on the measurement theory	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Machine Learning as Experimental Philosophy of Science	SEP   03, 2001	Freiburg, GERMANY			data mining; discovery science; domain theory; knowledge discovery; machine learning; scientific discovery; theory formation		The purpose of this work is to analyse the cognitive process of the domain theories in terms of the measurement theory to develop a computational machine learning approach for implementing it. As a result, the relational data mining approach, the authors proposed in the preceding books, was improved. We present the approach as an implementation of the cognitive process as the measurement theory perceived. We analyse the cognitive process in the first part of the paper and present the theory and method of the logically most powerful empirical theory discovery in the second. The theory is based on the notion of 'law-like' rules, which conform to all the properties of laws of nature, namely generality, simplicity, maximum refutability and minimum number of parameters. This notion is defined for deterministic and probabilistic cases. Based on the method, the 'discovery' system is developed, The system was successfully applied to many practical tasks.

J	Wei, Q; Chen, GQ				Wei, Q; Chen, GQ			Efficient discovery of functional dependencies with degrees of satisfaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Fuzzy Information Processing (FIP2003)	MAR 01-04, 2003	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA				APPROXIMATE DEPENDENCIES; ALGORITHM; DATABASE	Functional dependency (FD) is an important type of semantic knowledge reflecting integrity constraints in databases, and has nowadays attracted an increasing amount of research attention in data mining. Traditionally, FD is defined in the light of precise or complete data, and can hardly tolerate partial truth due to imprecise or incomplete data (such as noises, nulls, etc.) that may often exist in massive databases, or due to a very tiny insignificance of tuple differences in a huge volume of data. Based on the notion of functional dependencies with degrees of satisfaction (FDs)(d), this article presents an efficient approach to discovering all satisfied (FDs)(d) using some important results obtained from exploration of (FDs)(d) properties such as extended Armstrong-like axioms and their derivatives. In this way, many dependencies can be inferred from previously discovered ones without scanning databases, and those unsatisfied ones could be filtered out inside (rather than after) the mining process. Fuzzy relation matrix operation is used to infer transitive dependencies in the mining algorithm. Finally, the efficiency is demonstrated with data experiments. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Jin, DJ; Ziavras, SG				Jin, DJ; Ziavras, SG			A super-programming approach for mining association rules in parallel on PC clusters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						mining association rules; cluster computing; load balancing; parallel processing		PC clusters have become popular in parallel processing. They do not involve specialized interprocessor networks, so the latency of data communications is rather long. The programming models for PC clusters are often different than those for parallel machines or supercomputers containing sophisticated interprocessor communication networks. For PC clusters, load balancing among the nodes becomes a more critical issue in attempts to yield high performance. We introduce a new model for program development on PC clusters, namely, the Super-Programming Model (SPM). The workload is modeled as a collection of Super-Instructions (SIs). We propose that a set of SIs be designed for each application domain. They should constitute an orthogonal set of frequently used high-level operations in the corresponding application domain. Each SI should normally be implemented as a high-level language routine that can execute on any PC. Application programs are modeled as Super-Programs (SPs), which are coded using SIs. SIs are dynamically assigned to available PCs at runtime. Because of the known granularity of SIs, an upper bound on their execution time can be estimated at static time. Therefore, dynamic load balancing becomes an easier task. Our motivation is to support dynamic load balancing and code porting, especially for applications with diverse sets of inputs such as data mining. We apply here SPM to the implementation of an Apriori-like algorithm for mining association rules. Our experiments show that the average idle time per node is kept very low.

Despite many approaches that analyzed smaller parts of the relevant data or single variables, respectively, no larger database with all the possible relevant data existed. Our work was to bridge this gap. We built a large database for abdominal septic shock patients. While building it, we were confronted with many problems concerning the database realization and the data quality. Thus, we will demonstrate how we built our database and how we assured data quality. This is of interest for all medical or computer scientists who are concerned with building medical databases with retrospective data, e.g. for data mining purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Pedrycz, W				Pedrycz, W			Associations and rules in data mining: A link analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2002)	MAY, 2002	HONOLULU, HAWAII				SYSTEMS	We discuss a problem of synthesis and analysis of rules based on experimental numeric data. Two descriptors of the rules that are viewed individually and en block are introduced. The coverage of the rules is quantified in terms of the data being covered by the antecedents and conclusions standing in the rule. Although this index describes each rule individually, the consistency of the rule deals with the quality of the rule viewed compared with other rules. It expresses how much the rule "interacts" with others in the sense that its conclusion is affected (distorted) by the conclusion parts coming from other rules. We propose a synthetic index of rule relevance that combines the two already introduced descriptors. We show how the rules are formed by means of fuzzy clustering and their quality is evaluated by means of the aforementioned indexes. Global characteristics of a set of rules also are discussed and related to the number of information granules formed in the space of antecedents and conclusions. Finally, we discuss the rules in the setting of granular modeling and express their performance in the design of numeric models. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The chain's higher probability trails correspond to the preferred trails on the web site. The algorithm implements a depth-first search that scans the Markov chain for the high probability trails. We show that the average behaviour of the algorithm is linear time in the number of web pages accessed.

Automated procedures are described to determine the position, size, shape and orientation of cells in each video frame. From the temporal changes in the values of these simple metadata parameters, high-level descriptors are derived that describe the semantic content of the video. This content information (specific intrinsic metadata) is of high information value, since it describes the behavior of cells and the timing of events within the video, including changes in environmental conditions experienced by the cells. When such metadata are properly organized in a searchable database, a content-based video query and retrieval system may be developed to locate particular objects, events or behaviors. Moreover, the availability of such semantic contents in the formal and generic format we propose will allow the application of data mining techniques and the amassing of moire elaborate knowledge, e.g., species classification depending on behavior, patterns in response to environment changes, etc. The suitability and functionality of the proposed metadata model is demonstrated by the automated analysis of five different types of biological experiments, recording epithelial wound healing, bacterial multiplication, the rotations of tethered bacteria, and the swimming of motile bacteria and of human sperm.

To address this challenge, we are developing a hybrid link discovery system called KOJAK that combines state-of-the-art knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&R) technology with statistical clustering and analysis techniques from the area of data mining. In this paper we report on the architecture and technology of its first fully completed module called the KOJAK Group Finder. The Group Finder is capable of finding hidden groups and group members in large evidence databases. Our group finding approach addresses a variety of important LD challenges, such as being able to exploit heterogeneous and structurally rich evidence, handling the connectivity curse, noise and corruption as well as the capability to scale up to very large, realistic data sets. The first version of the KOJAK Group Finder has been successfully tested and evaluated on a variety of synthetic datasets.

The novel approach is evaluated over a test bed of texture feature data of 184 aerial photograph images. The experimental results show that the distributed version with more agents outperforms the version with fewer agents when the rule generation from the large database is not complicated.

We propose an agent-based middleware that bridges the gap between the programmable application layer consisting of software agents and the physical layer consisting of extremely small, low power devices that combine programmable computing with sensing, tracking and wireless communication capabilities. The middleware supports mechanisms for communication, mobility, cooperative data mining, querying, tasking, self-organization and administration of the constituent sensor nodes to build higher-level, interoperable applications with software agents. We discuss two major middleware components, namely, CCL: a command and control language and STACS: a programmable controller synthesizer. We explain how the controller can be used to configure the behavior of a node and CCL to command and control the nodes in a sensor network. We provide frameworks for communication and mobility. We suggest an agent model that integrates the software agents of the application with the hardware agents of the physical environment. We describe an integrated target tracking experiment, to demonstrate an implementation of this architecture. Finally, we conclude with an insight to our future challenges.

J	Calders, T				Calders, T			Deducing bounds on the support of itemsets	DATABASE SUPPORT FOR DATA MINING APPLICATIONS: DISCOVERING KNOWLEDGE WITH INDUCTIVE QUERIES	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article							LOGIC	Mining Frequent Itemsets is the core operation of many data mining algorithms. This operation however, is very data intensive and sometimes produces a prohibitively large output. In this paper we give a complete set of rules for deducing tight bounds on the support of an iternset if the supports of all its subsets are known. Based on the derived bounds [l, u] on the support of a candidate itemset I, we can decide not to access the database to count the support of I if I is larger than the support threshold (I will certainly be frequent), or if u is below the threshold (I will certainly fail the frequency test). We can also use the deduction rules to reduce the size of an adequate representation of the collection of frequent sets; all itemsets I with bounds [l, u], where l = u, do not need to be stored explicitly. To assess the usability in practice, we implemented the deduction rules and we present experiments on real-life data sets.

We record runtime properties of each request and apply automated machine learning and data mining techniques to identify the causes of failures. We train decision trees on the request traces from time periods in which user-visible failures are present. Paths through the tree are ranked according to their degree of correlation with failure, and nodes are merged according to the observed partial order of system components. We evaluate this approach using actual failures from eBay, and find that, among hundreds of potential causes, the algorithm successfully identifies 13 out of 14 true causes of failure, along with 2 false positives. We discuss some results in applying simplified decision trees on eBay's production site for several months. In addition, we give a cost-benefit analysis of manual vs. automated diagnosis systems. Our contributions include the statistical learning approach, the adaptation of decision trees to the context of failure diagnosis, and the deployment and evaluation of our tools on a high-volume production service.

A model of learning from positive and negative examples, naturally described in terms of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), is used here to generate hypotheses about biological activity of chemical compounds. A standard FCA technique is used to reduce labeled graphs to object-attribute representation. The major challenge is the construction of the context, which can involve ten thousands attributes. The method is tested against a standard dataset from an ongoing international competition called Predictive Toxicology Challenge (PTC).

Here, the efficiency, reliability, and semantic capability for associative retrieval of three models of a DNA-based memory are quantified and compared to current conventional methods. In affinity-based memories[1], retrievals and deletions under stringent conditions occur reliably (98%) within very short times (100 milliseconds), regardless of the degree of stringency of the recall or the number of simultaneous queries in the input. In a more sophisticated type of DNA-based memory B proposed and experimentally verified by Chen et al. [2] with three genomes, the sensitivity of the discrimination ability remains unchanged when used on a library of 18 plasmids in the range of 1-4kbps and does appear to grow exponentially with the number of library strands used, even under simultaneous multiple queries in the same input. Finally, using a new type of memory compaction mechanism for data mining in vitro, DNA-based semantic retrieval compares favorably with statistically-based Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), one of the best performers for semantic associative-based retrieval on text corpora.

Taking two features of the pass sequence - temporal irregularity and requirements for multiscale observation - into account, we have developed a comparison method of the sequences based on multiscale matching. The method can be used with hierarchical clustering, that brings us a new style of data mining in sports data. Experimental results on 64 game records of FIFA world cup 2002 demonstrated that the method could discover some interesting pass patterns that may be associated with successful goals.

Mining frequent itemsets in a transaction database is critical for mining association rules. Many investigations have estabilished that pattern-growth method outperforms the method of Apriori-like candidate generation. The performance of the pattern-growth method depends on the number of tree nodes. Accordingly, this work presents a new FP-tree structure (NFP-tree) and develops an efficient approach for mining frequent itemsets, based on an NFP-tree, called the NFP-growth approach. NFP-tree employs two counters in a tree node to reduce the number of tree nodes. Additionally, the header table of the NFP-tree is smaller than that of the FP-tree. Therefore, the total number of nodes of all conditional trees can be reduced. Simulation results reveal that the NFP-growth algorithm is superior to the FP-growth algorithm for dense datasets and real datasets.

It is indubitable that we can obtain numerous discovered patterns using a Web mining model. However, some discovered patterns might include uncertainties when we extract them. Also user profiles are changeable. Therefore, the difficult issue is how to use and maintain the discovered patterns. This paper presents a theoretical framework for this issue, which consists of automatic ontology extraction, reasoning on the ontology and capturing evolving patterns. The experimental results show that all objectives we expect for the theoretical framework are achievable.

In this paper, we present an heuristic fast way of finding shortest relative reducts by exploring the specific nature of the input data. As a byproduct, we can show that the shortest relative reducts can be found in polynomial time, provided that we do know apriori that the lengths of the shortest reducts is bounded by a constant, that is, independent of the column size n. It should be noted that there are heuristic factors in the algorithm ("speeds" are not guaranteed) but the results, namely, the founded shortest reducts, are the precise answers.

However, there has not been much research on how condensed representations should actually be represented. In this paper we propose a general approach to build condensed representations of pattern collections. The approach is based on separating the structure of the pattern collection from the interestingness values of the patterns. We study also the concrete case of representing the frequent sets and their (approximate) frequencies following this approach: we discuss the trade-offs in representing the frequent sets by the maximal frequent sets, the minimal infrequent sets and their combinations, and investigate the problem approximating the frequencies from samples by giving new upper bounds on sample complexity based on frequent closed sets and describing how convex optimization can be used to improve and score the obtained samples.

Both the cluster generation mechanism and the partition integration process influence the quality of the combinations. In this paper we propose a data resampling approach for building cluster ensembles that are both robust and stable. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of a bootstrapping technique in conjunction with several combination algorithms. The empirical study shows that a meaningful consensus partition for an entire set of objects emerges from multiple clusterings of bootstrap samples, given optimal combination algorithm parameters. Experimental results for ensembles with varying numbers of partitions and clusters are reported for simulated and real data sets. Experimental results show improved stability and accuracy for consensus partitions obtained via a bootstrapping technique.

Ideally, BI research should be driven by industry needs. However, only little information on how BI is used in industry is currently available to the BI research community. This industrial paper presents the experiences that the author has obtained from running a number of knowledge exchange activities related to BI, e.g., network meetings and workshops, with partners in industry. The paper presents the network participants, the topics of the knowledge exchange activities, and the lessons learned over the last couple of years. For example, lessons relate to the popularity of OLAP and data mining tools, the time spent on different tasks in BI projects, and the importance of "soft" people-related issues. Finally, the paper makes a recommendation on a number of future research topics that are useful in industry.

This paper proposes a method of spatial data mining handling randomness and fuzziness simultaneously. First, the uncertainties in spatial data mining are presented via characteristics, spatial data, knowledge discovery and knowledge representation. Second, the aspects of the uncertainties in spatial data mining are briefed. They often appear simultaneously, but most of the existing methods cannot deal with spatial data mining with more than one uncertainty. Third, cloud model is presented to mine spatial data with both randomness and fuzziness. It may also act as an uncertainty transition between a qualitative concept and its quantitative data, which is the basis of spatial data mining in the contexts of uncertainties. Finally, a case study on landslide-monitoring data mining is given. The results show that the proposed method can well deal with randomness and fuzziness during the process of spatial data mining.

However, these methods assume that training sets do not contain significant noise, which is rarely the case in real-world environments. In this paper, we systematically study the impacts of class noise on CS learning, and propose a cost-guided class noise handling algorithm to identify noise for effective CS learning. We call it Cost-guided Iterative Classification Filter (CICF), because it seamlessly integrates costs and an existing Classification Filter [1] for noise identification. Instead of putting equal weights to handle noise in all classes in existing efforts, CICF puts more emphasis on expensive classes, which makes it especially successful in dealing with datasets with a large cost-ratio. Experimental results and comparative studies from real-world datasets indicate that the existence of noise may seriously corrupt the performance of CS classifiers, and by adopting the proposed CICF algorithm, we can significantly reduce the misclassfication cost of a CS classifier in noisy environments.

J	Chang, E; Li, BT				Chang, E; Li, BT			MEGA - The maximizing expected generalization algorithm for learning complex query concepts	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						algorithms; management; active learning; data mining; query concept; relevance feedback	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; SEARCH	Specifying exact query concepts has become increasingly challenging to end-users. This is because many query concepts ( e. g., those for looking up a multimedia object) can be hard to articulate, and articulation can be subjective. In this study, we propose a query-concept learner that learns query criteria through an intelligent sampling process. Our concept learner aims to fulfill two primary design objectives: ( 1) it has to be expressive in order to model most practical query concepts and ( 2) it must learn a concept quickly and with a small number of labeled data since online users tend to be too impatient to provide much feedback. To fulfill the first goal, we model query concepts in k-CNF, which can express almost all practical query concepts. To fulfill the second design goal, we propose our maximizing expected generalization algorithm ( MEGA), which converges to target concepts quickly by its two complementary steps: sample selection and concept refinement. We also propose a divide-and-conquer method that divides the concept-learning task into G subtasks to achieve speedup. We notice that a task must be divided carefully, or search accuracy may suffer. Through analysis and mining results, we observe that organizing image features in a multiresolution manner, and minimizing intragroup feature correlation, can speed up query-concept learning substantially while maintaining high search accuracy. Through examples, analysis, experiments, and a prototype implementation, we show that MEGA converges to query concepts significantly faster than traditional methods.

J	Toroslu, IH				Toroslu, IH			Repetition support and mining cyclic patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; sequential patterns; cyclic patterns; repetition support	SEQUENCES; DISCOVERY	For customer transaction database, the support (customer support) of the sequential pattern is defined as the fraction of the customers supporting the sequence. We define new forms of the mining patterns, called cyclic patterns, as an extension to the sequential pattern mining by introducing a new parameter, the repetition support. For customer transaction database, the repetition support specifies the minimum number of repetitions of the patterns in each customer transaction sequence. Repeated patterns can also be viewed as cyclic since the beginning of a sequence will follow the end of the previous occurrence of the same sequence. In this paper, we introduce the repetition support parameter, the cyclic pattern mining problem, describe the related algorithms, and at the end of the paper we give some performance results.

J	Hamann, B; Bethel, EW; Simon, H; Meza, J				Hamann, B; Bethel, EW; Simon, H; Meza, J			NERSC "visualization greenbook" future visualization needs of the DOE Computational Science Community hosted at NERSC	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS			English	Article								In this paper we present the findings and recommendations that emerged from a one-day workshop held at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) on June 5, 2002, in conjunction with the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) User Group (NUG) Meeting. The motivation for this workshop was to solicit direct input from the application science community on the subject of visualization. The workshop speakers and participants included computational scientists from a cross-section of disciplines that use the NERSC facility, as well as visualization researchers from across the country. We asked the workshop contributors how they currently visualize their results, and how they would like to do visualization in the future. We were especially interested in each individual's view of how visualization tools and services could be improved in order to better meet the needs of future computational science projects. The outcome of this workshop is a set of findings and recommendations that are presented in more detail later in this paper, and are briefly summarized here. Scientific visualization is a crucial technological capability that plays an important role in understanding data created by computational science projects as well as experiments. In order to be effective, visualization technology should be easy to use for a non-expert. The term easy to use" encompasses a number of different categories, including a short learning curve, tight integration with computational frameworks, availability on the desktop as well as the fixed visualization facility, tools that are tailored for each specific application domain, and low cost. Current visualization tools fall short in several key areas of capability. Few visualization tools are capable of processing large datasets, such as those commonly generated at NERSC. Better support for parallel visualization tools may prove useful in leveraging large parallel machines as visualization resources. Multivariate visualization - multiple grids, many species, and many dimensions - is needed in order to quickly gain insight into large datasets. Related "drill-down" capabilities, such as the ability to quickly move from macro to micro views (used in "data mining"), would be extremely helpful in understanding data but are missing from most visualization tools. Many application scientists perceive a conundrum when it comes to visualization support. Support for visualization within each individual program level is often inadequate or nonexistent due to funding constraints, yet support for visualization at the institutional level is also often inadequate or nonexistent. Better solutions are needed for remote visualization. Current approaches are further constrained by network bandwidth and access to resources. The proliferation of visualization tools and data formats poses challenges. Researchers must often master many different tools in order to achieve the desired results. Data format conversion is often required when moving between tools. Common data formats and frameworks for visualization tools are needed to reduce duplication of effort and better promote sharing of resources and results. Better communication is needed between the visualization and computational science communities. The computational scientists are often unaware of current trends and practices in the visualization community. By being more aware of the needs of the computational science community, the visualization research programs can be crafted so as to be more responsive to their needs. As a result of the workshop, we have developed a set of recommendations that can be summarized as follows: Establish a coherent program that focuses on remote visualization. A remote visualization program should provide tools and infrastructure that can be used by multiple "virtual teams". Establish mechanisms whereby generally-applicable visualization technology is developed and deployed in a centralized fashion. Develop a research program in interactive visualization with running codes that stresses the integrated design and development of coupled simulation-visualization methods. Establish a research program in the areas of multi-field visualization and multi-dimensional data visualization. Establish a research program in the area of automated data exploration for next generation petascale datasets. Significantly enhance life science data visualization efforts, with particular emphasis upon the relationship with scientific data management. Develop new programs that link visualization with data management and provide support for multi-resolution representations of large datasets, support for simultaneous display of data from disparate sources, support for the ability to generate and display derived values, and the ability to pose queries and display results.

These data can and do contain patterns that are useful for the decision maker. Knowledge discovery and data mining methods have been widely used to extract these patterns. It is acknowledged that about 80% of the resources in a majority of data mining applications are spent on cleaning and preprocessing the data. However, there have been relatively few studies on preprocessing data used as input in these data mining systems. In this study, we present a feature selection method based on the Hausdorff distance measure, and evaluate its effectiveness in preprocessing input data for inducing decision trees. Message traffic data from a Web site are used to illustrate performance of the proposed method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Large-scale simulations with particles currently involve ensembles consisting of between 10(6) and 10(9) particles, which cover 10(5)-10(6) time steps. Thus, the data files produced in a single run can reach from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. This data bank allows one to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of both the particle system as a whole and each particle separately. Realistically, for one to look at a large data set at full resolution at all times is not possible and, in fact, not necessary. We have developed an agglomerative clustering technique, based on the concept of a mutual nearest neighbor (MNN). This procedure can be easily adapted for efficient visualization of extremely large data sets from simulations with particles at various resolution levels. We present the parallel algorithm for MNN clustering and its timings on the IBM SP and SGI/Origin 3800 multiprocessor systems for up to 16 million fluid particles. The high efficiency obtained is mainly due to the similarity in the algorithmic structure of MNN clustering and particle methods. We show various examples drawn from MNN applications in visualization and analysis of the order of a few hundred gigabytes of data from discrete particle simulations, using dissipative particle dynamics and fluid particle models. Because data clustering is the first step in this concept extraction procedure, we may employ this clustering procedure to many other fields such as data mining, earthquake events-and stellar populations in nebula clusters.

Classical data mining techniques are based on the power set lattice of binary attributes and, even extended, are not suitable when addressing the discovery of constrained multidimensional patterns. In this paper we propose a foundation for various multidimensional data mining problems by introducing a new algebraic structure called cube lattice which characterizes the search space to be explored. We take into consideration monotone and/or antimonotone constraints enforced when mining multidimensional patterns. In addition, we propose condensed representations of the constrained cube lattice which is a convex space. Finally, we place emphasis on advantages of the cube lattice when compared to the power set lattice of binary attributes used for multidimensional data mining.

The major characteristic of this project is the fusion of RFID technology, database management, data mining, real-time information visualization, and interactive web application technologies into an operational integrated system deployed at a major public conference. The developed system tracks conference attendees, analyzes the tracking data in real-time and provides various services to the attendees, such as a real-time snapshot of the conference events attendance, the ability to locate friends in the convention center, and the ability to search for events of interest. The results of this experiment were revealing in terms of both the potential of the developed technology and the conference dynamics.

Similarly, in data mining, an association occurs when one attribute set occurs together with another As the number of such associations may be large, maximal association rules are sought, e.g., Feldman et al (1997, 1998). Rough set theory is a successful tool for data mining. By using this theory, rules similar to maximal associations can be found. However we show that the rough set approach to discovering knowledge is much simpler than the maximal association method.

One of the primary data mining tasks is clustering. However, traditional clustering algorithms often fail to detect meaningful clusters because of the high dimensional, inherently sparse feature space of most real-world data sets. Nevertheless, the data sets often contain clusters hidden in various subspaces of the original feature space. We present a pre-processing step for traditional clustering algorithms, which detects all interesting subspaces of high-dimensional data containing clusters. For this purpose, we define a quality criterion for the interestingness of a subspace and propose an efficient algorithm called RIS (Ranking Interesting Subspaces) to examine all such subspaces. A broad evaluation based on synthetic and real-world data sets empirically shows that RIS is suitable to find all relevant subspaces: in large, high dimensional, sparse data and to rank them accordingly.

We briefly review existing approaches and argue for the potential added value of using agent technology in the domain of knowledge discovery, discussing both issues and benefits. We also propose an approach to distributed data clustering, outline its agent-oriented implementation, and examine potential privacy violating attacks in which agents may incur.

PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence	DEC 04-07, 2003	BEJA, PORTUGAL				LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ACCURACY; TIME	We propose a methodology to investigate the relevance for the real world of repositories of benchmark problems like the one commonly known as the UCI repository. It compares the distribution of relative performance of algorithms in data sets from a given repository and from the "real world". If the distributions are different, the knowledge about the relative performance of algorithms obtained from the repository in question is mostly useless. In the case of the UCI repository, this would mean that a significant proportion of published results would be of little practical use. However, this is not what our results indicate. We also propose an adaptation of this method to test whether tool developers are "overfitting" repositories, which also yields negative results in the UCI repository.

Hence, the page categorization is learned from the data without the need for a (possibly cumbersome) manual categorization. We provide an EM algorithm for training a mixture of HMMs and show that additional static user data can be incorporated easily to possibly enhance the labelling of users. Furthermore, we use prior knowledge to enhance generalization and avoid numerical problems. We use parameter tying to decrease the danger of overfitting and to reduce computational overhead. We put a flat prior on the parameters to deal with the problem that certain transitions between page categories occur very seldom or not at all, in order to ensure that a nonzero transition probability between these categories nonetheless remains. In applications to artificial data and real-world web logs we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. We train a mixture of HMMs on artificial navigation patterns, and show that the correct model is being learned. Moreover, we show that the use of static 'satellite data' may enhance the labeling of shorter navigation patterns. When applying a mixture of HMMs to real-world web logs from a large Dutch commercial web site, we demonstrate that sensible page categorizations are being learned.

J	Zhang, H; Lu, YN; Wang, F				Zhang, H; Lu, YN; Wang, F			Grammar based genetic programming using linear representations	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						genetic programming; context-free grammar; parse tree; derivation tree; linear representation		In recent years, there has been a great interest in genetic programming (GP), which is used to solve many applications such as data mining, electronic engineering and pattern recognition etc.. Genetic programming paradigm as a form of adaptive learning is a functional approach to many problems that require a non-fixed representation and GP typically operates on a population of parse trees which usually represent computer programs whose nodes have single data type. In this paper GP using context-free grammars (CFGs) is described. This technique separates search space from solution space through a genotype to phenotype mapping. The genotypes and phenotypes of the individuals both act on different linear representations. A phenotype is postfix expression, a new method of representing which is described by making use of the definition and related features of a context-free grammar, i.e. a genotype is a variable length, linear valid genome determined by a simplified derivation tree (SDT) generated from a context-free grammar. A CFG is used to specify how the possible solutions are created according to experiential knowledge and to direct legal crossover (or mutation) operations without any explicit reference to the process of program generation and parsing, and automatically ensuring typing and syntax correctness. Some related definitions involving genetic operators are described. Fitness evaluation is given. This technique is applied to a symbol regression problem-the identification of nonlinear dynamic characteristics of cushioning packaging. Experimental results show this method can find good relations between variables and is better than basic GP without a grammar. Future research on it is outlined.

We introduce the concept of profile association rules, which discusses the problem of relating consumer buying behavior to profile information. The problem of online mining of profile association rules in this large database is discussed. We show how to use multidimensional indexing structures in order to actually perform the mining. The use of multidimensional indexing structures to perform profile mining provides considerable advantages in terms of the ability to perform very generic range-based online queries.

It is also shown how EGB2 can integrate asymmetric costs of Type I and Type II errors, thereby minimizing expected misclassification costs. Importantly, it has been shown that standard methods of computing maximum-likelihood estimators are generally inconsistent when applied to sample data having different proportions of labels than are found in the universe from which the sample is drawn. We show how a choice estimator based on weighting each observation's contribution to the log-likelihood function, can contribute to estimator consistency and how this feature can be implemented in EGB2.

We first introduce the creation of the typhoon image collection that consists of around 34,000 typhoon images for the northern and southern hemisphere, providing the medium-sized, richly-variational and quality-controlled data collection suitable for spatio-temporal data mining research. Next we apply several data mining approaches for this image collection. We start with spatial data mining, where principal component analysis is used for extracting basic components and reducing dimensionality, and it revealed that the major principal components describe latitudinal structures and spiral bands. Moreover, clustering procedures give the "birds-eye-view" visualization of typhoon cloud patterns. We then turn to temporal data mining, including state transition rules, but we demonstrate that it involves intrinsic difficulty associated with the nonlinear dynamics of the atmosphere, or chaos. Finally we briefly introduce our system IMET (Image Mining Environment for Typhoon analysis and prediction), which is designed for the intelligent and efficient searching and browsing of the typhoon image collection.

J	Sanchez, SN; Triantaphyllou, E; Kraft, D				Sanchez, SN; Triantaphyllou, E; Kraft, D			A feature mining based approach for the classification of text documents into disjoint classes	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						document classification; document indexing; vector space model; data mining; One Clause At a Time (OCAT) algorithm; machine learning	LOGICAL CLAUSES; EXAMPLES	This paper proposes a new approach for classifying text documents into two disjoint classes. The new approach is based on extracting patterns. in the form of two logical expressions, which are defined on various features (indexing terms) or the documents. The pattern extraction is aimed at providing descriptions (in the form of two logical expressions) of the two classes of positive and negative examples. This is achieved by means or a data mining approach, called One Clause At a Time (OCAT), which is based on mathematical logic, The application of a logic-based approach to text document classification is critical when one wishes to be able to justify why a particular document has been assigned to one class versus the other class. This situation occurs, for instance, in declassifying documents that have been previously considered important to national security and thus are currently being kept as secret. Some Computational experiments have investigated the effectiveness of the OCAT-based approach and compared it to the well-known vector space model (VSM). These tests also have investigated finding the best indexing terms that could be used in making these classification decisions. The results of these computational experiments on a sample of 2897 text documents from the TIPSTER collection indicate that the first approach hits many advantages over the VSM approach for solving this type of text document classification problem. Moreover, a guided strategy for the OCAT-based approach is presented for deciding which document one needs to consider next while building the training example sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We have developed a data mining system, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/rsnp/, called rSNP-Guide, to discover regulatory sites in DNA sequences, which mutations could be the cause of genetic diseases. During the first step, we estimate the abilities of the proteins considered to bind to genomic DNA, which alterations by mutations are associated with a genetic disease under study. During the second step, we formalize the disease-associated experimental data on the SNP-referred alterations in DNA binding to unknown protein. During the third step, we cluster fuzzily all known proteins examined so that to determine one of them, which specific site is altered by mutations in consistence with that of the unknown protein experimentally associated with genetic disease. During the fourth step, we predict the known protein, which binding site is (i) resent on DNA and (ii) altered by mutations associated with genetic disease. Finally, during the last step, we estimate the robustness of this prediction. The rSNP_ Guide has been tested on the SNPs with the known relationships between regulatory site alterations and genetic disease penetration. Besides, the novel SNPs-referred regulatory sites associated with the genetic disease penetrations were discovered and, then, successfully confirmed experimentally. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this article we deal with the grouping of rows and columns of a matrix with non-negative entries. Two rows (or columns) are considered similar if corresponding cross-distributions are close. This grouping is a dual clustering of two sets of elements, row and column indices. The introduced approach is based on the minimization of reduction of mutual information contained in a matrix that represents the relationship between two sets of elements. Our clustering approach contains many parallels with K-Means clustering due to certain common algebraic properties. The obtained results have many applications, including grouping of Web visit data.

One of the problems encountered is the overfilling of rules to training data. In some cases this can lead to an excessively large number of rules, many of which have very little predictive value for unseen data. This paper describes a means of reducing overfitting known as J-pruning, based on the J-measure, an information theoretic means of quantifying the information content of a rule. It is demonstrated that using J-pruning generally leads to a substantial reduction in the number of rules generated and an increase in predictive accuracy. The advantage gained becomes more pronounced as the proportion of noise increases.

An alternative source of evidence, especially valuable for understanding the purposes for which the application was built, can be the dynamic behavior of the system, and more specifically the system-user interaction. We have developed a method for modeling the application behavior from the user's perspective in the form of use case models, using recorded traces of system-user interaction. We use data mining and pattern matching methods to mine these traces for frequently occurring user tasks. When interesting patterns are discovered, they are augmented with semantic information and they are used to build use case models. We demonstrate a successful application of this method to recover use case models from interaction traces with legacy 3270 systems to serve user interface reengineering activities.

J	Gentry, JA; Shaw, MJ; Tessmer, AC; Whitford, DT				Gentry, JA; Shaw, MJ; Tessmer, AC; Whitford, DT			Using inductive learning to predict bankruptcy	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						bankruptcy prediction; data mining; free cash flow; inductive learning; information entropy; net cash flow; relative cash flow components	INCREMENTAL INFORMATION-CONTENT; OPERATING CASH FLOW; FINANCIAL DISTRESS; FIRMS; MODELS; COMPONENTS; ACCRUALS; EARNINGS; COSTS	An emerging trend in organizational computing is using information technology to learn decision knowledge from enterprise data. The primary contribution of this study is the presentation of a sound theory and a comprehensive technique for learning the decision model for predicting bankruptcy. The theory is based on the information contained in cash flow components, which is the foundation of valuation theory, and an analytical system that measures the amount of uncertainty in the cash flow information. The approach links a tree-based inductive learning system that relies on the concept of entropy, with an information system based on the cash flow of a firm. A test of the cash flow approach involves the cash flow components for a sample of 99 failed and 99 non-failed companies. The structural instability of cash flow components generated by an inductive learning system is a serious issue for financial analysts. However, this shortcoming is overcome by using a jackknife procedure to develop a global tree that identifies the most important cash flow components. The final global tree found only 3 cash flow components were needed to classify correctly 89% of the companies as either failed or non-failed. Only a few early studies achieved a higher level of predictive accuracy. The 3 significant cash flow components were dividends, net investment, and net operating cash flow. Using the same data, a probit statistical technique generated a 67.5% predictive accuracy. In summary, the inductive learning results indicate that cash flow components are not only a natural tool for explaining the bankruptcy process, but they provide a high level of predictive accuracy.

Frequent structures are graphs that are isomorphic to a large number of subgraphs in the data graph. Frequent structures form building blocks for visual exploration and data mining of semistructured data. We overcome the inherent computational complexity of the problem by using a summary data structure to prune the search space and to provide interactive feedback. We present an experimental study of our methods operating on real datasets. The implementation of our methods is capable of operating on datasets that are two to three orders of magnitude larger than those described in prior work.

This paper thus attempts to propose a new mining approach for extracting linguistic weighted association rules from quantitative transactions, when the parameters needed in the mining process are given in linguistic terms. Items are also evaluated by managers as linguistic terms to reflect their importance, which are then transformed as fuzzy sets of weights. Fuzzy operations are then used to find weighted fuzzy large itemsets and fuzzy association rules. An example is given to clearly illustrate the proposed approach.

J	Nock, R				Nock, R			Inducing interpretable voting classifiers without trading accuracy for simplicity: Theoretical results, approximation algorithms, and experiments	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							RULES	Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification strength is being rased in a growing number of machine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theroetically and empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. then we provide an efficient "top-down and prune" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision committees.

However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns "motifs", because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification. In this work we carefully motivate, then introduce, a non-trivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to discover them, and we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach on several real world datasets.

It usually requires that users fully understand the database structure and content to issue a query. Due to the complexity of the database applications, the so called global queries can be posed which traditional query answering systems can not handle. In this paper a query answering system based on distributed data mining is presented to rectify these problems. Task ontologies are used as a tool to handle semantic inconsistencies between sites.

We present several examples of information maps and patterns in such maps. In particular, temporal patterns investigated in data mining are special cases of such patterns in information maps. We also introduce association rules over information maps. Patterns over such maps can be represented by means of formulas of temporal logics.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that little is known about which techniques are suited to which types of problems. This paper provides some insights into the data characteristics that suit particular data mining algorithms. Our approach consists of four main stages. First, the performance of six leading data mining algorithms is examined across a collection of 57 well-known classification problems from the machine learning literature. Secondly, a collection of statistics that describe each of the 57 problems in terms of data complexity is collated. Thirdly, a self-organising map (SOM) is used to cluster the 57 problems based on these measures of complexity. Each cluster represents a group of classification problems with similar data characteristics. The performance of each data mining algorithm within each cluster is then examined in the Final stage to provide both quantitative and qualitative insights into which techniques perform best on certain problem types.

The entire system is parallelized on the Silicon Graphics Origin 2000, which is a shared memory multiprocessor system consisting of 24-CPU, 4G main memory, and 200GB hard-drive. In simulations, the parallel fuzzy neural network running on a 24-processor system is trained in parallel using training data sets, and then the trained parallel fuzzy neural network discovers fuzzy rules for future prediction. A parallel learning algorithm is implemented in C. The data are extracted into a flat file from SQL server database containing sample Visa Card transactions and then preprocessed for applying in fraud detection. The data are classified into three categories: first for training, second for prediction, and third for fraud detection. After learning from training data, the GNN is used to predict on second set of data and later the third set of data is applied for fraud detection. Around eight scenarios are employed for detecting purpose. GNN gives fewer average training errors with larger amount of past training data. We also found that the number of training error is inversely proportional to the number of training cycles. The higher the fraud detection error is, the greater the possibility of that transaction being actually fraudulent.

In the paper, we investigate ways of using ordered information for gastric cancer data mining, based on rough set theory and granular computing. With respect to the notion of ordered information tables, we describe how to mine ordering rules and how to form granules of values of attributes in a pre/post-processing step for improving the quality of the mined classification rules. Experimental results in gastric cancer data mining show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approaches.

In this paper, we present our development of an integrated environment acting as a software agent for discovering correlative attributes of data objects from multiple heterogeneous resources. The environment provides necessary supporting tools and processing engines for acquiring, collecting, and extracting relevant information from multiple data resources, and then forming meaningful knowledge patterns. The agent system is featured with an interactive user interface that provides useful communication channels for human supervisors to actively engage in necessary consultation and guidance in the entire knowledge discovery processes. A cross-reference technique is employed for searching and discovering coherent set of correlative patterns from the heterogeneous data resources. A Bayesian network approach is applied as a knowledge representation scheme for recording and manipulating the discovered causal relations. The system employs common data warehousing and OLAP techniques to form integrated data repository and generate database queries over large data collections from various distinct data resources.

J	Moon, YS; Whang, KY; Loh, WK				Moon, YS; Whang, KY; Loh, WK			Efficient time-series subsequence matching using duality in constructing windows	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						duality; data mining; subsequence matching; time-series data; similarity search		In this paper, we propose a new subsequence matching method, Dual Match. Dual Match exploits duality in constructing windows and significantly improves performance. Dual Match divides data sequences into disjoint windows and the query sequence into sliding windows, and thus, is a dual approach of the one by Faloutsos et al. (Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Seattle, Washington, 1994, pp. 419-429.) (FRM in short), which divides data sequences into sliding windows and the query sequence into disjoint windows. FRM causes a lot of false alarms (i.e., candidates that do not qualify) by storing minimum bounding rectangles rather than individual points representing windows to save storage space for the index. Dual Match solves this problem by directly storing points without incurring excessive storage overhead. Experimental results show that, in most cases, Dual Match provides large improvement both in false alarms and performance over FRM given the same amount of storage space. In particular, for low selectivities (less than 10(-4)), Dual Match significantly improves performance up to 430-fold. On the other hand, for high selectivities (more than 10(-2)), it shows a very minor degradation (less than 29%). For selectivities in between (10(-4)-10(-2)), Dual Match shows performance slightly better than that of FRM. Overall, these results indicate that our approach provides a new paradigm in subsequence matching that improves performance significantly in large database applications.

While the model is induced from the follow-up data, we show that the use of additional expert knowledge is absolutely crucial to obtain good predictive accuracy. A schema is proposed where domain knowledge is encoded as a hierarchical decision model of which only a part is induced from the data while the rest is specified by the expert. Although applied to hip endoprosthesis domain, the proposed schema is general and can be used for the construction of other prognostic models where both follow-up data and human expertise is available.

J	Zhang, SC; Wu, XD				Zhang, SC; Wu, XD			Large scale data mining based on data partitioning	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Dealing with very large databases is one of the defining challenges in data mining research and development. Some databases are simply too large (e.g., with terabytes of data) to be processed at one time. For efficiency and space reasons, partitioning them into subsets for processing is necessary. However, since the number of item sets in each partitioned data subset can be a combinatorial amount and each of them may be a large item set in the original database, data mining results from these subsets can be very large in size. Therefore, the key to data partitioning is how to aggregate the results from these subsets. It is not realistic to keep all results from each subset, because the rules from one subset need to be verified for usefulness in other subsets. This article presents a model of aggregating association rules from different data subsets by weighting. In particular, the aggregation efficiency is enhanced by rule selection.

In the similarity join, two point sets of a multidimensional vector space are combined such that the result contains all point pairs where the distance does not exceed a parameter epsilon. Due to its high practical relevance, many similarity join algorithms have been devised. In this paper, we propose an analytical cost model for the similarity join operation based an indexes. Our problem analysis reveals a serious optimization conflict between CPU time and I/O time: Fine-grained index structures are beneficial for the CPU efficiency, but deteriorate the I/O performance. As a consequence of this observation, we propose a new index architecture and join algorithm which allows a separate optimization of CPU time and I/O time. Our solution utilizes large pages which are optimized for I/O processing. The pages accommodate a search structure which minimizes the computational effort. In the experimental evaluation, a substantial improvement over competitive techniques is shown.		Bohm, C (reprint author), Univ Munich, Marchioninistr 15, D-80539 Munich, Germany.

J	Chang, SK; Znati, T				Chang, SK; Znati, T			Adlet: An active document abstraction for multimedia information fusion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						active document; information fusion; active index system	DISCOVERY; SYSTEM	A new approach is described for the fusion of multimedia information based on the concept of active documents advertising on the Internet, whereby the metadata of a document travels in the network to seek out documents of interest to the parent document and, at the same time, advertises its parent document to other interested documents. This abstraction of metadata is called an adlet, which is the core of our approach. Two important features make this approach applicable to multimedia information fusion, information retrieval, data mining, geographic information systems, and medical information systems: 1) any document, including a web page, database record, video file, audio file, image and even paper documents, can be enhanced by an adlet and become an active document, and 2) any node in a nonactive network can be enhanced by adlet-savvy software and the adlet-enhanced node can coexist with other nonenhanced nodes. An experimental prototype provides a testbed for feasibility studies in a hybrid active network environment.

S	Fan, TF; Hu, WC; Liau, CJ			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Fan, TF; Hu, WC; Liau, CJ			Decision logics for knowledge representation in data mining	25TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE & APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE	PROCEEDINGS - INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE & APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	25th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2001)	OCT 08-12, 2001	CHICAGO, IL	IEEE Comp Soc			FUZZY	In this paper the qualitative and quantitative semantics for rules in data tables are investigated from a logical viewpoint. In modern data analysis, knowledge can be discovered from data tables and is usually represented by some rules. However, the knowledge is useful for a human user only when he can understand the meaning of the rules. This is called the interpretability problem of intelligent data analysis. The solution of the problem depends on the selection of the rule representation language. A good representation language should have clear semantics so that a rule can be effectively validated with respect to the given data tables. In this regard, logic is one of the best choices. Starting from reviewing the decision logic for data tables, we subsequently generalize it to fuzzy and possibilistic decision logics. The rules are then viewed as the implications between well-formed formulas of these logics and their semantics with respect to precise or uncertain data tables are presented. The validity, support, and confidence of a rule are also rigorously defined in the framework.

We define a Logical Information System that combines navigation and querying for searching for objects. Places and queries are unified as formal concepts represented by logical formulas. Answers can be both extensional (objects belonging to a concept) and intensional (formulas refining a concept). Thus, all facets of navigation are formalized in terms of Logical Concept Analysis. We show that the definition of being a refinement of some concept is a specific case of Knowledge Discovery in a formal context. It can be generalized to recover more classical KD operations like machine-learning through the computation of necessary or sufficient properties (modulo some confidence), or data-mining through association rules.

So far, however, association rules of this type have not been investigated thoroughly from a semantical point of view. Particularly, the quality measures which have been proposed for assessing such rules are mostly "ad-hoc" generalizations of measures for classical rules. In this paper, we show that fuzzy association rules can be interpreted in different ways and that the interpretation has a strong influence on their assessment and, hence, on the process of rule mining. We motivate the use of multiple-valued implication operators in order to model fuzzy association rules and propose quality measures suitable for this type of rule.

Since it's inception in 1990, NED has provided astronomers world-wide with the results of a systematic cross-correlation of catalogs covering all wavelengths, along with thousands of extragalactic observations culled from published journal articles. NED is continuously being expanded and revised to include new catalogs and published observations, each undergoing a process of cross-identification to capture the current state of knowledge about extragalactic sources in a panchromatic fashion. In addition to assimilating data from the literature, the team is incrementally folding in millions of observations from new large-scale sky surveys such as 2MASS, NVSS, APM, and SDSS. At the time of writing the system contains over 3.3 million unique objects with 4.2 million cross-identifications. We summarize the recent evolution of NED from its initial emphasis on object name-, position-, and literature-based queries into a research environment that also assists statistical data exploration and discovery using large samples of objects. Newer capabilities enable intelligent 'Web mining' of entries in geographically distributed astronomical archives that are indexed by object names and positions in NED, sample building using constraints on redshifts, object types and other parameters, as well as image and spectral archives for targeted or serendipitous discoveries. A pilot study demonstrates how NED is being used in conjunction with linked survey archives to characterize the properties of galaxy classes to form a training set for machine learning algorithms; an initial goal is production of statistical likelihoods that newly discovered sources belong to known classes, represent statistical outliers, or candidates for fundamentally new types of objects. Challenges and opportunities for tighter integration of NED capabilities into data mining tools for astronomy archives are also discussed.

S	Pierfederici, F		Starck, JL; Murtagh, FD		Pierfederici, F			Querator: an advanced multi-archive data mining tool	ASTRONOMICAL DATA ANALYSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Astronomical Data Analysis	AUG 02-03, 2001	SAN DIEGO, CA	SPIE		Astronomy; multi-color photometry; Virtual Observatory; data-mining; databases; search engines		In recent years, the operation of large telescopes with wide field detectors - such as the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the 2.2 meters telescope at La Silla, Chile - have dramatically increased the amount of astronomical data produced each year. The next survey telescopes, such as the ESO VST, will continue on this trend, producing extremely large datasets. Astronomy, therefore, has become an incredibly data rich field requiring new tools and new strategies to efficiently handle huge archives and fully exploit their scientific content. At the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility we are working on a new project, code named Querator*. Querator is an advanced multi-archive search engine built to address the needs of astronomers looking for multicolor imaging data across different astronomical data-centers. Querator returns sets of images of a given astronomical object or search region. A set contains exposures in a number of different wave bands. The user constraints the number of desired wave bands by selecting from a set of instruments, filters or by specifying actual physical units. As far as present-day data-centers are concerned, Querator points out the need for: - an uniform and standard description of archival data and - an uniform and standard description of how the data was acquired (i.e. instrument and observation characteristics). Clearly, these pieces of information will constitute an intermediate layer between the data itself and the data mining tools operating on it. This layered structure is a prerequisite to real data-center inter-operability and, hence, to Virtual Observatories (VOs). A detailed description of Querator's design, of the required data structures, of the problems encountered so far and of the proposed solutions will be given in the following pages. Throughout this paper we'll favor the term data-center over archive to stress the need to look at raw-pixels' archives and catalogues in an homogeneous way.

Mining Associations is one of the techniques involved in the process mentioned above and used in this paper. Association is the discovery of association relationships or correlations among a set of items. The algorithm that was implemented is a basic algorithm for mining association rules, known as a priori. In Healthcare, association rules are considered to be quite useful as they offer the possibility to conduct intelligent diagnosis and extract invaluable information and build important knowledge bases quickly and automatically. The problem of identifying new, unexpected and interesting patterns in medical databases in general, and diabetic data repositories in specific, is considered in this paper. We have applied the apriori algorithm to a database containing records of diabetic patients and attempted to extract association rules from the stored real parameters. The results indicate that the methodology followed may be of good value to the diagnostic procedure, especially when large data volumes are involved The followed process and the implemented system offer an efficient and effective tool in the management of diabetes. Their clinical relevance and utility await the results of prospective clinical studies currently under investigation.

J	Smith, A; Suri, S				Smith, A; Suri, S			Rectangular tiling in multidimensional arrays	JOURNAL OF ALGORITHMS			English	Article								We study the following tiling problem in d dimensions: given a d-dimensional rectangular array of nonnegative numbers and an integer p, partition the array into at most p rectangular subarrays so that the maximum weight of any subarray is minimized; the weight of a subarray is the sum of its elements. The rectangular tiling problem is motivated by applications in data mining, data partitioning, and video compression. Recently, Khanna, Muthukrishnan, and Paterson [SODA'98], showed that the tiling problem is NP-complete and gave a 2.5-approximation algorithm for d = 2. In this paper, we extend their result to multidimensional arrays and give an algorithm with approximation ratio (d+3/2), for d greater than or equal to 2. The algorithm can be implemented to run in worst-case time O(N + p log N) time, where N is the size of the array, and the constant is of the order d!. We also obtain a similar algorithm for the dual tiling problem, where the goal is to compute a tiling of weight at most W using as few tiles as possible. Our algorithm yields an approximation factor (2d + 1). We implemented our algorithm and ran simulation tests on multidimensional arrays with random data. In our limited experiments, the algorithm always produced approximations that were no worse than factor two from the optimal. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Landmarking is a novel and promising meta-learning approach to model selection. It uses accuracy estimates from simple and efficient learners to describe tasks and subsequently construct meta-classifiers that predict which one of a set of more elaborate learning algorithms is appropriate for a given problem. Experiments show that landmarking compares favourably with the traditional statistical approach to meta-learning.

It searches for an "optimal" subset of features. The search strategies under consideration are one of the three: complete, heuristic, and probabilistic. Existing algorithms adopt various measures to evaluate the goodness of feature subsets. This work focuses on one measure called consistency. We study its properties in comparison with other major measures and different ways of using this measure in search of feature subsets. We conduct an empirical study to examine the pros and cons of these different search methods using consistency. Through this extensive exercise, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of this measure and its relations with other measures and a guideline of the use of this measure with different search strategies facing a new application.

A key computationally-intensive subproblem of data mining involves finding frequent sets in order to help mine association rules for market basket analysis. Given a bag of sets and a probability, the frequent set problem is to determine which subsets occur in the bag with some minimum probability. This paper provides a convincing application of program calculation in the derivation of a completely new and fast algorithm for this practical problem. Beginning with a simple but inefficient specification expressed in a functional language, the new algorithm is calculated in a systematic manner from the specification by applying a sequence of known calculation techniques.

Two problems are tackled with Fastmap in the interactive process of discovering interesting clusters from real world databases. That is, (1) to verify separations of clusters created by a clustering algorithm and (2) to determine the number of clusters to be produced. They are achieved through projecting objects and clusters by Fastmap to the 2D space and visually examining the results by humans.

Furthermore, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be updated timely whenever a novel intrusion surfaces; and geographically distributed IDSs need to cooperate to detect distributed and coordinated intrusions. In this paper, we describe an experimental system, based on the Common Intrusion Detection Framework (CIDF), where multiple IDSs can exchange attack information to detect distributed intrusions. The system also includes an ID model builder, where a data mining engine can receive audit data of a novel attack from an IDS, compute a new detection model, and then distribute it to other IDSs. We describe our experiences in implementing such system and the preliminary results of deploying the system in an experimental network.

A serious problem of its practical applications is long processing time required by data mining algorithms. Current systems consume minutes or hours to answer simple queries. In this paper we present the concept of materialized data mining views. Materialized data mining views store selected patterns discovered in a portion of a database, and are used for query rewriting, which transforms a data mining query into a query accessing a materialized view. Since the transformation is transparent to a user, materialized data mining views can be created and used like indexes.

To better reflect the customer usage patterns in the EC environment, we propose a mining model that takes both the traveling patteerns and purchasing behavior of customers into consideration. We devise two efficient olgorithms (MTSPJ and MTSPC) for determining the frequent transaction patterns, which are termed large transaction patterns in this paper. In addition, algorithm WTM devised in our prior work, is used for comparison purposes. By utilizing the path-trimming technique which is developed to exploit the relationship between traveling and purchasing behaviors, MTSPJ and MTSPC are able to generate the large transaction patterns very efficiently simulation model for the EC environment is developed mid a synthetic workload is,generated for performance studies.

These benefits are investigated by applying discretisation algorithms to two large commercial databases; the discretisations yielded are then evaluated using a simulated annealing based data mining algorithm. The results produced suggest that dramatic reductions in problem size may be achieved, yielding improvements in the speed of the data mining algorithm. However, it is also demonstrated under certain circumstances that the discretisation produced may give an increase in problem size or allow overfitting by the data mining algorithm. Such cases, within which often only a small proportion of the database belongs to the class of interest, highlight the need both for caution when producing discretisations and for the development of more robust discretisation algorithms.

Therefore, rule induction requires preprocessing, where missing attribute values are replaced by appropriate values. The rule induction method used in our research is based on rough. set theory. In this paper we present our results on a new approach to missing attribute values called a closest fit. The main idea of the closest fit is based on searching through the set of all cases, considered as vectors of attribute values, for a case that is the most similar to the given case with missing attribute values. There are two possible ways to look for the closest case: we may restrict our attention to the given concept or to the set of all cases. These methods are compared with a special case of the closest fit principle: replacing missing attribute values by the most common Value from the concept. All algorithms were implemented in system OOMIS. Our experiments were performed on preterm birth data sets collected at the Duke University Medical Center.

A belief-based theory of Approximate Reasoning is proposed for these structures. Evidence sets are then used in the development of a relational database architecture useful for the data mining of information stored in several networked databases. This useful data mining application establishes an Artificial Intelligence model of Cognitive Categorization with a hybrid architecture that possesses both connectionist and symbolic attributes.

J	Srivastava, J; Chen, PY				Srivastava, J; Chen, PY			Warehouse creation - A potential roadblock to data warehousing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data warehouse; entity identification; attribute value conflict; data mining; data integration	INTEGRATION; QUERIES	Data warehousing is gaining in popularity as organizations realize the benefits of being able to perform sophisticated analyses of their data. Recent years have seen the introduction of a number of data-warehousing engines. from both established database vendors as well as new players. The engines themselves are relatively easy to use and come with a good set of end-user tools. However, there is one key stumbling block to the rapid development of data warehouses, namely that of warehouse population. Specifically problems arise in populating a warehouse with existing data since it has various types of heterogeneity. Given the lack of good tools, this task has generally been performed by various system integrators, e.g., software consulting organizations which have developed in-house tools and processes for the task. The general conclusion is that the task has proven to be labor-intensive, error-prone, and generally frustrating, leading a number of warehousing projects to be abandoned mid-way through development. However, the picture is not as grim as it appears. The problems that are being encountered in warehouse creation are very similar to those encountered in data integration, and they have been studied for about two decades. However, not all problems relevant to warehouse creation have been solved. and a number of research issues remain. The principal goal of this paper is to identify the common issues in data integration and data-warehouse creation. We hope this will lead: Ij developers of warehouse creation tools to examine and, where appropriate, incorporate the techniques developed for data integration, and 2) researchers in both the data integration and the data warehousing communities to address the open research issues in this important area.

Usually, Srikant and Agrawal's algorithm is used for mining generalized association rules upon all levels of presumed exact taxonomic structures. However, in many real-world applications, the taxonomic structures may not be crisp but fuzzy. This paper focuses on the issue of mining generalized association rules with fuzzy taxonomic structures. Particular attention is paid to extending the notions of the degree of support, the degree of confidence, and the R-interest measure. The computation of these degrees takes into account the fact that there exists a partial belonging of any two itemsets in the taxonomy concerned. Finally, a simplified example is given to help illustrate the ideas.

This is an important operation for spatial on-line analytical processing and spatial data mining, where polygons representing different spatial objects often need to be amalgamated by varying criteria when the user wants to aggregate or reclassify these objects. The processing cost of this operation can be very high for a large number of polygons. Based on the observation that not all polygons to be amalgamated contribute to the boundary, we investigate in this paper efficient polygon amalgamation methods by excluding those internal polygons without retrieving them fr-om the database; Two novel algorithms, adjacency-based and occupancy-based, are proposed. While both algorithms can reduce the amalgamation cost significantly, the occupancy-based algorithm is particularly attractive because: 1) it retrieves a smaller amount of data than the adjacency-based algorithm; 2) it is based on a simple extension to a commonly used spatial indexing mechanism; and 3) it can handle fuzzy amalgamation.

J	Park, I; Voss, M; Armstrong, B; Eigenmann, R				Park, I; Voss, M; Armstrong, B; Eigenmann, R			Parallel programming and performance evaluation with the URSA tool family	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						parallel programming; programming environment; performance evaluation; program optimization; web-based tool		This paper contributes to the solution of several open problems with parallel programming tools and their integration with performance evaluation environments. First, we propose interactive compilation scenarios instead of the usual black-box-oriented use of compiler tools. In such scenarios, information gathered by the compiler and the compiler's reasoning are presented to the user in meaningful ways and on-demand. Second, a tight integration of compilation and performance analysis tools is advocated. Many of the existing, advanced instruments for gathering performance results are being used in the presented environment and their results are combined in integrated views with compiler information and data from other tools. Initial instruments that assist users in "data mining" this information are presented and the need for much stronger facilities is explained. The URSA Family provides two tools addressing these issues. URSA MINOR supports a group of users at a specific site, such as a research or development project. URSA MAJOR complements this tool by making available the gathered results to the user community at large via the World-wide Web. This paper presents objectives, functionality, experience, and next development steps of the URSA tool family. Two case studies are presented that illustrate the use of the tools for developing and studying parallel applications and for evaluating parallelizing compilers.

J	Wu, XD				Wu, XD			Rule induction with extension matrices	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								This article presents a heuristic, attribute-based, noise-tolerant data mining program, HCV (Version 2.0), based on the newly-developed extension matrix approach. By dividing the positive examples (PE) of a specific class in a given example set into intersecting groups and adopting a set of strategies to find a heuristic conjunctive formula in each group which covers all the group's positive examples and none of the negative examples (NE), the HCV induction algorithm adopted in the HCV (Version 2.0) software finds a description formula in the form of variable-valued logic for PE against NE in low-order polynomial time at induction time. In addition to the HCV induction algorithm, this article also outlines some of the techniques for noise handling and discretization of numerical domains developed and implemented in the HCV (Version 2.0) software, and provides a performance comparison of HCV (Version 2.0) with other data mining algorithms ID3, C4.5, C4.5rules, and NewID in noisy and continuous domains. The empirical comparison shows that the rules generated by HCV (Version 2.0) are more compact than the decision trees or rules produced by ID3-like algorithms, and HCV's predicative accuracy is competitive with ID3-like algorithms.

Our method attempts to find out hyperboxes at any orientation by combining deterministic hill-climbing with GA. Standard techniques, such as C4.5, use hyperboxes that are aligned with the coordinate axes. The system uses the decision queue (DQ) as method of representing the rule set. It means that the obtained rules must be applied in specific order, that is, an example will be classify by the i-rule only if it doesn't satisfy the condition part of the i-1 previous rules. With this policy, the number of rules is less because the rules could be one inside of another one. We have tested our system on real data from UCI repository. Moreover, we have designed some two-dimensional artificial databases to show graphically the experiments. The results are summarized in the last section.

Recently, it was shown that those associations that are missing in data may also be interesting. These missing associations are the holes or empty regions. The existing algorithm for discovering holes has a number of shortcomings. It requires each hole to contain no data point, which is too restrictive for many real-life applications. It also has a very high complexity, and produces a huge number of holes. Additionally, the algorithm only works in a continuous space, and does not allow any discrete/nominal attribute. These drawbacks limit its applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these shortcomings. This approach transforms the holes-discovery problem into a supervised learning task, and then uses the decision tree induction technique for discovering holes in data.

We describe a paleoecological reconstruction problem where Bayesian methods are useful and allow plausible inferences from the small and vague data sets available. Paleoecological reconstruction aims at estimating temperatures in the past. Knowledge about present day abundances of certain species are combined with data about the same species in fossil assemblages (e.g., lake sediments). Stated formally, the reconstruction task has the form of a typical machine learning problem. However, to obtain useful predictions, a lot of background knowledge about ecological variation is needed. In paleoecological literature the statistical methods are involved variations of regression. We compare these methods with regression trees, nearest neighbor methods, and Bayesian hierarchical models. All the methods achieve about the same prediction accuracy on modern specimens, but the Bayesian methods and the involved regression methods seem to yield the best reconstructions. The advantage of the Bayesian methods is that they also give good estimates on the variability of the reconstructions.

In order to use these developments in practical settings, there is need to consider the computing systems that would support the complete KDD process. In this regard, we identify and discuss important computing systems issues, and we compare and contrast some available research and commercial efforts. We suggest several enhancements to the underlying database systems that may significantly benefit the KDD process. We indicate why it is important that tools to handle different aspects of the KDD effort need to be integrated. Finally, we briefly describe our experience in implementing a prototype KDD system for a large corporate environment.

J	Lee, DH; Kim, MH				Lee, DH; Kim, MH			Database summarization using fuzzy ISA hierarchies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						data mining; fuzzy set application; summary discovery		Summ. discovery is one of the major components of knowledge discovery in databases, which provides the user with comprehensive information for grasping the essence from a large amount of information in a database. In this paper, we propose an interactive top-down summary discovery process which utilizes fuzzy ISA hierarchies as domain knowledge, We define a generalized tuple as a representational form of a database summary including fuzzy concepts. By virtue of fuzzy ISA hierarchies where fuzzy ISA relationships common in actual domains are naturally expressed, the discovery process comes up with more accurate database summaries. We also present an informativeness measure for distinguishing generalized tuples that delivers much information to users, based on Shannon's information theory.

J	Djoko, S; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB				Djoko, S; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB			An empirical study of domain knowledge and its benefits to substructure discovery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; minimum description length principle; data compression; inexact graph match; domain knowledge	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; DISTANCE; GRAPHS	Discovering repetitive, interesting, and functional substructures in a structural database improves the ability to interpret and compress the data. However, scientists working with a database in their area of expertise often search for predetermined types of structures or for structures exhibiting characteristics specific to the domain. This paper presents a method for guiding the discovery process with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, the SUBDUE discovery system is used to evaluate the benefits of using domain knowledge to guide the discovery process. Domain knowledge is incorporated into SUBDUE following a single general methodology to guide the discovery process. Results show that domain-specific knowledge improves the search for substructures that are useful to the domain and leads to greater compression of the data. To illustrate these benefits, examples and experiments from the computer programming, computer-aided design circuit, and artificially generated domains are presented.

Different methods are used for extraction of different types of relationships. A complete methodology for extraction is developed by integrating widely accepted statistical methods. Statistical relationships manifest embedded relationships in data and thus lend themselves naturally to estimating unknown attribute values and detecting unlikely values. We will carefully examine these applications and evaluate the usefulness of statistical relationships in these applications using a real-life database.

The system uses data-mining techniques known as induction and case based reasoning which exploit failure descriptions that are stored in a case base. A first prototype using the induction technique applied on an initial case base has been achieved. The paper presents the main characteristics of the CBR and induction techniques. The modelling of the engine failures and the process of feeding the case base are given next. The system is intended to be used by airline maintenance staff and CFMI specialists. A user friendly environment has been implemented to allow an optimum use of the system as a troubleshooting support.

The research aims to develop this idea into a theory of computing to integrate and simplify diverse concepts in the field. The research also aims to develop a 'new generation' computing system, based on the theory, to integrate and simplify diverse kinds of computing and to achieve more flexibility and 'intelligence' than conventional computers. Software simulations of the proposed new system provide a concrete expression of the developing theory and a test-bed for the ideas. The background to the research is briefly reviewed including evidence that information compression is a significant element in biological information processing systems. Concepts of information and redundancy are described as a basis for describing how information compression may be achieved by the comparison or matching of patterns, the merging or unification of patterns which are the same, together with metrics-guided search (e.g., 'hill climbing', 'beam search') to maximise compression for a given computational effort. The main elements of the SP theory and of the proposed SP system are described with a summary of developments to date. Some of the kinds of computing which be interpreted as information compression are briefly reviewed. These include: the 'low level' workings of conventional computers; information retrieval, pattern recognition and de-referencing of identifiers; unsupervised inductive learning (grammatical inference, data mining, automatic organisation of software and of knowledge bases); the execution of mathematical or computing functions; deductive and probabilistic inference; parsing and natural language processing; planning and problem solving. Areas of uncertainty where further work is needed are indicated at appropriate points throughout the article.

These large data sets typically describe different states of a system and are difficult to interpret because there is no obvious way of abstracting and presenting data features in a meaningful way for a human observer. Data mining is a term which has recently become popular to describe techniques for the exploration and exploitation of data. In particular, a large part of data mining involves the visualisation of data and subsequent utilisation of machine-learning techniques for classification of data. This paper describes some techniques for data visualisation which enable the user to enhance understanding of the structure and properties of (often multidimensional) data prior to applying machine-learning techniques for further analysis and exploration.

J	Denoeux, T				Denoeux, Thierry			Maximum Likelihood Estimation from Uncertain Data in the Belief Function Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Uncertain data mining; Dempster-Shafer theory; Evidence theory; clustering; EM algorithm; mixture models	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUZZY DATA; EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; DISSIMILARITY DATA; DECISION TREES; CREDAL EM; MODELS; PROBABILITY; INTERVAL	We consider the problem of parameter estimation in statistical models in the case where data are uncertain and represented as belief functions. The proposed method is based on the maximization of a generalized likelihood criterion, which can be interpreted as a degree of agreement between the statistical model and the uncertain observations. We propose a variant of the EM algorithm that iteratively maximizes this criterion. As an illustration, the method is applied to uncertain data clustering using finite mixture models, in the cases of categorical and continuous attributes.

J	Wang, S; Yao, X				Wang, Shuo; Yao, Xin			Relationships between Diversity of Classification Ensembles and Single-Class Performance Measures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Class imbalance learning; ensemble learning; diversity; single-class performance measures; data mining	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; IMBALANCED DATA; ACCURACY; STATISTICS; SELECTION	In class imbalance learning problems, how to better recognize examples from the minority class is the key focus, since it is usually more important and expensive than the majority class. Quite a few ensemble solutions have been proposed in the literature with varying degrees of success. It is generally believed that diversity in an ensemble could help to improve the performance of class imbalance learning. However, no study has actually investigated diversity in depth in terms of its definitions and effects in the context of class imbalance learning. It is unclear whether diversity will have a similar or different impact on the performance of minority and majority classes. In this paper, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of if and when ensemble diversity has a positive impact on the classification of imbalanced data sets. First, we explain when and why diversity measured by Q-statistic can bring improved overall accuracy based on two classification patterns proposed by Kuncheva et al. We define and give insights into good and bad patterns in imbalanced scenarios. Then, the pattern analysis is extended to single-class performance measures, including recall, precision, and F-measure, which are widely used in class imbalance learning. Six different situations of diversity's impact on these measures are obtained through theoretical analysis. Finally, to further understand how diversity affects the single class performance and overall performance in class imbalance problems, we carry out extensive experimental studies on both artificial data sets and real-world benchmarks with highly skewed class distributions. We find strong correlations between diversity and discussed performance measures. Diversity shows a positive impact on the minority class in general. It is also beneficial to the overall performance in terms of AUC and G-mean.

J	Wang, SP; Zhu, QX; Zhu, W; Min, F				Wang, Shiping; Zhu, Qingxin; Zhu, William; Min, Fan			Matroidal structure of rough sets and its characterization to attribute reduction	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rough set; Matroid; 2-Circuit matroid; Information system; Attribute reduction; Rank function; Isomorphism	APPROXIMATION OPERATORS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DECISION SYSTEMS; FUZZY-SETS; SELECTION; SPACES	Rough sets are efficient for data pre-processing in data mining. However, some important problems such as attribute reduction in rough sets are NP-hard, and the algorithms to solve them are almost greedy ones. As a generalization of the linear independence in vector spaces, matroids provide well-established platforms for greedy algorithms. In this paper, we apply matroids to rough sets through an isomorphism from equivalence relations to 2-circuit matroids. First, a matroid is induced by an equivalence relation. Several equivalent characterizations of the independent sets of the induced matroid are obtained through rough sets. Second, an equivalence relation is induced by a matroid. The relationship between the above two inductions is studied. Third, an isomorphism from equivalence relations to 2-circuit matroids is established, which lays a sound foundation for studying rough sets using matroidal approaches. Finally, attribute reduction is equivalently formulated with rank functions and closure operators of matroids.

However, twin support vector machines (TWSVM) do not provide such probabilities. In this paper, we propose a TWSVM probability model, called PTWSVM, to estimate the posterior probability. Note that our model is quite different from the SVM probability model because of the different mechanism of TWSVM and SVM. In fact, for TWSVM, we first define a new ranking continues output by comparing the distances between the sample and the two non-parallel hyperplanes, and then map this ranking continues output into probability by training the parameters of an additional sigmoid function. Our PTWSVM has been tested on both artificial datasets and several data-mining-style datasets, and the numerical experiments indicate that PTWSVM yields nice results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Rough set theory has been successfully applied in data mining. The lower and upper approximations are basic concepts in rough set theory. The effective computation of approximations is vital for improving the performance of data mining or other related tasks. The recently introduced MapReduce technique has gained a lot of attention from the scientific community for its applicability in massive data analysis. This paper proposes a parallel method for computing rough set approximations. Consequently, algorithms corresponding to the parallel method based on the MapReduce technique are put forward to deal with the massive data. An extensive experimental evaluation on different large data sets shows that the proposed parallel method is effective for data mining. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Vo, B; Hong, TP; Le, B				Bay Vo; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Bac Le			DBV-Miner: A Dynamic Bit-Vector approach for fast mining frequent closed itemsets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						BitTable; Data mining; Dynamic Bit-Vector; Frequent closed itemsets; Vertical data format	ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; MAINTENANCE; BITTABLEFI; DATABASES; PATTERNS; LATTICE; TREES	Frequent closed itemsets (FCI) play an important role in pruning redundant rules fast. Therefore, a lot of algorithms for mining FCI have been developed. Algorithms based on vertical data formats have some advantages in that they require scan databases once and compute the support of itemsets fast. Recent years, BitTable (Dong & Han, 2007) and IndexBitTable (Song, Yang, & Xu, 2008) approaches have been applied for mining frequent itemsets and results are significant. However, they always use a fixed size of Bit-Vector for each item (equal to number of transactions in a database). It leads to consume more memory for storage Bit-Vectors and the time for computing the intersection among Bit-Vectors. Besides, they only apply for mining frequent itemsets, algorithm for mining FCI based on BitTable is not proposed. This paper introduces a new method for mining FCI from transaction databases. Firstly, Dynamic Bit-Vector (DBV) approach will be presented and algorithms for fast computing the intersection between two DBVs are also proposed. Lookup table is used for fast computing the support (number of bits 1 in a DBV) of itemsets. Next, subsumption concept for memory and computing time saving will be discussed. Finally, an algorithm based on DBV and subsumption concept for mining frequent closed itemsets fast is proposed. We compare our method with CHARM, and recognize that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than CHARM in both the mining time and the memory usage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shang, FH; Jiao, LC; Wang, F				Shang, Fanhua; Jiao, L.

Among of its techniques, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has received considerable attention due to producing a parts-based representation of the data. Recent research has shown that not only the observed data are found to lie on a nonlinear low dimensional manifold, namely data manifold, but also the features lie on a manifold, namely feature manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called graph dual regularization non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF), which simultaneously considers the geometric structures of both the data manifold and the feature manifold. We also present a graph dual regularization non-negative matrix tri-factorization algorithm (DNMTF) as an extension of DNMF. Moreover, we develop two iterative updating optimization schemes for DNMF and DNMTF, respectively, and provide the convergence proofs of our two optimization schemes. Experimental results on UCI benchmark data sets, several image data sets and a radar HRRP data set demonstrate the effectiveness of both DNMF and DNMTF. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This ensures the anonymity of the users in the logs, a problem that has been already found in released logs from well known companies. This paper presents the anonymization of query logs using microaggregation. Our proposal ensures the k-anonymity of the users in the query log, while preserving its utility. We provide the evaluation of our proposal in real query logs, showing the privacy and utility achieved, as well as providing estimations for the use of such data in data mining processes based on clustering.

Most existing incremental methods based on the classical rough set model can only be used to deal with the categorical data. This paper presents a new dynamic method for incrementally updating approximations of a concept under neighborhood rough sets to deal with numerical data. A comparison of the proposed incremental method with a nonincremental method of dynamic maintenance of rough set approximations is conducted by an extensive experimental evaluation on different data sets from UCI. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively updates approximations of a concept in practice. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Improving integrative searching of systems chemical biology data using semantic annotation	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article							ONTOLOGY; WEB; TROGLITAZONE; UNIFICATION; TOOL	Background: Systems chemical biology and chemogenomics are considered critical, integrative disciplines in modern biomedical research, but require data mining of large, integrated, heterogeneous datasets from chemistry and biology. We previously developed an RDF-based resource called Chem2Bio2RDF that enabled querying of such data using the SPARQL query language. Whilst this work has proved useful in its own right as one of the first major resources in these disciplines, its utility could be greatly improved by the application of an ontology for annotation of the nodes and edges in the RDF graph, enabling a much richer range of semantic queries to be issued. Results: We developed a generalized chemogenomics and systems chemical biology OWL ontology called Chem2Bio2OWL that describes the semantics of chemical compounds, drugs, protein targets, pathways, genes, diseases and side-effects, and the relationships between them. The ontology also includes data provenance. We used it to annotate our Chem2Bio2RDF dataset, making it a rich semantic resource. Through a series of scientific case studies we demonstrate how this (i) simplifies the process of building SPARQL queries, (ii) enables useful new kinds of queries on the data and (iii) makes possible intelligent reasoning and semantic graph mining in chemogenomics and systems chemical biology.

J	Gandomi, AH; Alavi, AH				Gandomi, Amir Hossein; Alavi, Amir Hossein			A new multi-gene genetic programming approach to non-linear system modeling. Part II: geotechnical and earthquake engineering problems	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Geotechnical engineering; Multi-gene genetic programming; Formulation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION	Complexity of analysis of geotechnical behavior is due to multivariable dependencies of soil and rock responses. In order to cope with this complex behavior, traditional forms of engineering design solutions are reasonably simplified. Incorporating simplifying assumptions into the development of the traditional methods may lead to very large errors. This paper presents an endeavor to exploit a robust multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) method for the analysis of geotechnical and earthquake engineering systems. MGGP is a modified genetic programming approach for model structure selection combined with a classical technique for parameter estimation. To justify the abilities of MGGP, it is systematically employed to formulate the complex geotechnical engineering problems. Different classes of the problems analyzed include the assessment of (i) undrained lateral load capacity of piles, (ii) undrained side resistance alpha factor for drilled shafts, (iii) settlement around tunnels, and (iv) soil liquefaction. The validity of the derived models is tested for a part of test results beyond the training data domain. Numerical examples show the superb accuracy, efficiency, and great potential of MGGP. Contrary to artificial neural networks and many other soft computing tools, MGGP provides constitutive prediction equations. The MGG-based solutions are particularly valuable for pre-design practices.

This new type of complex and heterogeneous graph-structured data raises new challenges for the data mining community. In this paper, we present a novel method for mining association rules from semantic instance data repositories expressed in RDF/(S) and OWL. We take advantage of the schema-level (i.e. Tbox) knowledge encoded in the ontology to derive appropriate transactions which will later feed traditional association rules algorithms. This process is guided by the analyst requirements, expressed in the form of query patterns. Initial experiments performed on semantic data of a biomedical application show the usefulness and efficiency of the approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Finally, the comparative experiments were carried out to evaluate the new feature set and the seven modelling techniques for customer churn prediction. The experimental results show that the new features with the six modelling techniques are more effective than the existing ones for customer churn prediction in the telecommunication service field.

J	Olson, DL; Delen, D; Meng, YY				Olson, David L.; Delen, Dursun; Meng, Yanyan			Comparative analysis of data mining methods for bankruptcy prediction	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Data mining; Neural networks; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Transparency; Transportability	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION-SUPPORT; TECHNICAL ANALYSIS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; FINANCIAL RATIOS; FUZZY; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; SELECTION	A great deal of research has been devoted to prediction of bankruptcy, to include application of data mining. Neural networks, support vector machines, and other algorithms often fit data well, but because of lack of comprehensibility, they are considered black box technologies. Conversely, decision trees are more comprehensible by human users. However, sometimes far too many rules result in another form of incomprehensibility. The number of rules obtained from decision tree algorithms can be controlled to some degree through setting different minimum support levels. This study applies a variety of data mining tools to bankruptcy data, with the purpose of comparing accuracy and number of rules. For this data, decision trees were found to be relatively more accurate compared to neural networks and support vector machines, but there were more rule nodes than desired. Adjustment of minimum support yielded more tractable rule sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Aiming at traditional CBR system's too much dependence upon experts or engineers, this paper introduces data mining technology into CBR system and GHSOM (Growing Hierarchical Self Organizing Map), an excellent data mining tool with ANN (artificial neural network) technology, is integrated with it. After principal features are selected from numerous initial features to represent a case, through GHSOM cases are organized and managed in case base and while case retrieval is conducted, new case is guided into corresponding sub-case base, which greatly raises system's accuracy and efficiency. At last, experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by comparing the proposed methods with other recent researches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	He, HB; Chen, S; Li, K; Xu, X				He, Haibo; Chen, Sheng; Li, Kang; Xu, Xin			Incremental Learning from Stream Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Adaptive classification; concept shifting; data mining; incremental learning; machine learning; mapping function	NEURAL-NETWORK; MULTIDIMENSIONAL MAPS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; TRANSFORM; ARTMAP; ARRAY; POWER	Recent years have witnessed an incredibly increasing interest in the topic of incremental learning. Unlike conventional machine learning situations, data flow targeted by incremental learning becomes available continuously over time. Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to abandon the traditional assumption of the availability of representative training data during the training period to develop decision boundaries. Under scenarios of continuous data flow, the challenge is how to transform the vast amount of stream raw data into information and knowledge representation, and accumulate experience over time to support future decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a general adaptive incremental learning framework named ADAIN that is capable of learning from continuous raw data, accumulating experience over time, and using such knowledge to improve future learning and prediction performance. Detailed system level architecture and design strategies are presented in this paper. Simulation results over several real-world data sets are used to validate the effectiveness of this method.

The exposure of sensitive data can potentially lead to breach of individual privacy. Therefore, many privacy preserving techniques have been proposed recently. In this paper we present a framework that uses a few novel noise addition techniques for protecting individual privacy while maintaining a high data quality. We add noise to all attributes, both numerical and categorical. We present a novel technique for clustering categorical values and use it for noise addition purpose. A security analysis is also presented for measuring the security level of a data set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Olmo, JL; Romero, JR; Ventura, S				Luis Olmo, Juan; Raul Romero, Jose; Ventura, Sebastian			Using Ant Programming Guided by Grammar for Building Rule-Based Classifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); ant programming (AP); classification; data mining (DM); grammar-based automatic programming	COLONY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; DATA SETS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	The extraction of comprehensible knowledge is one of the major challenges in many domains. In this paper, an ant programming (AP) framework, which is capable of mining classification rules easily comprehensible by humans, and, therefore, capable of supporting expert-domain decisions, is presented. The algorithm proposed, called grammar based ant programming ( GBAP), is the first AP algorithm developed for the extraction of classification rules, and it is guided by a context-free grammar that ensures the creation of new valid individuals. To compute the transition probability of each available movement, this new model introduces the use of two complementary heuristic functions, instead of just one, as typical ant-based algorithms do. The selection of a consequent for each rule mined and the selection of the rules that make up the classifier are based on the use of a niching approach. The performance of GBAP is compared against other classification techniques on 18 varied data sets. Experimental results show that our approach produces comprehensible rules and competitive or better accuracy values than those achieved by the other classification algorithms compared with it.

J	Chuang, LY; Hsiao, CJ; Yang, CH				Chuang, Li-Yeh; Hsiao, Chih-Jen; Yang, Cheng-Hong			Chaotic particle swarm optimization for data clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data clustering; Chaotic map; Particle swarm optimization	ALGORITHMS; CONVERGENCE	Data clustering is a popular analysis tool for data statistics in several fields, including includes pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning, image analysis and bioinformatics, in which the information to be analyzed can be of any distribution in size and shape. Clustering is effective as a technique for discerning the structure of and unraveling the complex relationship between massive amounts of data. An improved technique which combines chaotic map particle swarm optimization with an acceleration strategy is proposed, since results of one of the most used clustering algorithm, K-means can be jeopardized by improper choices made in the initializing stage. Accelerated chaotic particle swarm optimization (ACPSO) searches through arbitrary data sets for appropriate cluster centers and can effectively and efficiently find better solutions. Comparisons of the clustering performance are obtained from tests conducted on six experimental data sets; the algorithms compared with ACPSO includes PSO, CPSO, K-PSO, NM-PSO, K-NM-PSO and K-means clustering.

J	Baralis, E; Bruno, G; Fiori, A				Baralis, Elena; Bruno, Giulia; Fiori, Alessandro			Measuring gene similarity by means of the classification distance	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Similarity measure; Microarray; Clustering; Data mining	MICROARRAY DATA; EXPRESSION DATA; CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; CANCER; PROSTATE; CELLS; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS; CRITERIA; TUMOR	Microarray technology provides a simple way for collecting huge amounts of data on the expression level of thousands of genes. Detecting similarities among genes is a fundamental task, both to discover previously unknown gene functions and to focus the analysis on a limited set of genes rather than on thousands of genes. Similarity between genes is usually evaluated by analyzing their expression values. However, when additional information is available (e.g., clinical information), it may be beneficial to exploit it. In this paper, we present a new similarity measure for genes, based on their classification power, i.e., on their capability to separate samples belonging to different classes. Our method exploits a new gene representation that measures the classification power of each gene and defines the classification distance as the distance between gene classification powers. The classification distance measure has been integrated in a hierarchical clustering algorithm, but it may be adopted also by other clustering algorithms. The result of experiments runs on different microarray datasets supports the intuition of the proposed approach.

Traditionally, the process involved in discovering the relay operation characteristics is bogged down by the issues of differing knowledge of protection experts, meticulous manual understanding of complex relay event report and the need to have supplementary data from diverse intelligent electronic devices. This paper investigates the implementation of a novel data mining approach of integrated-Rough-Set-and-Genetic-Algorithm based rule discovery and Rule Quality Measure to hypothesize expected relay behavior in the form of an association rule from digital protective relay's resident event report. Firstly, the data mining approach of the integrated-Rough-Set-and-Genetic-Algorithm is used to discover the relay CD-decision algorithm. Subsequently, the Rule Quality Measure, combined with rule interestingness and importance judgment, deduces the relay CD-decision algorithm to the desired relay CD-association rule. The relay CD-association rule in its singularity form essentially describes the logical pattern of the correlating descriptions of conditions (i.e., attribute set C for various multifunctional protection elements) and the decision class (i.e., attribute D for trip assertion status). Using the area under the ROC curve measurements, the CD-decision algorithm has been verified to be able to predict as well as discriminate future unknown-trip-state relay events in unsupervised learning. This evaluation is necessary to allow the eventual deduction of the single relay CD-association rule to take place. The discovered CD-association rule, and thus the desired hypothesis, has been proven to be an exact manifestation of the relay operation characteristics hidden in the event report.

J	Zhu, XQ; Ding, W; Yu, PS; Zhang, CQ				Zhu, Xingquan; Ding, Wei; Yu, Philip S.; Zhang, Chengqi			One-class learning and concept summarization for data streams	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Stream data mining; One-class learning; Classification; Clustering	CLASSIFICATION; EXAMPLES; SVMS	In this paper, we formulate a new research problem of concept learning and summarization for one-class data streams. The main objectives are to (1) allow users to label instance groups, instead of single instances, as positive samples for learning, and (2) summarize concepts labeled by users over the whole stream. The employment of the batch-labeling raises serious issues for stream-oriented concept learning and summarization, because a labeled instance group may contain non-positive samples and users may change their labeling interests at any time. As a result, so the positive samples labeled by users, over the whole stream, may be inconsistent and contain multiple concepts. To resolve these issues, we propose a one-class learning and summarization (OCLS) framework with two major components. In the first component, we propose a vague one-class learning (VOCL) module for concept learning from data streams using an ensemble of classifiers with instance level and classifier level weighting strategies. In the second component, we propose a one-class concept summarization (OCCS) module that uses clustering techniques and a Markov model to summarize concepts labeled by users, with only one scanning of the stream data. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that the proposed VOCL module outperforms its peers for learning concepts from vaguely labeled stream data. The OCCS module is also able to rebuild a high-level summary for concepts marked by users over the stream.

Previous studies largely adopt the approach that, as the subjects for response model predictions, the entire customer population or filtered through certain attribute values is based on recommendations made from sales professionals. However, such methods may reduce response rates due to an oversized potential customer population, thus diminishing the accuracy of the prediction model. In resolve this problem, this work presents proposes a novel forecasting method that integrates the union sequential pattern with classification algorithms to facilitate the construction of customer response models. Based on use of a union sequential pattern, the potential customer size is established by identifying attributes with a high level of association. The prediction model is then constructed using classification algorithms such as support vector machines and logistic regression. Consequently, the problem involving the setting of range for potential customers can be solved, as well as the time spent on processing extended lists of customers during prediction. Finally, predicted potential Internet-phone customers and churning mobile-phone customers of a telecommunication company in Taiwan as are taken as an illustrative example, based on the proposed prediction model. The proposed method more accurately predicts potential customers than those of previous studies. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mining Cluster-Based Temporal Mobile Sequential Patterns in Location-Based Service Environments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; transportation; mining methods and algorithms; mobile environments	PREDICTION; COMMERCE	Researches on Location-Based Service (LBS) have been emerging in recent years due to a wide range of potential applications. One of the active topics is the mining and prediction of mobile movements and associated transactions. Most of existing studies focus on discovering mobile patterns from the whole logs. However, this kind of patterns may not be precise enough for predictions since the differentiated mobile behaviors among users and temporal periods are not considered. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely, Cluster-based Temporal Mobile Sequential Pattern Mine (CTMSP-Mine), to discover the Cluster-based Temporal Mobile Sequential Patterns (CTMSPs). Moreover, a prediction strategy is proposed to predict the subsequent mobile behaviors. In CTMSP-Mine, user clusters are constructed by a novel algorithm named Cluster-Object-based Smart Cluster Affinity Search Technique (CO-Smart-CAST) and similarities between users are evaluated by the proposed measure, Location-Based Service Alignment (LBS-Alignment). Meanwhile, a time segmentation approach is presented to find segmenting time intervals where similar mobile characteristics exist. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on mining and prediction of mobile behaviors with considerations of user relations and temporal property simultaneously. Through experimental evaluation under various simulated conditions, the proposed methods are shown to deliver excellent performance.

J	Xu, Y; Li, YF; Shaw, G				Xu, Yue; Li, Yuefeng; Shaw, Gavin			Reliable representations for association rules	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Association rule mining; Redundant association rules; Closed itemsets; Data mining agents	CONDENSED REPRESENTATION; FREQUENT PATTERNS; DATABASES	Association rule mining has contributed to many advances in the area of knowledge discovery. However, the quality of the discovered association rules is a big concern and has drawn more and more attention recently. One problem with the quality of the discovered association rules is the huge size of the extracted rule set. Often for a dataset, a huge number of rules can be extracted, but many of them can be redundant to other rules and thus useless in practice. Mining non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solve this problem. In this paper, we first propose a definition for redundancy, then propose a concise representation, called a Reliable basis, for representing non-redundant association rules. The Reliable basis contains a set of non-redundant rules which are derived using frequent closed itemsets and their generators instead of using frequent itemsets that are usually used by traditional association rule mining approaches. An important contribution of this paper is that we propose to use the certainty factor as the criterion to measure the strength of the discovered association rules. Using this criterion, we can ensure the elimination of as many redundant rules as possible without reducing the inference capacity of the remaining extracted non-redundant rules. We prove that the redundancy elimination, based on the proposed Reliable basis, does not reduce the strength of belief in the extracted rules. We also prove that all association rules, their supports and confidences, can be retrieved from the Reliable basis without accessing the dataset Therefore the Reliable basis is a lossless representation of association rules. Experimental results show that the proposed Reliable basis can significantly reduce the number of extracted rules. We also conduct experiments on the application of association rules to the area of product recommendation. The experimental results show that the non-redundant association rules extracted using the proposed method retain the same inference capacity as the entire rule set. This result indicates that using non-redundant rules only is sufficient to solve real problems needless using the entire rule set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, K; Yu, X				Zhao, Kai; Yu, Xin			A case based reasoning approach on supplier selection in petroleum enterprises	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Case based reasoning system; Information entropy; k-Prototype clustering; Back propagation neural networks	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; VENDOR SELECTION; ALGORITHM; DESIGN; COST	Petroleum is an important strategic material which is connected with the vitals and safety of the national economy, and the supplier selections are related to the safety of petroleum production and supply. However, the traditional approaches for supplier selections are limited in subjective evaluation of weights, inaccurate assessing rules, and inefficient decision-making. Although most of the current methods are widely applied in corporation management, a more efficient approach needs to be proposed for supplier selection of oil enterprise. This paper summarizes the particular characteristics of the supply chain of Chinese petroleum enterprises, analyzes the limitations of the traditional methods of supplier selection, and brought forward the method based on case reasoning system (CBR) for petroleum enterprises. The method based on data mining techniques which solves three key problems of CBR, includes calculating the weights of the attributes with information entropy in case warehouse organizing process objectively, evaluating the similarities with k-prototype clustering between the original and target cases in case retrieving process exactly, and extracting the potential rules with back propagation neural networks from conclusions in maintenance and revising process efficiently. It demonstrates the advantages, practicability and validity of this method via case study finally. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahn, H; Ahn, JJ; Oh, KJ; Kim, DH				Ahn, Hyunchul; Ahn, Jae Joon; Oh, Kyong Joo; Kim, Dong Ha			Facilitating cross-selling in a mobile telecom market to develop customer classification model based on hybrid data mining techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customer classification; Genetic algorithms; Logistic regression; Artificial neural network; Decision tree; Mobile telecom market	NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; REASONING SYSTEMS; PREDICTION	As the competition between mobile telecom operators becomes severe, it becomes critical for operators to diversify their business areas. Especially, the mobile operators are turning from traditional voice communication to mobile value-added services (VAS), which are new services to generate more average revenue per user (ARPU). That is, cross-selling is critical for mobile telecom operators to expand their revenues and profits. In this study, we propose a customer classification model, which may be used for facilitating cross-selling in a mobile telecom market. Our model uses the cumulated data on the existing customers including their demographic data and the patterns for using old products or services to find new products and services with high sales potential. The various data mining techniques are applied to our proposed model in two steps. In the first step, several classification techniques such as logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and decision trees are applied independently to predict the purchase of new products, and each model produces the results of their prediction as a form of probabilities. In the second step, our model compromises all these probabilities by using genetic algorithm (GA), and makes the final decision for a target customer whether he or she would purchase a new product. To validate the usefulness of our model, we applied it to a real-world mobile telecom company's case in Korea. As a result, we found that our model produced high-quality information for cross-selling, and that GA in the second step contributed to significantly improve the performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, HL; Guo, CH				Li, Hailin; Guo, Chonghui			Piecewise cloud approximation for time series mining	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Piecewise cloud approximation; Time series mining; Dimensionality reduction; Cloud model; Time series representation	LINEAR APPROXIMATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODELS	Many researchers focus on dimensionality reduction techniques for the efficient data mining in large time series database. Meanwhile, corresponding distance measures are provided for describing the relationships between two different time series in reduced space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which we call piecewise cloud approximation (PWCA) to reduce the dimensionality of time series. This representation not only allows dimensionality reduction but also gives a new way to measure the similarity between time series well. Cloud, a qualitative and quantitative transformation model, is used to describe the features of subsequences of time series. Furthermore, a new way to measure the similarity between two cloud models is defined by an overlapping area of their own expectation curves. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed representation and similarity measure used in time series mining tasks, including clustering, classification and similarity search. The results of experiments indicate that PWCA is an effective representation for time series mining. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gisbrecht, A; Mokbel, B; Hammer, B				Gisbrecht, Andrej; Mokbel, Bassam; Hammer, Barbara			Relational generative topographic mapping	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Topographic mapping; Dissimilarity data; Relational data mining	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; PROXIMITY DATA; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; NETWORKS	The generative topographic mapping (GTM) has been proposed as a statistical model to represent high-dimensional data by a distribution induced by a sparse lattice of points in a low-dimensional latent space, such that visualization, compression, and data inspection become possible. The formulation in terms of a generative statistical model has the benefit that relevant parameters of the model can be determined automatically based on an expectation maximization scheme. Further, the model offers a large flexibility such as a direct out-of-sample extension and the possibility to obtain different degrees of granularity of the visualization without the need of additional training. Original GTM is restricted to Euclidean data points in a given Euclidean vector space. Often, data are not explicitly embedded in a Euclidean vector space, rather pairwise dissimilarities of data can be computed, i.e. the relations between data points are given rather than the data vectors themselves. We propose a method which extends the GTM to relational data and which allows us to achieve a sparse representation of data characterized by pairwise dissimilarities, in latent space. The method, relational GTM, is demonstrated on several benchmarks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interestingness measures for association rules based on statistical validity	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Structured data; Interesting rules; Statistical analysis; Redundant rules; Interestingness measure	CLASSIFICATION	Assessing rules with interestingness measures is the pillar of successful application of association rules discovery. However, association rules discovered are normally large in number, some of which are not considered as interesting or significant for the application at hand. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to ascertain the discovered rules, and provide a precise statistical approach supporting this framework. The proposed strategy combines data mining and statistical measurement techniques, including redundancy analysis, sampling and multivariate statistical analysis, to discard the non- significant rules. Moreover, we consider real world datasets which are characterized by the uniform and non-uniform data/items distribution with a mixture of measurement levels throughout the data/items. The proposed unified framework is applied on these datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in discarding many of the redundant or non-significant rules, while still preserving the high accuracy of the rule set as a whole.

J	Varewyck, M; Martens, JP				Varewyck, Matthias; Martens, Jean-Pierre			A Practical Approach to Model Selection for Support Vector Machines With a Gaussian Kernel	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Data mining; model selection; pattern classification; support vector machine (SVM)	INITIALIZATION; RECOGNITION	When learning a support vector machine (SVM) from a set of labeled development patterns, the ultimate goal is to get a classifier attaining a low error rate on new patterns. This so-called generalization ability obviously depends on the choices of the learning parameters that control the learning process. Model selection is the method for identifying appropriate values for these parameters. In this paper, a novel model selection method for SVMs with a Gaussian kernel is proposed. Its aim is to find suitable values for the kernel parameter. and the cost parameter C with a minimum amount of central processing unit time. The determination of the kernel parameter is based on the argument that, for most patterns, the decision function of the SVM should consist of a sufficiently large number of significant contributions. A unique property of the proposed method is that it retrieves the kernel parameter as a simple analytical function of the dimensionality of the feature space and the dispersion of the classes in that space. An experimental evaluation on a test bed of 17 classification problems has shown that the new method favorably competes with two recently published methods: the classification of new patterns is equally good, but the computational effort to identify the learning parameters is substantially lower.

Robust Inference of Principal Road Paths for Intelligent Transportation Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; digital road maps; Global Positioning System (GPS); machine learning; road safety	HIGH-RESOLUTION; AERIAL IMAGES; GPS TRACES; EXTRACTION; CURVES	Over the last few years, electronic vehicle guidance systems have become increasingly more popular. However, despite their ubiquity, performance will always be subject to availability of detailed digital road maps. Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications in unstructured environments. Lack of up-to-date information and insufficient refinement of the road geometry are among the most important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, combined with the rapidly increasing availability of wireless communication infrastructure, suggests that large amounts of data combining both modalities will be available in the near future. The approach presented here draws on machine-learning techniques and processes logs of position traces to consistently build a detailed and fine-grained representation of the road network by extracting the principal paths followed by the vehicles. Although this work addresses the road-building problem in dynamic environments such as open-pit mines, it is also applicable to urban environments. New contributions include a fully unsupervised segmentation method for sampling roads and inferring the network topology, which is a general technique for extracting detailed information about road splits, merges, and intersections, as well as a robust algorithm that articulates these two. Experimental results with data from large mining operations are presented to validate the new algorithm.

J	Kotsiantis, S				Kotsiantis, Sotiris			Combining bagging, boosting, rotation forest and random subspace methods	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Data mining; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Ensembles of classifiers	ENSEMBLES; CLASSIFIERS; RANDOMIZATION; COMBINATION; ALGORITHMS	Bagging, boosting, rotation forest and random subspace methods are well known re-sampling ensemble methods that generate and combine a diversity of learners using the same learning algorithm for the base-classifiers. Boosting and rotation forest algorithms are considered stronger than bagging and random subspace methods on noise-free data. However, there are strong empirical indications that bagging and random subspace methods are much more robust than boosting and rotation forest in noisy settings. For this reason, in this work we built an ensemble of bagging, boosting, rotation forest and random subspace methods ensembles with 6 sub-classifiers in each one and then a voting methodology is used for the final prediction. We performed a comparison with simple bagging, boosting, rotation forest and random subspace methods ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers, as well as other well known combining methods, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique had better accuracy in most cases.

Efficiency issues of evolutionary k-means	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						k-means; Evolutionary clustering; Data mining	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MEANS ALGORITHM; CLUSTER VALIDITY; CLASSIFICATION	One of the top ten most influential data mining algorithms, k-means, is known for being simple and scalable. However, it is sensitive to initialization of prototypes and requires that the number of clusters be specified in advance. This paper shows that evolutionary techniques conceived to guide the application of k-means can be more computationally efficient than systematic (i.e., repetitive) approaches that try to get around the above-mentioned drawbacks by repeatedly running the algorithm from different configurations for the number of clusters and initial positions of prototypes. To do so, a modified version of a (k-means based) fast evolutionary algorithm for clustering is employed. Theoretical complexity analyses for the systematic and evolutionary algorithms under interest are provided. Computational experiments and statistical analyses of the results are presented for artificial and text mining data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Naldi, M. C.; Campello, R. J. G.

J	Czarnowski, I; Jedrzejowicz, P				Czarnowski, Ireneusz; Jedrzejowicz, Piotr			An agent-based framework for distributed learning	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Distributed data mining; Distributed learning; Multi-agent system; Data reduction	PREDICTION; REDUCTION; DATABASES; SELECTION	In this paper an agent-based distributed learning framework based on data reduction is proposed. Data reduction aims at finding patterns or regularities within certain features, allowing to induce the so-called prototypes which should be retained for further use during the learning process. The considered approach assumes that data reduction through instance and feature selection is carried out independently at each site by a team of agents. To assure obtaining homogenous prototypes the feature selection requires coordination. The proposed approach provides such coordination by collaboration of agents. In the process of data reduction heterogeneous prototypes can be subsequently merged to create a compact representation of the distributed data repositories and, next, based on such a compact representation a selected meta-learning technique can be applied for generating the global classifier. The paper proposes and explains strategies for agent collaboration producing a common set of features and strategies for constructing combiner classifier. Suggested strategies are evaluated experimentally and compared. The paper includes a detailed description of the proposed approaches and a discussion of the computational experiment results.

The eXiT*CBR framework is proposed to support the development of and experimentation with new case-based reasoning (CBR) systems for medical diagnosis. Method: Our framework offers a modular, heterogeneous environment that combines different CBR techniques for different application requirements. The graphical user interface allows easy navigation through a set of experiments that are pre-visualized as plots (receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and accuracy curves). This user-friendly navigation allows easy analysis and replication of experiments. Used as a plug-in on the same interface, eXiT*CBR can work with any data mining technique such as determining feature relevance. Results: The results show that eXiT*CBR is a user-friendly tool that facilitates medical users to utilize CBR methods to determine diagnoses in the field of breast cancer, dealing with different patterns implicit in the data. Conclusions: Although several tools have been developed to facilitate the rapid construction of prototypes, none of them has taken into account the particularities of medical applications as an appropriate interface to medical users. eXiT*CBR aims to fill this gap. It uses CBR methods and common medical visualization tools, such as ROC plots, that facilitate the interpretation of the results. The navigation capabilities of this tool allow the tuning of different CBR parameters using experimental results. In addition, the tool allows experiment reproducibility. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Combining spatial transition probabilities for stochastic simulation of categorical fields	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						categorical data; indicator kriging; conditional independence; Tau model	ORDER MARKOV-CHAINS; INDICATOR GEOSTATISTICS; MODEL; VARIABLES	Categorical spatial data, such as land use classes and socioeconomic statistics data, are important data sources in geographical information science (GIS). The investigation of spatial patterns implied in these data can benefit many aspects of GIS research, such as classification of spatial data, spatial data mining, and spatial uncertainty modeling. However, the discrete nature of categorical data limits the application of traditional kriging methods widely used in Gaussian random fields. In this article, we present a new probabilistic method for modeling the posterior probability of class occurrence at any target location in space-given known class labels at source data locations within a neighborhood around that prediction location. In the proposed method, transition probabilities rather than indicator covariances or variograms are used as measures of spatial structure and the conditional or posterior (multi-point) probability is approximated by a weighted combination of preposterior (two-point) transition probabilities, while accounting for spatial interdependencies often ignored by existing approaches. In addition, the connections of the proposed method with probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian networks) and weights of evidence method are also discussed. The advantages of this new proposed approach are analyzed and highlighted through a case study involving the generation of spatial patterns via sequential indicator simulation.

We show that "white-box" algorithms constructed with reusable components design can have significant benefits for researchers, and end users as well. We developed a component-based algorithm design platform, and used it for "white-box" algorithm construction. The proposed platform can also be used for testing algorithm parts ( reusable components), and their single or joint influence on algorithm performance. The platform is easily extensible with new components and algorithms, and allows testing of partial contributions of an introduced component. We propose two new heuristics in decision tree algorithm design, namely removal of insignificant attributes in induction process at each tree node, and usage of combined strategy for generating possible splits for decision trees, utilizing severalways of splitting together, which experimentally showed benefits. Using the proposed platform we tested 80 component-based decision tree algorithms on 15 benchmark datasets and present the results of reusable components' influence on performance, and statistical significance of the differences found. Our study suggests that for a specific dataset we should search for the optimal component interplay instead of looking for the optimal among predefined algorithms.

The RNA Ontology (RNAO): An ontology for integrating RNA sequence and structure data	APPLIED ONTOLOGY			English	Article						Ontology of molecules; RNA ontology; covalent bonding relation; non-covalent bonding relation; base pairing relation; base stacking relation; RNA motif; RNA sequence alignment	BASE-PAIRS; ISOSTERICITY MATRICES; ALIGNMENT ONTOLOGY; NUCLEIC-ACID; INFORMATION; UNIFICATION; TOOL; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; ANNOTATIONS	Biomedical Ontologies integrate diverse biomedical data and enable intelligent data-mining and help translate basic research into useful clinical knowledge. We present the RNA Ontology (RNAO), an ontology for integrating diverse RNA data, including RNA sequences and sequence alignments, three-dimensional structures, and biochemical and functional data. For example, individual atomic resolution RNA structures have broader significance as representatives of classes of homologous molecules, which can differ significantly in sequence while sharing core structural features and common roles or functions. Thus, structural data gain value by being linked to homologous sequences in genomic data and databases of sequence alignments. Likewise, the value of genomic data is enhanced by annotation of shared structural features, especially when these can be linked to specific functions. Moreover, the significance of biochemical, functional and mutational analyses of RNA molecules are most fully understood when linked to molecular structures and phylogenies. To achieve these goals, RNAO provides logically rigorous definitions of the components of RNA primary, secondary and tertiary structure and the relations between these entities. RNAO is being developed to comply with the developing standards of the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Consortium. The RNAO can be accessed at http://code.google.com/p/rnao/.

Detection of financial statement fraud and feature selection using data mining techniques	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Financial fraud detection; Feature selection; t-statistic; Neural networks; SVM; GP	RATIOS	Recently, high profile cases of financial statement fraud have been dominating the news. This paper uses data mining techniques such as Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MLFF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GP), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Logistic Regression (LR), and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to identify companies that resort to financial statement fraud. Each of these techniques is tested on a dataset involving 202 Chinese companies and compared with and without feature selection. PNN outperformed all the techniques without feature selection, and GP and PNN outperformed others with feature selection and with marginally equal accuracies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sim, K; Liu, GM; Gopalkrishnan, V; Li, JY				Sim, Kelvin; Liu, Guimei; Gopalkrishnan, Vivekanand; Li, Jinyan			A case study on financial ratios via cross-graph quasi-bicliques	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Financial data mining; Financial ratios analysis; Quasi-bicliques; 3D subspace clustering	ALGORITHMS; MARKET	Stocks with similar financial ratio values across years have similar price movements. We investigate this hypothesis by clustering groups of stocks that exhibit homogeneous financial ratio values across years, and then study their price movements. We propose using cross-graph quasi-biclique (CGQB) subgraphs to cluster stocks, as they can define the three dimensional (3D) subspaces of financial ratios that the stocks are homogeneous in across the years, and they can also handle missing values that are rampant in the stock data. Furthermore, investors can easily analyze these 3D subspaces to explore the relations between the stocks and financial ratios. We develop a novel algorithm, CGQBminer, which mines the complete set of CGQB subgraphs from the stock data. Through experimental analysis, we show that the hypothesis is valid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that having an investment strategy which uses groups of stocks mined by CGQB subgraphs have higher returns than one that does not. We also conducted an extensive performance analysis on CGQBminer, and show that it is efficient across different 3D datasets and parameter settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Takacs, B; Demiris, Y				Takacs, Balint; Demiris, Yiannis			Spectral clustering in multi-agent systems	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spectral clustering; Spatio-temporal data mining; Multi-agent systems; Plan extraction; Plan recognition		We examine the application of spectral clustering for breaking up the behavior of a multi-agent system in space and time into smaller, independent elements. We propose clustering observations of individual entities in order to identify significant changes in the parameter space (like spatial position) and detect temporal alterations of behavior within the same framework. Available knowledge of important interactions (events) between entities is also considered. We describe a novel algorithm utilizing iterative subdivisions where clusters are pre-processed at each step to counter spatial scaling, rotation, replay speed, and varying sampling frequency. A method is presented to balance spatial and temporal segmentation based on the expected group size, and a validity measure is introduced to determine the optimal number of clusters. We demonstrate our results by analyzing the outcomes of computer games and compare our algorithm to K-means and traditional spectral clustering.

In this study. a PSO-based improved Wang-Mendel (WM) method is proposed, which is a new combined modelling method based on fuzzy system and evolutionary algorithm. This method adopts a modified Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the fuzzy rule centroid of data covered area and thus obtains complete fuzzy rule set through extrapolating. The electric load-forecasting model based on this proposed method is described, and a case study on short-term load forecast illustrates that this method effectively enhances the forecast accuracy of WM method, has a fast convergence rate, and is independent of the forecasting objects.

Using that class of neural networks is still unexplored to date. We examined four of the most popular networks of the class-fuzzy, distributed, instance counting, and default ARTMAP. In order to illustrate their performance and to compare with other techniques, we used data, financial ratios, and experimental conditions identical to those published in previous studies. Our experiments show that two financial ratios provide highest discriminatory power of the model and ensure best prediction accuracy. We examined performance and validated results by exhaustive search of input variables, cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under curve metric. We also did application-specific cost analysis. Our results show that distributed ARTMAP outperforms the other three models in general, but the fuzzy model is best performer for certain vigilance values and in the application-specific context. We also found that ARTMAP outperforms the most popular neural networks - multi-layer perceptrons and other statistical techniques applied to the same data.

Srinivas; Kumar, Sunill; Bailey, Barbara A.; Garg, Rajni			Computational Analysis of HIV-1 Protease Protein Binding Pockets	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; CATION-PI INTERACTIONS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; QSAR; REGRESSION	Mutations that arise in HIV-1 protease after exposure to various HIV-1 protease inhibitors have proved to be a difficult aspect in the treatment of HIV. Mutations in the binding pocket of the protease can prevent the protease inhibitor from binding to the protein effectively. In the present study, the crystal structures of 68 HIV-1 proteases complexed with one of the nine FDA approved protease inhibitors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were analyzed by (a) identifying the mutational changes with the aid of a developed mutation map and (b) correlating the structure of the binding pockets with the complexed inhibitors. The mutations of each crystal structure were identified by comparing the amino acid sequence of each structure against the HIV-1 wild-type strain HXB2. These mutations were visually presented in the form of a mutation map to analyze mutation patterns corresponding to each protease inhibitor. The crystal structure mutation patterns of each inhibitor (in vitro) were compared against the mutation patterns observed in in vivo data. The in vitro mutation patterns were found to be representative of most of the major in vivo mutations. We then performed a data mining analysis of the binding pockets from each crystal structure in terms of their chemical descriptors to identify important structural features of the HIV-1 protease protein with respect to the binding conformation of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Data mining analysis is performed using several classification techniques: Random Forest (RF), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR). We developed two hybrid models, RF-LDA and RF-LR. Random Forest is used as a feature selection proxy, reducing the descriptor space to a few of the most relevant descriptors determined by the classifier. These descriptors are then used to develop the subsequent LDA, LR, and hierarchical classification models. Clustering analysis of the binding pockets using the selected descriptors used to produce the optimal classification models reveals conformational similarities of the ligands in each cluster. This study provides important information in understanding the structural features of HIV-1 protease which cannot be studied by other existing in vivo genomic data sets.

Military applications such as Blue Force Tracking, inter-team communications, remote unmanned vehicle control, and sensor data mining/fusion thus have to deal with unstable links with limited bandwidth and variable latency. The peculiar characteristics of tactical networks call for peer-to-peer approaches to realize complex, adaptive, and fault-tolerant applications to be deployed in the battlefield. This article reports on our observations from several tactical networking experiments in which we have deployed state-of-the-art applications and services that leverage P2P communications. More specifically, we discuss why P2P approaches are critical for tactical network environments and applications. We then analyze the requirements that should be satisfied by P2P middleware for tactical environments. Finally, we discuss a case study, the Agile Computing Middleware, and present experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.

To bridge the gap, this research takes previous popular visiting behaviours as the suggestion foundation and develops a sequential pattern based route suggestion system to generate personalized tours. First, to increase suggestion feasibility, exhibits are grouped into a set, of exhibit sections.

In this paper, we propose a new importance estimation method using a mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers. The proposed method is more flexible than existing approaches, and is expected to work well when the target importance function is correlated and rank-deficient. Through experiments, we illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.

Like other data mining and machine learning tasks, multilabel learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction has been studied for many years, however, multilabel dimensionality reduction remains almost untouched. In this article, we propose amultilabel dimensionality reduction method, MDDM, with two kinds of projection strategies, attempting to project the original data into a lower-dimensional feature space maximizing the dependence between the original feature description and the associated class labels. Based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, we derive a eigen-decomposition problem which enables the dimensionality reduction process to be efficient. Experiments validate the performance of MDDM.

Mining such uncertain graph data is semantically different from and computationally more challenging than mining conventional exact graph data. This paper investigates the problem of mining uncertain graph data and especially focuses on mining frequent subgraph patterns on an uncertain graph database. A novel model of uncertain graphs is presented, and the frequent subgraph pattern mining problem is formalized by introducing a new measure, called expected support. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. An approximate mining algorithm is proposed to find a set of approximately frequent subgraph patterns by allowing an error tolerance on expected supports of discovered subgraph patterns. The algorithm uses efficient methods to determine whether a subgraph pattern can be output or not and a new pruning method to reduce the complexity of examining subgraph patterns. Analytical and experimental results show that the algorithm is very efficient, accurate, and scalable for large uncertain graph databases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to investigate the problem of mining frequent subgraph patterns from uncertain graph data.

A key issue is extracting and making use of significant features hidden behind the chronological and structural dependencies found in these sequences. Almost all existing algorithms designed to perform this task are based on the matching of patterns in chronological order, but such sequences often have similar structural features in chronologically different order. In this paper we propose SCS, a novel, effective and domain-independent method for measuring the similarity between categorical sequences, based on an original pattern matching scheme that makes it possible to capture chronological and non-chronological dependencies. SCS captures significant patterns that represent the natural structure of sequences, and reduces the influence of those which are merely noise. It constitutes an effective approach to measuring the similarity between data in the form of categorical sequences, such as biological sequences, natural language texts, speech recognition data, certain types of network transactions, and retail transactions. To show its effectiveness, we have tested SCS extensively on a range of data sets from different application fields, and compared the results with those obtained by various mainstream algorithms. The results obtained show that SCS produces results that are often competitive with domain-specific similarity approaches.

J	Zhang, Y; Wu, XD				Zhang, Yan; Wu, Xindong			Integrating induction and deduction for noisy data mining	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Noise handling; Induction; Deduction; Error correction	MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; RULES	Data mining research has been drawing a lot of interest and attention from various fields since late 1980s. The rapid progress has been achieved from three aspects: the prosperity of data mining conferences, the significant number of data mining algorithms, and widely applied areas of data mining techniques. With the continuing growth of the data volumes in many domains, the need of employing data mining techniques provides not only new opportunities but also immense challenges. In this article, we present our study on a challenging topic - integrating induction and deduction for noisy data mining. In particular, we assume the mechanism that corrupts the input data is a set of structured knowledge in the form of Associative Corruption (AC) rules. We apply deductive reasoning to generate the noise corruption rules: make error corrections on the input data with the help of these rules; and perform inductive learning from the corrected input data. Our experimental results show that the proposed integration framework is effective. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intelligible Support Vector Machines for Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining; diabetes; machine learning; medical diagnosis	IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; FEATURE-SELECTION; RULE EXTRACTION; MIDDLE-EAST; RISK SCORE; CLASSIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; PREVALENCE	Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease and a major public health challenge worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 246 million diabetic people worldwide, and this number is expected to rise to 380 million by 2025. Furthermore, 3.8 million deaths are attributable to diabetes complications each year. It has been shown that 80% of type 2 diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed by early identification of people at risk. In this context, several data mining and machine learning methods have been used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. In this paper, we propose utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the diagnosis of diabetes. In particular, we use an additional explanation module, which turns the "black box" model of an SVM into an intelligible representation of the SVM's diagnostic (classification) decision. Results on a real-life diabetes dataset show that intelligible SVMs provide a promising tool for the prediction of diabetes, where a comprehensible ruleset have been generated, with prediction accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 94%. Furthermore, the extracted rules are medically sound and agree with the outcome of relevant medical studies.

J	Becker, K; Vanzin, M				Becker, Karin; Vanzin, Mariangela			O3R: Ontology-based mechanism for a human-centered environment targeted at the analysis of navigation patterns	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Web usage mining; Pattern analysis; Ontology; User-centered environment	SYSTEMS	Web Usage Mining (WUM) is the application of data mining techniques over Web server logs in order to extract navigation usage patterns. The analysis of mining patterns for assessing the knowledge they reveal is a critical phase in WUM. The main challenges are: (a) mining algorithms yield a huge number of patterns and (b) there is a significant semantic gap between URLs and events performed by users. In this paper, we describe the pattern analysis mechanisms integrated in O3R (Ontology-based Rules Retrieval and Rummaging), a human-centered environment for the analysis of navigation rules. O3R explores the synergy of mechanisms for retrieving and analyzing patterns. Filtering and clustering allow users to retrieve subsets of patterns with specific characteristics, in order to deal with the large volume of patterns. Rummaging mechanisms are targeted at assessing the meaning and relevance of pattern with regard to the domain, and it is particularly suitable for exploratory analysis. The distinctive feature of O3R is that is dynamically associates meaning to patterns using the concepts and relationships of a domain ontology, as a means of reducing the gap between syntactic URLs and semantic events performed by users. The paper describes the mechanisms in detail, and explores their synergic integration in the O3R prototype. It also reports two case studies that evaluate the use of O3R for the analysis of navigation patterns of a learning site. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hwang, JH; Ryu, KH				Hwang, Jeong Hee; Ryu, Keun Ho			A weighted common structure based clustering technique for XML documents	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Data mining; XML mining; Document clustering; XML clustering		XML has recently become very popular as a means of representing semistructured data and as a standard for data exchange over the Web, because of its varied applicability in numerous applications. Therefore, XML documents constitute an important data mining domain. In this paper, we propose a new method of XML document clustering by a global criterion function, considering the weight of common structures. Our approach initially extracts representative structures of frequent patterns from schemaless XML documents using a sequential pattern mining algorithm. Then, we perform clustering of an XML document by the weight of common structures, without a measure of pairwise similarity, assuming that an XML document is a transaction and frequent structures extracted from documents are items of the transaction. We conducted experiments to compare our method with previous methods. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Applications like city traffic planning, identification of evacuation routes, trend detection, and many more can benefit from trajectory mining. However, the trajectories of individuals often contain private and sensitive information, so anyone who possess trajectory data must take special care when disclosing this data. Removing identifiers from trajectories before the release is not effective against linkage type attacks, and rich sources of background information make it even worse. An alternative is to apply transformation techniques to map the given set of trajectories into another set where the distances are preserved. This way, the actual trajectories are not released, but the distance information can still be used for data mining techniques such as clustering. In this paper, we show that an unknown private trajectory can be reconstructed using the available background information together with the mutual distances released for data mining purposes. The background knowledge is in the form of known trajectories and extra information such as the speed limit. We provide analytical results which bound the number of the known trajectories needed to reconstruct private trajectories. Experiments performed on real trajectory data sets show that the number of known samples is surprisingly smaller than the actual theoretical bounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, in order to realize the full benefits of the RBAC paradigm, one must first define the roles accurately. This task of defining roles and associating permissions with them, also known as role engineering, is typically accomplished either in a top-down or in a bottom-up manner. Under the top-down approach, a careful analysis of the business processes is done to first define job functions and then to specify appropriate roles from them. While this approach can help in defining roles more accurately, it is tedious and time consuming since it requires that the semantics of the business processes be well understood. Moreover, it ignores existing permissions within an organization and does not utilize them. On the other hand, under the bottom-up approach, existing permissions are used to derive roles from them. As a result, it may help automate the process of role definition. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach, called RoleMiner, for mining roles from existing user-permission assignments. Since a role, when semantics are unavailable, is nothing but a set of permissions, the task of role mining is essentially that of clustering users having the same (or similar) permissions. However, unlike the traditional applications of data mining that ideally require identification of nonoverlapping clusters, roles will have overlapping permissions and thus permission sets that define roles should be allowed to overlap. It is this distinction from traditional clustering that makes the problem of role mining nontrivial. Our experiments with real and simulated data sets indicate that our role mining process is quite accurate and efficient. Since our role mining approach is based on subset enumeration, it is fairly robust to reasonable levels of noise.

To bring the multiple attribute evaluation method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) into evaluating large number of elements, it needs to set up the performance standards and an evaluation procedure by the DEA model. In this paper, we first determine a set of "standard" candidates, called in decision making units (DMUs) in the DEA terminology. This standard set is called "training set". We then establish the evaluation procedure based on this "training set" for measuring a large number of DMUs. We first investigate the efficiency evaluation of a new DMU along with the original definition based on the sum formed production possibility set which is formed by the n DMUs in the training set and the new DMU. We then identify the intersection form of the production possibility set formed only by the n DMUs from the training set. And show that the new DMU evaluation is simply to check if the DMU satisfies a set of linear inequalities. The intersection formed production possibility set formed by the n DMUs from the training set is fixed for evaluating any new DMU. Therefore, it provides an efficient and effective method for dealing with a large amount of data. The method can be regarded as a complementary approach for data mining.

However, there are increasingly numerous concerns about whether the KM efforts can be fairly reflected and transformed into the business performance. Even though the KM contribution is qualitative and hard to measure, some works using statistical methods declare that a specific KM style may produce a better corporate performance. Statistical methods attempt to summarize yesterday's success rules, while data mining techniques aim to explore tomorrow's success clues. This study challenges the issue of what the hidden patterns between KM and its performance are, and whereby identifies the reality of whether a better performance is resulted from a special KM style. The analysis results using Bayesian network classifier and rough set theory show that it is not easy to support that a special KM style would produce a similar performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This approach is particularly designed for classification of datasets with a small number of samples and a high percentage of missing values where available missing value treatment approaches do not usually work well. Based on the pattern of the missing values, the proposed approach finds subsets of samples for which most of the features are available and trains a classifier for each subset. Then, it combines the outputs of the classifiers. Subset selection is translated into a clustering problem, allowing derivation of a mathematical framework for it. A trade off is established between the computational complexity (number of subsets) and the accuracy of the overall classifier. To deal with this trade off, a numerical criterion is proposed for the prediction of the overall performance. The proposed method is applied to seven datasets from the popular University of California, Irvine data mining archive and an epilepsy dataset from Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan (total of eight datasets). Experimental results show that classification accuracy of the proposed method is superior to those of the widely used multiple imputations method and four other methods. They also show that the level of superiority depends on the pattern and percentage of missing values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the increasing prevalence of TCM and the large volume of TCM data accumulated though thousands of years, there is an urgent need to efficiently and effectively explore this information and its hidden rules with knowledge discovery in database (KDD) techniques. This paper describes the design and development of a knowledge discovery system for TCM as well as the newly proposed KDD techniques integrated in this system. Methods: A novel Knowledge dIscovery System for TCM (KISTCM) is developed by incorporating several data mining techniques, primarily including a medicine dependency relationship discovery algorithm, an efficacy dimension reduction algorithm based on neural networks, a method for exploring the relationships between formulae and syndromes using gene expression programming (GEP), and an approach for discovering the properties in terms of nature, taste and meridian based on the herbal dosage by employing the effect degree function to calculate the effect of each property. Results: Representative experimental cases are used to evaluate the system performance. Encouraging results are obtained, including rules previously unknown to algorithm designers and experiment runners. Experiments demonstrate that KISTCM has powerful knowledge discovery and data analysis capabilities, and is a useful tool for discovering the underlying rules in formulae. Our proposed techniques successfully discover hidden knowledge from TCM data, which is a new direction in knowledge discovery. From TCM experts' perspective, the accuracy of data analysis for KISTCM is an improvement, and these results compare favorably to other existing TCM data mining techniques. The system could be expected to be useful in the practice of TCM, e.g., assisting TCM physicians in prescribing formulae or automatically distinguishing between minister and assistant herbs in a formula.

This algorithm is used for density estimation and clustering of data distributed over nodes of a network. Then, a distributed incremental EM algorithm (DIEM) with a higher convergence rate is proposed. After a full derivation of distributed EM algorithms, convergence of these algorithms is analyzed based on the negative free energy concept used in statistical physics. An analytical approach is also developed for evaluating the convergence rate of both incremental and distributed incremental EM algorithms. It is analytically shown that the convergence rate of DIEM is much faster than that of the DEM algorithm. Finally, simulation results approve that DIEM remarkably outperforms DEM for both synthetic and real data sets.

Data-mining (DM) and evolutionary strategy algorithms are integrated in the framework for solving the optimization model. DM algorithms learn dynamic equations from the process data. An evolutionary strategy algorithm is then applied to solve the optimization problem guided by the knowledge extracted by the DM algorithm. The concept presented in this paper is illustrated with the data from a power plant, where the goal is to maximize the boiler efficiency and minimize the limestone consumption. This multiobjective optimization problem can be either transformed into a single-objective optimization problem through preference aggregation approaches or into a Pareto-optimal optimization problem. The computational results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

A practical approach to bankruptcy prediction for small businesses: Substituting the unavailable financial data for credit card sales information	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Small business; Support vector machines; Data mining; Credit card sales	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Small businesses are open to the elements of both consumer and business credit risks. One of the problems in bankruptcy prediction for small businesses is that the official financial data in most cases are not available for evaluating the business credit risks. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose to use the credit card sales information as a substitute for the official financial data in developing a bankruptcy prediction model. In most cases, the credit card sales information is available because most small businesses are member stores of credit card processors. First, we derived several variables using the credit card sales information, including business period, sales scale, sales fluctuation, sales pattern and business category's bankruptcy ratio, etc. Then we developed support vector machines (SVM) based model. The empirical analyses show that credit card sales information is an acceptable substitute for the financial data in predicting the bankruptcy of small businesses. In addition, the proposed SVM model exhibits superior performance compared to other classifiers such as neural networks, CART, C5.0, multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), and logistic regression analysis (LRA).

Studies on Bayes classifier for condition monitoring of single point carbide tipped tool based on statistical and histogram features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision tree; Naive Bayes; Bayes Net; Statistical features; Histogram features; Tool condition monitoring	TURNING OPERATIONS; WEAR; VIBRATION; NETWORK; SYSTEM	Various methods of tool condition monitoring techniques are used to control the tool wear during machining in CNC machine tools. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is used to probe into the structural information hidden in the signals acquired. This paper discusses machine tool condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool by using Naive Bayes and Bayes Net classifiers and compares the results of histogram features with the statistical features to establish better classification among the two. The vibration signals are acquired for various tool conditions like tool-good condition, tip-breakage, etc. The effort is to bring out the better feature-classifier combine. The results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Elangovan, M.; Ramachandran, K.

J	Kim, YS				Kim, Yong Soo			Performance evaluation for classification methods: A comparative simulation study	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Data mining; Statistical method; Artificial neural network; Decision tree; Logistic regression	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE-REGRESSION; MODELS	In this article, the performance of classification methods was empirically compared while varying the number of classes of dependent variables, the number of independent variables, the types of independent variables, the number of classes of the independent variables, and the sample size. Our study employed 324 simulated examples, with artificial neural networks and decision trees as the data mining techniques, and logistic regression as the statistical method. In the performance study, we use the misclassification errors as the metric and come up with some additional findings: (i) for continuous independent variables, a statistical technique (i.e., logistic regression) was superior to data mining techniques (i.e., artificial neural network and decision tree) when dependent variable has binary values, while the artificial neural network was best when the number of classes of dependent variable was three or more; (ii) for continuous and categorical independent variables, logistic regression performs better than artificial neural network and decision tree in the case of small number of independent variables and small sample size, while artificial neural network was best in other cases; and (iii) the artificial neural network performance improved faster than that of other methods as the number of independent variables and the number of classes of dependent variables increases.

J	Chen, JS; Moon, YS; Wong, MF; Su, GD				Chen, Jiansheng; Moon, Yiu-Sang; Wong, Ming-Fai; Su, Guangda			Palmprint authentication using a symbolic representation of images	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						Biometrics; Palmprint authentication; Symbolic representation; Time series	IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; VERIFICATION	A new branch of biometrics, palmprint authentication, has attracted increasing amount of attention because palmprints are abundant of line features so that low resolution images can be used. In this paper, we propose a new texture based approach for palmprint feature extraction, template representation and matching. An extension of the SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation), a time series technology, to 2D data is the key to make this new approach effective, simple, flexible and reliable. Experiments show that by adopting the simple feature of grayscale information only, this approach can achieve an equal error rate of 0.3%, and a rank one identification accuracy of 99.9% on a 7752 palmprint public database. This new approach has very low computational complexity so that it can be efficiently implemented on slow mobile embedded platforms. The proposed approach does not rely on any parameter training process and therefore is fully reproducible. What is more, besides the palmprint authentication, the proposed 2D extension of SAX may also be applied to other problems of pattern recognition and data mining for 2D images. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

FLNN have been successfully used in many applications such as system identification, channel equalization, short-term electric-load forecasting, and some of the tasks of data mining. The goals of this paper are to: (1) provide readers who are novice to this area with a basis of understanding FLNN and a comprehensive survey, while offering specialists an updated picture of the depth and breadth of the theory and applications; (2) present a new hybrid learning scheme for Chebyshev functional link neural network (CFLNN); and (3) suggest possible remedies and guidelines for practical applications in data mining. We then validate the proposed learning scheme for CFLNN in classification by an extensive simulation study. Comprehensive performance comparisons with a number of existing methods are presented.

The main application motivating this study is textile image annotation, which has recently rapidly expanded in relation to the Web. In the proposed method, color and pattern are used as cues to predict the emotional semantics associated with an image, where these features are extracted using a color quantization and a multi-level wavelet transform, respectively. The extracted features are then applied to three representative classifiers: K-means clustering, Naive Bayesian, and a multi-layered perceptron (MLP), all of which are widely used in data mining. When evaluating the proposed emotion prediction method using 3600 textile images, the MLP produces the best performance. Thereafter, the proposed MLP-based method is compared with other methods that only use color or pattern, and the proposed method shows the best performance with an accuracy of above 92%. Therefore, the results confirm that the proposed method can be effectively applied to the commercial textile industry and image retrieval. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

THE-MUSS supports the development and running of u-health services with functions, modules, and facilities that are commonly required for various mobile u-health services. Aiming to achieve reusability and evolvability design goals, basic modules to support bio-signal capturing, processing, analysis, diagnosis, and feedback are developed and stacked in the layered architecture of THE-MUSS. A U-health service platform, design tool, portal, and matrix-based disease group identification method are the major components constituting the THE-MUSS architecture.

J	Zhu, D				Zhu, Dan			A hybrid approach for efficient ensembles	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Ensembles; Classification; Data envelopment analysis; Stacking	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTING ENSEMBLES; STACKED GENERALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; MODELS	An ensemble of classifiers, or a systematic combination of individual classifiers, often results in better classifications in comparison to a single classifier. However. the question regarding what classifiers should be chosen for a given situation to construct an optimal ensemble has often been debated. In addition, ensembles are often computationally expensive since they require the execution of multiple classifiers for a single classification task. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid approach for selecting and combining data mining models to construct ensembles by integrating Data Envelopment Analysis and stacking. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gao, L; Ren, SX				Gao, Ling; Ren, Shouxin			Combining orthogonal signal correction and wavelet packet transform with radial basis function neural networks for multicomponent determination	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Orthogonal signal correction; Wavelet packet transform; Radial basis function neural network; Data mining; Multicomponent spectrophotometric determination	SIMULTANEOUS SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION; FOURIER DOMAIN; 4 METALS; ALGORITHM; SPECTROSCOPY; PROJECTION; SELECTION	This paper presented a novel method named OSCWPTRBFN based on the concept of data mining in chemometrics for resolving overlapping spectra. The method combines orthogonal signal correction, wavelet packet transform and radial basis function neural network for enhancing the ability of removing noise and eliminating unrelated information as well as improving the quality of the regression method. OSC was applied to remove structured noise that is unrelated to the concentration variables. Wavelet packet representations of signals provided a local time-frequency description. thus in the wavelet packet domain, the quality of noise removal can be improved. Radial basis function network was applied for overcoming the convergence problem met in back propagation training and for facilitating nonlinear calculation. In this spectrophotometric case. through optimization, the number of OSC components, wavelet function, decomposition level. the number of hidden nodes and the width (sigma) of RBFN for OSCWPTRBFN method were selected as 1, Coif 2, 4, 15 and 0.7 respectively. The relative standard errors of prediction (RSEP) for all components with OSCWPTRBFN, WPTRBFN, RBFN, partial least squares (PLS), OSCWPTPLS, principal component regression (PCR), Fourier transform based PCR (FTPCR) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods were 6.85, 7.74, 22.0, 10.1, 8.93, 13.5, 13.1, and 2.38 X 10(3)% respectively. Experimental results showed that the OSCWPTRBFN method was successful and had advantages over the other approaches. The results obtained from an additional test case, Simultaneous differential pulse stripping voltammetric determination of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II), also demonstrated that the OSCWPTRBFN method performed very well.

Recent work has suggested that contextual estimation of student guessing and slipping leads to better prediction within the tutoring software (Baker, Corbett, & Aleven, 2008a, 20086). However, it is not yet clear whether this new variant on knowledge tracing is effective at predicting the latent student knowledge that leads to successful post-test performance. In this paper, we compare the Contextual-Guess-and-Slip variant on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to classical four-parameter Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and the Individual Difference Weights variant of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (Corbett & Anderson, 1995), investigating how well each model variant predicts post-test performance. We also test other ways to utilize contextual estimation of slipping within the tutor in post-test prediction, and discuss hypotheses for why slipping during tutor use is a significant predictor of post-test performance, even after Bayesian Knowledge Tracing estimates are controlled for.

Using MOSE, a user can easily compose and execute geo-workflows for analyzing and managing natural disasters such as landslides, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, etc. MOSE is designed to be applicable both for the implementation of response strategies when emergencies occur and for disaster prevention. It takes advantage of the standardized resource access and workflow support for loosely coupled software components provided by web/grid services technologies. The integration of workflows with data mining services significantly improves data analysis. Geospatial data management and mining are critical areas of modern-day geosciences research. An important challenge for geospatial information mining is the distributed nature of the data. MOSE provides knowledge discovery services based on the WEKA data mining library and novel distributed data mining algorithms for spatial data analysis. A P2P bio-inspired algorithm for distributed spatial clustering as an example of distributed knowledge discovery service for intensive data analysis is presented. A real case application for the analysis of landslide hazard areas in the Campania Region near the Sarno area shows the advantages of using the portal. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the general data mining and classification literature, functions such as Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation have gained their status of de facto standards thanks to a considerable amount of experimental validation. For microarray data, the issue of which distance function "works best" has been investigated, but no final conclusion has been reached. The aim of this paper is to shed further light on that issue. Indeed, we present an experimental study, involving several distances, assessing (a) their intrinsic separation ability and (b) their predictive power when used in conjunction with clustering algorithms. The experiments have been carried out on six benchmark microarray datasets, where the "gold solution" is known for each of them. We have used both Hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms and external validation criteria as evaluation tools. From the methodological point of view, the main result of this study is a ranking of those measures in terms of their intrinsic and clustering abilities, highlighting also the correlations between the two. Pragmatically, based on the outcomes of the experiments, one receives the indication that Minkowski, cosine and Pearson correlation distances seems to be the best choice when dealing with microarray data analysis.

In imbalanced datasets one class (sometimes severely) outnumbers the other class, causing correct, and useful predictions to be difficult to achieve. In order to combat this, many techniques have been proposed, especially centered around sampling methods. In this paper we propose an ensemble framework that combines random subspaces with sampling to overcome the class imbalance problem. We then experimentally verify this technique on a wide variety of datasets. We conclude by analyzing the performance of the ensembles, and showing that, overall, our technique provides a significant improvement.	[Hoens, T.

DBSCAN is recognized as a high quality density-based algorithm for clustering data. It enables both the determination of clusters of any shape and the identification of noise in data. The most time-consuming operation in DBSCAN is the calculation of a neighborhood for each data point. In order to speed up this operation in DBSCAN, the neighborhood calculation is expected to be supported by spatial access methods. DBSCAN, nevertheless, is not efficient in the case of high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new efficient TI-DBSCAN algorithm and its variant TI-DBSCAN-REF that apply the same clustering methodology as DBSCAN. Unlike DBSCAN, TI-DBSCAN and TI-DBSCAN-REF do not use spatial indices; instead they use the triangle inequality property to quickly reduce the neighborhood search space. The experimental results prove that the new algorithms are up to three orders of magnitude faster than DBSCAN, and efficiently cluster both low and high dimensional data.

In this paper, we adopt the UWB channel model in underwater networks and suggest a blind non-coherent receiver. Some differentiated features have been developed to represent the multipath signals. Then, we formulate the underwater signal detection as a data mining process. Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is finally adopted to perform blind signal detection.

Modeling Individualization in a Bayesian Networks Implementation of Knowledge Tracing	USER MODELING, ADAPTATION, AND PERSONALIZATION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization	JUN 20-24, 2010	Hilo, HI	Univ Hawaii, Manoa, User Modeling Inc, ACM SIGIR, ACM SIGART		Knowledge Tracing; Individualization; Bayesian Networks; Data Mining; Prediction; Intelligent Tutoring Systems		The field of intelligent tutoring systems has been using the well known knowledge tracing model, popularized by Corbett and Anderson (1995), to track student knowledge for over a decade. Surprisingly, models currently in use do not allow for individual learning rates nor individualized estimates of student initial knowledge. Corbett and Anderson, in their original articles, were interested in trying to add individualization to their model which they accomplished but with mixed results. Since their original work, the field has not made significant progress towards individualization of knowledge tracing models in fitting data. In this work, we introduce an elegant way of formulating the individualization problem entirely within a Bayesian networks framework that fits individualized as well as skill specific parameters simultaneously, in a single step. With this new individualization technique we are able to show a reliable improvement in prediction of real world data by individualizing the initial knowledge parameter. We explore three difference strategies for setting the initial individualized knowledge parameters and report that the best strategy is one in which information from multiple skills is used to inform each student's prior. Using this strategy we achieved lower prediction error in 33 of the 42 problem sets evaluated. The implication of this work is the ability to enhance existing intelligent tutoring systems to more accurately estimate when a student has reached mastery of a skill. Adaptation of instruction based on individualized knowledge and learning speed is discussed as well as open research questions facing those that wish to exploit student and skill information in their user models.

Data mining of these vasts amount of data is crucial in gaining this understanding. In this paper, we present a fuzzy rule-based classification system that allows for effective analysis of gene expression data. The applied classifier consists of a set of fuzzy if-then rules that enable accurate nonlinear classification of input patterns. We further present a hybrid fuzzy classification scheme in which a small number of fuzzy if-then rules are selected through means of a genetic algorithm, leading to a compact classifier for gene expression analysis. Extensive experimental results on various well-known gene expression datasets confirm the efficacy of our approaches.

J	Wilson, D; Bertolotto, M; Weakliam, J				Wilson, David; Bertolotto, Michela; Weakliam, Joe			Personalizing map content to improve task completion efficiency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						map personalization; user modeling; implicit profiling; data mining; mobile GIS	USERS	Significant interaction challenges arise in both developing and using interactive map applications. Users encounter problems of information overload in using interactive maps to complete tasks. This is further exacerbated by device limitations and interaction constraints in increasingly popular mobile platforms. Application developers must then address restrictions related to screen size and limited bandwidth in order to effectively display maps on mobile devices. In order to address issues of user information overload and application efficiency in interactive map applications, we have developed a novel approach for delivering personalized vector maps. Ongoing task interactions between users and maps are monitored and captured implicitly in order to infer individual and group preferences related to specific map feature content. Personalized interactive maps that contain spatial feature content tailored specifically to users' individual preferences are then generated. Our approach addresses spatial information overload by providing only the map information necessary and sufficient to suit user interaction preferences, thus simplifying the completion of tasks performed with interactive maps. In turn, tailoring map content to specific user preferences considerably reduces the size of vector data sets necessary to transmit and render maps on mobile devices. We have developed a geographic information system prototype, MAPPER ( MAP PERsonalization), that implements our approach. Experimental evaluations show that the use of personalized maps helps users complete their tasks more efficiently and can reduce information overload.

TUNEDIT is composed of three complementary and interconnected components: Tuned Tester, Repository and Knowledge Base. TunedTester is a stand-alone Java application that runs automated tests (experiments) of algorithms. Repository is a database of algorithms, datasets and evaluation procedures used by Tuned Tester for setting up a test. Knowledge Base is a database of test results. Repository and Knowledge Base are accessible through TUNEDIT website. TUNEDIT is open and free for use by any researcher. Every registered user can upload new resources to Repository, run experiments with Tuned Tester, send results to Knowledge Base and browse all collected results, generated either by himself or by others. As a special functionality, built upon the framework of automated tests, TUNEDIT provides a platform for organization of on-line interactive competitions for machine-learning problems. This functionality may be used, for instance, by teachers to launch contests for their students instead of traditional assignment tasks; or by organizers of machine-learning and data-mining conferences to launch competitions for the scientific community, in association with the conference.

Prediction of liquefaction is also a complex problem as it depends on many different physical factors, and the relations between these factors are highly non-linear and complex. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for modeling and prediction of liquefaction. Most of these approaches are based on classical statistical approaches and neural networks. In this paper a new approach which is based on classification data mining is proposed first time in the literature for liquefaction prediction. The proposed approach is based on extracting accurate classification rules from neural networks via ant colony optimization. The extracted classification rules are in the form of IF-THEN rules which can be easily understood by human. The proposed algorithm is also compared with several other data mining algorithms. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is very effective and accurate in prediction of liquefaction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thongkam, J; Xu, GD; Zhang, YC; Huang, FC				Thongkam, Jaree; Xu, Guandong; Zhang, Yanchun; Huang, Fuchun			Toward breast cancer survivability prediction models through improving training space	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Outliers; Over-sampling; Breast cancer survivability prediction models		Due to the difficulties of outlier and skewed data, the prediction of breast cancer survivability has presented many challenges in the field of data mining and pattern precognition, especially in medical research. To solve these problems, we have proposed a hybrid approach to generating higher quality data sets in the creation of improved breast cancer survival prediction models. This approach comprises two main steps: (1) utilization of an outlier filtering approach based on C-Support Vector Classification (C-SVC) to identify and eliminate outlier instances: and (2) application of an over-sampling approach using over-sampling with replacement to increase the number of instances in the minority class. In order to assess the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, several measurement methods including basic performance (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity), Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and F-measure were utilized. Moreover. a 10-fold cross-validation method was used to reduce the bias and variance of the results of breast cancer survivability prediction models. Results have indicated that the proposed approach leads to improving the performance of breast cancer survivability prediction models by up to 28.34% due to the improved training data space.

SPARCL: an effective and efficient algorithm for mining arbitrary shape-based clusters	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; Spatial; Kmeans; Hierarchical; Linear time		Clustering is one of the fundamental data mining tasks. Many different clustering paradigms have been developed over the years, which include partitional, hierarchical, mixture model based, density-based, spectral, subspace, and so on. The focus of this paper is on full-dimensional, arbitrary shaped clusters. Existing methods for this problem suffer either in terms of the memory or time complexity (quadratic or even cubic). This shortcoming has restricted these algorithms to datasets of moderate sizes. In this paper we propose SPARCL, a simple and scalable algorithm for finding clusters with arbitrary shapes and sizes, and it has linear space and time complexity. SPARCL consists of two stages-the first stage runs a carefully initialized version of the Kmeans algorithm to generate many small seed clusters. The second stage iteratively merges the generated clusters to obtain the final shape-based clusters. Experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets to highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our approach. On the large datasets SPARCL is an order of magnitude faster than the best existing approaches.

J	Eriksson, L; Trygg, J; Wold, S				Eriksson, Lennart; Trygg, Johan; Wold, Svante			PLS-Trees (R), a top-down clustering approach	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS			English	Article						PLS-Trees; PLS; dendrogram; data mining; clustering; variable selection; outlier detection	ORTHOGONAL PROJECTIONS; PLS; SELECTION	A hierarchical clustering approach based on a set of PLS models is presented. Called PLS-Trees (R), this approach is analogous to classification and regression trees (CART), but uses the scores of PLS regression models as the basis for splitting the clusters, instead of the individual X-variables. The split of one cluster into two is made along the sorted first X-score (t(1)) of a PLS model of the cluster, but may potentially be made along a direction corresponding to a combination of scores. The position of the split is selected according to the improvement of a weighted combination of (a) the variance of the X-score, (b) the variance of Y and (c) a penalty function discouraging an unbalanced split with very different numbers of observations. Cross-validation is used to terminate the branches of the tree, and to determine the number of components of each cluster PLS model. Some obvious extensions of the approach to OPLS-Trees and trees based on hierarchical PLS or OPLS models with the variables divided in blocks depending on their type, are also mentioned. The possibility to greatly reduce the number of variables in each PLS model on the basis of their PLS w-coefficients is also pointed out. The approach is illustrated by means of three examples. The first two examples are quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data sets, while the third is based on hyperspectral images of liver tissue for identifying different sources of variability in the liver samples.

However, not all of the generated rules are interesting, and some unapparent rules may be ignored. We have introduced an "extracted probability" measure in this article. Using this measure, 3 models are presented to modify the confidence of rules. An efficient method based on the support-confidence framework is then developed to generate rules of interest. The adult dataset from the UCl machine learning repository and a database of occupational accidents are analyzed in this article. The analysis reveals that the proposed methods can effectively generate interesting rules from a variety of association rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, J; Li, X; Zhong, WC				Liu, Jing; Li, Xue; Zhong, Weicai			Ambiguous decision trees for mining concept-drifting data streams	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Data streams; Data mining; Concept drift; Ambiguous decision trees; Incremental learning		In real world situations, explanations for the same observations may be different depending on perceptions or contexts. They may change with time especially when concept drift occurs. This phenomenon incurs ambiguities. It is useful if an algorithm can learn to reflect ambiguities and select the best decision according to context or situation. Based on this viewpoint, we study the problem of deriving ambiguous decision trees from data streams to cope with concept drift. CVFDT (Concept-adapting Very Fast Decision Tree) is one of the most well-known streaming data mining methods that can learn decision trees incrementally. In this paper, we establish a method called ambiguous CVFDT (aCVFDT), which integrates ambiguities into CVFDT by exploring multiple options at each node whenever a node is to be split. When aCVFDT is used to make class predictions, it is guaranteed that the best and newest knowledge is used. When old concepts recur, aCVFDT can immediately relearn them by using the corresponding options recorded at each node. Furthermore, CVFDT does not automatically detect occurrences of concept drift and only scans trees periodically, whereas an automatic concept drift detecting mechanism is used in aCVFDT. In our experiments, hyperplane problem and two benchmark problems from the UCI KIDD Archive, namely Network Intrusion and Forest CoverType, are used to validate the performance of aCVFDT. The experimental results show that aCVFDT obtains significantly improved results over traditional CVFDT. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We take the difference between manipulated stock's and index's average daily return, average daily change in trading volume and average daily volatility and used these statistics as explanatory variables. The data in post-manipulation and pre-manipulation periods are used as non-manipulated instances while the data in the manipulation period are used as manipulated instances. Test performance of classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity statistics for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared with the results of discriminant analysis and logistics regression (logit). We found that the data mining techniques (ANN and SVM) are better suited to detect stock-price manipulation than multivariate statistical techniques (discriminant analysis, logistics regression) as the performances of the data mining techniques in terms of total classification accuracy and sensitivity statistics are better than those of multivariate techniques. We also found that unit change in difference between average daily return of manipulated stock and the index has the largest effect while unit change in difference between average daily change in trading volume of manipulated stock and index has the least effect on multivariate classifiers' decision functions.

In this paper, we show that it is in general also hard to approximate. Subsequently, a randomized counting algorithm is developed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. While for general inputs an exponential running time is needed in order to guarantee a certain approximation bound, we show that the algorithm still has the desired accuracy on several real-world datasets when its running time is capped polynomially.

The proposed methodology uses term co-occurrence frequencies as an indicator of the semantic closeness between terms. To support the automated creation of taxonomies or subject classifications we present a simple modification to the basic distance measure, and describe a set of procedures by which these measures may be converted into estimates of the desired taxonomy. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, a pilot study on renewable energy technologies is conducted, where the proposed method is used to construct a hierarchy of terms related to alternative energy. These techniques have many potential applications, but one activity in which we are particularly interested is the mapping and subsequent prediction of future developments in the technology and research.

Towards a new strategy for solving fuzzy optimization problems	FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Fuzzy linear programming; Fuzzy optimization; Heuristics algorithms; Soft computing; Data mining	RANKING; NUMBERS	Fuzzy Optimization models and methods has been one of the most and well studied topics inside the broad area of Soft Computing. Particularly relevant is the field of fuzzy linear programming (FLP). Its applications as well as practical realizations can be found in all the real world areas. As FLP problems constitute the basis for solving fuzzy optimization problems, in this paper a basic introduction to the main models and methods in FLP is presented and, as a whole, Linear Programming problems with fuzzy costs, fuzzy constraints and fuzzy coefficients in the technological matrix are analyzed. But fuzzy sets and systems based optimization methods do not end with FLP, and hence in order to solve more complex optimization problems, fuzzy sets based Meta-heuristics are considered, and two main operative approaches described. Provided that these techniques obtain efficient and/or effective solutions, we present a fuzzy rule based methodology for coordinating Meta-heuristics and in addition, to provide intelligence, we propose a process of extraction of the knowledge to conduct the coordination of the system.

In VC theory, the goal is to 'imitate' unknown target function, in the sense of minimization of prediction risk or good 'generalization'. That is, the result of VC learning depends on (unknown) input distribution, while that of FA does not. This distinction is important because regularization theory originally introduced under clearly stated FA setting [Tikhonov, N. (1963). On solving ill-posed problem and method of regularization. Doklady Akademii Nauk USSR, 153, 501-504; Tikhonov, N.. & V. Y. Arsenin (1977). Solution of ill-posed problems. Washington, DC: W. H. Winston], has been later used under risk-minimization or VC setting. More recently, several authors [Evgeniou, T., Pontil, M., & Poggio, T. (2000). Regularization networks and support vector machines. Advances in Computational Mathematics, 13, 1-50; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2001). The elements of statistical learning: Data mining, inference and prediction. Springer; Poggio, T. and Smale, S., (2003). The mathematics of learning: Dealing with data. Notices of the AMS, 50 (5), 537-544] applied constructive methodology based on regularization framework to learning dependencies from data (under VC-theoretical setting). However, such regularization-based learning is usually presented as a purely constructive methodology (with no clearly stated problem setting). This paper compares FA/regularization and VC/risk minimization methodologies in terms of underlying theoretical assumptions. The control of model complexity, using regularization and using the concept of margin in SVMs, is contrasted in the FA and VC formulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Correct behavior identification system in a Tagged World	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Tagged World; User behavior; RFID; Frequent itemsets; Regular Grammar		This paper presents a system that is able to process the information provided by a Tagged World to identify user's behavior and to produce alarms in dangerous situations. The system inputs are signals from sensors, which are used to recognize correct behavior (action sequences) by Inductive Learning, using Data Mining techniques. The inference engine is a reasoning device that is implemented by means of Regular Grammars. It permits LIS to control user's behavior. As Output, the system produces and sends alarms when a user action sequence is wrong, indicating the erroneous actions, forgotten future, and so on. To test Our system, the Tagged World is supposed to be at a house, where we have used RFID technology to control the objects inside it. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, TP; Wu, YY; Wang, SL				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Wu, Yi-Ying; Wang, Shyue-Liang			An effective mining approach for up-to-date patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Temporal patterns; Up-to-date patterns; Lifetime		Mining association rules is most commonly seen among the techniques for knowledge discovery from databases (KDD). It is used to discover relationships among items or itemsets. Furthermore, temporal data mining is concerned with the analysis of temporal data and the discovery of temporal patterns and regularities. In this paper, a new concept of up-to-date patterns is proposed, which is a hybrid of the association rules and temporal mining. An itemset may not be frequent (large) for an entire database but may be large up-to-date since the items seldom occurring early may often occur lately. An up-to-date pattern is thus composed of an itemset and its up-to-date lifetime, in which the user-defined minimum-support threshold must be satisfied. The proposed approach can mine more useful large itemsets than the conventional ones which discover large itemsets valid only for the entire database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than the traditional ones in discovering Such up-to-date temporal patterns especially when the minimum-support threshold is high.

J	Shieh, J; Keogh, E				Shieh, Jin; Keogh, Eamonn			iSAX: disk-aware mining and indexing of massive time series datasets	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Time series; Data mining; Representations; Indexing	REPRESENTATION; COMPRESSION	Current research in indexing and mining time series data has produced many interesting algorithms and representations. However, the algorithms and the size of data considered have generally not been representative of the increasingly massive datasets encountered in science, engineering, and business domains. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-resolution symbolic representation which can be used to index datasets which are several orders of magnitude larger than anything else considered in the literature. To demonstrate the utility of this representation, we constructed a simple tree-based index structure which facilitates fast exact search and orders of magnitude faster, approximate search. For example, with a database of one-hundred million time series, the approximate search can retrieve high quality nearest neighbors in slightly over a second, whereas a sequential scan would take tens of minutes. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our representation allows index performance to scale well with increasing dataset sizes. Additionally, we provide analysis concerning parameter sensitivity, approximate search effectiveness, and lower bound comparisons between time series representations in a bit constrained environment. We further show how to exploit the combination of both exact and approximate search as sub-routines in data mining algorithms, allowing for the exact mining of truly massive real world datasets, containing tens of millions of time series.

J	Gely, A; Medina, R; Nourine, L				Gely, Alain; Medina, Raoul; Nourine, Lhouari			Representing lattices using many-valued relations	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Representation theory; Many-valued relation; Lattice; Partition into chains; Product of chains	ROUGH SET; ALGORITHMS	This paper provides a representation theorem of lattices using many-valued relations. We show that any many-valued relation can be associated to a unique lattice which is a meet-sublattice of a product of chains. Conversely, to any lattice we can associate a many-valued relation such that its associated lattice is isomorphic to the initial one. Thereby, we obtain a representation theorem of lattices using many-valued relations. Moreover, since several many-valued relations might have the same associated lattice, we give a characterization of the minimal many-valued relation that can be associated to a lattice. We then sketch a polynomial time algorithm which computes such a minimal relation from either a lattice or an arbitrary relation. This representation presents several advantages: it is smaller than the usual binary representation; all known reconstruction algorithms working on binary relation can be used without loss of efficiency; it can be used by existing data mining processes.

Knowledge discovery in databases is successfully applied for deriving models that estimate the value of one variable based on correlated others. The estimated values can then be used instead of the recorded ones of a measuring instrument with false reading. The aim is to reassure the correctness of data entered to an optimization software application that was developed for the Thermal Power Plants of Western Macedonia, Greece. The architecture of the application follows the Multi-Agent System approach in order to cope with its complexity and distributed nature. The application was tested on a case study and proved to be efficient. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient automation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements. This paper therefore describes a new approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed method utilizes data-mining and machine learning techniques to prioritize requirements according to stakeholders' interests, business goals, and cross-cutting concerns such as security or performance requirements. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated and evaluated through two case studies based on the requirements of the Ice Breaker System, and also on a set of stakeholders' raw feature requests mined from the discussion forum of an open source product named SugarCRM.

J	Jiang, Z; Huang, YX				Jiang, Zhu; Huang, Yong-Xuan			Parametric calibration of speed-density relationships in mesoscopic traffic simulator with data mining	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Mesoscopic simulator; Parametric calibration; Data mining; K-means clustering; Agglomerative hierarchical clustering	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; REGRESSION; CLUSTERS; FLOW	Speed-density relationships are used by mesoscopic traffic simulators to represent traffic dynamics. While classical speed-density relationships provide useful insights into the traffic dynamics problem, they may be restrictive for such applications. This paper addresses the problem of calibrating speed-density relationship parameters using data mining techniques, and proposes a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm based on K-means clustering. By combining K-means with agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the proposed new algorithm is able to reduce early-stage errors inherent in agglomerative hierarchical clustering resulted in improved clustering performance. Moreover, in order to improve the precision of parametric calibration, densities and flows are utilized as variables. The proposed approach is tested against sensor data captured from the 3rd Ring Road of Beijing. The testing results show that the performance of our algorithm is better than existing solutions.

Mining inter-sequence patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Inter-sequence pattern; Inter-transaction pattern; Sequential pattern	INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; ITEMSETS	Sequential pattern and inter-transaction pattern mining have long been important issues in data mining research. The former finds sequential patterns Without considering the relationships between transactions in databases, while the latter finds inter-transaction patterns without considering the ordered relationships of items within each transaction. However, if we want to find patterns that cross transactions in a sequence database, called inter-sequence patterns, neither of the above models can perform the task. In this paper, we propose a new data mining model for mining frequent inter-sequence patterns. We design two algorithms, M-Apriori and EISP-Miner. to find such patterns. The former is an Apriori-like algorithm that can mine inter-sequence patterns, but it is not efficient. The latter, a new method that we propose, employs several mechanisms for mining inter-sequence patterns efficiently. Experiments show that EISP-Miner is very efficient and outperforms M-Apriori by several orders of magnitude. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For purposes of better Customer relationship management, data mining technology is commonly used to analyze large quantities of data about customer bargains, purchase preferences, customer churn, etc. This paper aims to propose a recommender system for wireless network companies to understand and avoid customer churn. To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, We use the decision tree algorithm to analyze data of over 60,000 transactions and of more than 4000 members, over a period of three months. The data of the first nine weeks is used as the training data, and that of the last month as the testing data.

J	Bouguessa, M; Wang, SR				Bouguessa, Mohamed; Wang, Shengrui			Mining Projected Clusters in High-Dimensional Spaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; clustering; high dimensions	ALGORITHMS	Clustering high-dimensional data has been a major challenge due to the inherent sparsity of the points. Most existing clustering algorithms become substantially inefficient if the required similarity measure is computed between data points in the full-dimensional space. To address this problem, a number of projected clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them encounter difficulties when clusters hide in subspaces with very low dimensionality. These challenges motivate our effort to propose a robust partitional distance-based projected clustering algorithm. The algorithm consists of three phases. The first phase performs attribute relevance analysis by detecting dense and sparse regions and their location in each attribute. Starting from the results of the first phase, the goal of the second phase is to eliminate outliers, while the third phase aims to discover clusters in different subspaces. The clustering process is based on the K-Means algorithm, with the computation of distance restricted to subsets of attributes where object values are dense. Our algorithm is capable of detecting projected clusters of low dimensionality embedded in a high-dimensional space and avoids the computation of the distance in the full-dimensional space. The suitability of our proposal has been demonstrated through an empirical study using synthetic and real data sets.

Cost factors have been taken into consideration in many previous studies regarding decision tree models. In this study, we also consider a cost-sensitive decision tree construction problem. We assume that there are test costs that must be paid to obtain the values of the decision attribute and that a record must be classified without exceeding the spending cost threshold. Unlike previous studies, however, in which records were classified with only a single condition attribute, in this study, we are able to simultaneously classify records with multiple condition attributes. An algorithm is developed to build a cost-constrained decision tree, which allows us to simultaneously classify multiple condition attributes. The experimental results show that our algorithm satisfactorily handles data with multiple condition attributes under different cost constraints. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper presents the KP-Miner system, and demonstrates through experimentation and comparison with widely used systems that it is effective and efficient in extracting keyphrases from both English and Arabic documents of varied length. Unlike other existing keyphrase extraction systems, the KP-Miner system does not need to be trained on a particular document set in order to achieve its task. It also has the advantage of being configurable as the rules and heuristics adopted by the system are related to the general nature of documents and keyphrases. This implies that the users of this system can use their understanding of the document(s) being input into the system to fine-tune it to their particular needs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jiang, T; Tuzhilin, A				Jiang, Tianyi; Tuzhilin, Alexander			Improving Personalization Solutions through Optimal Segmentation of Customer Bases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Customer segmentation; marketing application; personalization; one-to-one marketing; customer profiles	USER PROFILES; WEB SITES; ALGORITHM; MODELS	On the Web, where the search costs are low and the competition is just a mouse click away, it is crucial to segment the customers intelligently in order to offer more targeted and personalized products and services to them. Traditionally, customer segmentation is achieved using statistics-based methods that compute a set of statistics from the customer data and group customers into segments by applying distance-based clustering algorithms in the space of these statistics. In this paper, we present a direct grouping-based approach to computing customer segments that groups customers not based on computed statistics, but in terms of optimally combining transactional data of several customers to build a data mining model of customer behavior for each group. Then, building customer segments becomes a combinatorial optimization problem of finding the best partitioning of the customer base into disjoint groups. This paper shows that finding an optimal customer partition is NP-hard, proposes several suboptimal direct grouping segmentation methods, and empirically compares them among themselves, traditional statistics-based hierarchical and affinity propagation-based segmentation, and one-to-one methods across multiple experimental conditions. It is shown that the best direct grouping method significantly dominates the statistics-based and one-to-one approaches across most of the experimental conditions, while still being computationally tractable. It is also shown that the distribution of the sizes of customer segments generated by the best direct grouping method follows a power law distribution and that microsegmentation provides the best approach to personalization.

J	Sharma, S; Osei-Bryson, KM				Sharma, Sumana; Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			Framework for formal implementation of the business understanding phase of data mining projects	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Framework; Business understanding; CRISP-DM	KNOWLEDGE	Various data mining methodologies have been proposed in the literature to provide guidance towards the process of implementing data mining projects. The methodologies describe a data mining project as comprised of a sequence of phases and highlight the particular tasks and their corresponding activities to be performed during each of the phases. It seems that the large number of tasks and activities, often presented in a checklist manner, are cumbersome to implement and may explain why all the recommended tasks are not always formally implemented. Additionally, there is often little guidance provided towards how to implement a particular task. These issues seem to be especially dominant in case of the business understanding phase which is the foundational phase of any data mining project. In this paper, we present an organizationally grounded framework to formally implement the business understanding phase of data mining projects. The framework serves to highlight the dependencies between the various tasks of this phase and proposes how and when each task can be implemented. An illustrative example of a credit scoring application from the financial sector is used to exemplify the tasks discussed in the proposed framework. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, wafer fabrication is a complex, costly, and lengthy process that involves hundreds of chemical steps and needs to monitor lots of process parameters at the same time. As we know, IC chips fabricated oil semiconductor wafers are highly vulnerable to clustered defects since defects may cause IC to completely malfunction. In particular, various types of defect patterns (i.e. scratch, ring, or zone pattern) shown oil the wafer bin map (WBM) usually contain crucial information for quality engineers to track their root causes of failure. Today, many companies still rely on the visual inspection of experienced experts to check and to hand-mark the defective regions oil WBM. This manual approach is not only time-consuming, but also inefficient and inconsistent owing to human fatigue. In this Study, a hybrid approach that integrates spatial statistics, kernel based eigen-decomposition and Support vector clustering is proposed to estimate the number of defect clusters in advance, and to separate both convex and non-convex defect clusters at the same time. Experimental results confirm that four kinds of composite defect patterns are Successfully extracted and separated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lexicographic multi-objective evolutionary induction of decision trees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION			English	Article						lexicographic multi-objective genetic algorithms; decision tree induction; classification tasks; data mining		Among the several tasks that evolutionary algorithms have successfully employed, the induction of classification rules and decision trees has been shown to be a relevant approach for several application domains. Decision tree induction algorithms represent one of the most popular techniques for dealing with classification problems. However, conventionally used decision trees induction algorithms present limitations due to the strategy they usually implement: recursive top-down data partitioning through a greedy split evaluation. The main problem with this strategy is quality loss during the partitioning process, which can lead to statistically insignificant rules. In this paper, we propose a new GA-based algorithm for decision tree induction. The proposed algorithm aims to prevent the greedy strategy and to avoid converging to local optima. For such, it is based on a lexicographic multi-objective approach. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, it is compared with a well-known and frequently used decision tree induction algorithm using different public datasets. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm is able to avoid the previously described problems, reporting accuracy gains. Even more important, the proposed algorithm induced models with a significantly reduction in the complexity considering tree sizes.	[Basgalupp, Marcia P.; de Carvalho, Andre C. P. L.

Unfortunately, the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects, where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders. As a result, new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface, such as online forums and wiki pages. In our previous work, we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums, and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders. The framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view, conflicts, interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible. In this paper, we present two substantial enhancements to the Recommender System component of this framework, and demonstrate through experiments how they improve the quality of the recommendations.

This interest in anonymization techniques has resulted in a plethora of methods for anonymizing data under different privacy and utility assumptions. At the same time, there has been little research addressing how to effectively use the anonymized data for data mining in general and for distributed data mining in particular. In this paper, we propose a new approach for building classifiers using anonymized data by modeling anonymized data as uncertain data. In our method, we do not assume any probability distribution over the data. Instead, we propose collecting all necessary statistics during anonymization and releasing these together with the anonymized data. We show that releasing such statistics does not violate anonymity. Experiments spanning various alternatives both in local and distributed data mining settings reveal that our method performs better than heuristic approaches for handling anonymized data.

However, this assumption may not hold in some situations because of data uncertainty arising from measurement errors, data staleness, and repeated measurements, etc. With uncertainty, the value of each data item is represented by a probability distribution function (pdf). In this paper, we propose a novel naive Bayes classification algorithm for uncertain data with a pdf. Our key solution is to extend the class conditional probability estimation in the Bayes model to handle pdf's. Extensive experiments on UCI datasets show that the accuracy of naive Bayes model can be improved by taking into account the uncertainty information.

In this paper we introduce a novel manifold alignment approach, which differs from "semisupervised alignment" and "Procrustes alignment" in that it does not require predetermining correspondences. Our approach learns a projection that maps data instances (from two different spaces) to a lower dimensional space simultaneously matching the local geometry and preserving the neighborhood relationship within each set. This approach also builds connections between spaces defined by different features and makes direct knowledge transfer possible. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated and validated in a series of carefully designed experiments in information retrieval and bioinformatics.

Spatial data, such as remote sensed imagery (RSI) data, is one of the promising application areas. Extracting interesting patterns and rules from spatial data sets, composed of images and associated ground data, can be of importance in precision agriculture, resource discovery, and other areas. However, in most cases, the sizes of the spatial data sets are too large to be mined in a reasonable amount of time using existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to derive association rules from spatial data using Peano Count Tree (P-tree) structure. P-tree structure provides a lossless and compressed representation of spatial data. Based on P-trees, an efficient association rule mining algorithm PARM with fast support calculation and significant pruning techniques is introduced to improve the efficiency of the rule mining process. The P-tree based Association Rule Mining (PARM) algorithm is implemented and compared with FP-growth and Apriori algorithms. Experimental results showed that our algorithm is superior for association rule mining on RSI spatial data.

J	Chen, HL; Chuang, KT; Chen, MS				Chen, Hung-Leng; Chuang, Kun-Ta; Chen, Ming-Syan			On data labeling for clustering categorical data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; categorical clustering; data labeling	MULTIPLE EVOLVING STREAMS	Sampling has been recognized as an important technique to improve the efficiency of clustering. However, with sampling applied, those points which are not sampled will not have their labels after the normal process. Although there is a straightforward approach in the numerical domain, the problem of how to allocate those unlabeled data points into proper clusters remains as a challenging issue in the categorical domain. In this paper, a mechanism named MAximal Resemblance Data Labeling (abbreviated as MARDL) is proposed to allocate each unlabeled data point into the corresponding appropriate cluster based on the novel categorical clustering representative, namely, N-Nodeset Importance Representative (abbreviated as NNIR), which represents clusters by the importance of the combinations of attribute values. MARDL has two advantages: 1) MARDL exhibits high execution efficiency and 2) MARDL can achieve high intracluster similarity and low intercluster similarity, which are regarded as the most important properties of clusters, thus benefiting the analysis of cluster behaviors. MARDL is empirically validated on real and synthetic data sets, and is shown to be significantly more efficient than prior works while attaining results of high quality.

J	Hauglid, JO; Heggland, J				Hauglid, Jon Olav; Heggland, Jon			Savanta - search, analysis, visualisation and navigation of temporal annotations	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						video database; metadata; browsing; filtering; temporal analysis	VIDEO DATA; SYSTEM	In this article, we present Savanta, an information gathering interface for temporal, semantic video annotations. In Savanta, we integrate various methods and paradigms for information gathering, including visualisation, filtering, data mining, navigation and search, in order to explore the possible advantages of doing so. We posit that a seamless integration of multiple access methods, combined with an improved interval visualisation scheme and dynamically generated metadata, will result in greater user satisfaction compared to conventional approaches for searching and querying video databases-despite the increased complexity that may result. We perform a formal usability evaluation comparing Savanta to systems based on traditional search/query paradigms, and conclude that Savanta outperforms them with regard to both power and usability, especially for complex and open-ended tasks.

J	Yu, CC; Wang, CS				Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Chen-Shu			A hybrid mining approach for optimizing returns policies in e-retailing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						returns policies; e-retailing; hybrid data mining approach	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; PRODUCT; CHANNEL; DESIGN	The returns policy has long been considered as a critical yet controversial issue in the development of supply chain and marketing strategies. Up-stream manufacturers or distributors may offer returns policies to the down-stream retailers or customers to increase order and sales quantities. There are trade-offs between returns policies and customer satisfaction, product sales, and operating costs. The goal of this paper is to use a hybrid mining approach for analyzing return patterns from both the customer and product perspectives, classifying customers and products into levels, and then for adopting proper returns policies and marketing strategies to these customer classes for sustaining better profits. A multi-dimensional framework and an associated model for the hybrid mining approach are provided with a demonstrated example for validation. It is expected that by adopting suitable returns policies, benefits can be created and shared by both e-retailers and customers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Boutsinas, B; Athanasiadis, S				Boutsinas, B.; Athanasiadis, S.			On merging classification rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						data mining; classification; meta-learning	ALGORITHM	One of the main challenges of today's data mining systems is their ability to manage a huge volume of data generated possibly by different sources. On the other hand, inductive learning algorithms have been extensively researched in machine learning using small amounts of judiciously chosen laboratory examples. There is an increasing concern in classifiers handling data that are substantially larger than available main memory on a single processor. One approach to the problem is to combine the results of different classifiers supplied with different subsets of the data, in parallel. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for combining partial classification rules. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be used to match classification rules in a distributed environment, where different subsets of data may have different domains. The latter is achieved by using given concept hierarchies for the identification of matching classification rules. We also present empirical tests that demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a significant speedup with respect to the analog non-distributed classification algorithm, at a cost of a lower classification accuracy.

M.; Debbabi, Mourad			A novel approach of mining write-prints for authorship attribution in e-mail forensics	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Annual DFRWS Conference	AUG 11-13, 2008	Baltimore, MD			E-mail forensic analysis; Authorship identification; Data mining; Write-print; Frequent itemsets	IDENTIFICATION; STYLE	There is an alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The problem of e-mail authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are supported by a strong evidence. (c) 2008 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.

J	Folino, G; Pizzuti, C; Spezzano, G				Folino, Gianluigi; Pizzuti, Clara; Spezzano, Giandomenico			Training distributed GP ensemble with a selective algorithm based on clustering and pruning for pattern classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						boosting; classification; clustering; data mining; ensemble; genetic programming (GP)	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; DECISION TREES; CLASSIFIERS; DIVERSITY	A boosting algorithm based on cellular genetic programming (GP) to build an ensemble of predictors is proposed. The method evolves a population of trees for a fixed number of rounds and, after each round, it chooses the predictors to include in the ensemble by applying a clustering algorithm to the population of classifiers. Clustering the population allows the selection of the most diverse and fittest trees that best contribute to improve classification accuracy. The method proposed runs on a distributed hybrid environment that combines the island and cellular models of parallel GP. The combination of the two models provides an efficient implementation of distributed GP, and, at the same time, the generation of low sized and accurate decision trees. The large amount of memory required to store the ensemble affects the performance of the method. This paper shows that, by applying suitable pruning strategies, it is possible to select a subset of the classifiers without increasing misclassification errors; indeed for some data sets, for up to 30% of pruning, ensemble accuracy increases.

J	Mukherjee, S; Banerjee, M; Chen, ZY; Gangopadhyay, A				Mukherjee, Shibnath; Banerjee, Madhushri; Chen, Zhiyuan; Gangopadhyay, Aryya			A privacy preserving technique for distance-based classification with worst case privacy guarantees	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						security and privacy; data mining; privacy preserving data mining; K-nearest neighbor classification	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SEARCH; DIMENSIONS	There has been relatively little work on privacy preserving techniques for distance based mining. The most widely used ones are additive perturbation methods and orthogonal transform based methods. These methods concentrate on privacy protection in the average case and provide no worst case privacy guarantee. However, the lack of privacy guarantee makes it difficult to use these techniques in practice, and causes possible privacy breach under certain attacking methods. This paper proposes a novel privacy protection method for distance based mining algorithms that gives worst case privacy guarantees and protects the data against correlation-based and transform-based attacks. This method has the following three novel aspects. First, this method uses a framework to provide theoretical bound of privacy breach in the worst case. This framework provides easy to check conditions that one can determine whether a method provides worst case guarantee. A quick examination shows that special types of noise such as Laplace noise provide worst case guarantee, while most existing methods such as adding normal or uniform noise, as well as random projection method do not provide worst case guarantee. Second, the proposed method combines the favorable features of additive perturbation and orthogonal transform methods. It uses principal component analysis to decorrelate the data and thus guards against attacks based on data correlations. It then adds Laplace noise to guard against attacks that can recover the PCA transform. Third, the proposed method improves accuracy of one of the popular distance-based classification algorithms: K-nearest neighbor classification, by taking into account the degree of distance distortion introduced by sanitization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous pattern and data clustering for pattern cluster analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						pattern discovery; contingency table; residual; chi-square test; categorical data analysis	DISCOVERY; RESIDUALS	In data mining and knowledge discovery, pattern discovery extracts previously unknown regularities in the data and is a useful tool for categorical data analysis. However, the number of patterns discovered is often overwhelming. It is difficult and time consuming to 1) interpret the discovered patterns and 2) use them to further analyze the data set. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new method that clusters patterns and their associated data simultaneously. When patterns are clustered, the data containing the patterns are also clustered, and the relation between patterns and data is made explicit. Such an explicit relation allows the user, on one hand, to further analyze each pattern cluster via its associated data cluster and, on the other hand, to interpret why a data cluster is formed via its corresponding pattern cluster. Since the effectiveness of clustering mainly depends on the distance measure, several distance measures between patterns and their associated data are proposed. Their relationships to the existing common ones are discussed. Once pattern clusters and their associated data clusters are obtained, each of them can be further analyzed individually. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experimental results on synthetic and real data are reported.	[Wong, Andrew K. C.; Li, Gary C.

In recent years, research in intrusion detection has evolved to become a multi-discipline task that involves areas such as data mining, decision analysis, agent-based systems or cost-benefit analysis among others. We propose a multiagent IDS that considers decision analysis techniques in order to configure itself optimally according to the conditions faced. This IDS also provides a quantitative measure of the value of the response decision it can autonomously take. Results regarding the well-known 1999 KDD dataset are shown. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rokach, L; Romano, R; Maimon, O				Rokach, Lior; Romano, Roni; Maimon, Oded			Mining manufacturing databases to discover the effect of operation sequence on the product quality	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						data mining; sequence mining; decision trees; quality engineering	CATEGORIZATION; INDUCTION; TEXT	Data mining techniques can be used for discovering interesting patterns in complicated manufacturing processes. These patterns are used to improve manufacturing quality. Classical representations of quality data mining problems usually refer to the operations settings and not to their sequence. This paper examines the effect of the operation sequence on the quality of the product using data mining techniques. For this purpose a novel decision tree framework for extracting sequence patterns is developed. The proposed method is capable to mine sequence patterns of any length with operations that are not necessarily immediate precedents. The core induction algorithmic framework consists of four main steps. In the first step, all manufacturing sequences are represented as string of tokens. In the second step a large set of regular expression-based patterns are induced by employing a sequence patterns. In the third step we use feature selection methods to filter out the initial set, and leave only the most useful patterns. In the last stage, we transform the quality problem into a classification problem and employ a decision tree induction algorithm. A comparative study performed on benchmark databases illustrates the capabilities of the proposed framework.

While privacy was a sensitive issue long before the advent of computers, the phenomenal growth in Internet commerce in recent years has brought privacy concerns to the fore. The problem of privacy has been further exacerbated by the fact that the Web makes it easy for new data to be automatically collected and analyzed by sophisticated data mining tools and personalized marketing services. This study explores the nature of the privacy concern in detail, especially for the online environment.

J	Lee, I; Phillips, P				Lee, Ickjai; Phillips, Peter			Urban crime analysis through areal categorized multivariate associations mining	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							PATTERNS	As geospatial data grows explosively, there is a great demand for the incorporation, of data mining techniques into a geospatial context. Association rules mining is a core technique in data mining and. is a solid candidate for the associative analysis of large geospatial databases. In, this article, we propose a geospatial knowledge discovery framework for automating the detection of multivariate associations based on a given areal base map. We investigate a series of geospatial preprocessing steps involving data conversion and classification so that the traditional Boolean. and quantitative association rules mining can be applied. Our framework, has been integrated into GISs using a dynamic link library to allow the automation of both the preprocessing and data mining phases to provide greater ease of use for users. Experiments with real-crime datasets quickly reveal interesting frequent Patterns and multivariate associations, which demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.
