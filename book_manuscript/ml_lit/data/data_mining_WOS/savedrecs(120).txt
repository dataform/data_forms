An approach to optimization is being explored that involves embedding the resource manager in an electronic game environment. The game allows a human expert to play against the resource manager in a simulated battlespace with each of the defending platforms being exclusively directed by the fuzzy resource manager and the attacking platforms being controlled by the human expert or operating autonomously under their own logic. This approach automates the data mining problem. The game automatically creates a database reflecting the domain expert's knowledge. It calls a data mining, function a algorithm, for data mining of the database as required and allows easy evaluation of the information date mined. The criterion for re-optimization is discussed. The mined information is extremely valuable as indicated by demanding scenarios.

S	Yang, Q; Li, ITY; Zhang, HH		Aha, DW; Watson, I		Yang, Q; Li, ITY; Zhang, HH			Mining high-quality cases for hypertext prediction and prefetching	CASE-BASED REASONING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR 2001)	JUL 30-AUG 02, 2001	VANCOUVER, CANADA	Amer Assoc Artificial Intelligence, AI-CBR, Changing Worlds, eGain, Empolis, European Coordinating Ctr, Haley Enterprise, Machine Learning Network, Naval Res Lab			WORLD-WIDE-WEB	Case-based reasoning aims to use past experience to solve new problems. A strong requirement for its application is that extensive experience base exists that provides statistically significant justification for new applications. Such extensive experience base has been rare, limiting most CBR applications to be confined to small-scale problems involving single or few users, or even toy problems. In this work, we present an application of CBR in the domain of web document prediction and retrieval, whereby a server-side application can decide, with high accuracy and coverage, a user's next request for hypertext documents based on past requests. An application program can then use the prediction knowledge to prefetch or presend web objects to reduce latency and network load. Through this application, we demonstrate the feasibility of CBR application in the web-document retrieval context, exposing the vast possibility of using web-log Files that contain document retrieval experiences from millions of users. In this framework, a CBR system is embedded within an overall web-server application. A novelty of the work is that data mining and case-based reasoning are combined in a scanless manner, allowing cases to be mined efficiently. In addition we developed techniques to allow different case bases to be combined in order to yield a overall case base with higher quality than each individual ones. We validate our work through experiments using realistic, large-scale web logs.

It allows taking advantage of the growing availability of geographically referenced data and their potential richness. This includes the spatial analysis of risk such as epidemic risk or traffic accident risk in the road network. This work deals with the method of decision tree for spatial data classification. This method differs from conventional decision trees by taking account implicit spatial relationships in addition to other object attributes. Our approach consists in materializing those spatial relationships leading to treat them as normal attributes. Then, any conventional decision tree building method could be applied providing a spatial decision tree. Compared to existent approaches, this one is more flexible because no specific algorithm is imposed. Moreover, it considers the organization in several thematic layers that is characteristic of geographical data by distinguishing the intra theme and the inter theme relations (such as the road section contiguity or the proximity between road sections and schools). This method has been tested in the framework of traffic risk analysis.

The k-means-type algorithm is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large numerical and categorical data sets. An efficient parallel k-means-type algorithm for clustering data sets on a distributed share-nothing parallel system is considered. It has a simple communication scheme which performs only one round of information exchange in every iteration. We show that the speedup of our algorithm is asymptotically linear when the number of objects is sufficiently large. We implement the parallel k-means-type algorithm on an IBM SP2 parallel machine. The performance studies show that the algorithm has nice parallelism in experiments.

Our version can effectively handle high dimensional data, a high number of clusters and more importantly, a very large number of data records. We present three strategies to implement EM in SQL: horizontal, vertical and a hybrid one. We expect this work to be useful for data mining programmers and users who want to cluster large data sets inside a relational DBMS.

We show that such a scheme makes it possible to support a Data Mining workload on an OLTP system almost for free: there is only a small impact on the throughput and response time of the existing workload. Specifically, we show that an OLTP system has the disk resources to consistently provide one third of its sequential bandwidth to a background Data Mining task with close to zero impact on OLTP throughput and response time at high transaction loads. At low transaction loads, we show much lower impact than observed in previous work. This means that a production OLTP system can be used for Data Mining tasks without the expense of a second dedicated system. Our scheme takes advantage of close interaction with the on-disk scheduler by reading blocks for the Data Mining workload as the disk head "passes over" them while satisfying demand blocks from the OLTP request stream. We show that this scheme provides a consistent level of throughput for the background workload even at very high foreground loads. Such a scheme is of most:benefit in combination with an Active Disk environment that allows the background Data Mining application to also take advantage of the processing power and memory available directly on the disk drives.

Distributed clusters are enabling a new class of data mining applications in which large amounts of data can be transferred using high performance networks and statistically and numerically intensive computations can be done using clusters of workstations. In this paper, we briefly describe a protocol called the Data Space Transfer Protocol (DSTP) for distributed data mining. With high performance networks, it becomes possible to move large amounts of data for certain queries when necessary. This paper describes the design of a high performance DSTP data server called Osiris which is designed to efficiently satisfy data requests for distributed data mining queries. In particular,, we describe 1) Osiris's ability to lay out data by row or by column, 2) a. scheduler intended to handle requests using standard network links and requests using network links enjoying some type of premium service, and 3) a mechanism designed to hide latency.

This especially holds true for database systems. Spatial data and geographic information systems in particular require some means for managing uncertainty. Rough set theory has been shown to be an effective tool for data mining and for uncertainty management in databases. This paper addresses the particular needs for management of uncertainty in spatial data and GIS and discusses ways in which rough sets can be used to enhance these systems.

Although many or even all of the performed queries do not depend on each other, the algorithms process them in a sequential way. Recently, a novel technique for efficiently processing multiple similarity queries issued simultaneously has been introduced. It was shown that multiple similarity queries substantially speed-up query intensive data mining applications. For the important case of multiple k-nearest neighbor queries on top of a multidimensional index structure the problem of scheduling directory pages and data pages arises. This aspect has not been addressed so far. In this paper, we derive the theoretic foundation of this scheduling problem. Additionally, we propose several scheduling algorithms based on our theoretical results. In our experimental evaluation, we show that considering the maximum priority of pages clearly outperforms other scheduling approaches.

However, causal inference algorithms discover more concise relationships between variables, namely, relations of direct cause. These algorithms produce regressive structured equation models for continuous linear data and Bayes networks for discrete data. This work compares the effectiveness of causal inference algorithms with association rule induction for discovering patterns in discrete data.

Biology and informatics are likely to be the two most important sciences for the next century, and this interdisciplinary field between them will have a crucial role. Computational analyses of vast amounts of DNA sequence data are currently being used to find genes, and to predict the poles of the encoded proteins in cells. Currently successful data-mining approaches include the use of Hidden Markov Models and Neural Networks. We are utilising these methods to accurately predict genes and also to understand how proteins are made from these coded instructions.

ACCURACY 2000, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Spatial Accuracy Assessment in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences	JUL 12-14, 2000	AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS			sampling; spatial data mining; regression; kriging		To estimate spatial means of soil properties of a region from data collected by convenience or purposive sampling discussions on the validity of the results can be avoided by collecting additional data by probability sampling. The nonprobability and probability sample can be combined by interpolating the data at the nonprobability sample to the probability sample points, and to use these interpolated values as an auxiliary variable in the design-based regression estimator. The regression estimator is approximately unbiased even if the measurements at the nonprobability sample are severely biased. The gain in precision compared to the pi estimator that uses the probability sample only, depends on the correlation between the target variable and interpolated auxiliary variable at the probability sample points. This correlation on his turn is partly determined by the quality of the interpolation. Factors that govern this quality are the density of the nonprobability sample, its configuration and the interpolation method.

Combining data mining techniques with the Internet information resource, NetMiner aims to provide a powerful information mining engine. NetMiner can not only use keywords to retrieve information on the Internet in the same way as other search engines do, but is also capable of processing heterogeneous information retrieval requests, helping users extract high level information and making predictions on likely future outcome. The paper first discusses briefly some of the common information retrieval techniques currently used on the Internet. It then outlines our proposal for NetMiner for mining the Internet. An overall structure of NetMiner is described, together with discussion of various components of NetMiner and their interactions. The functionality of several key modules and some system issues are also highlighted.

Mining association rule and sequential patterns from Large Database has been recognized by many researchers in Database systems and many other related management areas recently. In this paper, the necessary of researching on data mining of supply chain is introduced first, then the four stages of the implementation of data mining are given. Nevertheless many previous works were focused on mining association rules in transaction database and sequential patterns at a single concept level, there exists many phenomenon of multiple level sequence patterns in practice. An effective multiple sequence patterns mining algorithm is raised in this paper. A case study is discussed lastly.

Intrusion Detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely "attack signatures", resulting in false alarms. We are using data mining techniques to identify sequences of alarms that likely result from normal behavior, enabling construction of filters to eliminate those alarms. This can be done at low cost for specific environments, enabling the construction of customized intrusion detection filters. We present our approach, and preliminary results identifying common sequences in alarms for a particular environment.

Various distance metrics for measuring the distances in the database multi-dimensional attribute space were reviewed in this context identifying their relationship to the type of the attributes, depending on whether thy are continuous valued, integer valued, or symbolic valued or a mix thereof. In this study, we explore the sensitivity of the bonding process to the metrics that are mostly suited to continuous valued attributes only, such as Euclidean, city-block, and chess board, using once again the previously used data set for illustrative purposes. This sensitivity to the metric employed is investigated at various stages of the RR bond delineation process. Results obtained under the different metrics are compared and fused to identify the degree of consensus that in turn can provide a measure of confidence in the results of the knowledge discovery process.

Decision trees and On-Line-Analytical-Processing (OLAP) were used to inspect the resulting clustering and look for correlations between deletion patterns, populations and the clinical picture of infertility. The results of the analysis indicate that there are correlations between deletion patterns and patient populations, as well as clinical phenotype severity.

The database describes 382 patients for which 177 markers were tested. Two data mining techniques, clustering and decision tree induction were used, as well as a heuristic set cover algorithm. Clustering was used to group markers according to their appearance across patients, while a heuristic set covering algorithm was used to select as small a set of markers that cover as many patients with deletions as possible. This algorithm created a diagnostic set of 13 markers that cover more than 90% of the patients with deletions. Finally, decision tree induction was used to relate deletion patterns to the severity of the clinical phenotype. A decision tree induced from the data uses 5 markers, ail of which are also in the diagnostic set of 13 markers, to show relations between the severity of the clinical phenotype and deletion patterns which have not been known previously.

Process control, statistical analysis, and design of experiments have established a solid base for a well tuned manufacturing process. However, the dynamic "next-tier" problems such as multi-factor & nonlinear interactions, intermittent problems, dynamically changing processes or installing new processes, multiple products and the sheer volume of data can all make quickly finding and resolving problems an overwhelming task. Data Mining technology applied to data analysis can increase product yield and quality to the nest higher level by quickly finding and solving these problems. Case studies of semiconductor wafer manufacturing problems are presented. A combination of self-organizing neural networks and rule induction is used to identify the critical poor yield factors from normally collected wafer manufacturing data. Subsequent controlled experiments and process changes confirmed the solutions. Wafer yield problems were solved 10x faster than standard approaches; yield increases ranged from 3% to 15%; endangered customer product deliveries were saved. This approach is flexible. easy to use, and can be appropriate far a number of complex manufacturing processes.

The case study involved, relates to an engineering component manufacturing company with a consortium of several plant outlets in various geographical locations world-wide. Currently, data, information and knowledge management, transparency and communication between plants within the scenario are limited. As a result, important information and best practices are not collectively pooled or conversed with the objective of improving information management and process development procedures on a global basis. This paper explores the possible enhancement of these consortium relationships and it also investigates the use of data mining techniques with the potential to advance information management and process improvement within the manufacturing environment concerned.

S	Greenyer, A		Ebecken, N; Brebbia, CA		Greenyer, A			The use of learning classifier systems in the direct marketing industry	DATA MINING II	MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Data Mining	JUL 05-07, 2000	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Wessex Inst Technol, Fed Univ Rio De Janiero, COPPE Ctr	CAMBRIDGE UNIV			It is now widely accepted that large companies need to be able to emulate the old fashion corner shop: where the shop keeper knew all his customers by name, what they liked, what they disliked and was able to recommend certain products based on his knowledge. Companies know have large data warehouses containing the transactional and demographic information relating to each of their customers that when analysed correctly allow them to make the same decisions that the shop keeper used to make, but on a larger scale. Traditionally direct marketing companies have used statistical techniques such as linear regression, decision trees such as CHAID and cart, through to neural networks to predict which customers are likely to respond or purchase a particular product. This paper is designed to introduce a new analysis technique in the field of data mining to be used in the direct marketing arena. The system has been developed jointly by University of the West of England and The Database Group, under a project funded by the UK Department of Trade. The system is based on a form of learning classifier system, known as XCS [1]. The system is designed to produce rule based criteria for identify best prospects for marketing activity. Using reinforcement learning with genetic algorithms together with an accuracy based fitness function allows the system to produce rules, which are accurate, measurable in frequency of occurrence and easy to interpret and apply. New research techniques are usually designed and tested using artificial academic data sets. However the tool developed using XCS has been designed with database marketing information, using real customer data, the results of which will be used to illustrate the use of the system, and allow for easy comparisons to be made to traditional statistical techniques.

This includes the use of unsupervised neural networks for the detection of the most significant temporal patterns in multivariate time series, as well as the use of Machine Learning-algorithms for the generation of a rule-based description of primitive patterns. The main idea lies in introducing several abstraction levels for the pattern discovery process. The results of the previous step then are used to induce temporal grammatical rules at different abstraction levels. This approach was successfully applied to a problem in medicine, called sleep apnea.

The process of interactive visual discovery consists of six steps: preparing the raw data, visualizing the original data, cleaning the data, discretizing numerical attributes, and discovering and visualizing association rules. The basic framework of the AViz system is presented and three approaches to discretize numerical attributes, including equal-sized, bin-packing based equal-depth, and interaction-based approaches, are proposed and implemented. The algorithm for discovering and visualizing numerical association rules is discussed and analyzed. The AViz system has been experimented on a census data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the AViz system is useful and helpful for discovering and visualizing numerical association rules.

We are applying similarity measures to cardiac images pre-registered with a template. Our database is composed of 1430 patient cases with associated clinical information. For each new case, we sort all the patients of the database from most to less similar ones and compute a severity criterion, based on a statistical analysis of normal and diseased most similar patients. By varying a threshold on the severity criterion and testing the classification of controlled cases, we have measured the operational characteristic of this test (ROC curves), and shown increased performance in sensitivity and specificity for disease detection with respect to clinicians and to experts in consensus.

In the Internet-based system, how to search the desired information in a short time is very important for the agent, search engine, and data mining systems. Thus, we try to design an intelligent system with the characteristics of low complexity, quick convergence, and low output error for both the academy and industry. Ln this paper, we will use grey relational analysis to select more important input variables to establish a simplified fuzzy model. Then, we exploit the concepts of extension theory to adjust the fuzzy model during the parameter identification to expedite the tuning process. Finally, the proposed extension-based fuzzy model is applied to implementing an intelligent information retrieval system for the search engine to stress the model's applicability.

Subsequence similarity matching has been an active research area driven by the need to analyse large data sets in the financial, biomedical and scientific databases. In thus paper, we investigate an intelligent subsequence similarity matching of time series queries based on efficient graph traversal. We introduce a new problem, the approximate partial matching of a query sequence in a time series database. Our system can address such queries with high specificity and minimal time and space overhead. The performance bottleneck of the current methods were analysed and we show our method can improve the performance of the time series queries significantly. It is general and flexible enough to find the best approximate match query without specifying a tolerance epsilon parameter.

We examine knowledge discovery in databases combined with individual-oriented modeling and simulation to support the detection of hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships within environmental systems. An individual-oriented model and detected hypotheses can uncover possible explanations for the current state of health of a study population. Such a model can support future planning and decision making for healthcare management. The main goal of attempting to use these methods in epidemiological research is to reduce expenditures in costs and time for a study as well as to improve the analysis and interpretation of available data.

Schema Mining: Finding Structural Regularity among Semistructured Data	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								Motivated by decision support problems, data mining has been extensively addressed in the few past years. Nevertheless, the proposed approaches mainly concern flat representation of the data and to the best of our knowledge, not much effort has been spent on mining interesting patterns from such structures. In this paper we address the problem of mining structural association of semistructured data, or in other words the discovery of structural regularities among a large data-base of semistructured objects. This problem is much more complicated than the classical association rule one, since complex structures in the form of a labeled hirearchical objects partially ordered has to be taken into account.

In practical applications the preprocessing task is very time consuming and has;in important influence on the quality of the generated models. In this paper we describe a new approach for data preprocessing. Combining database technology with classical data mining systems using an OLAP engine as interface we outline an architecture for OLAP-based preprocessing that enables interactive and iterative processing of data. This high level of interaction between human and database system enables efficient understanding and preparing of data for building scalable data mining applications. Our case study taken from the data-intensive telecommunication domain applies the proposed methodology for deriving user communication profiles. These user profiles are given as input to data mining algorithms for clustering customers with similar behavior.

Recently, many interesting works have been published in the Web Usage Mining context. Nevertheless, the large amount of input data poses a maintenance problem. In fact, maintaining global patterns is a non-trivial task after access log file update because new data may invalidate old client behavior and creates new ones.

A difficulty is that ways for discouvery are often drawn from methods whose amount of work increase geometrically with darn quantity. Consequentially, the use of these methods is problematic in very large data bases. Categorically based association rules are a linearly complex data mining methodology. Unfotunately, rules formed from categorical data often gneerate many fine grained rules. The concern is how might fine grained rules be aggregated and the role that non-categorical data might have. It appears that soft computing techniques may be useful.

In this case, models of normal traffic have to be determined and compared against the current network traffic. Data mining systems based on Genetic Algorithms can contribute powerful search techniques for the acquisition of patterns of the network traffic from the large amount of data made available by audit tools. We compare models of network traffic acquired by a system based on a distributed genetic algorithm with the ones acquired by a system based on greedy heuristics.

These techniques are often called Data Mining' and have met with varying degrees of success. An alternative approach to automatic pattern detection is to keep the user in the 'exploration loop'. A domain expert is often better able to search data for relationships. Furthermore, it is now possible to construct user interfaces that provide multi-sensory interactions. For example, interfaces can be designed which utilise 3D visual spaces and also provide auditory and haptic feedback. These multi-sensory interfaces may assist in the interpretation of abstract information spaces by providing models that map different attributes of data to different senses. While this approach has the potential to assist in exploring these large information spaces what is unclear is how to choose the best models to define mappings between the abstract information and the human sensory channels. This paper describes some simple guidelines based on real world analogies for designing these models. These principles are applied to the problem of finding new patterns in stock market data.

Default parameters of TCP retransmission mechanism cannot provide good performance for data mining application, since a lot of collisions occur in the case of all-to-all multicasting in the large scale PC cluster. Using a TCP retransmission parameters according to the proposed parameter optimization, reasonably good performance improvement is achieved for parallel data mining on 100 PCs. Association rule mining, one of the best-known problems in data mining, differs from conventional scientific calculations in its usage of main memory. We have investigated the feasibility of using available memory on remote nodes as a swap area when working nodes need to swap out their real memory contents. According to the experimental results on our PC cluster, the proposed method is experted to be considerably better than using hard disks as a swapping device.

In this paper, given a data set (TF) of a phenomenon, where T subset of or equal to {0,1}(n) denotes a set of positive examples and F subset of or equal to {0,01}(n) denotes a set of negative examples, we propose a method to identify decomposable structures among the attributes of the data. Such information will reveal hierarchical structure of the phenomenon under consideration. We first study computational complexity of the problem of finding decomposable Boolean extensions. Since the problem turns out to be intractable (i.e., N-R-complete), we propose a heuristic: algorithm in the second half of the paper. Our method searches a decomposable partition of the set of all attributes, by using the error sizes of almost-fit decomposable extensions as a guiding measure, and then finds, structural relations among the attributes in the obtained partition. The results of numerical experiment on synthetically generated data sets axe also reported.

The method we have earlier proposed to find outstanding associations is to compare estimated frequencies of combinations of variables with the frequencies that would be predicted assuming there were no dependencies. The method we now propose use the same strategy as an efficient way of finding complex dependencies, i.e. certain combinations of explanatory variables, mainly medical drugs, which may be highly associated with certain outcome events or combinations of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Such combinations of ADRs may also be recognized as syndromes. The method we use for data mining is an artificial neural network architecture denoted Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). To decide whether the joint probabilities of events are different from what would follow from the independence assumption, the "information component" log(P-ij/(PiPj)), which is a weight in the BCPNN, and its variance plays a crucial role. We also suggest how this method might be used in combination with stochastic EM to analyse conditioned dependencies also between real valued variables, e.g. to consider the amount of each drug taken.

In our previous study, we proposed parallel algorithms and candidate duplication based load balancing strategies for mining generalized association rules and showed our algorithms could attain good performance on 16 nodes parallel computer system. However, as the number of nodes increase, it would be difficult to achieve flat workload distribution. In this paper, we present the candidate partition based load balancing strategy for parallel algorithm of generalized association rule mining. This strategy partitions the candidate itemsets so that the number of candidate probes for each node is equalized each other with estimated support count by the information of previous pass. Moreover, we implement the parallel algorithms and load balancing strategies for mining generalized association rules on a cluster of 100 PCs interconnected with an ATM network, and analyze the performance using a large amount of transaction dataset. Through the several experiments, we showed the load balancing strategy, which partition the candidate itemsets with considering the distribution of candidate probes and duplicate the frequently occurring candidate itemsets, can attain high performance and achieve good workload distribution on one hundred PC cluster system.

Data mining research is being fueled by novel application areas that are helping the development of newer applied algorithms in the field of bioinformatics, an emerging discipline representing the integration of biological and information sciences. This is a shift in paradigm from the earlier and the continuing data mining efforts in marketing research and support for business intelligence. The problem described in this paper is along a ne ni dimension in DNA sequence analysis research and supplements the previously studied stochastic models for evolution and variability. The discovery of novel patterns from genetic databases as described is quite significant because biological patterns play an important role in a large variety of cellular processes and constitute the basis for gene therapy. Biological databases containing the genetic codes from a wide variety of organisms, including humans, have continued their exponential growth over the last decade. At the time of this writing, the GenBank database contains over 300 million sequences and over 2.5 billion characters of sequenced nucleotides. The focus of this paper is on developing a general data mining algorithm for discovering regions of locus control, i.e. those regions that are instrumental for determining cell type. One such type of element of locus control are the MARs or the Matrix Association Regions. Our limited knowledge about MARs has hampered their detection using classical pattern recognition techniques. Consequently, their detection is formulated by utilizing a statistical interestingness measure derived from a set of empirical features that are known to be associated with MARs. This paper presents a systematic approach for finding associations between such empirical features in genomic sequences, and for utilizing this knowledge to detect biologically interesting control signals, such as MARs. This computational MAR discovery tool is implemented as a web-based software called MAR-Wiz and is available for public access. As our knowledge about the living system continues to evolve, and as the biological databases continue to grow, a pattern learning methodology similar to that described in this paper will be significant for the detection of regulatory signals embedded in genomic sequences.

We show that deductive inferences about the salient data features in a knowledge base can be represented by a set of logical equations. We describe how logical equations with finite predicates can be successfully used for the description of logical links between discrete features, and how this can be applied to pattem recognition and data mining. New knowledge about logical links between discrete features in the data can be obtained by eliminating variables from these equations with the help of the operation There Exists, and we describe this process in detail. We consider the application of the operation There Exists to a logical equation as an analogue to a query in a database. The process results in a dependence between the features subsequent to application of the elimination procedure that is easier to interpret than the dependence represented in the original equations, and is obtained without the need for exhaustive searching. We recursively define a class of finite predicates that allow eliminating variables without increasing the size of the original equation, and show how this can be applied for knowledge discovery using logical data modelling.

No automatic method for data mining is used. Instead, InfoZoom enables the user to interactively explore different visualisations of the data. In this way, the user gets a feeling of the data, detects interesting knowledge, and gains a deep understanding of the data set. InfoZoom displays database relations in tables with attributes as rows and objects as columns. In our example, each column corresponds to the participation of a driver in a certain race. The table has about 8000 columns. The attributes include the name of the driver, his team, the date and location of the race, and the starting and final position. InfoZoom compresses this table by reducing the column width until all the 8000 columns fit on the screen. The column width is then about 0.1 pixels. Special techniques are used to make such highly compressed tables readable. The most important is that neighbouring cells with identical values are combined into one larger cell. The width of each cell indicates the number of subsequent objects with this value. If a cell is to small to display a numeric value, a short horizontal line still indicates its relative height. In this way the value distribution of each attribute can be seen at a glance. Correlations can be found by subsequent sorts by different attributes and by animated zooms into interesting areas of the table. Like the formula-cells in a spreadsheet program, derived summary attributes (like average, maximum etc.) can be defined which are automatically updated by InfoZoom when necessary. InfoZoom was initially developed at GMD and is now extended and marketed by the spin-off company humanIT.

Our entire existence is a process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amount of data, Pattern classification is a key element in arriving at the solution. Engineering applications like SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making respectively. Although modern technologies enable storage of large streams of data, we do not yet have a technology to help us to understand, analyze, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data Mining is now the emerging field attracting all research communities, Pattern classification is one particular category of Data Mining, which enables the Discovery of Knowledge from Very Large Databases (VLDB). In this paper. mining the database through pattern classification has been done by utilizing two important mining tools called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Fuzzy logic concepts are applied to improve decision-making capability of the network. Genetic Algorithm is used for optimizing different parameters controlling the network in the training stage and reducing the total number of rules generated through the rule generation algorithm. The Artificial Neural Network used is a Fuzzy Multilayer Perceptron (FMLP) with Backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network. The concept of Knowledge encoding incorporated in the FMLP helps the network converge to the target quickly and thus reducing the search space. Knowledge based Fuzzy Multilayer Perceptron [FMLP], using fuzzy mean square error function has been proposed for Data Mining applications. The knowledge encoded network is trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The network size is optimized to have a minimal number of links through pruning procedure. Rules are generated from the refined network using the input, output membership values and connection weights. Each rule has an antecedent and consequent part defining the attributes and the confidence value.

Local regression modeling is known for its ability to accurately approximate quite diverse regression surfaces with high accuracy. However, theses methods are also known for being computationally demanding and for not providing any comprehensible model of the data. These two characteristics can be regarded as major drawbacks in the context of a typical data, mining scenario. The method we describe tackles these problems by integrating local regression within a partition-based induction method.

However, most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist in the real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper, we will look at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem the COE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithm called COE-CLARANS to solve it.

To information retrieval purposes there exist methods. They are mainly based on keywords. In cases where keywords are lacking the information retrieval is problematic. One approach is to use the whole text document as a search key. Neural networks offer an adaptive tool for this purpose. This paper suggests a new adaptive approach to the problem of clustering and search in large text document databases. The approach is a multilevel one based on word, sentence, and paragraph level maps. Here only the word map level is reported. The reported approach is based on smart encoding, on Self-Organizing Maps, and on document histograms. The results are very promising.

The main goal is to combine innovative techniques and associated tools for exploring very large environmental data sets in order to arrive at valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable spatio-temporal patterns. The GeoInsight approach is described using the principles and key developments in the research domains of KDD, GVis, and STDB. The GeoInsight approach aims at the integration of these research domains in order to provide tools for performing information retrieval, exploration, analysis, and visualisation. The result is a knowledge-based design, which involves visual thinking (perceptual-cognitive process) and automated information processing (computer-analytical process).

A number of algorithms for mining functional dependencies from crisp relational data model have been proposed recently. The concept of functional dependency is based on the assumption that data are either fully dependent or fully independent. However, this assumption is too restrictive for real-world application. Our paper thus proposes a method to extract fuzzy functional dependencies from quantitative data. The dependencies discovered contain not only the conventional functional dependencies but also semantic dependencies between attributes. The discovered dependencies can be used in the reconstruction of conceptual structure of relations and applied further to the integration of knowledge bases and databases as well as reverse engineering.

This method generates compact Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) rules. Each class has an equal number of unweighted rules. A new example is classified by applying all rules and assigning the example to the class with the most satisfied rules. Disjuncts in rules are naturally overlapping. When combined with voted solutions, the inherent redundancy is enhanced. We provide experimental evidence that this transparent approach to classification can yield strong results for data mining with missing values.

The data-mining step in the knowledge discovery process that involves unsupervised teaming (clustering) consumes the bulk of the computation. We have developed a technique that allows us to partition the data, distribute it to different processors for training, and train a single system to join the results of the independent categorizers. We report prelininary results using this approach for knowledge discovery with large acoustic images having more than 10,000 training instances.

We discuss requirements and phases of development of the system, we present the structure of the system, the experiences with end users and obstacles that we met, as well as possible improvements end extensions of the system. The system is designed as a framework that works with workload measurement sub-systems, which are defined as multidimensional arrays, and are observed through different units of time. Each of the axis has several hierarchical structures build on top of it. Setting up the system is a difficult task, because it requires a good knowledge of organisational structure of a particular hospital. We used an incremental approach in defining the organisational structure. On top of the framework we build a user customisable graphical user interface, which enables different types of end users to efficiently use the system.

The project provides a single focus for almost all of the faculty members and their graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University, the women's university with the longest history and tradition of excellence in Korea. We envision knowledge engineering (KE) as the new dimension being added to information technology (IT) infrastructure, on which the daily business of corporations, government agencies, and educational institutes depends in today's client/server, Internet era. The primary components of KE technology include relational database systems, data warehousing systems, decision support, and multidimensional data analysis systems, data mining and knowledge discovery systems, Internet XML/HTML document content search mechanisms, and industry-specific applications of data analysis and data mining systems. The objectives of the IKEA project are to address various major open research subjects in each of these areas and to put together a Knowledge Engineering Architecture platform using component-based software development:technology. We envision the knowledge engineering architecture to be used in supporting "knowledge" applications such as database marketing, fraud detection, personalized electronic commerce, customer relationship management, etc. The IKEA project requires participation from at least six major subdisciplines, including databases, knowledge discovery and reasoning (statistics and artificial Intelligence), visualization and human-computer interlace, parallel processing, networking and distributed systems, and software engineering.

J	Gelmi, V				Gelmi, V			Preventive maintenance: Using data mining systems	BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING			English	Article								The collection of alarms from a network is beneficial when a failure in. the system is permanent and if is therefore possible to identify the failure itself However, often temporary failures are reported by the alarms, but the network soon comes back to working conditions. These chronic failures can be understood only by analysing possible correlation with other events, on the basis of synchronicity logical sequence, etc. It is impossible to define a priori how to search properly for this correlation, but an artificial intelligence system can be used methodically to help the operator This paper describes how an intelligent data mining system can be designed and ifs main features. As many systems control different elements of the network and different databases can hold part of the overall information needed to identify the correlation, the intelligent data mining system must be equipped to interact with these external systems. To optimise the process (permitting parallel activities on different platforms) this interaction is carried out by mobile agents that are sent to the different systems, locally collect and elaborate the necessary information and come back to the intelligent data mining system bringing the required results.

Each server is coupled with an object-oriented database and a computational engine such as a network of high-performance workstations. The database provides persistent storage and supports querying of the "mined" information. The computational engine provides parallel execution of expensive image processing, object recognition,and query-by-content operations. Key benefits of the Diamond Eye architecture are: (1) the design promotes trial evaluation of advanced data mining and machine learning techniques by potential new users (all that is required is to point a web browser to the appropriate URL), (2) software infrastructure that is common across a range of science mining applications is factored out and reused, and (3) the system facilitates closer collaborations between algorithm developers and domain experts.

The genetic engine is modified through the addition of several methods tuned specifically for the task of association rule discovery. A set of genetic operators and techniques are employed to efficiently search the space of potential rules. During this process, RAGA evolves a default hierarchy of rules, where the emphasis is placed on the group rather than each individual rule. Rule sets of this type are kept simple in both individual rule complexity and the total number of rules that are required. In addition, the default hierarchy deals with the problem of over-fitting, particularly in classification tasks. Several data mining experiments using RAGA are described.

Being able to express these data mining queries concisely is of major importance not only from the user's, but also from the system's point of view. Recent research in OLAP has focused on datacubes and their applications; however expression and processing of ad hoc decision support queries has been given very little attention. In this paper we present an appropriate framework for these queries and introduce a syntactic construct to support it. This SQL extension allows most OLAP queries, such as pivoting, complex intra- and inter-group comparisons, trends and hierarchical comparisons, to be expressed in a compact, intuitive and simple manner This succinct representation of a complex OLAP query translates immediately to a novel, simple and efficient evaluation algorithm. We show how to optimize, analyze and parallelize this algorithm and discuss issues such as multiple query analysis and scaling. We present several experimental results of real-life queries that show orders of magnitude of performance improvement. We argue that this tight coupling between representation and algorithm is essential to efficient processing of ad hoc OLAP queries.

However, due to the formidable problem size, existing techniques for finding common substructures are computationally feasible only under certain artificially imposed constraints, such as using super-secondary structures and fixed-length segmentation. This paper presents the first, pure tertiary-level algorithm that discovers the common protein substructures without such limitations. Modeling this as a maximal common subgraph (MCS) problem, the solution is found by further mapping into the domain of maximum clique (MC). Coupling a MC solver with a graph coloring (GC) solver, the iterative algorithm, CRP-GM, is developed to narrow down towards the desired solution by feeding results from one solver into the other. The solution quality of CRF-GM amply demonstrates its potential as a new and practical data-mining tool for molecular biologists, as well as several other similar problems requiring identification of common substructures.

The integration of such 'islands of information', which ultimately forms the basis of so-called 'virtual enterprises', is heavily dependent on the flexibility and accessibility of the data model describing the enterprise's repository. The model must provide interoperability and reusability so that a range of applications can access the enterprise data. Making the repository self-describing ensures that knowledge about the repository structure is available for applications to interrogate and to navigate around for the extraction of application-specific data. Herein a large application is described which uses a meta-object based repository to capture product and workflow data in an engineering data warehouse. It is shown that adopting a meta-object approach to repository design provides support for interoperability and a suitable environment on which to build data mining applications.

J	Galal, GM; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB				Galal, GM; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB			Exploiting parallelism in a structural scientific discovery system to improve scalability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								The large amount of data collected today is quickly overwhelming researchers' abilities to interpret the data and discover interesting patterns. Knowledge discovery and data mining approaches hold the potential to automate the interpretation process, but these approaches frequently utilize computationally expensive algorithms. In particular, scientific discovery systems focus on the utilization of richer data representation, sometimes without regard for scalability. This research investigates approaches for scaling a particular knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) system, SUBDUE, using parallel and distributed resources. SUBDUE has been used to discover interesting and repetitive concepts in graph-based databases from a variety of domains, but requires a substantial amount of processing time. Experiments that demonstrate scalability of parallel versions of the SUBDUE system are performed using CAD circuit databases and artificially-generated databases, and potential achievements and obstacles are discussed.

We address this problem by using the processing power of workstation clusters and have studied the performance of CLAP queries as a first step towards a portable data mining platform. The results of our study suggest that with the availability of parallel workstation clusters that are equipped with high performance communication networks, fine-grained and communication-intensive parallelizations of queries are promising - even though they are considered too costly in traditional database systems. The paper describes our Java framework for parallel OLAP-type query execution, necessary optimizations to the standard Java implementation, and analyzes the performance of non-standard parallel execution schemes on a workstation cluster.

If ina certain problem, numerical data is the only source of available knowledge, then it is obvious that inductive techniques seem to be the method of choice. Recently data mining has received much attention to extract hidden knowledge from very large databases and is therefore in this framework considered to be an inductive approach. Deductive methods in contrary rely on a rigorous application and the explicit knowledge of the underlying domain using first principles to establish a mathematical model of the problem typically yielding governing equations. The paper focuses on the establishment of an intermediate knowledge representation level inbetween both the inductive and the deductive knowledge identification techniques. This intermediate knowledge representation level is based on the notion of group transforms and can be shown to be a mathematically necessary condition in the existence of any correct model representation. The synergy effect of using group transforms in both the inductive data mining and the deductive similarity theory approach can be demonstrated to be conceptually advantageous and is observed to be numerically superior to conventional techniques. The limitations and underlying assumptions of the approach are identified and discussed using an example.

The goal is to analyse warranty claims in the automobile sector. Basically we want to support the technical engineers concerned with warranty issues in two ways: First of all we want to guide them during verification of their hypothesis and additionally Ne want to strengthen their creative and inspirational potentials. For this purpose we accessed the Quality Information System (QUIS) of DaimlerChrysler. The whole project was carried through according to the CRISP-DM data mining process. The methods from Data Mining that we applied were: baysian nets, boolean association rules, generalised association rules, quantitative association rules and sequential patterns. We present some of the data mining results exemplarily, discuss the difficulties we encountered and finally give a short conclusion.

However, the tendency to turn data into information - met currently in large corporations - has forced the application of this technology in various branches of business, mainly for banking and finance, retail and marketing, telecommunication, and healthcare. In this paper, central issues to data mining and knowledge discovery will be briefly presented and discussed, giving an insight into recent progress in DM&KD. Giving the necessary background for three fundamental approaches (classification studies, clustering studies, and visualization studies). some general features of the data mining process and its basic steps will be dealt with, assigning particular attention to the problem of data visualization.

Tape libraries are suitable devices for storing such mass data. The online analytical processing (OLAP) of this data typically leads to long-running aggregation queries joining the tape-resident facts relation with disk-resident dimension relations. Typically, during the execution of the join, the disks storing the dimension relations are not dedicated to the join. They are subject of reads and writes invoked by concurrently running applications In many cases, it is desirable that the performance of these concurrent applications must not be degraded too much by the processing of the join. In this paper we present an accurate model for analyzing the performance of three different tape-disk join strategies in multi-query systems like database or OLAP servers. The major contributions of this paper are (a) a derailed cost model considering rape and disk bandwidth, tape and disk latencies, available buffer sizes, CPU costs, and the selectivity of filters on tape data, (b) the consideration of disk queueing effects due to concurrent reads and writes at the disk, and (c) the consideration of two different disk scheduling strategies. Based on the analytical model, we show the superiority of a disk scheduling strategy giving preference to the service of the concurrent disk load. Furthermore, we present a strategy for dynamically selecting the most beneficial join algorithm and its parameters at runtime. We have implemented the tape-disk join strategies in a prototype system based on detailed simulations of secondary and tertiary storage devices. Our experimental evaluations confirm that the analytical model is indeed very accurate and a suitable basis for run-time strategy decisions.

The hierarchy is well designed so as to exclude meaningless rules from a particular point of view. However, there may exist several ways of generalizing databases according to user's intention. It is therefore important to provide a multi-layered abstraction hierarchy under which several generalizations are possible and are well controlled. In fact, too-general or too-specific databases are inappropriate for mining algorithms to extract significant rules. From this viewpoint, this paper proposes a generalization method based on an information theoretical measure to select an appropriate abstraction hierarchy. Furthermore, we present a system, called ITA (Information Theoretical Abstraction), based on our method and an attribute-oriented induction. We perform some practical experiments in which ITA discovers meaningful rules from a census database US Census Bureau and discuss the validity of ITA based on the experimental results.

We propose a keyword selection method that can be used for obtaining characterizations of clusters of data whenever textual descriptions can be associated with the data. Several methods that cluster data sets or form projections of data provide an order or distance measure of the clusters. If such an ordering of the clusters exists or can be deduced, the method utilizes the order to improve the characterizations. The proposed method may be applied, for example, to characterizing graphical displays of collections of data ordered e.g. with the SOM algorithm. The method is validated using a collection of 10,000 scientific abstracts from the INSPEC database organized on a WEBSOM document map.

Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert security knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and require a large amount of programming and debugging. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models specifically for use with Network Flight Recorder (NFR). The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. Detection models are then incorporated into NFR through a machine translator, which produces a working detection model in the form of N-Code, NFR's powerful filtering language.

Typical solutions involve partitioning each numerical attribute into a set of disjoint intervals, interpreting each interval as an item, and applying standard boolean association rule mining. Commonly used partitioning methods construct set of intervals that either have equal width or equal cardinality. We introduce an adaptive partitioning method based on repeatedly merging smaller intervals into larger ones. this method provides an effective compromise between the equal width and equal cardinality criteria. Experimental results show that the proposed method is an effective method and improves on both equal-width partitioning and equal-cardinality partitioning.

The model is based on the evolution of association rules of the IF-THEN type, which provide a high level of accuracy and coverage. The modeling of the Genetic Algorithm consists of the definition of chromosomes representation, the evaluation function, and the genetic operators. The Rule-Evolver is a tool that provides an environment for the evaluation of the genetic model and implements the interface with DBs. The case studies evaluate the performance of the model in several benchmark DBs. The results obtained are compared with those of other models, such as Artificial Neural Nets, Neuro-Fuzzy Systems and Statistical Models.

A system, Cyclone. which efficiently supports financial applications, is developed under the OPICS. We then introduce a data mining solution for equity portfolio construction using the simulated annealing algorithm. Two data sets consist of small stocks ranging from 11/86 to 10/91 and from 6/93 to 5/96 are used. The corresponding rates of return of Russell 2000 index are collected as benchmarks for evaluation based on the Sharpe ratios and the turnover ratios. The result shows that the simulated annealing algorithm outperforms both the market index and the gradient maximization method.

In this paper, we argue the case for using neural networks as a viable data mining tool that can provide statistical insights and models from large data-sets. We demonstrate how Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps, an unsupervised learning neural network paradigm, can be efficaciously used for data mining purposes, in particular for data clustering applications. We show that high-dimensional data can be projected to a lower dimension and that data can be clustered together whilst preserving essential information. The Kohonen Map based data-clustering technique is applied to the 1991 World Bank social economics indicators, to show how multi-dimensional data sets can be reduced to two-dimensional (feature) maps, manifesting clusters of similar data items.

We compare ARMA- and Vector-Autoregressive (VAR-) models by examining their abilities to predict turning points in monthly time series. An approach proposed by Wecker[1] and enhanced by Kling[2] forms the basis to explicitly incorporate uncertainty in the forecasts by producing probabilistic statements for turning points. To allow for possible structural change within the time period under investigation, we conduct Data Mining by using rolling regressions over a fix-sized window. For each datapoint a multitude of models is estimated. The models are evaluated by an economic performance criterion, the Sharpe-Ratio, and a testing procedure for its statistical significance developed by Jobson/Korkie[3]. We find that ARMA-models seem to be valuable forecasting tools for predicting turning points, whereas the performance of the VAR-models is disappointing.

As the true data generating process (DGP) in general is unknown, so is the model that mimics the DGP, In order to find the model which fits the data best, we conduct data mining by estimating a multitude of models and selecting the best one optimizing a well-defined model selection criterion. In the focus of interest are two simple in-sample criteria (AIC, SIC) and a more complicated out-of-sample model selection procedure. We apply Analysis of Variance to assess which selection criterion produces the best forecasts. Our results indicate that there are no differences in the predictive quality when alternative model selection criteria are used.

An integration technique should estimate and then select the most appropriate component classifiers from an ensemble of classifiers. We discuss an advanced dynamic integration technique with multiple classifiers as one variation of the stacked generalization method based on the assumption that each component classifier is the best inside some sub areas of the application domain. In the learning phase a performance matrix of each component classifier is derived and it is then used during the application phase to estimate the performance of each component classifier with new instances.

Available manpower and skills must be deployed as effectively as possible, while being flexible enough to cope with the unexpected. This paper shows how high end PC technology in data-mining and simulation, as opposed to super-computing techniques, were applied to staff-scheduling in a large commercial organisation, where randomly fluctuating demand and a requirement for a simple, fixed schedule meant that optimisation techniques were not the most appropriate approach to the problem.

Rule discovery, in spite of its usefulness as a fundamental data-mining technique, outputs a huge number of rules. Since usefulness of a discovered rule is judged by human inspection, augmenting the readability of a discovered rule set is an important issue. We formalize this problem as a transformation of a rule set into a tree structure called a vidual graph. A novel information-based criterion which represents compressed entropy of a data set per description length of the graph is employed in order to evaluate the readability quantitatively. Experiments with an agricultural data set in cooperation with domain experts confirmed the effectiveness of our method in terms of readability and validness.

Discovering new patterns or assuring behaviour that has been observed over the years is a central information for a company or an organisation. This is especially true for the field of tourism, where great volumes of data are collected, but not often analysed in depth. The paper presents an application of several techniques used in the field of Data Mining on the "Tux-database" of the tourism resort Tux in Tyrol, Austria. This database is based on the entities of the registration sheets in this tourism resort. Times series models of seasonal decomposition as well as simple descriptive procedures were used to detect primary pattern. In a second step explorative multivariate statistical techniques such as clustering, log-linear models and decision trees were applied to underline the primary results and to discover new ones.

Call tracking data is becoming a target of data mining for telecommunication carriers. Conventional data-mining programs control the number of association rules found with two types of thresholds (minimum confidence and minimum support), however, often they generate too many association rules because of the wide variety of patterns found in call tracking data. This paper proposes a new method to reduce the number of generated rules. The method proposed tests each generated rule based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) without using conventional thresholds. Experiments with artificial call tracking data show the high performance of the proposed method.

J	Williams, R; Sears, B				Williams, R; Sears, B			A high-performance active digital library	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						digital library; MPI; parallel computing; data computing; user interface; Java		We describe Javaflow and Paraflow, the client and server parts of a digital library, providing high-performance data-retrieval and data-mining services, with emphasis on user interface as well as computing efficiency. Paraflow is a component model for high-performance computing, implemented as a thin layer on Message Passing Interface (MPI); it controls a heterogeneous metacomputer, allowing groups of processes (services) to work collectively and communicate with each other by parallel messaging links (channels). Javaflow is a straightforward, intuitive, loosely coupled component model for Java applets, allowing them to be combined into a GUI that can run on a thin client from a standing start. Javaflow controls Paraflow through a well-exposed text interface which is carried by authenticated telnet, while the output of the computation can be web-pages, files, or high-speed graphics. As an example, we discuss the SARA remote-sensing library, which provides public retrieval of multichannel images of the Earth, as well as private, authenticated access to a variety of image-processing services running on parallel supercomputers.

Faced with the pressures of a still-restructuring business environment, even the executives who had initiated the effort failed to probe its value. They abandoned their commitment to prospecting and then the whole of the mining effort, despite its payback and promise. This article analyzes the project's failures and successes, offering guidelines that could make a difference in similar situations.

J	Zucker, JD; Ganascia, JG; Bournaud, I				Zucker, JD; Ganascia, JG; Bournaud, I			Relational knowledge discovery in a Chinese character database	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								This article describes a novel application of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to the problem of data mining relational databases. The task addressed here consists in mining a relational database of more than 200,000 ground facts describing 6768 Chinese characters. Mining this relational database may be recast in an ILP setting, where the form of the association rules searched are represented as nondeterminate Horn clauses, a type of clause known for being computationally hard to learn. We have introduced a new kind of language bins, S-structural indeterminate clauses, which takes into account the meaning of part-of predicates that play a keg, role in the complexity of learning in structural domains. The ILP algorithm REPART has been specifically developed to learn S-structural indeterminate clauses. Its efficiency lies in a particular change of representation, so as to enable one to use propositional learners. This article presents original results discover ed by REPART that exemplify how ILP algorithms may not only scale up efficiently to large relational databases but also discover useful and computationally hard to learn patterns.

This work is motivated by the obvious limitations of paradigms for Data Mining that are being used in isolation. We present a classification of hybrid systems based on the level of interaction between the component paradigms and present example objectives for the development of such systems. We highlight possible hybrid solutions by discussing various hybrid systems that may be developed to enhance the Nearest Neighbour algorithm. These include statistical measures to enhance distance measures, a loose coupling with Neural Networks or alternatively a tight coupling with genetic algorithms, to discover attribute weights. We also establish enhancements to the k-NN that make it appropriate for use as a paradigm for addressing regression data mining goals. We provide results obtained using these systems, comparing them with more traditional paradigms used to solve regression goals within Data Mining.

We show that our ideas can be useful for Knowledge Discovery by introducing a derivation of the Naive-Bayes classifier based on them: the Qualitative Bayes Classifier. This classification method keeps Naive-Bayes accuracy while gaining interpretability, so we think it can be useful for the Data Mining step of the Knowledge Discovery process.

Hence, we use NDs to "mine" a relation to see how well a given FD set is approximated. We motivate NDs by examining their use with indefinite information in relations. The family of all possible ND sets which may approximate an FD set forms a complete lattice. Using this, a proximity metric is presented and used to assess the distance of each resulting ND set to a given FD set. Searching for a definite relation extracted from an indefinite relation which satisfies a given set of FDs, known as the consistency problem, has been shown to be NP-complete. We propose a novel application of the bootstrap, a computer intensive resampling technique, to determine a suitable number of definite relations upon which to apply a heuristic based hill-climbing algorithm which attempts to minimise the distance between the best ND set and the given FD set. The novelty is that we repeatedly apply the bootstrap to an indefinite relation with an increasing sample size until an approximate fixpoint is reached at which point we assume that the sample size is then representative of the indefinite relation. We compare the bootstrap with its predecessor, the jackknife, and conclude that both are applicable with the bootstrap providing additional flexibility. This work highlights the utility of computer intensive resampling within a dependency data mining context.

Basically, the framework of BPA is similar to that of algorithm Apriori. In the first pass, all the frequent 1-itemsets can be divided into two disjoint parts. Accordingly in each subsequent pass k, we partition the set of all the frequent k-itemsets into three subsets. Any two different partitions are disjoint. If necessary, this partition procedure can be a recursive one. Therefore we get a binary partition tree in the first pass and a corresponding ternary partition tree in each subsequent pass k, Due to such a partition, BPA can be very easily parallelized assuming a shared-memory architecture.

While the private buffer areas contain pages to be updated by particular users, the public buffer area contains pages shared among users from different sites. Different from traditional buffer management strategies where limited knowledge of user access patterns is used, the proposed approach discovers knowledge from page access sequences of user transactions and uses it to guide public buffer placement and replacement. The knowledge to be discovered and the discovery algorithms are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated through a simulation study. The results indicate that with the help of the discovered knowledge, the public buffer hit ratio can be improved significantly.

J	Hsu, CN; Knoblock, CA				Hsu, CN; Knoblock, CA			Discovering robust knowledge from databases that change	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						robustness; database transactions and changes; rule consistency; knowledge discovery	SEMANTIC QUERY OPTIMIZATION	Many applications of knowledge discovery and data mining such as rule discovery for semantic query optimization, database integration and decision support, require the knowledge to be consistent with the data. However, databases usually change over time and make machine-discovered knowledge inconsistent. Useful knowledge should be robust against database changes so that it is unlikely to become inconsistent after database updates. This paper defines this notion of robustness in the context of relational databases and describes how robustness of first-order Hem-clause rules can be estimated. Experimental results show that our estimation approach can accurately identify robust rules. We also present a rule antecedent pruning algorithm that improves the robustness and applicability of machine discovered rules to demonstrate the usefulness of robustness estimation.

Data mining derives effective patterns and rules from a large amount of data to support the decision making process. Although various approaches have been attempted in some research fields, we focused on the visual data mining support system from the viewpoint of harnessing the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of the human user. In visual data mining support, defining the visualization model is important to obtain effective patterns. The main point of the definition is how to find useful data attributes as the visualization target. This paper proposes a visual data mining support system based on two key concepts: automatic target attribute selection method using a decision tree or correlation coefficient matrix and automatic scene definition generating methods. Application examples are presented and evaluated.

However, clinicians have been unable to readily explore these information sources, because currently available data retrieval tools require substantial technical skill, as well as knowledge of the underlying database structures. To address this, we have defined a group of "atomic" queries, including both population-based and temporal predicates, to enable the extraction of clinically meaningful information from these databases. DXtractor is an application that incorporates this functionality, and allows clinicians to simply combine these atomic queries.

The main objective is to assist in the generation, storage, and evaluation of large amounts of experimental option pricing data and to facilitate the identification of performance properties of the pricing algorithms with respect to the various problems. The analysis of the data is achieved using statistical and inductive logic techniques and the identified properties are used to expand the knowledge base. We demonstrate the use of the system in the context of a case study covering the pricing of American vanilla options in a Black & Scholes modeling framework.

In this paper we present the application of this approach on a set of conventional pathology data. Inherent difficulties in the utilization of such data were overcome by utilizing three data subspaces identified as Drugs, Topography and Morphology. A series of Unsupervised Neural Networks were designed and actual data were used to evaluate their performance in identifying natural clusters of patient populations. Included is a method to examine and validate the underlying reasons for clustering. Preliminary examinations of identified clusters by qualified pathologists have shown promising results, which supports the conclusion that the suggested methodology yields discoveries and medical interpretations that can eliminate or serve as alternatives to special purpose epidemiological studies.

J	Wilcox, A; Hripcsak, G				Wilcox, A; Hripcsak, G			Knowledge discovery and data mining to assist natural language understanding	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								As natural language processing systems become more frequent in clinical use, methods for interpreting the output of these programs become increasingly important. These methods require the effort of a domain expert, who must build specific queries and rules for interpreting the processor output. Knowledge discovery and data mining tools can be used instead of a domain expert to automatically generate these queries and rules. C5.0, a decision tree generator, was used to create a rule base for a natural language understanding system. A general-purpose natural language processor using this rule base was tested on a set of 200 chest radiograph reports. When a small set of reports, classified by physicians, was used as the training set, the generated rule base performed as well as lay persons, hut worse than physicians. When a larger set of reports, using ICD9 coding to classify the set, was used for training the system, the rule base performed worse than the physicians and lay persons. It appears that a larger, more accurate training set is needed to increase performance of the method.

Let I be the set of all intervals on U = {1, 2,..., n}. Consider an objective function f(I), conditional functions u(i)(I) on I, and define an optimization problem of finding the interval I maximizing f(I) subject to u(i)(I) > K-i for given real numbers K-i (i = 1:2,...: h). We propose efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problem if the objective function is either additive or quotient, and the conditional functions are additive, where a function f is additive if f(I) = Sigma(i is an element of I) (f) over cap(i) extending a function (f) over cap on ii, and quotient if it is represented as a quotient of two additive functions. We use computational-geometric methods such as convex hull, range searching, and multidimensional divide-and-conquer.		Fukuda, T (reprint author), IBM JAPAN LTD,TOKYO RES LAB,YAMATO 242,JAPAN.

The algorithm aims to provide both efficient and predictive data buffering by exploiting the use of prior knowledge of query reference behaviour. Designed to offer a high level of flexibility, RESBAL employs a multiple buffering strategy both on page fetch level and page replacement level. The evaluation of RESBAL has been carried out in a parallel database system environment based on a transputer architecture. The results of this evaluation allow comparisons to be made between different buffer algorithms, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the RESBAL algorithm. It is hoped that this work will provide some useful input to research on developing high performance database systems. Their new uses such as data mining and data warehousing are presenting the research community with interesting and important challenges.

To define possible genotype and phenotype correlations, we evaluated the application of data mining methodology whereby the clinical cancer histories Of gene-mutation-positive patients were used to define valid or "true" patterns for a specific DNA intragenic mutation. The clinical histories of patients with their corresponding detailed attributes without the same oncologic intragenic mutation were labeled incorrect or "false" patterns. The results of data mining technology yielded characterizing rules for the true cases that constituted clinical features which predicted the intragenic mutation. Some of the initial results derived correlations already independently known in the literature, adding to the confidence of using this methodological approach.

Increasing system size, complexity and bandwidth are threatening to overload current management systems so it comes as no surprise that network management is a high priority for leading telecommunications providers. Central to network management is the monitoring of the performance of the network and the handling of large volumes of alarm messages to resolve or avoid faults. Although many systems have been proposed that correlate alarms, the more fundamental question still remains of what to correlate and how to recognise it. For large telecommunications networks, complexity means that explicit symptoms for all possible occurrences cannot easily be determined. In this paper we examine the role that data mining can play in the analysing and generalisation of the sizeable volumes of network performance information that are collected every day. We describe its potential use as a tool for network fault recognition, discovery and categorisation, verifying our approach using alarm data from an SDH transmission simulation tool.

The object warehouse is built on top of a persistent object manager. We are especially interested in persistent object managers which are monotone, that is designed for data which is read-mostly, occasionally appended, and infrequently updated. These operations and access patterns are common when data mining large data stores, which provides the main motivation for our current work. For object warehouses to prove useful, they must scale as the number of objects increase, as the selectivity of queries increases, and as the computational complexity of queries increases. We show that our implementation scales in each of the dimensions over three orders of magnitudes: from queries taking seconds touching all the attributes on megabytes of data to queries taking hours touching a small fraction of the data on stores approaching one hundred gigabytes.

In this paper we present a randomized algorithm that can be used to compute the representation of a theory in terms of the most specific sentences of that theory. In addition to randomization, the algorithm uses a generalization of the concept of hypergraph transversal. We apply the general algorithm, for discovering maximal frequent sets in 0/1 data, and for computing minimal keys in relations. We present some empirical results on the performance of these methods on real data. We also show some complexity theoretic evidence of the hardness of these problems.

Using IBM's Intelligent Miner (a data mining toolbox), we built a model of serious delinquency on a sample of data, from Mortgage Information Corporation's Loan Performance System, which contains over 20 million loans with a volume of over $1.6 trillion. Currently, two technologies prevail in mortgage scoring: logistic regression, a very old and very simple method, and neural networks, newer and more complex types of models that can be extremely difficult to interpret. The radial basis function (RBF) algorithm in Intelligent Miner combines the mathematical complexity and generality of neural networks with a comprehensible visualization that explains the RBF model. Due to the performance and understandability of the RBF model, as well as other unique technologies not described here, the Intelligent Miner should be a useful tool for mortgage bankers, facilitating development of customized systems for mortgage scoring and other mortgage banking applications.

Although classification has been studied extensively, few of the known methods take serious consideration of efficient induction in large databases and the analysis of data at multiple abstraction levels. This paper addresses the efficiency and scalability issues by proposing a data classification method which integrates attribute-oriented induction, relevance analysis, and the induction of decision trees. Such an integration leads to efficient, high-quality, multiple-level classification of large amounts of data, the relaxation of the requirement of perfect training sets, and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data.

Frequent and unexpected changes in competition, customer demands and technology increase the need for a dynamic, adaptive and knowledge-driven organization. Real-time data collected fr om operational processes and marker research can be integrated and enriched towards business information. To reduce the data-overload produced by operational information systems, new data-analysis methods have been proposed to recognize patterns or relationships. Neural networks have been recently introduced to support these data mining and decision support applications. This article describes a practical application of neural networks to a specific area of business modelling, ie. prospect profiling. It is shown that neural networks can be used in this area. The benefits and pitfalls of neural networks in such data-mining applications are evaluated.

Data mining among independently developed databases often involves uncertain information. These uncertainties can be generated during both processes of combining relations and merging tuples. In this paper; we propose a framework in which uncertainties can be measured. The objective is to determine the best way to combine and merge tuples in multiple databases and avoid generating unexpected uncertainties. The Shannon entropy theory plays a key part in our approach to reduce uncertainties when merging related tuples in a combined relation. Derailed examples are provided in the paper to address key issues.

In particular, extracting image content is emerging as one of the most powerful tools to perform data mining. One of the most promising methods to extract image content is image classification, which provides a labeling of each pixel in the image. In this paper, we concentrate on neural network classifiers and we show how information obtained with a wavelet transform can be integrated to such a classifier. We apply a local spatial frequency analysis, a wavelet transform, to account for statistical texture information in Landsat/TM imagery. Statistical texture is extracted with a continuous edge-texture composite wavelet transform. We show how this approach relates to texture information computed from a co-occurrence matrix. The network is then trained with both the texture information and the additional pixel labels provided by the ground truth data. Theory and preliminary results are described in this paper. In future work, this pre-processing will automatically generate a texture index which will be fed into the artificial neural network, thus providing better discriminants of Landsat/TM imagery.

Past transaction data can be analyzed to discover customer purchasing behaviors such that the quality of business decision can be improved. The association rules describe the associations among items in the large database of customer transactions. However, the size of the database can be very large. It is very time consuming to find all the association rules from a large database, and users may be only interested in the associations among some items. Moreover, the criteria of the discovered rules for the user requirements may not be the same. Many uninteresting association rules for the user requirements can be generated when traditional mining methods are applied. Hence, a data mining language needs to be provided such that users can query only interesting knowledge to them from a large database of customer transactions. In this paper, a data milling language is presented. From the data mining language, users can specify the interested items and the criteria of the rules to be discovered. Also, an efficient data mining technique is proposed to extract the association rules according to the users' requests.

Yet database management systems (DBMS) and other data-intensive systems do not incorporate tertiary storage as a first-class citizen in the storage hierarchy. For instance, the typical solution for bringing tertiary-resident data under the control of a DBMS is to use operating system facilities to copy the data to secondary storage, and then to perform query optimization and execution as if the data had been in secondary storage all along. This approach fails to recognize the opportunities for saving execution time and storage space if the data were accessed on tertiary devices directly and in parallel with other I/Os. In this paper we examine issues in accessing secondary and tertiary storage in parallel and suggest buffering mechanisms for increasing the throughput of applications with concurrent, intensive I/O requirements. We first identify several factors that determine the parallel I/O performance of secondary and tertiary storage devices. We discuss the performance characteristics of magnetic disks and magnetic tapes when used alone and when used concurrently, sharing the same I/O bus. We then describe alternative buffering schemes for parallel I/O and analyze their efficiency via an experimental implementation.

Let I be the set of all intervals on U = {0, 1, 2, .., n}. Consider an objective function f(I), conditional functions u(i)(I) on I, and define an optimization problem of finding the interval I maximizing f(I) subject to u(i)(I) > K-i for given real numbers K-i (i = 1,2, .., h). We propose efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problem if the objective function is either additive or quotient, and the conditional functions are additive, where a function f is additive if f(I) = Sigma(i is an element of I) (f) over cap(i) extending a function (f) over cap on U, and quotient if it is represented as a quotient of two additive functions. We use computational-geometric methods such as convex hull, range searching, and multidimensional divide-and-conquer.

The essential problem faced in the mining of association rules is the generation of large items, which are items that are present in at least s% (minimal support) of the total database tuples. As the large items and their counts information usually require much storage space, the minimal cover concept is introduced to achieve reductions in the storage size. percentage contour, an extension of minimal cover, is further introduced to aid in the handling of large databases.

This program first analyzes the statistical characteristics of attribute-value pairs from training samples, then determines what kind of diagnosing model can be applied to the training samples. Then, it extracts not only classification rules for differential diagnosis, but also other medical knowledge needed for other diagnostic procedures in a selected diagnosing model. PRIMEROSE3 is evaluated on three kinds of clinical databases and the induced results are compared with domain knowledge acquired from medical experts, including classification rules. The experimental results show that our proposed method correctly not only selects a diagnosing model, but also extracts domain knowledge.

Being one class much more represented than the other produces undesirable effects in both the learning and classification processes, mainly regarding the minority class. Such a problem needs accurate tools to be undertaken; lately, ensembles of classifiers have emerged as a possible solution. Among ensemble proposals, the combination of Bagging and Boosting with preprocessing techniques has proved its ability to enhance the classification of the minority class. In this paper, we develop a new ensemble construction algorithm (EUSBoost) based on RUSBoost, one of the simplest and most accurate ensemble, which combines random undersampling with Boosting algorithm. Our methodology aims to improve the existing proposals enhancing the performance of the base classifiers by the usage of the evolutionary undersampling approach. Besides, we promote diversity favoring the usage of different subsets of majority class instances to train each base classifier. Centered on two-class highly imbalanced problems, we will prove, supported by the proper statistical analysis, that EUSBoost is able to outperform the state-of-the-art methods based on ensembles. We will also analyze its advantages using kappa-error diagrams, which we adapt to the imbalanced scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A popular and effective approach to feature selection is based on information theory, namely the mutual information of features and class variable. In this paper we compare eight different mutual information-based feature selection methods. Based on the analysis of the comparison results, we propose a new mutual information-based feature selection method. By taking into account both the class-dependent and class-independent correlation among features, the proposed method selects a less redundant and more informative set of features. The advantage of the proposed method over other methods is demonstrated by the results of experiments on UCI datasets (Asuncion and Newman, 2010 [1]) and object recognition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Its goal is to help market managers find relationships among items from large databases and thus increase sales volume. Association-rule mining is one of the well known and commonly used techniques for this purpose. The Apriori algorithm is an important method for such a task. Based on the Apriori algorithm, lots of mining approaches have been proposed for diverse applications. Many of these data mining approaches focus on positive association rules such as "if milk is bought, then cookies are bought". Such rules may, however, be misleading since there may be customers that buy milk and not buy cookies. This paper thus takes the properties of propositional logic into consideration and proposes an algorithm for mining highly coherent rules. The derived association rules are expected to be more meanful and reliable for business. Experiments on two datasets are also made to show the performance of the proposed approach.

J	Chen, CH; Chiang, RD; Wu, TF; Chu, HC				Chen, Chun-Hao; Chiang, Rui-Dong; Wu, Terng-Fang; Chu, Huan-Chen			A combined mining-based framework for predicting telecommunications customer payment behaviors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Late payment prediction system; Association rules; Clustering; Decision trees; Domain-driven data mining	FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES; FRAUD	Most existing data mining algorithms apply data-driven data mining technologies. The major disadvantage of this method is that expert analysis is required before the derived information can be used. In this paper, we thus adopt a domain-driven data mining strategy and utilize association rules, clustering, and decision trees to analyze the data from fixed-line users for establishing a late payment prediction system, namely the Combined Mining-based Customer Payment Behavior Predication System (CM-CoP). The CM-CoP could indicate potential users who may not pay the fee on time. In the implementation of the proposed system, first association rules were used to analyze customer payment behavior and the results of analysis were used to generate derivative attributes. Next, the clustering algorithm was used for customer segmentation. The cluster of customers who paid their bills was found and was then deleted to reduce data imbalances. Finally, a decision tree was utilized to predict and analyze the rest of the data using the derivative attributes and the attributes provided by the telecom providers. In the evaluation results, the average accuracy of the CM-CoP model was 78.53% under an average recall of 88.13% and an average gain of 11.2% after a six-month validation. Since the prediction accuracy of the existing method used by telecom providers was 65.60%, the prediction accuracy of the proposed model was 13% greater. In other words, the results indicate that the CM-CoP model is effective, and is better than that of the existing approach used in the telecom providers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Evans, L; Lohse, N; Summers, M				Evans, Liam; Lohse, Niels; Summers, Mark			A fuzzy-decision-tree approach for manufacturing technology selection exploiting experience-based information	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Experience-based decision support; Manufacturing technology selection; Fuzzy decision tree; Data mining	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; EXPERT-SYSTEM; STRATEGIC JUSTIFICATION; INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS; MACHINE SELECTION; MODEL; AHP; INDUCTION; INVESTMENTS	Manufacturing technology selection is traditionally a human-driven approach where the trade-off of alternative manufacturing investments is steered by a group of experts. The problem is a semi-structured and subjective-based decision practice influenced by the experience and intuitive feeling of the decision-makers involved. This paper presents a distinct experience-based decision support system that uses factual information of historical decisions to calculate confidence factors for the successful adoption of potential technologies for a given set of requirements. A fuzzy-decision-tree algorithm is applied to provide a more objective approach given the evidence of previous manufacturing technology implementation cases. The model uses the information relationship of key technology decision variables, project requirements of an implemented technology case and the success outcome of a project to support decision problems. An empirical study was conducted at an aircraft manufacturer to support their technology decision for a typical medium complexity assembly investment project. The experimental analysis demonstrated encouraging results and practical viability of the approach. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Horta, IM; Camanho, AS				Horta, I. M.; Camanho, A. S.			Company failure prediction in the construction industry	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Construction industry; Company failure; Support vector machine; Logistic regression	BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; CONTRACTOR DEFAULT; FINANCIAL RATIOS; MODEL; FIRMS	This paper proposes a new model to predict company failure in the construction industry. The model includes three major innovative aspects. The use of strategic variables reflecting the key specificities of construction companies, which are critical to explain company failure. The use of data mining techniques, i.e. support vector machine to predict company failure. The use of two different sampling methods (random undersampling and random oversampling with replacement) to balance class distributions. The model proposed was empirically tested using all Portuguese contractors that operated in 2009. It is concluded that support vector machine, with random oversampling and including strategic variables, is a very robust tool to predict company failure in the context of the construction industry. In particular, this model outperforms the results obtained with logistic regression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Horta, I. M.; Camanho, A.

J	Lopez-Chau, A; Cervantes, J; Lopez-Garcia, L; Lamont, FG				Lopez-Chau, Asdrubal; Cervantes, Jair; Lopez-Garcia, Lourdes; Garcia Lamont, Farid			Fisher's decision tree	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Oblique decision tree; Fisher's linear discriminant; C4.5	ALGORITHMS	Univariate decision trees are classifiers currently used in many data mining applications. This classifier discovers partitions in the input space via hyperplanes that are orthogonal to the axes of attributes, producing a model that can be understood by human experts. One disadvantage of univariate decision trees is that they produce complex and inaccurate models when decision boundaries are not orthogonal to axes. In this paper we introduce the Fisher's Tree, it is a classifier that takes advantage of dimensionality reduction of Fisher's linear discriminant and uses the decomposition strategy of decision trees, to come up with an oblique decision tree. Our proposal generates an artificial attribute that is used to split the data in a recursive way. The Fisher's decision tree induces oblique trees whose accuracy, size, number of leaves and training time are competitive with respect to other decision trees reported in the literature. We use more than ten public available data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As such, companies have recognized the importance of customer centered strategies and consequently customer relationship management (CRM) is often at the core of their strategic plans. In this context, a priori knowledge about the risk of a given customer to mitigate or even end the relationship with the provider is valuable information that allows companies to take preventive measures to avoid defection. This paper proposes a model to predict partial defection, using two classification techniques: Logistic regression and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The main objective is to compare the performance of MARS with Logistic regression in modeling customer attrition. This paper considers the general form of Logistic regression and Logistic regression combined with a wrapper feature selection approach, such as stepwise approach. The empirical results showed that MARS performs better than Logistic regression when variable selection procedures are not used. However, MARS loses its superiority when Logistic regression is conducted with stepwise feature selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Migueis, V.

Decision tree models for profiling ski resorts' promotional and advertising strategies and the impact on sales	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Decision tree models; Promotions; Advertising; Ski resorts; Online and mobile technologies services	SEGMENTATION; CUSTOMERS	Based on survey data, this paper builds decision tree models to profile the online and mobile technologies and services that ski resorts use for their promotional and advertising strategies for two important segments, namely millennials (less than and equal to 35) and non-millennials (greater than 35). The technologies and services include resort websites, microblogging services, and online coupon services. The decision tree models reveal that ski resorts use specific strategies for these segments. Also, the paper reveals the impact that the technologies and services have on resort sales. The impact is positive and both immediate and sustained in nature. The research is the first of its type in the ski industry and represents a novel use of decision tree models for profiling promotional and advertising strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing mining classifiers need to be updated frequently to adapt to the changes in data streams. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an adaptive ensemble approach for classification and novel class detection in concept drifting data streams. The proposed approach uses traditional mining classifiers and updates the ensemble model automatically so that it represents the most recent concepts in data streams. For novel class detection we consider the idea that data points belonging to the same class should be closer to each other and should be far apart from the data points belonging to other classes. If a data point is well separated from the existing data clusters, it is identified as a novel class instance. We tested the performance of this proposed stream classification model against that of existing mining algorithms using real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository.

It is shown that a formal concept (as defined in formal concept analysis) corresponds to the idea of a maximal bi-clique, while sub-contexts, which correspond to independent "conceptual worlds" that can be characterized by means of the new operators introduced, are disconnected sub-graphs in a bipartite graph. The parallel between formal concept analysis and bipartite graph analysis is further exploited by considering "approximation" methods on both sides. It leads to suggest new ideas for providing simplified views of datasets, taking also inspiration from the search for approximate itemsets in data mining (with relaxed requirements), and the detection of communities in hierarchical small worlds.*	[Gaume, Bruno] Univ Toulouse 2, CLLE ERSS, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France; [Navarro, Emmanuel; Prade, Henri] Univ Toulouse 3, IRIT, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France	Gaume, B (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 2, CLLE ERSS, 5 Allees Antonio Machado, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France.	gaume@univ-tlse2.fr; navarro@irit.fr; prade@irit.fr					Agrawal R, 1993, P 1993 ACM SIGMOD IN, P207, DOI DOI 10.1145/170035.170072; Ahn YY, 2010, NATURE, V466, P761, DOI 10.1038/nature09182; Albert R, 2002, REV MOD PHYS, V74, P47, DOI 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.47; Barabasi AL, 1999, SCIENCE, V286, P509, DOI 10.1126/science.286.5439.509; Barber M.

Growing a list	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Set completion; Ranking; Internet data mining; Collective intelligence	SET EXPANSION; WEB; EXTRACTION; RANK	It is easy to find expert knowledge on the Internet on almost any topic, but obtaining a complete overview of a given topic is not always easy: information can be scattered across many sources and must be aggregated to be useful. We introduce a method for intelligently growing a list of relevant items, starting from a small seed of examples. Our algorithm takes advantage of the wisdom of the crowd, in the sense that there are many experts who post lists of things on the Internet. We use a collection of simple machine learning components to find these experts and aggregate their lists to produce a single complete and meaningful list. We use experiments with gold standards and open-ended experiments without gold standards to show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art. Our method uses the ranking algorithm Bayesian Sets even when its underlying independence assumption is violated, and we provide a theoretical generalization bound to motivate its use.

Two different DSS learning strategies have been tested - a standalone classifier and classifier ensemble application. Such classification algorithms as C4.5, CART, JRip and Naive Bayes were used as base classifiers. The classifiers were evaluated on the respondent medical data from an inquiry form, containing 28 attributes and 840 records. The dataset was preprocessed using simple methods in initial data analysis as well as more complex data mining methods for feature selection. The obtained results are summarized and discussed in order to summarize an information on what learning strategies are more applicable to the present dataset and should be studied in more detail in primary research.

An algorithm based on density and compactness for dynamic overlapping clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Data mining; Clustering; Overlapping clustering algorithms; Dynamic clustering algorithms	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NETWORKS	Most clustering algorithms organize a collection of objects into a set of disjoint clusters. Although this approach has been successfully applied in unsupervised learning, there are several applications where objects could belong to more than one cluster. Overlapping clustering is an alternative in those contexts like social network analysis, information retrieval and bioinformatics, among other problems where non-disjoint clusters appear. In addition, there are environments where the collection changes frequently and the clustering must be updated; however, most of the existing overlapping clustering algorithms are not able to efficiently update the clustering. In this paper, we introduce a new overlapping clustering algorithm, called DClustR, which is based on the graph theory approach and it introduces a new strategy for building more accurate overlapping clusters than those built by state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm introduces a new strategy for efficiently updating the clustering when the collection changes. The experimentation conducted over several standard collections shows the good performance of the proposed algorithm, wit accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Romei, A; Ruggieri, S; Turini, F				Romei, Andrea; Ruggieri, Salvatore; Turini, Franco			Discrimination discovery in scientific project evaluation: A case study	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Discrimination discovery; Gender bias; Case study; Situation testing; Data mining; KDD process	EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION; GRANT APPLICATIONS; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; NEPOTISM; BIAS	Discovering contexts of unfair decisions in a dataset of historical decision records is a non-trivial problem. It requires the design of ad hoc methods and techniques of analysis, which have to comply with existing laws and with legal argumentations. While some data mining techniques have been adapted to the purpose, the state-of-the-art of research still needs both methodological refinements, the consolidation of a Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, and, most of all, experimentation with real data. This paper contributes by presenting a case study on gender discrimination in a dataset of scientific research proposals, and by distilling from the case study a general discrimination discovery process. Gender bias in scientific research is a challenging problem, that has been tackled in the social sciences literature by means of statistical regression. However, this approach is limited to test an hypothesis of discrimination over the whole dataset under analysis. Our methodology couples data mining, for unveiling previously unknown contexts of possible discrimination, with statistical regression, for testing the significance of such contexts, thus obtaining the best of the two worlds.

Discovering diverse association rules from multidimensional schema	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rules; Data cubes; Knowledge discovery; OLAP analysis; Multidimensional schema	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DATA WAREHOUSES; INTERESTINGNESS; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; ALGORITHM; SELECTION	The integration of data mining techniques with data warehousing is gaining popularity due to the fact that both disciplines complement each other in extracting knowledge from large datasets. However, the majority of approaches focus on applying data mining as a front end technology to mine data warehouses. Surprisingly, little progress has been made in incorporating mining techniques in the design of data warehouses. While methods such as data clustering applied on multidimensional data have been shown to enhance the knowledge discovery process, a number of fundamental issues remain unresolved with respect to the design of multidimensional schema. These relate to automated support for the selection of informative dimension and fact variables in high dimensional and data intensive environments, an activity which may challenge the capabilities of human designers on account of the sheer scale of data volume and variables involved. In this research, we propose a methodology that selects a subset of informative dimension and fact variables from an initial set of candidates. Our experimental results conducted on three real world datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository show that the knowledge discovered from the schema that we generated was more diverse and informative than the standard approach of mining the original data without the use of our multidimensional structure imposed on it.

J	Zadeh, LA				Zadeh, Lotfi A.			Toward a restriction-centered theory of truth and meaning (RCT)	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Precisiation of meaning; Computation with restrictions; Assessment of truth value; Formalization of everyday reasoning		What is truth? The question does not admit a simple, precise answer. A dictionary-style definition is: The truth value of a proposition, p, is the degree to which the meaning of p is in agreement with factual information, F. A precise definition of truth will be formulated at a later point in this paper. The theory outlined in the following, call it RCT for short, is a departure from traditional theories of truth and meaning. In RCT, truth values are allowed to be described in natural language. Examples. Quite true, more or less true, almost true, largely true, possibly true, probably true, usually true, etc. Such truth values are referred to as linguistic truth values. Linguistic truth values are not allowed in traditional logical systems, but are routinely used by humans in everyday reasoning and everyday discourse. The centerpiece of RCT is a deceptively simple concept-the concept of a restriction. Informally, a restriction, R(X), on a variable, X, is an answer to a question of the form: What is the value of X? Possible answers: X = 10, X is between 3 and 20, X is much larger than 2, X is large, probably X is large, usually X is large, etc. In RCT, restrictions are preponderantly described in natural language. An example of a fairly complex description is: It is very unlikely that there will be a significant increase in the price of oil in the near future. The canonical form of a restriction, R(X), is X isr R, where X is the restricted variable, R is the restricting relation, and r is an indexical variable which defines the way in which R restricts X. x may be an n-ary variable and R may be an n-ary relation. The canonical form may be interpreted as a generalized assignment statement in which what is assigned to X is not a value of X, but a restriction on the values which X can take. A restriction, R(X), is a carrier of information about X. A restriction is precisiated if X, R and r are mathematically well defined. A key idea which underlies RCT is referred to as the meaning postulate, MP. MP postulates that the meaning of a proposition drawn from a natural language, p-or simply p may be represented as a restriction, p -> X isr R. This expression is referred to as the canonical form of p, CF(p). Generally, the variables X, R and r are implicit in p. Simply stated, MP postulates that a proposition drawn from a natural language may be interpreted as an implicit assignment statement. MP plays an essential role in defining the meaning of, and computing with, propositions drawn from natural language. What should be underscored is that in RCT understanding of meaning is taken for granted. What really matters is not understanding of meaning but precisiation of meaning. Precisiation of meaning is a prerequisite to reasoning and computation with information described in natural language. Precisiation of meaning is a desideratum in robotics, mechanization of decision-making, legal reasoning, precisiated linguistic summarization with application to data mining and other fields. It should be noted that most-but not all-propositions drawn from natural language are precisiable. In RCT, truth values form a hierarchy. First order (ground level) truth values are numerical, lying in the unit interval. Linguistic truth values are second order truth values and are restrictions on first order truth values. nth order truth values are restrictions on (n - 1) order truth values, etc. Another key idea is embodied in what is referred to as the truth postulate, TP. The truth postulate, TP, equates the truth value of p to the degree to which X satisfies R. This definition of truth value plays an essential role in RCT. A distinguishing feature of RCT is that in RCT a proposition, p, is associated with two distinct truth values-internal truth value and external truth value. The internal truth value relates to the meaning of p. The external truth value relates to the degree of agreement of p with factual information. To compute the degree to which X satisfies R, it is necessary to precisiate X, R and r. In RCT, what is used for this purpose is the concept of an explanatory database, ED. Informally, ED is a collection of relations which represent the information which is needed to precisiate X and R or, equivalentljr;to compute the truth value of p. Precisiated X, R and p are denoted as X*, R* and p*, respectively. X and R are precisiated by expressing them as functions of ED. The precisiated canonical form, CF*(p), is expressed as X*isr* R*. At this point, the numerical truth value of p, nt(p), may be computed as the degree to which X* satisfies R*. In RCT, the factual information, F, is assumed to be represented as a restriction on ED. The restriction on ED induces a restriction, t, on nt(p) which can be computed through the use of the extension principle. The computed restriction on ntp is approximated to by a linguistic truth value, lt(p). cPrecisiation of propositions drawn from natural language opens the door to construction of mathematical solutions of computational problems which are stated in natural language.

In 2006, Chen et al. initiated the study of rough approximations on a complete completely distributive lattice (CCD lattice for short) and brought generalizations of rough sets into a unified framework. In this paper, we discuss the approximation operators on a CCD lattice. Based on the concept of neighborhood, three kinds of upper approximation operators and a kind of lower approximation operator are constructed. Basic properties of lower and upper approximation operators are examined. Furthermore, the relationships among these operators are analyzed. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

CT4RDD: Classification trees for research on digital divide	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Digital divide analysis; Digital divide modeling; Digital divide measurement; Census data mining; C4.5 algorithm; J4.8 algorithm		This paper presents CT4RDD (classification trees for research on digital divide), a novel methodology for the quantitative analysis and modeling of the digital divide phenomenon with an approach of single country. It is inspired on the reputed Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to automatically produce classification trees, as implemented in Witten & Frank's WEKA software toolkit. The methodology is created and evaluated on data from the 2010 Mexican Population and Housing Census that include a number of variables whose interactions involve aspects of the phenomenon; particularly, interactions among Internet service presence in households and a number of features regarding educational and economical levels, genders, ages, housing characteristics, ratios of indigenous population, etc. Discretization is used to represent percentages of presence of Internet in households of municipalities as a nominal target attribute to produce classification trees. Results suggest that the methodology can produce quantitative profiles that describe similarities and differences among a series of municipality classes that present different percentages of presence of Internet in households. The discovered profiles provide scholars, government officials and enterprise managers with valuable insight for research, planning and decision making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysing user trust in electronic banking using data mining methods	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Financial sector; Electronic banking; Trust; Variable selection; Multi-objective optimisation; MOEAs; NSGA-II; MOGA; Genetic algorithms	BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; COMMERCE; SATISFACTION	The potential fraud problems, international economic crisis and the crisis of trust in markets have affected financial institutions, which have tried to maintain customer trust in many different ways. To maintain these levels of trust they have been forced to make significant adjustments to economic structures, in efforts to recoup their investments and maintain the loyalty of their customers. To achieve these objectives, the implementation of electronic banking for customers has been considered a successful strategy. The use of electronic banking in Spain in the last decade has been fostered due to its many advantages, giving rise to real integration of channels in financial institutions. This paper reviews different methods and techniques to determine which variables could be the most important to financial institutions in order to predict the likely levels of trust among electronic banking users including socio-demographic, economic, financial and behavioural strategic variables that entities have in their databases. To do so, the most recent advances in machine learning and soft-computing have been used, including a new selection operator for multiobjective genetic algorithms. The results obtained by the algorithms were validated by an expert committee, ranking the quality of them. The new methodology proposed, obtained the best results in terms of optimisation as well as the highest punctuation given by the experts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Malware detection by pruning of parallel ensembles using harmony search	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Malware detection; Ensemble learning; Ensemble pruning; Harmony search; Classification		Detection of malware using data mining techniques has been explored extensively. Techniques used for detecting malware based on structural features rely on being able to identify anomalies in the structure of executable files. The structural attributes of an executable that can be extracted include byte ngrams, Portable Executable (PE) features, API call sequences and Strings. After a thorough analysis we have extracted various features from executable files and applied it on an ensemble of classifiers to efficiently detect malware. Ensemble methods combine several individual pattern classifiers in order to achieve better classification. The challenge is to choose the minimal number of classifiers that achieve the best performance. An ensemble that contains too many members might incur large storage requirements and even reduce the classification performance. Hence the goal of ensemble pruning is to identify a subset of ensemble members that performs at least as good as the original ensemble and discard any other members. In this paper we propose a novel idea of pruning ensemble using Harmony search which is a music inspired algorithm. The pruned ensemble is then used for malware detection. Multiple heterogeneous classifiers in parallel fashion are used for constructing the ensemble and harmony search is used to choose the best set of classifiers from the ensemble to get the pruned set. From the experimental results, it is evident that our algorithm achieves high detection accuracy and outperforms the existing ensemble algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, data mining serves an important role for ubiquitous computing by providing intelligence to several types of ubiquitous computing applications. Thus, automating ubiquitous data mining is also crucial. We focus on the problem of automatically configuring the execution of a ubiquitous data mining algorithm. In our solution, we generate configuration decisions in a resource aware and context aware manner since the algorithm executes in an environment in which the context often changes and computing resources are often severely limited. We propose to analyze the execution behavior of the data mining algorithm by mining its past executions. By doing so, we discover the effects of resource and context states as well as parameter settings on the data mining quality. We argue that a classification model is appropriate for predicting the behavior of an algorithm's execution and we concentrate on decision tree classifier. We also define taxonomy on data mining quality so that tradeoff between prediction accuracy and classification specificity of each behavior model that classifies by a different abstraction of quality, is scored for model selection. Behavior model constituents and class label transformations are formally defined and experimental validation of the proposed approach is also performed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Generally speaking, spatial outliers are irregular data instances which have significantly distinct non-spatial attribute values compared to their spatial neighbors. In our proposed approach, we adopt SOM to preserve the intrinsic topological and metric relationships of the data distribution to seek reasonable spatial clusters for outlier detection. The proposed iterative learning process with robust distance estimation can address the high dimensional problems of spatial attributes and accurately detect spatial outliers with irregular features. To verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm, comparative study of ISOMRD and several existing approaches are presented in detail. Specifically, we test the performance of our method based on four real-world spatial datasets. Various simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Combination of machine learning algorithms for recommendation of courses in E-Learning System based on historical data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Simple K-means; Apriori; Weka; Moodle; Farthest first; Expectation maximization; Tertius; PredictiveApriori		Data mining is the process which is used to analyze the large database to find the useful pattern. Data mining can be used to learn about student's behavior from data collected using the course management system such as Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Developmental Learning Environment). Here in this paper we show how data mining techniques such as clustering and association rule algorithm is useful in Course Recommendation System which recommends the course to the student based on choice of other students for particular set of courses collected from Moodle. As a result of Course Recommendation System, we can recommend to new student who has recently enrolled for some course e.g. Operating System, the new course to be opted e.g. Distributed System. Our approach uses combination of clustering technique - Simple K-means and association rule algorithm - Apriori and finds the result. These results were compared with the results of open source data mining tool-Weka. The result obtained using combined approach matches with real world interdependencies among the courses. Other combinations of clustering and association rule algorithms are also discussed here to select the best combination. This Course Recommendation System could help in building intelligent recommender system. This approach of recommending courses to new students can be immensely be useful in "MOOC (Massively Open Online Courses)". (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geographic knowledge extraction and semantic similarity in OpenStreetMap	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Semantic similarity; OpenStreetMap; Volunteered Geographic Information; OSM Semantic Network; SimRank; P-Rank; Co-citation; Crowdsourcing	CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS; METAANALYSIS; DOCUMENTS; WEB	In recent years, a web phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has produced large crowdsourced geographic data sets. OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics consists of a set of properties (called 'tags') describing geographic classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement) of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic similarity of geographic concepts. Empirical evidence supports the usage of co-citation algorithms-SimRank showing the highest plausibility-to compute concept similarity in a crowdsourced semantic network.

NHOP: A Nested Associative Pattern for Analysis of Consensus Sequence Ensembles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classifier design and evaluation; data mining; granular computing; pattern analysis; bioinformatics	HYDROPHOBIC CORE; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY	In this research, we introduce a novel, complex associative pattern that is found to be very useful because it identifies the core associative structure from the data. We refer to it as nested high-order pattern. The pattern is more specific than associative patterns represented as multiple variables. It also generalizes sequential patterns, as the outcomes need not be contiguous. This paper outlines two search algorithms, the r-Tree and Best-k algorithm in its detection. It was then applied to an analysis of biomolecule using the aligned sequence family of the molecule. In the SH3 protein, a model for protein-protein interaction mediator, we identify functional groups (core and binding sites) in the three-dimensional structure as well as amino acid patterns dominating certain species.

Recommendation System technology can recommend web resources or information to people based on his/her personal preference, and has gotten a great deal of attention and development in recent years. In this paper, by combining collaborative filtering technology and information propagation principle, we proposed ROBIN, a novel recommendation model. The ROBIN model achieves a good recommendation effect by propagating the relationship information between users and resources. Based on the ROBIN model, we designed and implemented tag recommendation algorithm named ROBIN-T. For evaluating our proposed method, we have conducted tag recommendation experiments on three real datasets and the results show that the ROBIN-T algorithm achieves good performance when compared with classical approaches.

Even when metadata are available, query results may remain far from the timbre expected by users. This problem stems from the nature of query specification, which does not account for the underlying complexity of audio data. The Query By Example (QBE) paradigm tries to tackle this shortcoming by finding audio clips similar to a given sound example. However, it requires users to have a well-formed soundfile of what they seek, which is not always a valid assumption. Furthermore, most audio-retrieval systems rely on a single measure of similarity, which is unlikely to convey the perceptual similarity of audio signals. We address in this paper an innovative way of querying generic audio databases by simultaneously optimizing the temporal evolution of multiple spectral properties. We show how this problem can be cast into a new approach merging multiobjective optimization and time series matching, called MultiObjective Time Series (MOTS) matching. We formally state this problem and report an efficient implementation. This approach introduces a multidimensional assessment of similarity in audio matching. This allows to cope with the multidimensional nature of timbre perception and also to obtain a set of efficient propositions rather than a single best solution. To demonstrate the performances of our approach, we show its efficiency in audio classification tasks. By introducing a selection criterion based on the hypervolume dominated by a class, we show that our approach outstands the state-of-art methods in audio classification even with a few number of features.

J	Ferrari, L; Mamei, M				Ferrari, Laura; Mamei, Marco			Identifying and understanding urban sport areas using Nokia Sports Tracker	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Mobility pattern; Urban and environmental planning; Social dynamics; Web mining; Mobile applications		Current advancements in pervasive technologies allow users to create and share an increasing amount of whereabouts data. Thus, some rich datasets on human mobility are becoming available on the web. In this paper we extracted approximately 790,000 mobility traces from a web-based repository of GPS tracks-the Nokia Sports Tracker Service. Using data mining mechanisms, we show that this data can be analyzed to uncover daily routines and interesting schemes in the use of public spaces. We first show that our approach supports large-scale analysis of people's whereabouts by comparing behavioral patterns across cities. Then, using Kernel Density Estimation, we present a mechanism to identify popular sport areas in individual cities. This kind of analysis allows us to highlight human-centered geographies that can support a wide range of applications ranging from location-based services to urban planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

J	Gelernter, J; Balaji, S				Gelernter, Judith; Balaji, Shilpa			An algorithm for local geoparsing of microtext	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Geoparse; Microtext; Microblogs; Twitter; Social media; Geographic information retrieval; Geo-IR or GIR; Toponym; Data mining; Local search; Location	TWEETS	The location of the author of a social media message is not invariably the same as the location that the author writes about in the message. In applications that mine these messages for information such as tracking news, political events or responding to disasters, it is the geographic content of the message rather than the location of the author that is important. To this end, we present a method to geo-parse the short, informal messages known as microtext. Our preliminary investigation has shown that many microtext messages contain place references that are abbreviated, misspelled, or highly localized. These references are missed by standard geo-parsers. Our geo-parser is built to find such references. It uses Natural Language Processing methods to identify references to streets and addresses, buildings and urban spaces, and toponyms, and place acronyms and abbreviations. It combines heuristics, open-source Named Entity Recognition software, and machine learning techniques. Our primary data consisted of Twitter messages sent immediately following the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. The algorithm identified location in the data sample, Twitter messages, giving an F statistic of 0.85 for streets, 0.86 for buildings, 0.96 for toponyms, and 0.88 for place abbreviations, with a combined average F of 0.90 for identifying places. The same data run through a geo-parsing standard, Yahoo! Placemaker, yielded an F statistic of zero for streets and buildings (because Placemaker is designed to find neither streets nor buildings), and an F of 0.67 for toponyms.

J	Guvenir, HA; Kurtcephe, M				Guvenir, H. Altay; Kurtcephe, Murat			Ranking Instances by Maximizing the Area under ROC Curve	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ranking; data mining; machine learning; decision support	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; RISK; AUC; OPTIMIZATION	In recent years, the problem of learning a real-valued function that induces a ranking over an instance space has gained importance in machine learning literature. Here, we propose a supervised algorithm that learns a ranking function, called ranking instances by maximizing the area under the ROC curve (RIMARC). Since the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely accepted performance measure for evaluating the quality of ranking, the algorithm aims to maximize the AUC value directly. For a single categorical feature, we show the necessary and sufficient condition that any ranking function must satisfy to achieve the maximum AUC. We also sketch a method to discretize a continuous feature in a way to reach the maximum AUC as well. RIMARC uses a heuristic to extend this maximization to all features of a data set. The ranking function learned by the RIMARC algorithm is in a human-readable form; therefore, it provides valuable information to domain experts for decision making. Performance of RIMARC is evaluated on many real-life data sets by using different state-of-the-art algorithms. Evaluations of the AUC metric show that RIMARC achieves significantly better performance compared to other similar methods.	[Guvenir, H.

Moreover, many real-world applications are now capable of producing continuous, unbounded data streams. During the recent years, new methods have been developed to find frequent patterns in uncertain databases; nevertheless, very limited work has been done in discovering frequent patterns in uncertain data streams. The current solutions for frequent pattern mining in uncertain streams take a FP-tree-based approach; however, recent studies have shown that FP-tree-based algorithms do not perform well in the presence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose two hyper-structure-based false-positive-oriented algorithms to efficiently mine frequent itemsets from streams of uncertain data. The first algorithm, UHS-Stream, is designed to find all frequent itemsets up to the current moment. The second algorithm, TFUHS-Stream, is designed to find frequent itemsets in an uncertain data stream in a time-fading manner. Experimental results show that the proposed hyper-structure-based algorithms outperform the existing tree-based algorithms in terms of accuracy, runtime, and memory usage.

J	Honko, P				Honko, Piotr			Granular computing for relational data classification	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-relational data mining; Database models; Granular computing; Classification	INFORMATION GRANULES	We propose a novel framework for generating classification rules from relational data. This is a specialized version of the general framework intended for mining relational data and is defined in granular computing theory. In the framework proposed in this paper we define a method for deriving information granules from relational data. Such granules are the basis for generating relational classification rules. In our approach we follow the granular computing idea of switching between different levels of granularity of the universe. Thanks to this a granule-based relational data representation can easily be replaced by another one and thereby adjusted to a given data mining task, e.g. classification. A generalized relational data representation, as defined in the framework, can be treated as the search space for generating rules. On account of this the size of the search space may significantly be limited. Furthermore, our framework, unlike others, unifies not only the way the data and rules to be derived are expressed and specified, but also partially the process of generating rules from the data. Namely, the rules can be directly obtained from the information granules or constructed based on them.

In particular, we show how fare collection data can be used to identify behavioural differences between passengers: we thus advocate for a personalised approach to delivering transport related information to travellers. To demonstrate the potential for personalisation we compute trip time estimates that more accurately reflect the travel habits of each passenger. We propose a number of algorithms for personalised trip time estimations, and empirically demonstrate that these approaches outperform both a non-personalised baseline computed from the data, as well as published travel times as currently offered by the transport authority. Furthermore, we show how to easily scale the system by pre-clustering travellers. We close by outlining the wide variety of applications and services that may be fuelled by fare collection data.

The effect of context on misclassification costs in e-commerce applications	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Business intelligence; Knowledge management applications; Context; Predictive model	AWARE APPLICATIONS; PERSONALIZATION; CUSTOMERS; MODELS	The performance of customer behavior models depends on both the predictive accuracy and the cost of incorrect predictions. Previous research showed that including context in the customer behavior models can improve the accuracy. However, improving accuracy does not necessarily mean that the misclassification cost decreases. In fact, different errors have different costs. Even if the number of incorrect predictions decreases, the number of errors associated with higher costs increase. The aim of this paper is to understand whether including context in a predictive model reduces the misclassification costs and in which conditions this happens. Experimental analyses were done by varying the market granularity, the dependent variable and the context granularity. The results show that context leads to a decrease in the misclassification cost when the unit of analysis is the single customer or the micro-segment. The exceptions may occur when the unit of analysis is a segment. These findings have significant implications for companies that have to decide whether to gather context and how to exploit it best when they build predictive models of the behavior of their customers.

J	Middelfart, M; Pedersen, TB; Krogsgaard, J				Middelfart, Morten; Pedersen, Torben Bach; Krogsgaard, Jan			Efficient Sentinel Mining Using Bitmaps on Modern Processors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Pattern mining; predictive data mining; cube-based data mining; sentinels	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; RULES	This paper proposes a highly efficient bitmap-based approach for discovery of so-called sentinels. Sentinels represent schema level relationships between changes over time in certain measures in a multidimensional data cube. Sentinels are actionable and notify users based on previous observations, for example, that revenue might drop within two months if an increase in customer problems combined with a decrease in website traffic is observed. We significantly extend prior art by representing the sentinel mining problem by bitmap operations, using bitmapped encoding of so-called indication streams. We present a very efficient algorithm, SentBit, that is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, and utilizes CPU specific instructions and the multicore architectures available on modern processors. The SentBit algorithm scales efficiently to very large data sets, which is verified by extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data.

The indicator in this study is service requests. The association discovery techniques revealed problems in users' training (errors in operating procedures), intrinsic failures in medical devices, and badly scheduled maintenance policies. Clustering techniques uncovered the main causes of failures. With the evidence obtained corrective actions were taken. The service request average dropped dramatically from 6.4 to 0.4 during the analyzed period. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Drugs are the major causes for cases of SJS. While treating patients with SJS, the first and most important step is to identify and discontinue any possible responsible drugs. However, potential drugs that may lead to SJS are many and encompass various therapeutic areas. Very few physicians are familiar with the potential risk of all these drugs. If properly treated, most SJS cases are expected to recover without much sequelae. All drugs that have been associated with SJS should be avoided in these patients to prevent recurrence. If the physicians fail to identify and discontinue the drugs causing SJS, or even adding new drugs related to SJS, the patient may get worse or SJS may recur. These conditions can cause SJS patients to be re-hospitalized. Currently the reasons for re-hospitalization of SJS patients in Taiwan are not known. This study uses Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to analyze the causes of re-hospitalization for cases of SJS. First, we classified prescription history of re-hospitalized patients through the rule-based classification method. Secondly, by using the basic prescription actions, we identified drug association patterns. Then, by employing A-priori algorithm, pairs of drugs with relatively higher frequency of appearance were identified and their degrees of association were measured by using selected symmetric and asymmetric association mining methods. Finally, by listing and ranking up these pairs of drugs according to the value of support based on their degrees of association, we provide prescribing physicians with possible means of increasing the awareness and reducing re-hospitalization of SJS patients.

J	Shar, LK; Tan, HBK				Shar, Lwin Khin; Tan, Hee Beng Kuan			Predicting SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities through mining input sanitization patterns	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Vulnerability prediction; Data mining; Web application vulnerability; Input sanitization; Static code attributes; Empirical study	DEFECT PREDICTION; SOFTWARE METRICS	Context: SQL injection (SQLI) and cross site scripting (XSS) are the two most common and serious web application vulnerabilities for the past decade. To mitigate these two security threats, many vulnerability detection approaches based on static and dynamic taint analysis techniques have been proposed. Alternatively, there are also vulnerability prediction approaches based on machine learning techniques, which showed that static code attributes such as code complexity measures are cheap and useful predictors. However, current prediction approaches target general vulnerabilities. And most of these approaches locate vulnerable code only at software component or file levels. Some approaches also involve process attributes that are often difficult to measure. Objective: This paper aims to provide an alternative or complementary solution to existing taint analyzers by proposing static code attributes that can be used to predict specific program statements, rather than software components, which are likely to be vulnerable to SQLI or XSS. Method: From the observations of input sanitization code that are commonly implemented in web applications to avoid SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities, in this paper, we propose a set of static code attributes that characterize such code patterns. We then build vulnerability prediction models from the historical information that reflect proposed static attributes and known vulnerability data to predict SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities. Results: We developed a prototype tool called PhpMinerI for data collection and used it to evaluate our models on eight open source web applications. Our best model achieved an averaged result of 93% recall and 11% false alarm rate in predicting SQLI vulnerabilities, and 78% recall and 6% false alarm rate in predicting XSS vulnerabilities. Conclusion: The experiment results show that our proposed vulnerability predictors are useful and effective at predicting SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data with attribute value taxonomies (AVTs) are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. In this paper, we extend Pawlak's rough set model, and propose a novel multi-level rough set model (MLRS) based on AVTs and a full-subtree generalization scheme. Paralleling with Pawlak's rough set model, some conclusions related to the MLRS are given. Meanwhile, a novel concept of cut reduction based on MLRS is presented. A cut reduction can induce the most abstract multi-level decision table with the same classification ability on the raw decision table, and no other multi-level decision table exists that is more abstract. Furthermore, the relationships between attribute reduction in Pawlak's rough set model and cut reduction in MLRS are discussed. We also prove that the problem of cut reduction generation is NP-hard, and develop a heuristic algorithm named CRTDR for computing the cut reduction. Finally, an approach named RMTDR for mining multi-level decision rule is provided. It can mine decision rules from different concept levels. Example analysis and comparative experiments show that the proposed methods are efficient and effective in handling the problems where data is associated with AVTs.

Delay-sensitive approaches for anonymizing numerical streaming data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						K-anonymity; Privacy-preserving data mining; Streaming data	K-ANONYMITY; PRIVACY; CASTLE	Streaming data are widely used in today's world. Data come from different sources in streams and must be processed online and with minimum delay. These data stream can contain confidential data such as customers' purchase information and need to be mined in order to reveal other useful information like customers' purchase patterns. Privacy preservation throughout these processes plays a crucial role. K-anonymity is a well-known technique for preserving privacy. The principle issues in k-anonymity are information loss and running time. Although some of the existing k-anonymity techniques are able to generate anonymized data with acceptable information loss, their main drawback is that they are very time-consuming and are not applicable in a streaming context since streaming data are usually very sensitive to delay and need to be processed quite fast. In [32], we proposed a cluster-based k-anonymity algorithm called fast anonymizing algorithm for numerical streaming data (FAANST) which can anonymize numerical streaming data quite fast while providing an admissible information loss. The main drawback of FAANST is that some tuples may remain in the system for a long time and are output when they might be considered to have expired. In this paper, we propose two extensions for FAANST, passive and proactive solutions. These two solutions put a soft deadline, called , on the time each tuple can stay in the system, and if a tuple passes this deadline, these algorithms force the tuple to be output. The proactive solution goes even one step further and utilizes a simple heuristic function to predict when a tuple in the system may expire and outputs the tuple if it will expire in the next round of the algorithm's execution.

The main objective of clustering is to search for hidden patterns that may exist in datasets. Since the clustering problem is considered to be NP-hard, previous research has applied bio-inspired heuristic methods to solve such problems. In this paper we propose an effective method for clustering using an algorithm inspired by the decision making processes of bee swarms. The algorithm is called the Best-so-far Artificial Bee Colony with multiple patrilines. In the Best-so-far method, the solution direction is biased toward the Best-so-far solution rather than a neighboring solution proposed in the original Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. We introduce another bee-inspired concept called multiple patrilines to further improve the diversity of solutions and allow the calculations to be distributed among multiple computing units. We empirically assess the performance of our proposed method on several standard datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that the proposed method produces solutions that are as good as or better than the current state-of-the-art clustering techniques reported in the literature. Furthermore, to demonstrate the computing performance and scalability of the algorithm, we assess the algorithm on a large disk drive manufacturing dataset. The results indicate that our distributed Best-so-far approach is scalable and produces good solutions while significantly improving the processing time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cagliero, L; Garza, P				Cagliero, Luca; Garza, Paolo			Itemset generalization with cardinality-based constraints	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Generalized itemset mining; Mobile data analysis	ASSOCIATION RULES; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHMS; DATABASES	Generalized itemset mining is an established data mining technique that focuses on discovering high-level correlations among large databases. By exploiting a taxonomy built over the data items, items are aggregated into higher level concepts and, thus, data correlations at different abstraction levels can be discovered. However, since a large number of patterns can be extracted, the result of the mining process is often not easily manageable by domain experts. We propose a novel approach to discovering a compact subset of generalized itemsets from structured data. To guarantee model conciseness and readability, a set of itemsets that has a common generalization is generated only when its cardinality is so small that its manual inspection is practically feasible. Furthermore, generalizations are generated only when their knowledge is covered by a large number of low-level descendant itemsets, and the generalizations are worth considering in place of their many low-level descendants only in these cases. Experiments performed on synthetic, benchmark, and real data taken from a mobile application scenario demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This information can be used to support the election of the proper classification algorithm. This paper addresses the analysis of the relationship between data complexity measures and classifiers behavior. Each one of the metrics is evaluated covering its range of values and studying the classifiers accuracy on these values. The results offer information about the usefullness of these measures, and which of them allow us to analyze the nature of the input data set and help us to decide which classification method could be the most promising one.

Multi-level association rules and directed graphs for spatial data analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Lagrangian analysis; Spatial-temporal association rules; Multi-level directed graphs; Oceanography	MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; CIRCULATION; SURFACE; POLLUTION; MODEL	We propose a methodology that upgrades the methods of the Lagrangian analysis of surface sea-water parcels. This methodology includes data mining with efficient visualization techniques, namely, spatial-temporal association rules and multi-level directed graphs with different levels of space and time granularity. In the resulting multi-level directed graphs we can intertwine knowledge from various disciplines related to oceanography (in our application) and perform the mining of such graphs. We evaluate the proposed methodology on Lagrangian tracking of virtual particles in the velocity field of the numerical model called the Mediterranean Ocean Forecasting Model (MFS). We describe an efficient algorithm based on label propagation clustering, which finds cycles and paths in multi-level directed graphs and reveals how the number and size of the cycles depend on the seasons. In addition, we offer three interesting results of the visualization and mining of such graphs, that is, the 12 months periodicity of the exchange of water masses among sea areas, the separation of Mediterranean Sea circulation in summer and winter situations, obtained with the hierarchical clustering of multi-level directed graphs, and finally, with visualization with multi-level directed graphs we confirm the reversal of sea circulation in the Ionian Sea over the last decades. The aforementioned results received a very favorable evaluation from oceanographic experts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Opinions may be sensitive since they may reflect a person's perspective, understanding, particular feelings, way of life, and desires. On one hand, public opinion is often collected through a central server which keeps a user profile for each participant and needs to publish this data for research purposes. On the other hand, such publishing of sensitive information without proper de-identification puts individuals' privacy at risk, thus opinions Must be anonymized prior to publishing. While many anonymization approaches for tabular data with single sensitive attribute have been introduced, the proposed approaches do not readily apply to opinion polls. This is because opinions are generally collected on many issues, thus opinion databases have multiple sensitive attributes. Finding and enforcing anonymization models that work on datasets with multiple sensitive attributes while allowing risk analysis on the publisher side is not a well-studied problem. In this work, we identify the privacy problems regarding public opinions and propose a new probabilistic privacy model MSA-diversity, specifically defined. on datasets with multiple sensitive attributes. We also present a heuristic anonymization technique to enforce MSA-diversity. Experimental results on real data show that our approach clearly outperforms the existing approaches in terms of anonymization accuracy. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These findings are extremely relevant for a soccer coach, in order not only to evaluate the performance of his athletes, but also for the construction of the opponent team model for the next match. During a soccer match, due to the presence of a complex set of intercorrelated variables, the detection of a small set of factors that directly influence the final result becomes almost an impossible task for a human being. In consequence of that, a huge number of software packages for analysis capable of calculating a vast set of game statistics appeared over the years. However, all of them need a soccer expert in order to interpret the produced data and select which are the most relevant variables. Having as a base a set of statistics extracted from the RoboCup 2D Simulation League log files and using a multivariable analysis, the aim of this research project is to identify which are the variables that most influence the final game result and create prediction models capable of automatically detecting soccer team behaviors. For those purposes, more than two hundred games (from 2006-2009 competition years) were analyzed according to a set of variables defined by a soccer experts board, and using the MARS and RReliefF algorithms. The obtained results show that the MARS algorithm presents a lower error value, when compared to RReliefF (from a pairwire t-test for a significance level of 5%). The p-value for this test was 2.2e-16 which means these two techniques present a significant statistical difference for this data. In the future, this work will be used in an offline analysis module, with the goal of detecting which is the team strategy that will maximize the final game result against a specific opponent.

Translating genome wide association study results to associations among common diseases: In silico study with an electronic medical record	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bayesian network; In silico; Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS); Integration; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); Data mining; Bioinformatics	MISSING HERITABILITY; INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS; BIOLOGY; ORGANIZATION; DISCOVERY; INFERENCE; VARIANTS; NETWORKS; TRAITS; HAPMAP	Objective: To develop a map of disease associations exclusively using two publicly available genetic sources: the catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the HapMap, and the catalog of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) from the NHGRI, and to evaluate it with a large, long-standing electronic medical record (EMR). Methods: A computational model, In Silico Bayesian Integration of GWAS (IsBIG), was developed to learn associations among diseases using a Bayesian network (BN) framework, using only genetic data. The IsBIG model (I-Model) was re-trained using data from our EMR (M-Model). Separately, another clinical model (C-Model) was learned from this training dataset. The I-Model was compared with both the M-Model and the C-Model for power to discriminate a disease given other diseases using a test dataset from our EMR. Area under receiver operator characteristics curve was used as a performance measure. Direct associations between diseases in the I-Model were also searched in the PubMed database and in classes of the Human Disease Network (HDN). Results: On the basis of genetic information alone, the I-Model linked a third of diseases from our EMR. When compared to the M-Model, the I-Model predicted diseases given other diseases with 94% specificity, 33% sensitivity, and 80% positive predictive value. The I-Model contained 117 direct associations between diseases. Of those associations, 20 (17%) were absent from the searches of the PubMed database; one of these was present in the C-Model. Of the direct associations in the I-Model, 7 (35%) were absent from disease classes of HDN. Conclusion: Using only publicly available genetic sources we have mapped associations in GWAS to a human disease map using an in silico approach. Furthermore, we have validated this disease map using phenotypic data from our EMR. Models predicting disease associations on the basis of known genetic associations alone are specific but not sensitive. Genetic data, as it currently exists, can only explain a fraction of the risk of a disease. Our approach makes a quantitative statement about disease variation that can be explained in an EMR on the basis of genetic associations described in the GWAS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This paper proposes a data analysis framework based on a multiple-level clustering technique to identify the examination pathways commonly followed by patients with a given disease. This knowledge can support health care organizations in evaluating the medical treatments usually adopted, and thus the incurred costs. The proposed multiple-level strategy allows clustering patient examination datasets with a variable distribution. To measure the relevance of specific examinations for a given disease complication, patient examination data has been represented in the Vector Space Model using the TF-IDF method. As a case study, the proposed approach has been applied to the diabetic care scenario. The experimental validation, performed on a real collection of diabetic patients, demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in identifying groups of patients with a similar examination history and increasing severity in diabetes complications.

The device is modeled by a black box whose small signal (S) and noise parameters are evaluated through data mining techniques, based on the fitting of both of these parameters for multiple bias and configuration. It has been shown that DMT have a high potential of faithful and efficient device modeling. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J RF and Microwave CAE, 2013.

Discovery of extreme events-related communities in contrasting groups of physical system networks	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Spatio-temporal data mining; Complex network analysis; Community detection; Comparative analysis; Networkmotif detection; Extreme event prediction	TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; ABSOLUTE DEVIATION REGRESSION; ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON; BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; OUTLIER DETECTION; COMPLEX NETWORKS; EL-NINO; PREDICTION; TEMPERATURE	The latent behavior of a physical system that can exhibit extreme events such as hurricanes or rainfalls, is complex. Recently, a very promising means for studying complex systems has emerged through the concept of complex networks. Networks representing relationships between individual objects usually exhibit community dynamics. Conventional community detection methods mainly focus on either mining frequent subgraphs in a network or detecting stable communities in time-varying networks. In this paper, we formulate a novel problem-detection of predictive and phase-biased communities in contrasting groups of networks, and propose an efficient and effective machine learning solution for finding such anomalous communities. We build different groups of networks corresponding to different system's phases, such as higher or low hurricane activity, discover phase-related system components as seeds to help bound the search space of community generation in each network, and use the proposed contrast-based technique to identify the changing communities across different groups. The detected anomalous communities are hypothesized (1) to play an important role in defining the target system's state(s) and (2) to improve the predictive skill of the system's states when used collectively in the ensemble of predictive models. When tested on the two important extreme event problems-identification of tropical cyclone-related and of African Sahel rainfall-related climate indices-our algorithm demonstrated the superior performance in terms of various skill and robustness metrics, including 8-16 % accuracy increase, as well as physical interpretability of detected communities. The experimental results also show the efficiency of our algorithm on synthetic datasets.

A tutorial on rank-based coefficient estimation for censored data in small- and large-scale problems	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Accelerated failure time model; Ill-posed problems; Regularization; Survival analysis	FAILURE TIME MODEL; VARIABLE SELECTION; REGULARIZED ESTIMATION; LINEAR-REGRESSION; LASSO; TESTS	The analysis of survival endpoints subject to right-censoring is an important research area in statistics, particularly among econometricians and biostatisticians. The two most popular semiparametric models are the proportional hazards model and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model. Rank-based estimation in the AFT model is computationally challenging due to optimization of a non-smooth loss function. Previous work has shown that rank-based estimators may be written as solutions to linear programming (LP) problems. However, the size of the LP problem is O(n (2)+p) subject to n (2) linear constraints, where n denotes sample size and p denotes the dimension of parameters. As n and/or p increases, the feasibility of such solution in practice becomes questionable. Among data mining and statistical learning enthusiasts, there is interest in extending ordinary regression coefficient estimators for low-dimensions into high-dimensional data mining tools through regularization. Applying this recipe to rank-based coefficient estimators leads to formidable optimization problems which may be avoided through smooth approximations to non-smooth functions. We review smooth approximations and quasi-Newton methods for rank-based estimation in AFT models. The computational cost of our method is substantially smaller than the corresponding LP problem and can be applied to small- or large-scale problems similarly. The algorithm described here allows one to couple rank-based estimation for censored data with virtually any regularization and is exemplified through four case studies.

It then presents Query Directed Clustering (QDC), a web page clustering algorithm that produces higher-quality clusterings than other clustering algorithms for easy ambiguous queries, while performing at least as well as other clustering algorithms on queries for which clustering is not well suited. QDC has the five key innovations: a new cluster quality guide that is based on the relationship between clusters and the query; an improved cluster merging method that considers both cluster overlap and cluster description similarity; a new cluster splitting method that addresses the cluster chaining (drifting) problem; an improved heuristic for selecting good clusters; a new method that improves the clusters by ranking the pages in each cluster. Our experiments evaluate QDC both quantitatively and qualitatively and show that QDC significantly improves clustering performance, while being substantially more efficient than existing approaches.

It was developed to combine quantization and topological preservation. The algorithm also has a supervised version to create local linear models of scalar fields in the defined Voronoi regions. In this work a new methodology is proposed to use those models as data mining tools. Using visual tools, gradients are analysed to discover the influence of each variable over the output. It does not only allow to select the most relevant variables but also to detect different zones of influence, which can be used to create a set of fuzzy rules. The proposed methodology is proven to be useful to detect locally relevant variables that lead to a better understanding of the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Managing and Optimizing Bioinformatics Workflows for Data Analysis in Clouds	JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING			English	Article						Workflow execution; Resource level monitoring; Application level monitoring; Workflow management; Knowledge database; Cloud computing	RNA-SEQ; MANAGEMENT; SCIENCES; SERVICES; GENOMICS; SYSTEM	The rapid advancements in recent years of high-throughput technologies in the life sciences are facilitating the generation and storage of huge amount of data in different databases. Despite significant developments in computing capacity and performance, an analysis of these large-scale data in a search for biomedical relevant patterns remains a challenging task. Scientific workflow applications are deemed to support data-mining in more complex scenarios that include many data sources and computational tools, as commonly found in bioinformatics. A scientific workflow application is a holistic unit that defines, executes, and manages scientific applications using different software tools. Existing workflow applications are process- or data- rather than resource-oriented. Thus, they lack efficient computational resource management capabilities, such as those provided by Cloud computing environments. Insufficient computational resources disrupt the execution of workflow applications, wasting time and money. To address this issue, advanced resource monitoring and management strategies are required to determine the resource consumption behaviours of workflow applications to enable a dynamical allocation and deallocation of resources. In this paper, we present a novel Cloud management infrastructure consisting of resource level-, application level monitoring techniques, and a knowledge management strategy to manage computational resources for supporting workflow application executions in order to guarantee their performance goals and their successful completion. We present the design description of these techniques, demonstrate how they can be applied to scientific workflow applications, and present detailed evaluation results as a proof of concept.

Healthcare providers increasingly record data in electronic patient records (EPRs), in which we aim to identify possible adverse events (AEs) and, specifically, possible adverse drug events (ADEs). Materials and methods Based on the undesirable effects section from the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of 7446 drugs, we have built a Danish ADE dictionary. Starting from this dictionary we have developed a pipeline for identifying possible ADEs in unstructured clinical narrative text. We use a named entity recognition (NER) tagger to identify dictionary matches in the text and post-coordination rules to construct ADE compound terms. Finally, we apply post-processing rules and filters to handle, for example, negations and sentences about subjects other than the patient. Moreover, this method allows synonyms to be identified and anatomical location descriptions can be merged to allow appropriate grouping of effects in the same location. Results The method identified 1970731 (35477 unique) possible ADEs in a large corpus of 6011 psychiatric hospital patient records. Validation was performed through manual inspection of possible ADEs, resulting in precision of 89% and recall of 75%. Discussion The presented dictionary-building method could be used to construct other ADE dictionaries. The complication of compound words in Germanic languages was addressed. Additionally, the synonym and anatomical location collapse improve the method. Conclusions The developed dictionary and method can be used to identify possible ADEs in Danish clinical narratives.

In this paper, the problem of unsupervised dimensionality reduction for categorical data is first studied. Based on the theory of rough sets, the attributes of categorical data are decomposed into a number of rough subspaces. A novel clustering ensemble algorithm based on rough subspaces is then proposed to deal with categorical data. The algorithm employs some of rough subspaces with high quality to cluster the data and yields a robust and stable solution by exploiting the resulting partitions. We also introduce a cluster index to evaluate the solution of clustering algorithm for categorical data. Experimental results for selected UCI data sets show that the proposed method produces better results than those obtained by other methods when being evaluated in terms of cluster validity indexes.

A company (data owner) lacking in expertise or computational resources can outsource its mining needs to a third party service provider (server). However, both the items and the association rules of the outsourced database are considered private property of the corporation (data owner). To protect corporate privacy, the data owner transforms its data and ships it to the server, sends mining queries to the server, and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns received from the server. In this paper, we study the problem of outsourcing the association rule mining task within a corporate privacy-preserving framework. We propose an attack model based on background knowledge and devise a scheme for privacy preserving outsourced mining. Our scheme ensures that each transformed item is indistinguishable with respect to the attacker's background knowledge, from at least k-1 other transformed items. Our comprehensive experiments on a very large and real transaction database demonstrate that our techniques are effective, scalable, and protect privacy.

Like any other data mining task, web log mining starts with data cleaning and preparation and it ends up discovering some hidden knowledge which cannot be extracted using conventional methods. In order for this process to yield good results it has to rely on some good quality input data. Therefore, more focus in this process should be on data cleaning and pre-processing. On the other hand, one of the challenges facing online prediction is scalability. As a result any improvement in the efficiency of online prediction solutions is more than necessary. As a response to the aforementioned concerns we are proposing an enhancement to the web log mining process and to the online navigational pattern prediction. Our contribution contains three different components. First, we are proposing a refined time-out based heuristic for session identification. Second, we are suggesting the usage of a specific density based algorithm for navigational pattern discovery. Finally, a new approach for efficient online prediction is also suggested. The conducted experiments demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They are more distributed and networked, as supply chains, virtual organizations and corporate arrangements. By increasing the complexity of the decision making in dynamic competitive environment, managers need relevant strategic plans for their firms. In this paper, a new framework for strategic formulation based on clustering approach has been proposed to cope with these intricacies. After exploring internal and external factors influencing the goals of the organizational departments, the goal-factor matrices are formed based on their correlations. A clustering approach is applied to integrate goal-factor matrices to fulfill incorporate interactions among departments. Strategies would be formulated for clusters instead of departments individually or as organization totally. In fact, management by objective (MBO) has been substituted by management by cluster (MBC). The capability and usefulness of the proposed framework are shown through a case study in National Iranian Oil Company Training Center. Results indicate that the proposed strategic formulation outperforms other approaches and is very promising not only for solving the organization's problem, but also is appropriate for utilizing in other corporate organizations.

J	Lin, KW; Lo, YC				Lin, Kawuu W.; Lo, Yu-Chin			Efficient algorithms for frequent pattern mining in many-task computing environments	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Many-task computing; Cloud computing; Association rule mining; Frequent pattern mining	IMPLEMENTATION; MIDDLEWARE; GENERATION; CLUSTERS	The goal of data mining is to discover hidden useful information in large databases. Mining frequent patterns from transaction databases is an important problem in data mining. As the database size increases, the computation time and required memory also increase. Because the number of items increases, the user behaviours also become more complex. To solve the problem of increasing complexity, many researchers have applied parallel and distributed computing techniques to the discovery of frequent patterns from large amounts of data. However, most studies have focused on improving the performance for a single task and have neglected the many-task computing issue, which is important in the current cloud-computing environments. In these environments, an application is often provided as a service, e.g., the Google search engine, implying that many users can use it simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a set of algorithms, containing the Equal Working Set (EWS) algorithm, the Request On Demand (ROD) algorithm, the Small Size Working Set (SSWS) algorithm and the Progressive Size Working Set (PSWS) algorithm, for frequent pattern mining that provides a fast and scalable mining service in many-task computing environments. Through empirical evaluations in various simulation conditions, the proposed algorithms are shown to deliver excellent performance with respect to scalability and execution time.

Patterns of Knowledge in API Reference Documentation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						API documentation; software documentation; empirical study; content analysis; grounded method; data mining; pattern mining; Java; .NET	QUESTIONS	Reading reference documentation is an important part of programming with application programming interfaces (APIs). Reference documentation complements the API by providing information not obvious from the API syntax. To improve the quality of reference documentation and the efficiency with which the relevant information it contains can be accessed, we must first understand its content. We report on a study of the nature and organization of knowledge contained in the reference documentation of the hundreds of APIs provided as a part of two major technology platforms: Java SDK 6 and .NET 4.0. Our study involved the development of a taxonomy of knowledge types based on grounded methods and independent empirical validation. Seventeen trained coders used the taxonomy to rate a total of 5,574 randomly sampled documentation units to assess the knowledge they contain. Our results provide a comprehensive perspective on the patterns of knowledge in API documentation: observations about the types of knowledge it contains and how this knowledge is distributed throughout the documentation. The taxonomy and patterns of knowledge we present in this paper can be used to help practitioners evaluate the content of their API documentation, better organize their documentation, and limit the amount of low-value content. They also provide a vocabulary that can help structure and facilitate discussions about the content of APIs.

J	Maji, P; Garai, P				Maji, Pradipta; Garai, Partha			On fuzzy-rough attribute selection: Criteria of Max-Dependency, Max-Relevance, Min-Redundancy, and Max-Significance	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Data mining; Attribute selection; Rough sets; Classification	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; SETS; REDUCTION; FEATURES; INDEXES	Attribute selection is one of the important problems encountered in pattern recognition, machine learning, data mining, and bioinformatics. It refers to the problem of selecting those input attributes or features that are most effective to predict the sample categories. In this regard, rough set theory has been shown to be successful for selecting relevant and nonredundant attributes from a given data set. However, the classical rough sets are unable to handle real valued noisy features. This problem can be addressed by the fuzzy-rough sets, which are the generalization of classical rough sets. A feature selection method is presented here based on fuzzy-rough sets by maximizing both relevance and significance of the selected features. This paper also presents different feature evaluation criteria such as dependency, relevance, redundancy, and significance for attribute selection task using fuzzy-rough sets. The performance of different rough set models is compared with that of some existing feature evaluation indices based on the predictive accuracy of nearest neighbor rule, support vector machine, and decision tree. The effectiveness of the fuzzy-rough set based attribute selection method, along with a comparison with existing feature evaluation indices and different rough set models, is demonstrated on a set of benchmark and microarray gene expression data sets.

J	Marturana, F; Tacconi, S				Marturana, Fabio; Tacconi, Simone			A Machine Learning-based Triage methodology for automated categorization of digital media	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Digital Forensics Triage; Machine Learning; Automated digital device categorization; Crime-related feature extraction; Data mining algorithms; Child pornography exchange; Copyright infringement		The global diffusion of smartphones and tablets, exceeding traditional desktops and laptops market share, presents investigative opportunities and poses serious challenges to law enforcement agencies and forensic professionals. Traditional Digital Forensics techniques, indeed, may be no longer appropriate for timely analysis of digital devices found at the crime scene. Nevertheless, dealing with specific crimes such as murder, child abductions, missing persons, death threats, such activity may be crucial to speed up investigations. Motivated by this, the paper explores the field of Triage, a relatively new branch of Digital Forensics intended to provide investigators with actionable intelligence through digital media inspection, and describes a new interdisciplinary approach that merges Digital Forensics techniques and Machine Learning principles. The proposed Triage methodology aims at automating the categorization of digital media on the basis of plausible connections between traces retrieved (i.e. digital evidence) and crimes under investigation. As an application of the proposed method, two case studies about copyright infringement and child pornography exchange are then presented to actually prove that the idea is viable. The term "feature" will be regarded in the paper as a quantitative measure of a "plausible digital evidence", according to the Machine Learning terminology. In this regard, we (a) define a list of crime-related features, (b) identify and extract them from available devices and forensic copies, (c) populate an input matrix and (d) process it with different Machine Learning mining schemes to come up with a device classification. We perform a benchmark study about the most popular mining algorithms (i.e. Bayes Networks, Decision Trees, Locally Weighted Learning and Support Vector Machines) to find the ones that best fit the case in question. Obtained results are encouraging as we will show that, triaging a dataset of 13 digital media and 45 copyright infringement-related features, it is possible to obtain more than 93% of correctly classified digital media using Bayes Networks or Support Vector Machines while, concerning child pornography exchange, with a dataset of 23 cell phones and 23 crime-related features it is possible to classify correctly 100% of the phones. In this regards, methods to reduce the number of linearly independent features are explored and classification results presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Combining accuracy and success-rate to improve the performance of eXtended Classifier System (XCS) for data-mining and control applications	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classifier systems; XCS; Rule experience; Rule elimination; Reinforcement policy		The emergence of eXtended Classifier Systems (XCS) raised the bar for Learning Classifier Systems by incorporating the accuracies of the rules in the LCS's traditional reinforcement mechanism. However, neither XCS nor its extensions take into account the nature of a classifiers experience of attending the action set. We introduce an experience-evaluation mechanism that, once added to the traditional XCS, would assigns to each member of the action set a success rate indicating how effectively the classifier has contributed to the correct responding of the system to the environments queries. Application of the augmented system (called SRXCS) to several benchmark problems shows that the proposed mechanism enhances XCS classification capability and its rate of convergence at the same time. Application results indicate that SRXCS performs notably better on both pattern association and pattern recognition tasks. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed mechanism is further demonstrated through solving a fairly complex path planning problem for an autonomous mobile robot in a dynamic environment.

J	Pogorelc, B; Gams, M				Pogorelc, Bogdan; Gams, Matjaz			Detecting gait-related health problems of the elderly using multidimensional dynamic time warping approach with semantic attributes	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Health-problems detection; Human-motion analysis; Gait analysis; Machine learning; Data mining; Temporal data mining; Time-series data mining; Human locomotion; Elderly care; Ambient assisted living; Ambient media; Ambient intelligence; Ubiquitous computing; Pervasive health	CARE; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; DISEASE; FALL	We present a health-monitoring system based on the multidimensional dynamic time warping approach with semantic attributes for the detection of health problems in the elderly to prolong their autonomous living. The movement of the elderly user is captured with a motion-capture system that consists of body-worn tags, whose coordinates are acquired by sensors located in an apartment. The output time series of the coordinates are modeled with the proposed data-mining approach in order to recognize the specific health problem of an elderly person. This paper is an extension of our previous study, which proposed four data mining approaches to recognition of health problems, falls and activities of elderly from their motion patterns. The most successful of the four approaches is SMDTW (Multidimensional dynamic time-warping approach with semantic attributes), whose version is used and thoroughly analyzed in this paper. SMDTW is the modification of the DTW algorithm to use with the multidimensional time series with semantic attributes. To test the robustness of the SMDTW approach, this study calculates the DTW on the time series of various lengths. The semantic attributes presented here consist of the joint angles that are able to recognize many types of movement, e.g., health problems, falls and activities, in contrast to the more specific approaches with specific medically defined attributes from the literature. The k-nearest-neighbor classifier using SMDTW as a distance measure classifies movement of an elderly person into five different health states: one healthy and four unhealthy. Even though the new approach is more general and can be used to differentiate other types of activities or health problems, it achieves very high classification accuracy of 97.2%, comparable to the more specific approaches.

Such descriptors are of two types: 1) the vertex attributes that convey the information of the vertices themselves and 2) some topological properties used to describe the connectivity of the vertices. These descriptors are mostly of numerical or ordinal types and their similarity can be captured by quantifying their covariation. Mining topological patterns relies on frequent pattern mining and graph topology analysis to reveal the links that exist between the relation encoded by the graph and the vertex attributes. We propose three interestingness measures of topological patterns that differ by the pairs of vertices considered while evaluating up and down co-variations between vertex descriptors. An efficient algorithm that combines search and pruning strategies to look for the most relevant topological patterns is presented. Besides a classical empirical study, we report case studies on four real-life networks showing that our approach provides valuable knowledge.

Learning Bayesian network classifiers using ant colony optimization	SWARM INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); Data mining; Classification; Bayesian network classifiers	CLASSIFICATION RULE DISCOVERY; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; ALGORITHM; MINER	Bayesian networks are knowledge representation tools that model the (in)dependency relationships among variables for probabilistic reasoning. Classification with Bayesian networks aims to compute the class with the highest probability given a case. This special kind is referred to as Bayesian network classifiers. Since learning the Bayesian network structure from a dataset can be viewed as an optimization problem, heuristic search algorithms may be applied to build high-quality networks in medium- or large-scale problems, as exhaustive search is often feasible only for small problems. In this paper, we present our new algorithm, ABC-Miner, and propose several extensions to it. ABC-Miner uses ant colony optimization for learning the structure of Bayesian network classifiers. We report extended computational results comparing the performance of our algorithm with eight other classification algorithms, namely six variations of well-known Bayesian network classifiers, cAnt-Miner for discovering classification rules and a support vector machine algorithm.

The application presented in this paper consists in the estimation of the quality of base stations (BS) positioning in the architecture of a WiMAX network. Analysing the traffic of the considered WiMAX network, with an original data mining methodology based on long-range dependence, we determine which BS have a correct position in the topology of the network and which BS have an incorrect position. These BS must be repositioned when the next session of the network maintenance will take place.

We propose a perceptron-style method, latent structured perceptron, for fast discriminative learning of structured classification with hidden information. We also give theoretical analysis and demonstrate good convergence properties of the proposed method. Our method extends the perceptron algorithm for the learning task with hidden information, which can be hardly captured by traditional models. It relies on Viterbi decoding over latent variables, combined with simple additive updates. We perform experiments on one synthetic data set and two real-world structured classification tasks. Compared to conventional nonlatent models (e.g., conditional random fields, structured perceptrons), our method is more accurate on real-world tasks. Compared to existing heavy probabilistic models of latent variables (e.g., latent conditional random fields), our method lowers the training cost significantly (almost one order magnitude faster) yet with comparable or even superior classification accuracy. In addition, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has good scalability on large-scale problems.

However, there are some problems related to the integration scale to implement such switches in a single chip. An interesting alternative for building high-radix switches consists of combining several current smaller single-chip switches to obtain switches with a greater number of ports. A key design issue of this kind of high-radix switches is the internal switch configuration, specifically, the correspondence between the ports of these high-radix switches and the ports of their smaller internal single-chip switches. In this paper we use artificial intelligence and data mining techniques in order to obtain the optimal internal configuration of all the switches in the network of large supercomputers running parallel applications. Simulation results show that using the resultant switch configurations, it is possible to achieve similar performance as with single-chip switches with the same radix, which would be unfeasible with the current integration scale.

J	Wang, L; Hu, KY; Ku, T; Yan, XH				Wang, Liang; Hu, Kunyuan; Ku, Tao; Yan, Xiaohui			Mining frequent trajectory pattern based on vague space partition	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent trajectory pattern; Data mining; Vague space partition; PrefixSpan algorithm; GSP algorithm	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	Frequent trajectory pattern mining is an important spatiotemporal data mining problem with broad applications. However, it is also a difficult problem due to the approximate nature of spatial trajectory locations. Most of the previously developed frequent trajectory pattern mining methods explore a crisp space partition approach [8,10] to alleviate the spatial approximation concern. However, this approach may cause the sharp boundary problem that spatially close trajectory locations may fall into different partitioned regions, and eventually result in failure of finding meaningful trajectory patterns. In this paper, we propose a flexible vague space partition approach to solve the sharp boundary problem. In this approach, the spatial plane is divided into a set of vague grid cells, and trajectory locations are transformed into neighboring vague grid cells by a distance-based membership function. Based on two classical sequential mining algorithms, the PrefixSpan and GSP algorithms, we propose two efficient trajectory pattern mining algorithms, called VTPM-PrefixSpan and VTPM-GSP, to mine the transformed trajectory sequences with time interval constraints. A comprehensive performance study on both synthetic and real datasets shows that the VTPM-PrefixSpan algorithm outperforms the VTPM-GSP algorithm in both effectiveness and scalability.

Concept-adapting Very Fast Decision Tree (CVFDT) is one of the well-known streaming data mining techniques that can be applied to P2P traffic. However, we observe that P2P traffic data is class imbalanced, namely, only about 30 % of examples can be labeled as "P2P", biasing the trained models (e.g. decision tree) towards the majority class (i.e. "NonP2P"). In this paper, we propose a new technique, the imbalanced CVFDT (iCVFDT), by integrating the CVFDT with an efficient resampling technique to address the issue of the class imbalanced data. The iCVFDT classification technique enjoys the advantages of CVFDT (such as stability), and at the same time, is not sensitive to imbalanced data. We captured the Internet traffic at a main gateway and prepared a real data stream with 3.5 million examples to which the iCVFDT classification technique was applied. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of the iCVFDT compared to that of the CVFDT.

J	de Lope, J; Maravall, D				de Lope, Javier; Maravall, Dario			Data clustering using a linear cellular automata-based algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Cellular automata; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Data mining; Data clustering; Social segregation models; Ants clustering		In this paper we propose a novel data clustering algorithm based on the idea of considering the individual data items as cells belonging to a uni-dimensional cellular automaton. Our proposed algorithm combines insights into both social segregation models based on Cellular Automata Theory, where the data items themselves are able to move autonomously in lattices, and also from Ants Clustering algorithms, particularly in the idea of distributing at random the data items to be clustered in lattices. We also consider an automatic method for determining the number of clusters in the dataset by analyzing the intra-cluster variances. A series of experiments with both synthetic and real datasets are presented in order to study empirically the convergence and performance results. These experimental results are compared to the obtained by conventional clustering algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hence, companies operating on consumer markets face significant implementation complexities. However, successful implementation of market segmentation is reported problematic, despite being extensively researched and widely acknowledged as a powerful concept in practice. The desired outcome, and the knowledge discovery of market segmentation, is to reap the benefits of competitive advantage. This study takes Computers/Communications/Consumer (3C) products as an example and uses a two-step data mining approach to the cluster analysis and association rules to analyze customer channels and product segmentation. Moreover, we look at what kinds of products and brands customers of different segments prefer and how these preferences differ in relation to varying channel types. Thus, this study finds some 3C product-buying behavior patterns, including customer purchase preferences and customer purchase demands, in order to generate different 3C segmentation marketing alternatives.

A DOMAIN-INDEPENDENT, TRANSFERABLE AND TIMELY ANALYSIS APPROACH TO ASSESS STUDENT COLLABORATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Data mining; computer supported collaboration; machine learning; e-learning	SUBSET-SELECTION; RATING SCHEME; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY	Collaborative learning environments require intensive, regular and frequent analysis of the increasing amount of interaction data generated by students to assess that collaborative learning takes place. To support timely assessments that may benefit students and teachers the method of analysis must provide meaningful evaluations while the interactions take place. This research proposes machine learning-based techniques to infer the relationship between student collaboration and some quantitative domain-independent statistical indicators derived from large-scale evaluation analysis of student interactions. This paper (i) compares a set of metrics to identify the most suitable to assess student collaboration, (ii) reports on student evaluations of the metacognitive tools that display collaboration assessments from a new collaborative learning experience and (iii) extends previous findings to clarify modeling and usage issues. The advantages of the approach are: (1) it is based on domain-independent and generally observable features, (2) it provides regular and frequent data mining analysis with minimal teacher or student intervention, thereby supporting metacognition for the learners and corrective actions for the teachers, and (3) it can be easily transferred to other e-learning environments and include transferability features that are intended to facilitate its usage in other collaborative and social learning tools.

In particular, generative models are widely used and are very reliable in terms of overall performance. Success of these models hinges on their ability to construct a representation which captures the underlying statistical distribution of data. In this article, we focus on count data modeling. Indeed, this kind of data is naturally generated in many contexts and in different application domains. Usually, models based on the multinomial assumption are used in this case that may have several shortcomings, especially in the case of high-dimensional sparse data. We propose then a principled approach to smooth multinomials using a mixture of Beta-Liouville distributions which is learned to reflect and model prior beliefs about multinomial parameters, via both theoretical interpretations and experimental validations, we argue that the proposed smoothing model is general and flexible enough to allow accurate representation of count data.

Breakdown probability is proven to fit a Weibull distribution. For an engineering application, the lower limit of undervoltage ratio depends on breakdown probability, and the upper limit of undervoltage ratio depends on self-breakdown probability. Some characteristics have been determined experimentally, such as the influence of the air pressure and the influence of the undervoltage ratio on spark gap operation. Curve fitting and quasi-data mining are good methods for research on triggering characteristic in the paper. Therefore, a maximum operation range curve and a boundary line of expected delay time could be determined by application requirements, theory calculation, experimental data and curve fitting. On this basis, optimization operation range could be obtained, which represents a preferable performance of breakdown with expected delay time. It may provide guidance for engineering application.

J	Chang, JH; Park, NH				Chang, Joong Hyuk; Park, Nam Hun			Finding Interesting Sequential Patterns in Sequence Data Streams via a Time-Interval Weighting Approach	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						time-interval weight; weighted sequential pattern; time-interval sequential pattern; time-interval sequence data stream; data stream	ONLINE DATA STREAMS; FREQUENT ITEMSETS; DATABASES; ALGORITHM	The mining problem over data streams has recently been attracting considerable attention thanks to the usefulness of data mining in Various application fields of information science, and sequence data streams are so common in daily life. Therefore, a study on mining sequential patterns over sequence data streams can give valuable results for wide use in various application fields. This paper proposes a new framework for mining novel interesting sequential patterns over a sequence data stream and a mining method based on the framework. Assuming that a sequence with small time-intervals between its data elements is more valuable than others with large time-intervals, the novel interesting sequential pattern is defined and found by analyzing the time-intervals of data elements in a sequence as well as their orders. The proposed framework is capable of obtaining more interesting sequential patterns over sequence data streams whose data elements are highly correlated in terms of generation time.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Algorithms; decision support systems; decision trees; open-source software; student experiments	TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	University students are usually taught data mining through black-box data mining algorithms, which hide the algorithm's details from the user and optionally allow parameter adjustment. This minimizes the effort required to use these algorithms. On the other hand, white-box algorithms reveal the algorithm's structure, allowing users to assemble algorithms from algorithm building blocks. This paper provides a comparison between students' acceptance of both black-box and white-box decision tree algorithms. For these purposes, the technology acceptance model is used. The model is extended with perceived understanding and the influence it has on acceptance of decision tree algorithms. An experiment was conducted with 118 senior management students who were divided into two groups-one working with black-box, and the other with white-box algorithms-and their cognitive styles were analyzed. The results of how cognitive styles affect the perceived understanding of students when using decision tree algorithms with different levels of algorithm transparency are reported here.

However, no research on plastic bearing fault diagnostics using vibration sensors has been reported. In this paper, a two-step data mining-based approach for plastic bearing fault diagnostics using vibration sensors is presented. The two-step approach utilizes envelope analysis and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to preprocess vibration signals and extract frequency domain and time domain fault features as condition indicators (CIs) for plastic bearing fault diagnosis. In the first step, the frequency domain CIs are used by a statistical classification model to identify bearing outer race faults. In the second step, the time domain CIs extracted using EMD are developed to build a k-nearest neighbor algorithm-based fault classifier to identify other types of bearing faults. Seeded fault tests on plastic bearing outer race, inner race, balls, and cage are conducted on a bearing diagnostic test rig and real vibration signals are collected. The effectiveness of the presented fault diagnostic approach is validated using the plastic bearing seeded fault testing data.

These networks allow users to publish details about themselves and to connect to their friends. Some of the information revealed inside these networks is meant to be private. Yet it is possible to use learning algorithms on released data to predict private information. In this paper, we explore how to launch inference attacks using released social networking data to predict private information. We then devise three possible sanitization techniques that could be used in various situations. Then, we explore the effectiveness of these techniques and attempt to use methods of collective inference to discover sensitive attributes of the data set. We show that we can decrease the effectiveness of both local and relational classification algorithms by using the sanitization methods we described.

A hybrid scheme for energy-efficient object tracking in sensor networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Object tracking sensor networks; Schedule monitoring; Recovery mechanism; Temporal movement pattern; Data mining		Energy saving is a critical issue in many sensor-network-based applications. Among the existing sensor-network-based applications, the surveillance application has attracted extensive attention. Object tracking in sensor networks (OTSNs) is a typical surveillance application. Previous studies on energy saving for OTSNs can be divided into two main approaches: (1) improvements in hardware design to lower the energy consumption of attached components and (2) improvements in software to predict the movement of objects. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, namely hybrid tracking scheme (HTS), for tracking objects with energy efficiency. The scheme consists of the two parts: (1) adaptive schedule monitoring and (2) a recovery mechanism integrated with seamless temporal movement patterns and seeding-based flooding to relocate missing objects with the purpose of saving energy. Furthermore, we also propose a frequently visited periods mining algorithm, which discovers the corresponding frequently visited periods for adaptive schedule monitoring efficiently from the visitation information of sensor nodes. To decrease the number of sensor nodes activated in flooding, a seeding-based flooding mechanism is first proposed in our work. Empirical evaluations of various simulation conditions and real datasets show that the proposed HTS delivers excellent performance in terms of energy efficiency and low missing rates.

The proposed DMHCCA consists of two-level evolutions: the neuro-level evolution (NULE) and the network-level evolution (NWLE). In NULE, a data mining-based evolutionary learning algorithm is utilized to evolve neurons. The good combinations of neurons evolved in NULE are reserved for being the initial populations of NWLE. In NWLE, the initial population are mated and mutated to produce new structure of networks. Similar to NULE, the good neurons of evolved network in NWLE are inserted into the NULE. Thus, by interactive two-level evolutions, the neurons and structure of network can be evolved locally and globally, respectively. Simulation results using DMHCCA are reported and compared with other existing models. Application of DMHCCA to a three-dimensional (3D) surface alignment task is also described, and experimental results are presented better performance than other alignment systems.

We first observe that existing approaches use one or more of the following named entity similarity metrics: entity, entity context, and relationship. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new holistic approach by 1) combining all similarity types used and 2) additionally considering relationship context similarity between pairs of named entities, a missing quadrant in the taxonomy of similarity metrics. We abstract the named entity translation problem as the matching of two named entity graphs extracted from the comparable corpora. Specifically, named entity graphs are first constructed from comparable corpora to extract relationship between named entities. Entity similarity and entity context similarity are then calculated from every pair of bilingual named entities. A reinforcing method is utilized to reflect relationship similarity and relationship context similarity between named entities. We also discover "latent" features lost in the graph extraction process and integrate this into our framework. According to our experimental results, our holistic graph-based approach and its enhancement using corpus latent features are highly effective and our framework significantly outperforms previous approaches.

Two parameters, energy consumption and wastewater flow rate after the pumping system, are used to evaluate the performance of 27 scenarios while the pump was operating. Five data-mining algorithms are applied to identify the relationships between the outputs (energy consumption and wastewater flow rate) and the inputs (elevation level of the wet well and the speed of the pumps). The accuracy of the flow rate and energy consumption models exceeded 90%. The derived models are deployed to optimize the pump system. The computational results obtained with the proposed models are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Luo, DJ; Ding, C; Huang, H				Luo, Dijun; Ding, Chris; Huang, Heng			Toward structural sparsity: an explicit approach	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Structural sparsity; Sparse learning; Multitask learning	VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL SELECTION; FUSED LASSO; REGRESSION; SHRINKAGE; ALGORITHM	As powerful tools, machine learning and data mining techniques have been widely applied in various areas. However, in many real-world applications, besides establishing accurate black box predictors, we are also interested in white box mechanisms, such as discovering predictive patterns in data that enhance our understanding of underlying physical, biological and other natural processes. For these purposes, sparse representation and its variations have been one of the focuses. More recently, structural sparsity has attracted increasing attentions. In previous research, structural sparsity was often achieved by imposing convex but non-smooth norms such as and group norms. In this paper, we present the explicit and group norm to directly approach the structural sparsity. To tackle the problem of intractable optimizations, we develop a general Lipschitz auxiliary function that leads to simple iterative algorithms. In each iteration, optimal solution is achieved for the induced subproblem and a guarantee of convergence is provided. Furthermore, the local convergent rate is also theoretically bounded. We test our optimization techniques in the multitask feature learning problem. Experimental results suggest that our approaches outperform other approaches in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

J	Maji, P; Garai, P				Maji, Pradipta; Garai, Partha			Fuzzy-Rough Simultaneous Attribute Selection and Feature Extraction Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Attribute selection; classification; feature extraction; pattern recognition; rough sets	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SETS; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	Among the huge number of attributes or features present in real-life data sets, only a small fraction of them are effective to represent the data set accurately. Prior to analysis of the data set, selecting or extracting relevant and significant features is an important preprocessing step used for pattern recognition, data mining, and machine learning. In this regard, a novel dimensionality reduction method, based on fuzzy-rough sets, that simultaneously selects attributes and extracts features using the concept of feature significance is presented. The method is based on maximizing both the relevance and significance of the reduced feature set, whereby redundancy therein is removed. This paper also presents classical and neighborhood rough sets for computing the relevance and significance of the feature set and compares their performances with that of fuzzy-rough sets based on the predictive accuracy of nearest neighbor rule, support vector machine, and decision tree. An important finding is that the proposed dimensionality reduction method based on fuzzy-rough sets is shown to be more effective for generating a relevant and significant feature subset. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy-rough-set-based dimensionality reduction method, along with a comparison with existing attribute selection and feature extraction methods, is demonstrated on real-life data sets.

Consequently, software developers must face new challenges because of bug patterns occurring at runtime and due to the non-deterministic behavior of multi-threaded program executions. This calls for new defect-localization techniques. There has been much work in the field of defect localization for sequential programs on the one side and on the localization of specific multithreading bugs on the other side, but we are not aware of any general technique for multithreaded programs. This paper proposes such an approach. It generalizes data mining-based defect-localization techniques for sequential programs. The techniques work by analyzing call graphs. More specifically, we propose new graph representations of multithreaded program executions as well as two mining-based localization approaches based on these representations. Our evaluation shows that our technique yields good results and is able to find defects that other approaches cannot localize.

J	Palanichamy, J; Ramasamy, K				Palanichamy, Jaganathan; Ramasamy, Kuppuchamy			A NOVEL FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM WITH SUPERVISED MUTUAL INFORMATION FOR CLASSIFICATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Mutual information; feature selection; classification; C4.5; support vector machines	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION	Feature selection is essential in data mining and pattern recognition, especially for database classification. During past years, several feature selection algorithms have been proposed to measure the relevance of various features to each class. A suitable feature selection algorithm normally maximizes the relevancy and minimizes the redundancy of the selected features. The mutual information measure can successfully estimate the dependency of features on the entire sampling space, but it cannot exactly represent the redundancies among features. In this paper, a novel feature selection algorithm is proposed based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy criterion. The mutual information is used to measure the relevancy of each feature with class variable and calculate the redundancy by utilizing the relationship between candidate features, selected features and class variables. The effectiveness is tested with ten benchmarked datasets available in UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results show better performance when compared with some existing algorithms.

Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing with intrinsic mode function of acoustic emission data using APF-KNN	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Acoustic emission; KNN; Statistical feature; Ball bearing; Hilbert Hung transform	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique based on acoustic emission (AE) analysis with the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and data mining tool. HHT analyzes the AE signal using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are extracted using the process of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Instead of time domain approach with Hilbert transform, FFT of IMFs from HHT process are utilized to represent the time frequency domain approach for efficient signal response from rolling element bearing. Further, extracted statistical and acoustic features are used to select proper data mining based fault classifier with or without filter. K-nearest neighbor algorithm is observed to be more efficient classifier with default setting parameters in WEKA. APF-KNN approach, which is based on asymmetric proximity function with optimize feature selection shows better classification accuracy is used. Experimental evaluation for time frequency approach is presented for five bearing conditions such as healthy bearing, bearing with outer race, inner race, ball and combined defect. The experimental results show that the proposed method can increase reliability for the faults diagnosis of ball bearing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pandya, D. H.; Upadhyay, S.

A maximum-margin genetic algorithm for misclassification cost minimizing feature selection problem	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Cost sensitive classification; Support vector machines; Classification; Data mining	CLASSIFICATION; EVOLUTIONARY; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFIERS; DESIGN; MODEL	We consider a feature selection problem where the decision-making objective is to minimize overall misclassification cost by selecting relevant features from a training dataset We propose a two-stage solution approach for solving misclassification cost minimizing feature selection (MCMFS) problem. Additionally, we propose a maximum-margin genetic algorithm (MMGA) that maximizes margin of separation between classes by taking into account all examples as opposed to maximizing margin of separation using a few support vectors. Feature selection is carried out by either an exhaustive or a heuristic simulated annealing approach in the first stage and a cost sensitive classification using either MMGA or cost sensitive support vector machines (SVM) in the second stage. Using simulated and real-world data sets and different misclassification cost matrices, we test our two-stage approach for solving the MCMFS problem. Our results indicate that feature selection plays an important role when misclassification cost asymmetries increase and the MMGA shows equal or better performance than the SVM.

However, in the distance metric learning framework, previous studies have mainly focused on the classification performance. In this work, we consider the distance metric learning problem in the ranking setting, where predicting the order between the data vectors is more important than predicting the class labels. We focus on two problems: improving the ranking prediction accuracy and identifying the latent structure of the data. The core of our model consists of ranking the data using a Mahalanobis distance function. The additional use of non-negativity constraints and an entropy-based cost function allows us to simultaneously minimize the ranking error while identifying useful meta-features. To demonstrate its usefulness for information retrieval applications, we compare the performance of our method with four other methods on four UCI data sets, three text data sets, and four image data sets. Our approach shows good ranking accuracies, especially when few training data are available. We also use our model to extract and interpret the latent structure of the data sets. In addition, our approach is simple to implement and computationally efficient and can be used for data embedding and visualization.

Some works are focusing on detecting VF based on numerical analysis of time-frequency distributions, but in general the methods used do not provide insight into the problem. However, this study proposes a new methodology in order to obtain information about this problem. This work uses a supervised self-organising map (SOM) to obtain visually information among four important groups of patients: VF (ventricular fibrillation), VT (ventricular tachycardia), HP (healthy patients) and AHR (other anomalous heart rates and noise). A total number of 27 variables were obtained from continuous surface ECG recordings in standard databases (MIT and AHA), providing information in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. self-organising maps (SOMs), trained with 11 of the 27 variables, were used to extract knowledge about the variable values for each group of patients. Results show that the SOM technique allows to determine the profile of each group of patients, assisting in gaining a deeper understanding of this clinical problem. Additionally, information about the most relevant variables is given by the SOM analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Samet, S; Miri, A; Granger, E				Samet, Saeed; Miri, Ali; Granger, Eric			Incremental learning of privacy-preserving Bayesian networks	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Security and privacy preserving; Bayesian networks; Incremental learning; Data mining and machine learning	COMPUTATION	Bayesian Networks (BNs) have received significant attention in various academic and industrial applications, such as modeling knowledge in image processing, engineering, medicine and bio-informatics. Preserving the privacy of sensitive data, owned by different parties, is often a critical issue. However, in many practical applications, BNs must train from data that gradually becomes available at different period of times, on which the traditional batch learning algorithms are not suitable or applicable. In this paper, an algorithm based on a new and efficient version of Sufficient Statistics is proposed for incremental learning with BNs. The standard kappa 2 algorithm is also modified to be utilized inside the incremental learning algorithm. Next, some secure building blocks such as secure comparison, and factorial, which are resistant against colluding attacks and could be applied securely over public channels like internet, are presented to be used inside the main protocol. Then a privacy-preserving protocol is proposed for incremental learning of BNs, in which the structure and probabilities are estimated incrementally from homogeneously distributed and gradually available data among two or multi-parties. Finally, security and complexity analysis along with the experimental results are presented to compare with the batch algorithm and to show its performance and applicability in real world applications.

Conventional sequence data mining methods could be divided into two categories: Apriori-like methods and pattern growth methods. In a sequential pattern, probability of time between two adjacent events could provide valuable information for decision-makers. As far as we know, there has been no methodology developed to extract this probability in the sequential pattern mining process. We extend the PrefixSpan algorithm and propose a new sequential pattern mining approach: P-PrefixSpan. Besides minimum support-count constraint, this approach imposes minimum time-probability constraint, so that fewer but more reliable patterns will be obtained. P-PrefixSpan is compared with PrefixSpan in terms of number of patterns obtained and execution efficiency. Our experimental results show that P-PrefixSpan is an efficient and scalable method for sequential pattern mining. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Constructing a dental implant ontology for domain specific clustering and life span analysis	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Clustering; Key phrase extraction; Dental implant ontology; Life span analysis	PATENT ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; TOOL	Dental implant and prosthetics is a growing industry that follows the increasing aged populations that incur a higher percentage of tooth loss [1]. The dental implant sector is one of the most technical oriented fields in dentistry with many new techniques, devices, and materials being invented and put to clinical trials. Most innovations and technologies tend to be protected by intellectual property rights (IPRs) through patents. Thus, this research identifies the life spans of dental implant (DI) key technologies using patent analysis. Key patents and their frequently appearing phrases are analyzed for the construction of the DI ontology. Afterward, the life spans of DI technical clusters are defined based on the ontology schema. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using text mining and data mining techniques to extract key phrases from a set of DI patents with different patent classifications (e.g., UPC, IPC) as the basis for building a domain-specific ontology. The case study of ontological sub-clustering for dental implants demonstrates life span mapping of the technology and the ability to use clusters to represent stages of development and maturity in specific technology life cycles.

Efficient Algorithms for Mining High Utility Itemsets from Transactional Databases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Candidate pruning; frequent itemset; high utility itemset; utility mining; data mining	MOBILE SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION RULES; FREQUENT PATTERNS; COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT	Mining high utility itemsets from a transactional database refers to the discovery of itemsets with high utility like profits. Although a number of relevant algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they incur the problem of producing a large number of candidate itemsets for high utility itemsets. Such a large number of candidate itemsets degrades the mining performance in terms of execution time and space requirement. The situation may become worse when the database contains lots of long transactions or long high utility itemsets. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely utility pattern growth (UP-Growth) and UP-Growth(+), for mining high utility itemsets with a set of effective strategies for pruning candidate itemsets. The information of high utility itemsets is maintained in a tree-based data structure named utility pattern tree (UP-Tree) such that candidate itemsets can be generated efficiently with only two scans of database. The performance of UP-Growth and UP-Growth(+) is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on many types of both real and synthetic data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms, especially UP-Growth(+), not only reduce the number of candidates effectively but also outperform other algorithms substantially in terms of runtime, especially when databases contain lots of long transactions.

The result of this test is obtained after a time period of about 45 days. The purpose of this study is to develop a data mining solution that makes diagnosis of tuberculosis as accurate as possible and helps deciding whether it is reasonable to start tuberculosis treatment on suspected patients without waiting for the exact medical test results. We proposed the use of Sugeno-type "adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system" (ANFIS) to predict the existence of mycobacterium tuberculosis. Data set collected from 503 different patient records which are obtained from a private health clinic (consent of physicians and patients). Patient record has 30 different attributes which covers demographical and medical test data. ANFIS model was generated by using 250 records. Also, rough set method was implemented by using the same data set. The ANFIS model classifies the instances with correctness of 97 %, whereas rough set algorithm does the same classification with correctness of 92 %. This study has a contribution on forecasting patients before the medical tests.

J	Wu, CH; Kao, SC; Okuhara, K				Wu, ChienHsing; Kao, Shu-Chen; Okuhara, Koji			Examination and comparison of conflicting data in granulated datasets: Equal width interval vs. equal frequency interval	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Granulation; Conflicting data	DISCRETIZATION ALGORITHM; PERSPECTIVE; KNOWLEDGE; KDD	Knowledge discovery from databases requires comprehensive pre-examination to ensure that granulated datasets are consistent for continuous database conversion. Different granulation techniques may produce different results in the number of conflicting data in a granulated dataset. This work examines and compares the performance of equal width interval (EWI) and equal frequency interval (EFI), two granulation techniques. This work also explores the relationship between granulation performance and dataset size, number of attributes, and number of classes. Eighteen continuous datasets are examined. Experimental results indicate that (1) of the 18 datasets examined, 7 contained conflicting data by EWI and 8 by EFI, suggesting that almost 40% of the granulated datasets contained conflicting data; (2) almost 22% of the datasets had more than 20% conflicting data; (3) comparatively, no notable difference existed between EWI and EFI with respect to their granulation performance; (4) the production of conflicting data by EWI and EFI when compared against dataset size and number of classes was not remarkably different; and (5) more than 12 attributes will reduce the number of conflicting data by both EWI and EFI.

A partial periodic pattern consists of some periodic and non-periodic events in a specific period length, and is repeated with high frequency in an event sequence. In the past, a max-subpattern hit set algorithm was developed to discover partial periodic patterns, but its drawback is spending a large amount of time in calculating frequency counts from the redundant candidate nodes. In this study, we thus adopt an efficient encoding strategy to speed up the efficiency of processing period segments in an event sequence, and combined with the projection method to quickly find the partial periodic patterns in the recursive process. Finally, the experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of the existing clustering methods, for example, normalized cut and k-means, have been suffering from the fact that their optimization processes normally lead to an NP-hard problem due to the discretization of the elements in the cluster indicator matrix. A practical way to cope with this problem is to relax this constraint to allow the elements to be continuous values. The eigenvalue decomposition can be applied to generate a continuous solution, which has to be further discretized. However, the continuous solution is probably mixing-signed. This result may cause it deviate severely from the true solution, which should be naturally nonnegative. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, i.e., discriminative nonnegative spectral clustering, to explicitly impose an additional nonnegative constraint on the cluster indicator matrix to seek for a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we show an effective regularization term which is able to not only provide more useful discriminative information but also learn a mapping function to predict cluster labels for the out-of-sample test data. Extensive experiments on various data sets illustrate the superiority of our proposal compared to the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

Thereafter, patients may develop morbidity because of the complex reconstruction and loss of pancreatic parenchyma. A well-designed database is very important to address both the short-term and long-term outcomes after PD. Objective: The objective of this research was to build an international PD database implemented with security and clinical rule supporting functions, which made the data-sharing easier and improve the accuracy of data. Methods: The proposed system is a cloud-based application. To fulfill its requirements, the system comprises four subsystems: a data management subsystem, a clinical rule supporting subsystem, a short message notification subsystem, and an information security subsystem. After completing the surgery, the physicians input the data retrospectively, which are analyzed to study factors associated with post-PD common complications (delayed gastric emptying and pancreatic fistula) to validate the clinical value of this system. Results: Currently, this database contains data from nearly 500 subjects. Five medical centers in Taiwan and two cancer centers in Mongolia are participating in this study. A data mining model of the decision tree analysis showed that elderly patients (>76 years) with pylorus-preserving PD (PPPD) have higher proportion of delayed gastric emptying. About the pancreatic fistula, the data mining model of the decision tree analysis revealed that cases with non-pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) reconstruction - body mass index (BMI) > 29.65 or PG reconstruction -BMI > 23.7 -non-classic PD have higher proportion of pancreatic fistula after PD. Conclusions: The proposed system allows medical staff to collect and store clinical data in a cloud, sharing the data with other physicians in a secure manner to achieve collaboration in research.

Contributions of this paper include two aspects. (1) Due to the fact that the images are mostly stored and transmitted with JPEG compressed format on Internet, feature extraction is directly performed in the compressed domain. The exacted features include those derived from skin color regions, the results of image retrieval, human face and region of interest, as well as the global features of color and texture. (2) Data mining method is employed to search for the potential decision rules from large-scale image feature sets. Taken the misclassification cost and test cost into account, multi-cost sensitive decision tree is constructed first to improve the recognition speed and accuracy. Furthermore, the concept of pornography degree is introduced into the decision rules, which is output as the recognition results to represent the probability of the image being judged as pornographic. Experimental results show that, the recognition speed of the proposed method is almost three times faster than the classical pixel domain-based recognition method, and the recognition accuracy is also higher in terms of True Alarm Rate (TPR) and False Alarm Rate (FPR).

A principled approach to network-based classification and data representation	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Dataset visualisation; Interpretable model; Fisher information; Riemannian metric; Similarity network; Community detection	METRICS	Measures of similarity are fundamental in pattern recognition and data mining. Typically the Euclidean metric is used in this context, weighting all variables equally and therefore assuming equal relevance, which is very rare in real applications. In contrast, given an estimate of a conditional density function, the Fisher information calculated in primary data space implicitly measures the relevance of variables in a principled way by reference to auxiliary data such as class labels. This paper proposes a framework that uses a distance metric based on Fisher information to construct similarity networks that achieve a more informative and principled representation of data. The framework enables efficient retrieval of reference cases from which a weighted nearest neighbour classifier closely approximates the original density function. Importantly, the identification of nearby data points permits the retrieval of further information with potential relevance to the assessment of a new case. The practical application of the method is illustrated for six benchmark datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ruiz, Hector; Etchells, Terence A.; Jarman, Ian H.; Lisboa, Paulo J.

Their use in domains where interpretability is an issue is therefore hampered. In order to bridge the gap between advanced modeling techniques and their use in domains that demand interpretable results, the interpretability aspect should be included in the design of the technique. The Interval Coded Score index (ICS) is a recently proposed model that satisfies this condition and automatically detects thresholds on variables to generate score systems. The method was extended for censored data (ICSc) but two problems remain: (i) given a prognostic index, how can observations be grouped in different risk groups; (ii) given the risk groups, how can survival curves be estimated for survival models based on support vector machines or ICS models. This work offers solutions to both these problems. The ICSc model is used on the prognostic index to detect thresholds on this index. A grouped index, that can be interpreted as a risk group indicator, is the result. The method is then modified to ensure that observations with a lower prognostic index are allocated to higher risk groups. The second problem is tackled by simultaneously estimating multiple Kaplan-Meier curves, taking into account that the estimated survival curve for higher risk groups should always be lower than the curve for lower risk groups. The proposed approach is illustrated on the prognosis of breast cancer patients and compared with the proportional hazard model. Both models are comparable w.r.t discrimination, but calibration is better for the ICSc risk groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Large volumes of data are being produced by quantum chemistry calculations, which provide increasing accurate estimations of several properties, e.g. by Density Functional Theory (DFT), but are still too computationally expensive for those large scale uses. This work explores the possibility of using large amounts of data generated by DFT methods for thousands of molecular structures, extracting relevant molecular properties and applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to learn from the data. Once trained, these ML models can be applied to new structures to produce ultra-fast predictions. An approach is presented for homolytic bond dissociation energy (BDE). Results: Machine learning models were trained with a data set of >12,000 BDEs calculated by B3LYP/6-311++G (d,p)//DFTB. Descriptors were designed to encode atom types and connectivity in the 2D topological environment of the bonds. The best model, an Associative Neural Network (ASNN) based on 85 bond descriptors, was able to predict the BDE of 887 bonds in an independent test set (covering a range of 17.67-202.30 kcal/mol) with RMSD of 5.29 kcal/mol, mean absolute deviation of 3.35 kcal/mol, and R-2 = 0.953. The predictions were compared with semi-empirical PM6 calculations, and were found to be superior for all types of bonds in the data set, except for O-H, N-H, and N-N bonds. The B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)//DFTB calculations can approach the higher-level calculations B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) with an RMSD of 3.04 kcal/mol, which is less than the RMSD of ASNN (against both DFT methods). An experimental web service for on-line prediction of BDEs is available at http://joao.airesdesousa.com/bde. Conclusion: Knowledge could be automatically extracted by machine learning techniques from a data set of calculated BDEs, providing ultra-fast access to accurate estimations of DFT-calculated BDEs. This demonstrates how to extract value from large volumes of data currently being produced by quantum chemistry calculations at an increasing speed mostly without human intervention. In this way, high-level theoretical quantum calculations can be used in large-scale applications that otherwise would not afford the intrinsic computational cost.	[Qu, Xiaohui; Latino, Diogo A. R.

J	Adhikari, A				Adhikari, Animesh			Clustering local frequency items in multiple databases	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Association; Clustering; Data mining; Measure of association; Multi-database mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; DATA STREAMS; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Frequent items could be considered as a basic type of patterns in a database. In the context of multiple data sources, most of the global patterns are based on local frequency items. A multi-branch company transacting from different branches often needs to extract global patterns from data distributed over the branches. Global decisions could be taken effectively using such patterns. Thus, it is important to cluster local frequency items in multiple databases. An overview of the existing measures of association is presented here. For the purpose of selecting the suitable technique of mining multiple databases, we have surveyed the existing multi-database mining techniques. A study on the related clustering techniques is also covered here. The notion of high frequency itemsets is introduced here, and an algorithm for synthesizing supports of such itemsets is designed. The existing clustering technique might cluster local frequency items at a low level, since it estimates association among items in an itemset with a low accuracy, and thus a new algorithm for clustering local frequency items is proposed. Due to the suitability of measure of association A(2), association among items in a high frequency itemset is synthesized based on it. The soundness of the clustering technique has been shown. Numerous experiments are conducted using five datasets, and the results on different aspects of the proposed problem are presented in the experimental section. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering technique is more visible in dense databases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Shelokar, P; Quirin, A; Cordon, O				Shelokar, Prakash; Quirin, Arnaud; Cordon, Oscar			A multiobjective evolutionary programming framework for graph-based data mining	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Graph-based data mining; Frequent subgraph mining; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Pareto optimality; Multiobjective graph-based data mining; Multiobjective evolutionary programming	REGULATORY NETWORK; BOOLEAN QUERIES; ALGORITHM; DISCOVERY; SUBSTRUCTURES; SUBGRAPHS; DATABASES; SEARCH	Subgraph mining is the process of identifying concepts describing interesting and repetitive subgraphs within graph-based data. The exponential number of possible subgraphs makes the problem very challenging. Existing methods apply a single-objective subgraph search with the view that interesting subgraphs are those capable of not merely compressing the data, but also enhancing the interpretation of the data considerably. Usually the methods operate by posing simple constraints (or user-defined thresholds) such as returning all subgraphs whose frequency is above a specified threshold. Such search approach may often return either a large number of solutions in the case of a weakly defined objective or very few in the case of a very strictly defined objective. In this paper, we propose a framework based on multiobjective evolutionary programming to mine subgraphs by jointly maximizing two objectives, support and size of the extracted subgraphs. The proposed methodology is able to discover a nondominated set of interesting subgraphs subject to tradeoff between the two objectives, which otherwise would not be achieved by the single-objective search. Besides, it can use different specific multiobjective evolutionary programming methods. Experimental results obtained by three of the latter methods on synthetically generated as well as real-life graph-based datasets validate the utility of the proposed methodology when benchmarked against classical single-objective methods and their previous, nonevolutionary multiobjective extensions.

Mobile Data Mining is the process of intelligently analyzing continuous data streams on mobile devices. The use of mobile data mining for real-time business intelligence applications can be greatly advantageous. Past research has shown that resource-aware adaptation of data stream mining can significantly improve the continuity of data mining operations in mobile environments. The key underlying premise is that by varying the accuracy of the analysis process in accordance with changing available resource levels, the longevity and continuity of mobile data mining applications is ensured. In this article we qualitatively extend the notion of resource-aware adaptation of mobile data mining to holistically enable situation-awareness feature for user applications. We then present a novel generic toolkit that enables building situation and resource-aware mobile data mining applications and describe along with underlying theoretical foundations of resource and situation criticality, awareness and adaptation, which are entirely transparent and hidden from the user. The Open Mobile Miner (OMM) toolkit builds on our research for performing adaptive analysis of data streams on mobile/embedded devices. Finally, we describe a mobile health monitoring application as a case study and discuss the results of our conducted experimental evaluation which demonstrate the adaptation transparency and easy use of OMM for building mobile data mining applications such as stock market monitoring and real estate data analysis.

Being among the major types of these diseases, correct and in-time diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is very important. Angiography is the most accurate CAD diagnosis method; however, it has many side effects and is costly. Existing studies have used several features in collecting data from patients, while applying different data mining algorithms to achieve methods with high accuracy and less side effects and costs. In this paper, a dataset called Z-Alizadeh Sani with 303 patients and 54 features, is introduced which utilizes several effective features. Also, a feature creation method is proposed to enrich the dataset. Then Information Gain and confidence were used to determine the effectiveness of features on CAD. Typical Chest Pain, Region RWMA2, and age were the most effective ones besides the created features by means of Information Gain. Moreover Q Wave and ST Elevation had the highest confidence. Using data mining methods and the feature creation algorithm, 94.08% accuracy is achieved, which is higher than the known approaches in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Alvarez, MR; Felix, P; Carinena, P				Alvarez, Miguel R.; Felix, Paulo; Carinena, Purificacion			Discovering metric temporal constraint networks on temporal databases	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Temporal data mining; Temporal knowledge representation; Constraint satisfaction problems; Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION RULES; MEDICAL DOMAINS; TIME-SERIES; GUIDELINES; DIAGNOSIS; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Objective: In this paper, we propose the ASTPminer algorithm for mining collections of time-stamped sequences to discover frequent temporal patterns, as represented in the simple temporal problem (STP) formalism: a representation of temporal knowledge as a set of event types and a set of metric temporal constraints among them. To focus the mining process, some initial knowledge can be provided by the user, also expressed as an STP, that acts as a seed pattern for the searching procedure. In this manner, the mining algorithm will search for those frequent temporal patterns consistent with the initial knowledge. Background: Health organisations demand, for multiple areas of activity, new computational tools that will obtain new knowledge from huge collections of data. Temporal data mining has arisen as an active research field that provides new algorithms for discovering new temporal knowledge. An important point in defining different proposals is the expressiveness of the resulting temporal knowledge, which is commonly found in the bibliography in a qualitative form. Methodology: ASTPminer develops an Apriori-like strategy in an iterative algorithm where, as a result of each iteration i, a set of frequent temporal patterns of size i is found that incorporates three distinctive mechanisms: (1) use of a clustering procedure over distributions of temporal distances between events to recognise similar occurrences as temporal patterns; (2) consistency checking of every combination of temporal patterns, which ensures the soundness of the resultant patterns; and (3) use of seed patterns to allow the user to drive the mining process. Results: To validate our proposal, several experiments were conducted over a database of time-stamped sequences obtained from polysomnography tests in patients with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. ASTPminer was able to extract well-known temporal patterns corresponding to different manifestations of the syndrome. Furthermore, the use of seed patterns resulted in a reduction in the size of the search space, which reduced the number of possible patterns from 2.1 x 10(7) to 1219 and reduced the number of frequent patterns found from 1167 to 340, thereby increasing the efficiency of the mining algorithm. Conclusions: A temporal data mining technique for discovering frequent temporal patterns in collections of time-stamped event sequences is presented. The resulting patterns describe different and distinguishable temporal arrangements among sets of event types in terms of repetitive appearance and similarity of the dispositions between the same events. ASTPminer allows users to participate in the mining process by introducing domain knowledge in the form of a temporal pattern using the STP formalism. This knowledge constrains the search to patterns consistent with the provided pattern and improves the performance of the procedure. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bertrand, P; Diatta, J				Bertrand, Patrice; Diatta, Jean			Prepyramidal clustering and Robinsonian dissimilarities: one-to-one correspondences	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							K-MEANS	Cluster analysis and seriation are basic data mining techniques. We consider here clustering structures that enable us to achieve both a clustering and a seriation, namely the hierarchical, pyramidal, and prepyramidal clustering structures. Cluster collections of these types determine seriations of any data set by providing compatible orders, i.e., total rankings of the whole data set for which the objects within each cluster are consecutive. Moreover, the dissimilarity measures induced from such cluster collections are Robinsonian; in other words, the more distant the objects in a compatible order, the higher the induced dissimilarity value. It results in a one-to-one correspondence between weakly indexed pyramids and the class of Robinsonian dissimilarities, which holds still in a general setting where undistinguishable objects can be detected, and, as shown in this paper, extends, to prepyramids, which are not required to contain arbitrary intersections of clusters.

J	Cagliero, L; Garza, P				Cagliero, Luca; Garza, Paolo			Improving classification models with taxonomy information	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Taxonomies; Generalized association rules	ASSOCIATIVE-CLASSIFICATION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; GENERATION; SYSTEM; RULES	Classification is an established data mining problem that has largely been investigated by the research community. Since the raw data is commonly unsuitable for training a classifier as it is, several preprocessing steps are commonly integrated in the data mining and knowledge discovery process before applying classification. This paper investigates the usefulness of integrating taxonomy information into classifier construction. In particular, it presents a general-purpose strategy to improve structured data classification accuracy by enriching data with semantics-based knowledge provided by a taxonomy (i.e., a set of is-a hierarchies) built over data items. The proposed approach may be deemed particularly useful by experts who could directly access or easily infer meaningful taxonomy models over the analyzed data. To demonstrate the benefit obtained from utilizing taxonomies for contemporary classification methods, we also presented a generalized version of a state-of-the-art associative classifier, which also includes generalized (high level) rules in the classification model. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the accuracy of state-of-art classifiers, associative and not. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data mining approach to fault detection for isolated inverter-based microgrids	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								This study investigates the problem of fault protection in a microgrid containing inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs). Owing to the low magnitude of short circuit currents generated by IBDGs, traditional protection techniques which relay on current (fuses and overcurrent relays) may fail to protect such networks. This study addresses the problem of finding suitable features derived from local electrical measurements that can be used by statistical classifiers to better discriminate fault events from normal network events. Given a series of simple electrical features, a study of feature selection and data mining techniques is conducted in the context of fault detection in isolated microgrids with IBDGs. Two statistical classifiers are compared and implemented in this framework: Naive Bayes and decision trees. The proposed approach is tested on a facility scale microgrid consisting of three IBDGs.

In data mining, the dependencies among different items can be shown using an association rule. The new fuzzy-genetic (FG) approach is designed to mine fuzzy association rules from a quantitative transaction database. Three important advantages are associated with using the FG approach: (1) the association rules can be extracted from the transaction database with a quantitative value; (2) extracting proper membership functions and support threshold values with the genetic algorithm will exert a positive effect on the mining process results; (3) expressing the association rules in a fuzzy representation is more understandable for humans. In this paper, we design a comprehensive and fast algorithm that mines level-crossing fuzzy association rules on multiple concept levels with learning support threshold values and membership functions using the cluster-based master-slave integrated FG approach. Mining the fuzzy association rules on multiple concept levels helps find more important, useful, accurate, and practical information.

Many fuzzy data mining approaches have thus been proposed for finding fuzzy association rules with the predefined minimum support from the give quantitative transactions. However, the common problems of those approaches are that an appropriate minimum support is hard to set, and the derived rules usually expose common-sense knowledge which may not be interesting in business point of view. In this paper, an algorithm for mining fuzzy coherent rules is proposed for overcoming those problems with the properties of propositional logic. It first transforms quantitative transactions into fuzzy sets. Then, those generated fuzzy sets are collected to generate candidate fuzzy coherent rules. Finally, contingency tables are calculated and used for checking those candidate fuzzy coherent rules satisfy the four criteria or not. If yes, it is a fuzzy coherent rule. Experiments on the foodmart dataset are also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims at developing CBR-based hybrid models of predicting business failure. The need to supplement CBR (Case-Based Reasoning) with other classification and diagnosis techniques is triggered by the fact that accuracy and effectiveness tend to get reduced when CBR alone is applied to handle too many attributes. To enhance the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction, the hybrid models developed by this study include: RST-CBR (combining Rough Set Theory with CBR), RST-GRA-CBR (integrating RST, Grey Relational Analysis, and CBR), and CART-CBR (combining Classification and Regression Tree with CBR). In order to verify the ability of the proposed models to achieve optimal accuracy rate, this study further compares the predictive ability of CBR with those of other comparative models.

Subject-based semantic document clustering for digital forensic investigations	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Clustering; Classification; Data mining; Information retrieval; Forensic analysis; Crime investigation		Computers are increasingly used as tools to commit crimes such as unauthorized access (hacking), drug trafficking, and child pornography. The proliferation of crimes involving computers has created a demand for special forensic tools that allow investigators to look for evidence on a suspect's computer by analyzing communications and data on the computer's storage devices. Motivated by the forensic process at Surete du Quebec (SQ), the Quebec provincial police, we propose a new subject-based semantic document clustering model that allows an investigator to cluster documents stored on a suspect's computer by grouping them into a set of overlapping clusters, each corresponding to a subject of interest initially defined by the investigator.

Multi-battery systems that combine a standard battery with supercapacitors are currently one of the most promising ways to increase battery lifespan and reduce operating costs. However, their performance crucially depends on how they are designed and operated. In this paper, we formalize the problem of optimizing real-time energy management of multi-battery systems as a stochastic planning problem, and we propose a novel solution based on a combination of optimization, machine learning and data-mining techniques. We evaluate the performance of our intelligent energy management system on various large datasets of commuter trips crowdsourced in the United States. We show that our policy significantly outperforms the leading algorithms that were previously proposed as part of an open algorithmic challenge. Further, we show how to extend our approach to an incremental learning setting, where the policy is capable of improving and adapting as new data is being collected over time.

J	Fan, WT; Bouguila, N; Ziou, D				Fan, Wentao; Bouguila, Nizar; Ziou, Djemel			Unsupervised Hybrid Feature Extraction Selection for High-Dimensional Non-Gaussian Data Clustering with Variational Inference	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mixture models; unsupervised learning; generalized Dirichlet; model selection; feature selection; Bayesian estimation; variational inference; human action videos	GENERALIZED DIRICHLET MIXTURE; VARIABLE-SELECTION; MODELS; ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION; NETWORK; POINTS	Clustering has been a subject of extensive research in data mining, pattern recognition, and other areas for several decades. The main goal is to assign samples, which are typically non-Gaussian and expressed as points in high-dimensional feature spaces, to one of a number of clusters. It is well known that in such high-dimensional settings, the existence of irrelevant features generally compromises modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose a variational inference framework for unsupervised non-Gaussian feature selection, in the context of finite generalized Dirichlet (GD) mixture-based clustering. Under the proposed principled variational framework, we simultaneously estimate, in a closed form, all the involved parameters and determine the complexity (i.e., both model an feature selection) of the GD mixture. Extensive simulations using synthetic data along with an analysis of real-world data and human action videos demonstrate that our variational approach achieves better results than comparable techniques.

This paper presents efficient techniques for designing high-throughput, low-latency sorting units. Our sorting architectures utilize modular design techniques that hierarchically construct large sorting units from smaller building blocks. The sorting units are optimized for situations in which only the M largest numbers from N inputs are needed, because this situation commonly occurs in many applications for scientific computing, data mining, network processing, digital signal processing, and high-energy physics. We utilize our proposed techniques to design parameterized, pipelined, and modular sorting units. A detailed analysis of these sorting units indicates that as the number of inputs increases their resource requirements scale linearly, their latencies scale logarithmically, and their frequencies remain almost constant. When synthesized to a 65-nm TSMC technology, a pipelined 256-to-4 sorting unit with 19 stages can perform more than 2.7 billion sorts per second with a latency of about 7 ns per sort. We also propose iterative sorting techniques, in which a small sorting unit is used several times to find the largest values.

J	Lee, YJ; Yeh, YR; Wang, YCF				Lee, Yuh-Jye; Yeh, Yi-Ren; Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank			Anomaly Detection via Online Oversampling Principal Component Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anomaly detection; online updating; least squares; oversampling; principal component analysis		Anomaly detection has been an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

However, the performance of such criteria depends on the input data and a single one is not sufficient to guarantee success over a wide range of environments. An option to adapt the selection criteria to the input data is the use of meta-learning to build knowledge-based systems capable to choose the most appropriate selection strategy among several available candidates. Nevertheless, there is not in the literature a theoretical framework that guides the design of instance selection techniques based on meta-learning. This paper presents a framework for this purpose as well as a case study in which the framework is instantiated and an experimental study is carried out to show that the meta-learning approach offers a good compromise between efficiency and versatility in instance selection.

A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we review and compare these algorithms to identify their advantages and differences. We then propose a simple but time and space efficient hash-based algorithm for FD discovery. We conduct a performance comparison of three recently published algorithms and compare their performance with that of our hash-based algorithm. We show that the hash-based algorithm performs best among the four algorithms and analyze the reasons. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most social networks such as Epinions and Facebook allow users to declare trusts or friendships with other users. Some of them also allow users to declare distrusts or negative relationships. When both positive and negative links co-exist in a network, some interesting community structures can be studied. In this work, we mine Direct Antagonistic Communities (DACs) within such signed networks. Each DAC consists of two sub-communities with positive relationships among members of each sub-community, and negative relationships among members of the other sub-community. Identifying direct antagonistic communities is an important step to understand the nature of the formation, dissolution, and evolution of such communities. Knowledge about antagonistic communities allows us to better understand and explain behaviors of users in the communities. Identifying DACs from a large signed network is however challenging as various combinations of user sets, which is very large in number, need to be checked. We propose an efficient data mining solution that leverages the properties of DACs, and combines the identification of strongest connected components and bi-clique mining. We have experimented our approach on synthetic, myGamma, and Epinions datasets to showcase the efficiency and utility of our proposed approach. We show that we can mine DACs in less than 15 min from a signed network of myGamma, which is a mobile social networking site, consisting of 600,000 members and 8 million links. An investigation on the behavior of users participating in DACs shows that antagonism significantly affects the way people behave and interact with one another. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this sense, recommender systems make personalized suggestions and provide information of items available in the system. Nowadays, there is a vast amount of methods, including data mining techniques that can be employed for personalization in recommender systems. However, these methods are still quite vulnerable to some limitations and shortcomings related to recommender environment. In order to deal with some of them, in this work we implement a recommendation methodology in a recommender system for tourism, where classification based on association is applied. Classification based on association methods, also named associative classification methods, consist of an alternative data mining technique, which combines concepts from classification and association in order to allow association rules to be employed in a prediction context. The proposed methodology was evaluated in some case studies, where we could verify that it is able to shorten limitations presented in recommender systems and to enhance recommendation quality.

Grammar-based multi-objective algorithms for mining association rules	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Association rule mining; Genetic programming; Data mining; Mining methods and algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	In association rule mining, the process of extracting relations from a dataset often requires the application of more than one quality measure and, in many cases, such measures involve conflicting objectives. In such a situation, it is more appropriate to attain the optimal trade-off between measures. This paper deals with the association rule mining problem under a multi-objective perspective by proposing grammar guided genetic programming (G3P) models, that enable the extraction of both numerical and nominal association rules in only one single step. The strength of G3P is its ability to restrict the search space and build rules conforming to a given context-free grammar. Thus, the proposals presented in this paper combine the advantages of G3P models with those of multi-objective approaches. Both approaches follow the philosophy of two well-known multi-objective algorithms: the Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-2) and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2). In the experimental stage, we compare both multi-objective algorithms to a single-objective G3P proposal for mining association rules and perform an analysis of the mined rules. The results obtained show that multi-objective proposals obtain very frequent (with support values above 95% in most cases) and reliable (with confidence values close to 100%) rules when attaining the optimal trade-off between support and confidence. Furthermore, for the trade-off between support and lift, the multi-objective proposals also produce very interesting and representative rules. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Luna, J.

With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies, research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Classification and Adaptive Novel Class Detection of Feature-Evolving Data Streams	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data stream; concept-evolution; novel class; outlier		Data stream classification poses many challenges to the data mining community. In this paper, we address four such major challenges, namely, infinite length, concept-drift, concept-evolution, and feature-evolution. Since a data stream is theoretically infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Concept-drift is a common phenomenon in data streams, which occurs as a result of changes in the underlying concepts. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. Feature-evolution is a frequently occurring process in many streams, such as text streams, in which new features (i.e., words or phrases) appear as the stream progresses. Most existing data stream classification techniques address only the first two challenges, and ignore the latter two. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classification framework, where each classifier is equipped with a novel class detector, to address concept-drift and concept-evolution. To address feature-evolution, we propose a feature set homogenization technique. We also enhance the novel class detection module by making it more adaptive to the evolving stream, and enabling it to detect more than one novel class at a time. Comparison with state-of-the-art data stream classification techniques establishes the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In biological datasets, each object is described by a large number of variables (or dimensions) and it is crucial to perform their analyses in a smaller space, to extract useful information. Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been recently proposed in systems biology as a useful tool for exploratory analysis, data integration and discovery of new relationships in *omics datasets. SOMs have been traditionally used for clustering in several data mining problems, mainly due to their ability to preserve input data topology and reduce a high dimensional input space into a 2-D map. In spite of this, the above-mentioned dimensional reduction can lead to counterintuitive results. Sometimes, maps having almost the same size, trained on the same dataset, and with identical learning algorithms and parameters, may find different clusters. However, one would expect that small changes in map sizes or another training condition would not result in an abrupt different location of any of the grouped patterns. The aim of this work is to analyze and explain this issue through a real case study involving transcriptomic and metabolomic data, since it might have an important impact when interpreting clustering results over a biological dataset.

In this scenario, the commercial portal has its own taxonomy (the "master taxonomy"), while each data provider organizes its products into a different taxonomy (the "provider taxonomy"). In this paper, we consider the problem of categorizing products from the data providers into the master taxonomy, while making use of the provider taxonomy information. Our approach is based on a taxonomy-aware processing step that adjusts the results of a text-based classifier to ensure that products that are close together in the provider taxonomy remain close in the master taxonomy. We formulate this intuition as a structured prediction optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages the structure of taxonomies in order to enhance catalog integration. We propose algorithms that are scalable and thus applicable to the large data sets that are typical on the web. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world data and we show that taxonomy-aware classification provides a significant improvement over existing approaches.

Data weighing mechanisms for clustering ensembles	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Inspired by bagging and boosting algorithms in classification, the non-weighing and weighing-based sampling approaches for clustering are proposed and studied in the paper. The effectiveness of non-weighing-based sampling technique, comparing the efficacy of sampling with and without replacement, in conjunction with several consensus algorithms have been invested in this paper. Experimental results have shown improved stability and accuracy for clustering structures obtained via bootstrapping, subsampling, and boosting techniques. Subsamples of small size can reduce the computational cost and measurement complexity for many unsupervised data mining tasks with distributed sources of data. This empirical research study also compares the performance of boosting and bagging clustering ensembles using different consensus functions on a number of datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sheikhan, M; Rad, MS				Sheikhan, Mansour; Rad, Maryam Sharifi			Using particle swarm optimization in fuzzy association rules-based feature selection and fuzzy ARTMAP-based attack recognition	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						intrusion detection; feature selection; fuzzy association rules; particle swarm optimization; fuzzy ARTMAP	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; SUPPORT	Feature selection is a classic research topic in data mining, and it has attracted much interest in many fields such as network security. In addition, data mining approaches such as fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) can improve the performance of intrusion detection systems. In this study, a FARM-based feature selector is proposed in order to reduce the dimension of input features to the misuse detector. Furthermore, a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used as the classifier. The accuracy of the proposed approach depends strongly on the precision of the parameters of FARM-based feature selector module and fuzzy ARTMAP neural classifier. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is incorporated into the proposed method to determine optimum values of parameters. In this way, the performance of PSO algorithm is compared with genetic algorithm (GA), as well. Experimental results indicate that PSO outperforms GA both in population size and number of evolutions and can converge faster. This is very important for enhancing the mining performance in large datasets such as intrusion detection datasets.

Technologies to store and access these complex and large datasets are in place. However, robust and scalable analysis technologies are needed to extract meaningful information from these datasets. The research field of Information Visualization and Visual Data Analytics addresses this need. Information visualization and data mining are often used complementary to each other. Their common goal is the extraction of meaningful information from complex and possibly large data. However, though data mining focuses on the usage of silicon hardware, visualization techniques also aim to access the powerful image-processing capabilities of the human brain. This article highlights the research on data visualization and visual analytics techniques. Furthermore, we highlight existing visual analytics techniques, systems, and applications including a perspective on the field from the chemical process industry. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Wang, Y; Huang, WJ; Zong, L; Wang, TJ; Yang, DQ				Wang Yue; Huang WeiJing; Zong Lang; Wang TengJiao; Yang DongQing			Influence maximization with limit cost in social network	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; social network; influence maximization; graph-based diffusion model; information propagation	MODEL	Social networking service (SNS) applications are changing the way information spreads in online communities. As real social relationships are projected into SNS applications, word of mouth has been an important factor in the information spreading processes of those applications. By assuming each user needs a cost to accept some specific information, this paper studies the initial "seed user" selection strategy to maximize information spreading in a social network with a cost budget. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) proposing a graphic SEIR model (gSEIR) by extending the epidemic compartmental model to simulate the dynamic information spreading process between individuals in the social network; 2) proposing a formal definition for the influence maximization problem with limit cost (IMLC) in social networks, and proving that this problem can be transformed to the weighted set-cover problem (WSCP) and thus is NP-Complete; 3) providing four different greedy algorithms to solve the IMLC problem; 4) proposing a heuristic algorithm based on the method of Lagrange multipliers (HILR) for the same problem; 5) providing two parts of experiments to test the proposed models and algorithms in this paper. In the first part, we verify that gSEIR can generate similar macro-behavior as an SIR model for the information spreading process in an online community by combining the micro-behaviors of all the users in that community, and that gSEIR can also simulate the dynamic change process of the statuses of all the individuals in the corresponding social networks during the information spreading process. In the second part, by applying the simulation result from gSEIR as the prediction of information spreading in the given social network, we test the effectiveness and efficiency of all provided algorithms to solve the influence maximization problem with cost limit. The result show that the heuristic algorithm HILR is the best for the IMLC problem.

Its detection is a typical use case of the broad-based Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) methodology. However, there is very limited information available to distinguish dynamic fraud from genuine customer behavior in such an extremely sparse and imbalanced data environment, which makes the instant and effective detection become more and more important and challenging. In this paper, we propose an effective online banking fraud detection framework that synthesizes relevant resources and incorporates several advanced data mining techniques. By building a contrast vector for each transaction based on its customer's historical behavior sequence, we profile the differentiating rate of each current transaction against the customer's behavior preference. A novel algorithm, ContrastMiner, is introduced to efficiently mine contrast patterns and distinguish fraudulent from genuine behavior, followed by an effective pattern selection and risk scoring that combines predictions from different models.

J	Wu, ML; Chang, CH; Liu, RZ				Wu, Meng-Lun; Chang, Chia-Hui; Liu, Rui-Zhe			Co-clustering with augmented matrix	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Co-clustering; Collaborative filtering; Classification evaluation		Clustering plays an important role in data mining as many applications use it as a preprocessing step for data analysis. Traditional clustering focuses on the grouping of similar objects, while two-way co-clustering can group dyadic data (objects as well as their attributes) simultaneously. Most co-clustering research focuses on single correlation data, but there might be other possible descriptions of dyadic data that could improve co-clustering performance. In this research, we extend ITCC (Information Theoretic Co-Clustering) to the problem of co-clustering with augmented matrix. We proposed CCAM (Co-Clustering with Augmented Matrix) to include this augmented data for better co-clustering. We apply CCAM in the analysis of on-line advertising, where both ads and users must be clustered. The key data that connect ads and users are the user-ad link matrix, which identifies the ads that each user has linked; both ads and users also have their feature data, i.e. the augmented matrix. To evaluate the proposed method, we use two measures: classification accuracy and K-L divergence. The experiment is done using the advertisements and user data from Morgenstern, a financial social website that focuses on the advertisement agency. The experiment results show that CCAM provides better performance than ITCC since it considers the use of augmented matrix during clustering.

MKBoost: A Framework of Multiple Kernel Boosting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multiple kernel learning; boosting; kernel methods; classification		Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a promising family of machine learning algorithms using multiple kernel functions for various challenging data mining tasks. Conventional MKL methods often formulate the problem as an optimization task of learning the optimal combinations of both kernels and classifiers, which usually results in some forms of challenging optimization tasks that are often difficult to be solved. Different from the existing MKL methods, in this paper, we investigate a boosting framework of MKL for classification tasks, i.e., we adopt boosting to solve a variant of MKL problem, which avoids solving the complicated optimization tasks. Specifically, we present a novel framework of Multiple kernel boosting (MKBoost), which applies the idea of boosting techniques to learn kernel-based classifiers with multiple kernels for classification problems. Based on the proposed framework, we propose several variants of MKBoost algorithms and extensively examine their empirical performance on a number of benchmark data sets in comparisons to various state-of-the-art MKL algorithms on classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the existing MKL techniques.	[Xia, Hao; Hoi, Steven C.

J	Yang, HQ; Lyu, MR; King, I				Yang, Haiqin; Lyu, Michael R.; King, Irwin			Efficient Online Learning for Multitask Feature Selection	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Supervised learning; online learning; multitask learning; feature selection; dual averaging method	MULTIPLE TASKS; ALGORITHMS; REGULARIZATION; OPTIMIZATION	Learning explanatory features across multiple related tasks, or MultiTask Feature Selection (MTFS), is an important problem in the applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Previous MTFS methods fulfill this task by batch-mode training. This makes them inefficient when data come sequentially or when the number of training data is so large that they cannot be loaded into the memory simultaneously. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a novel online learning framework to solve the MTFS problem. A main advantage of the online algorithm is its efficiency in both time complexity and memory cost. The weights of the MTFS models at each iteration can be updated by closed-form solutions based on the average of previous subgradients. This yields the worst-case bounds of the time complexity and memory cost at each iteration, both in the order of O(d x Q), where d is the number of feature dimensions and Q is the number of tasks. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis for the average regret of the online learning algorithms, which also guarantees the convergence rate of the algorithms. Finally, we conduct detailed experiments to show the characteristics and merits of the online learning algorithms in solving several MTFS problems.

Mining Order-Preserving Submatrices from Data with Repeated Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; bioinformatics; mining methods and algorithms	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE	Order-preserving submatrices (OPSM's) have been shown useful in capturing concurrent patterns in data when the relative magnitudes of data items are more important than their exact values. For instance, in analyzing gene expression profiles obtained from microarray experiments, the relative magnitudes are important both because they represent the change of gene activities across the experiments, and because there is typically a high level of noise in data that makes the exact values untrustable. To cope with data noise, repeated experiments are often conducted to collect multiple measurements. We propose and study a more robust version of OPSM, where each data item is represented by a set of values obtained from replicated experiments. We call the new problem OPSM-RM (OPSM with repeated measurements). We define OPSM-RM based on a number of practical requirements. We discuss the computational challenges of OPSM-RM and propose a generic mining algorithm. We further propose a series of techniques to speed up two time dominating components of the algorithm. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods through a series of experiments conducted on real microarray data.

This paper proposes a friendly and intuitive tool called DRAL to detect the most relevant e-activities that a student needs to pass a course based on features extracted from logged data in an education web-based system. The method uses a more flexible representation of the available information based on multiple instance learning to prevent the appearance of a great number of missing values and is based on a multi-objective grammar guided genetic programming algorithm which obtains simple and clear classification rules which are markedly useful to identify the number, type and time of e-activities more relevant so that a student has a high probability to pass a course. To validate this approach, our proposal is compared with the most traditional proposals in multiple instance learning over the years. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach proposed successfully improves the accuracy of previous models by finding a balance between specificity and sensitivity values.

These applications provide open platforms for users to discover access and integrate near real-time sensor data which is collected from distributed sensors and sensor networks. To make use of the shared sensor data on the Web, conceptual models in a particular domain are normally adopted. However, most conceptual models require high quality data and high level domain knowledge. Such limitations greatly limit the application of these models. To overcome some of these limitations, this paper proposes a data-mining approach to analyze patterns and relationships among different sensor data sets. This approach provides a flexible way for users to understand hidden relationships in shared sensor data, and can help them to make use Web-based sensor systems better.

J	Huang, TCK; Hsu, WH; Chen, YL				Huang, Tony Cheng-Kui; Hsu, Wu-Hsien; Chen, Yen-Liang			Conjecturable knowledge discovery: A fuzzy clustering approach	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Conjecturable rules; Fuzzy clustering; Classification	CLASSIFIERS; MODEL; TREE	Traditionally, clustering is the task of dividing objects into homogeneous clusters based on their degrees of similarity. As objects are assigned to clusters, users need to manually give descriptions for all clusters. Characterizing clusters by hand can consume a great deal of time of users. In addition, users sometimes have no specific idea as to how to explain the clustering results; thus, they might give inappropriate descriptions. A clustering technique is proposed to discover conjecturable rules, providing descriptions of clusters with a decision tree classification technique. Every cluster in a conjecturable tree is depicted by only one conjecturable rule. However, less-utilized rules are not necessarily trivial. In some real-life circumstances, there might be some clusters which can be depicted by two or more rules, namely, recessive conjecturable rules. For example, customers usually prefer to buy inexpensive red wines; however, on certain occasions, such for a birthday celebration, they will buy expensive wine. Therefore, we know that there are some people who generally belong to a low-value cluster but may simultaneously be assigned to a high-value one. In this study, we propose a new discovery model for mining conjecturable rules to reveal this type of knowledge.

J	Guil, F; Marin, R				Guil, Francisco; Marin, Roque			A Theory of Evidence-based method for assessing frequent patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Frequent itemset mining; Theory of Evidence; Information measures; Uncertainty management	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; FUZZY-SETS; SPECIFICITY; ENTROPY; SYSTEM	Frequent itemset (or frequent pattern) mining is a very important issue within the data mining field. Both, syntactic simplicity and descriptive potential, are the key features of the itemset-based pattern which have led to its widespread use in a growing number of real-life domains. Some of the most representative algorithms for mining this kind of pattern are Apriori-like algorithms and, therefore, the number of patterns obtained under normal conditions is very large, making the process of evaluation and interpretation quite difficult. This problem is compounded if we consider that knowledge discovery is an iterative process, and the change in the parameters of the preprocessing techniques or the mining algorithm can lead to significant changes in the result. In this paper, we propose a method based on Shafer's Theory of Evidence which uses two information measures for the quality evaluation of the set of frequent patterns. From a practical point of view, the main goal is to select, for a given database, the best preprocessing technique that lead to the discovery of useful knowledge. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is to propose a formal method to assess, objectively, sets of frequent patterns, seen as belief structures, in terms of certainty in the information they represent.

As a result of the nature of how activity and related travel decisions are made in daily life, human activity-travel behavior exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal regularities as well as sequential ordering. In this study, we investigate to what extent the behavioral routines could reveal the activities being performed at mobile phone call locations that are captured when users initiate or receive a voice call or message. Our exploration consists of four steps. First, we define a set of comprehensive temporal variables characterizing each call location. Feature selection techniques are then applied to choose the most effective variables in the second step. Next, a set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests are employed to build classification models. Alongside, an ensemble of the results of the above models is also tested. Finally, the inference performance is further enhanced by a post-processing algorithm. Using data collected from natural mobile phone communication patterns of 80 users over a period of more than one year, we evaluated our approach via a set of extensive experiments. Based on the ensemble of the models, we achieved prediction accuracy of 69.7%. Furthermore, using the post processing algorithm, the performance obtained a 7.6% improvement. The experiment results demonstrate the potential to annotate mobile phone locations based on the integration of data mining techniques with the characteristics of underlying activity-travel behavior, contributing towards the semantic comprehension and further application of the massive data.

J	Nishi, MA; Ahmed, CF; Samiullah, M; Jeong, BS				Nishi, Manziba Akanda; Ahmed, Chowdhury Farhan; Samiullah, Md.; Jeong, Byeong-Soo			Effective periodic pattern mining in time series databases	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Periodic pattern; Time series; Suffix tree; Event skipping	SEQUENCES	The goal of analyzing a time series database is to find whether and how frequent a periodic pattern is repeated within the series. Periodic pattern mining is the problem that regards temporal regularity. However, most of the existing algorithms have a major limitation in mining interesting patterns of users interest, that is, they can mine patterns of specific length with all the events sequentially one after another in exact positions within this pattern. Though there are certain scenarios where a pattern can be flexible, that is, it may be interesting and can be mined by neglecting any number of unimportant events in between important events with variable length of the pattern. Moreover, existing algorithms can detect only specific type of periodicity in various time series databases and require the interaction from user to determine periodicity. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for the periodic pattern mining in time series databases which does not rely on the user for the period value or period type of the pattern and can detect all types of periodic patterns at the same time, indeed these flexibilities are missing in existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm facilitates the user to generate different kinds of patterns by skipping intermediate events in a time series database and find out the periodicity of the patterns within the database. It is an improvement over the generating pattern using suffix tree, because suffix tree based algorithms have weakness in this particular area of pattern generation. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves generating different kinds of interesting patterns and detects whether the generated pattern is periodic or not. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real life data from different domains and found a large number of interesting event sequences which were missing in existing algorithms and the proposed algorithm was efficient enough in generating and detecting periodicity of flexible patterns on both types of data.

J	Tsai, HH				Tsai, Hsu-Hao			Knowledge management vs. data mining: Research trend, forecast and citation approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Knowledge management; Data mining; Research trend analysis; Bibliometric methodology	NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOTKA LAW; SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY; BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS; PERSPECTIVE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Knowledge management (KM) and data mining (DM) have become more important today, however, there are few comprehensive researches and categorization schemes to discuss the characteristics for both of them. Using a bibliometric approach, this paper analyzes KM and DM research trends, forecasts and citations from 1989 to 2009 by locating headings "knowledge management" and "data mining" in topics in the SSCI database. The bibliometric analytical technique was used to examine these two topics in SSCI journals from 1989 to 2009, we found 1393 articles with KM and 1181 articles with DM. This paper implemented and classified KM and DM articles using the following eight categories publication year, citation, country/territory, document type, institute name, language, source title and subject area for different distribution status in order to explore the differences and how KM and DM technologies have developed in this period and to analyze KM and DM technology tendencies under the above result. Also, the paper performs the K-S test to check whether the distribution of author article production follows Lotka's law. The research findings can be extended to investigate author productivity by analyzing variables such as chronological and academic age, number and frequency of previous publications, access to research grants, job status, etc. In such a way characteristics of high, medium and low publishing activity of authors can be identified. Besides, these findings will also help to judge scientific research trends and understand the scale of development of research in KM and DM through comparing the increases of the article author. Based on the above information, governments and enterprises may infer collective tendencies and demands for scientific researcher in KM and DM to formulate appropriate training strategies and policies in the future. This analysis provides a roadmap for future research, abstracts technology trend information and facilitates knowledge accumulations, therefore the future research can concentrated in core categories. This implies that the phenomenon "success breeds success" is more common in higher quality publications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, F; Abulaish, M				Ahmed, Faraz; Abulaish, Muhammad			A generic statistical approach for spam detection in Online Social Networks	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Social network analysis; Social network security; Spam profile identification; Spam campaign identification		In this paper, we present a generic statistical approach to identify spam profiles on Online Social Networks (OSNs). Our study is based on real datasets containing both normal and spam profiles crawled from Facebook and Twitter networks. We have identified a set of 14 generic statistical features to identify spam profiles. The identified features are common to both Facebook and Twitter networks. For classification task, we have used three different classification algorithms - nave Bayes,Jrip, and J48, and evaluated them on both individual and combined datasets to establish the discriminative property of the identified features. The results obtained on a combined dataset has detection rate (DR) as 0.957 and false positive rate (FPR) as 0.048, whereas on Facebook dataset the DR and FPR values are 0.964 and 0.089, respectively, and that on Twitter dataset the DR and FPR values are 0.976 and 0.075, respectively. We have also analyzed the contribution of each individual feature towards the detection accuracy of spam profiles. Thereafter, we have considered 7 most discriminative features and proposed a clustering-based approach to identify spam campaigns on Facebook and Twitter networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

R.; Agarwal, Arun; Buyya, Rajkumar			A two phased service oriented Broker for replica selection in data grids	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Data grids; Replica selection Broker; Selection technique; Resource Broker; Association rules		Replica selection is one of the fundamental problems in Data Grid's environment. This work's concern is designing a Two phased Service Oriented Broker (2SOB) for replica selection. It is focused on investigating, selecting, modifying, and experimenting with some non-conventional approaches to be applied on the relevant selection techniques. The motivation of this work is to introduce a novel service Oriented Broker for Replica Selection in Data Grid. The main characteristics of this 2SOB are: Scalability, Reliability, Availability, Efficiency and Ease of deployment. 2SOB consists of two phases; the first is a Coarse-grain phase, basically used for sifting replica sites that have low latency (uncongested network links) and distinguishing them from other replicas having a high latency (congested network links). Procedurally, this has been done using the association rules concept of the Data Mining approach. The second is a Fine-grain phase,used for extracting the replicas admissible for user requirements through applying Modified Minimum Cost and Delay Policy (MMCD). Both phases have accordingly been designed, simulated, coded, and then validated using real data from EU Data Grid. The first phase has thereby been applied on the real network data of CERN (February 2011). Experimentations compared with some other contemporary selection methods of different Brokers showed appreciable results. Using this proposed Broker it is possible to achieve an enhancement in the speed of executing Data Grid jobs through reducing the transfer time. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vo, B; Hong, TP; Le, B				Bay Vo; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Le, Bac			A lattice-based approach for mining most generalization association rules	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Association rule; Data mining; Frequent closed itemset; Lattice; Most generalization association rule	CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHMS	Traditional association rules consist of some redundant information. Some variants based on support and confidence measures such as non-redundant rules and minimal non-redundant rules were thus proposed to reduce the redundant information. In the past, we proposed most generalization association rules (MGARs), which were more compact than (minimal) non-redundant rules in that they considered the condition of equal or higher confidence, instead of only equal confidence. However, the execution time for generating MGARs increased with an increasing number of frequent closed itemsets. Since lattices are an effective data structure widely used in data mining, in this paper, we thus propose a lattice-based approach for fast mining most generalization association rules. Firstly, a new algorithm for building a frequent-closed-itemset lattice is introduced. After that, a theorem on pruning nodes in the lattice for rule generation is derived. Finally, an algorithm for fast mining MGARs from the lattice constructed is developed. The proposed algorithm is tested with several databases and the results show that it is more efficient than mining MGARs directly from frequent closed itemsets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Boutsinas, B				Boutsinas, Basilis			A NEW BICLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE MINING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Biclustering; clustering; association rule mining; data mining; high dimensionality		Clustering has been applied in a wide variety of disciplines and has also been utilized in many scientific areas. Usually, clustering algorithms construct either clusters of rows or clusters of columns of the input data matrix. Biclustering is a methodology where biclusters are formed by both a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that objects represented by the first are the most similar to each other when compared over the latter. In this paper, we introduce a new biclustering technique, based on association rule mining, which can support different well-known biclustering models proposed in the literature. Experimental tests demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed technique with respect to well known related ones.

J	Cano, A; Olmo, JL; Ventura, S				Cano, Alberto; Luis Olmo, Juan; Ventura, Sebastian			Parallel multi-objective Ant Programming for classification using GPUs	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant programming (AP); Ant colony optimization (ACO); Parallel computing; GPU; Classification	COLONY OPTIMIZATION; GRAPHICS HARDWARE; ALGORITHMS; CUDA; PERFORMANCE; DISCOVERY; DIAGNOSIS; GRAMMAR	Classification using Ant Programming is a challenging data mining task which demands a great deal of computational resources when handling data sets of high dimensionality. This paper presents a new parallelization approach of an existing multi-objective Ant Programming model for classification, using GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. The computational costs of the different steps of the algorithm are evaluated and it is discussed how best to parallelize them. The features of both the CPU parallel and GPU versions of the algorithm are presented. An experimental study is carried out to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the interpreter of the rules, and reports the execution times and speedups regarding variable population size, complexity of the rules mined and dimensionality of the data sets. Experiments measure the original single-threaded and the new multi-threaded CPU and GPU times with different number of GPU devices. The results are reported in terms of the number of Giga GP operations per second of the interpreter (up to 10 billion GPops/s) and the speedup achieved (up to 834x vs CPU, 212x vs 4-threaded CPU). The proposed GPU model is demonstrated to scale efficiently to larger datasets and to multiple GPU devices, which allows the expansion of its applicability to significantly more complicated data sets, previously unmanageable by the original algorithm in reasonable time.

This method is based on the mathematical proof of several results, showing its effectiveness with regard to other clustering methods. Genetic algorithms applied to cluster analysis have disclosed good results on biological data and many studies have been carried out in this sense, although most of them are focused on partitional clustering methods. Even though there are few studies that attempt to use genetic algorithms for building hierarchical clustering, they do not include constraints that allow us to reduce the complexity of the problem. Therefore, these studies become intractable problems for large data sets. On the other hand, the deterministic hierarchical clustering methods generally face the problem of convergence towards local optimums due to their greedy strategy. The method introduced here is an alternative to solve some of the problems existing methods face. The results of the experiments have shown that our approach can be very effective in cluster analysis of DNA microarray data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, we calculate the counter values between any two questions, where the counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions. Then, we consider four kinds of association rules between two questions to mine some information. Finally, we calculate the relevance degree between two concepts derived from the association rule to construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of Chen and Bai's (2010) and Lee et al.'s method (2009). It provides us with a useful way to construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems based on data mining techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ericson, K; Pallickara, S				Ericson, Kathleen; Pallickara, Shrideep			On the performance of high dimensional data clustering and classification algorithms	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Distributed stream processing; Hadoop; Mahout; Clustering; Classification; Granules		There is often a need to perform machine learning tasks on voluminous amounts of data. These tasks have application in fields such as pattern recognition, data mining, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems. Here we evaluate the performance of 4 clustering algorithms and 2 classification algorithms supported by Mahout within two different cloud runtimes, Hadoop and Granules. Our benchmarks use the same Mahout backend code, ensuring a fair comparison. The differences between these implementations stem from how the Hadoop and Granules runtimes (1) support and manage the lifecycle of individual computations, and (2) how they orchestrate exchange of data between different stages of the computational pipeline during successive iterations of the clustering algorithm. We include an analysis of our results for each of these algorithms in a distributed setting, as well as a discussion on measures for failure recovery. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These two systems share many mechanisms and operators, but at the same time, they apply two different learning paradigms (the Iterative Rule Learning approach and the Pittsburgh approach, respectively). The aim of this paper is to: (a) propose standard configurations for handling small and large datasets, (b) compare the two systems in terms of learning capabilities, complexity of the obtained solutions and learning time, (c) determine the areas of the problem space where each one of these two systems performs better, and (d) compare them with other well-known machine learning algorithms. The results show that it is possible to find standard configurations for both systems. With these configurations the systems perform up to the standards of other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines. Moreover, we identify the problem domains where each one of these systems have advantages and disadvantages and propose ways to improve the systems based on this analysis.

J	Gunarathne, T; Zhang, BJ; Wu, TL; Qiu, J				Gunarathne, Thilina; Zhang, Bingjing; Wu, Tak-Lon; Qiu, Judy			Scalable parallel computing on clouds using Twister4Azure iterative MapReduce	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Iterative MapReduce; Cloud computing; HPC; Scientific applications; Azure		Recent advances in data-intensive computing for science discovery are fueling a dramatic growth in the use of data-intensive iterative computations. The utility computing model introduced by cloud computing, combined with the rich set of cloud infrastructure and storage services, offers a very attractive environment in which scientists can perform data analytics. The challenges to large-scale distributed computations on cloud environments demand innovative computational frameworks that are specifically tailored for cloud characteristics to easily and effectively harness the power of clouds. Twister4Azure is a distributed decentralized iterative MapReduce runtime for Windows Azure Cloud. Twister4Azure extends the familiar, easy-to-use MapReduce programming model with iterative extensions, enabling a fault-tolerance execution of a wide array of data mining and data analysis applications on the Azure cloud. Twister4Azure utilizes the scalable, distributed and highly available Azure cloud services as the underlying building blocks, and employs a decentralized control architecture that avoids single point failures. Twister4Azure optimizes the iterative computations using a multi-level caching of data, a cache aware decentralized task scheduling, hybrid tree-based data broadcasting and hybrid intermediate data communication. This paper presents the Twister4Azure iterative MapReduce runtime and a study of four real world data-intensive scientific applications implemented using Twister4Azure two iterative applications, Multi-Dimensional Scaling and KMeans Clustering; and two pleasingly parallel applications, BLAST+ sequence searching and SmithWaterman sequence alignment. Performance measurements show comparable or a factor of 2 to 4 better results than the traditional MapReduce runtimes deployed on up to 256 instances and for jobs with tens of thousands of tasks. We also study and present solutions to several factors that affect the performance of iterative MapReduce applications on Windows Azure Cloud, (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Heinecke, A; Pfluger, D				Heinecke, Alexander; Pflueger, Dirk			Emerging Architectures Enable to Boost Massively Parallel Data Mining Using Adaptive Sparse Grids	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Sparse grids; Adaptivity; SIMD; Many-core; Multi-core; Accelerators; GPGPU; Hybrid acceleration	GPU	Gaining knowledge out of vast datasets is a main challenge in data-driven applications nowadays. Sparse grids provide a numerical method for both classification and regression in data mining which scales only linearly in the number of data points and is thus well-suited for huge amounts of data. Due to the recursive nature of sparse grid algorithms and their classical random memory access pattern, they impose a challenge for the parallelization on modern hardware architectures such as accelerators. In this paper, we present the parallelization on several current task- and data-parallel platforms, covering multi-core CPUs with vector units, GPUs, and hybrid systems. We demonstrate that a less efficient implementation from an algorithmical point of view can be beneficial if it allows vectorization and a higher degree of parallelism instead. Furthermore, we analyze the suitability of parallel programming languages for the implementation. Considering hardware, we restrict ourselves to the x86 platform with SSE and AVX vector extensions and to NVIDIA's Fermi architecture for GPUs. We consider both multi-core CPU and GPU architectures independently, as well as hybrid systems with up to 12 cores and 2 Fermi GPUs. With respect to parallel programming, we examine both the open standard OpenCL and Intel Array Building Blocks, a recently introduced high-level programming approach, and comment on their ease of use. As the baseline, we use the best results obtained with classically parallelized sparse grid algorithms and their OpenMP-parallelized intrinsics counterpart (SSE and AVX instructions), reporting both single and double precision measurements.

Our method involves a combination of data mining and static analysis of the register transfer level (RTL) design. The RTL design is first simulated to generate data about the design's dynamic behavior. The generated data is then mined for "candidate assertions" that are likely to be invariants. The data mining algorithm is a decision-tree-based supervised learning algorithm. These candidate assertions are then passed through a formal verification engine to filter out the spurious candidates. The assertions that are attested as true by the formal engine are system invariants. These are then evaluated by a process of designer ranking that is provided as feedback to the data mining engine. We demonstrate the scalability of GoldMine by showing assertion generation of the RTL of Sun's OpenSparc T2 many-threaded processor. Our results show that GoldMine can generate complex, high coverage assertions for sequential as well as combinational designs in RTL, thereby minimizing human effort in this process. GoldMine assertions distill the random input stimulus space and can be used for calibrating directed tests. They can be used in a regression test suite of an evolving RTL. They are also useful in providing differing perspectives from the designer, as well as hints to designers for manually writing assertions.

We propose reducing the size of Apriori rule sets by removing overlapping rules, and compare this approach with two standard methods for reducing rule set size: increasing the minimum confidence parameter, and increasing the minimum antecedent support parameter. We evaluate the rule sets in terms of confidence and coverage, as well as two rule interestingness measures that favour rules with antecedent conditions that are poor individual predictors of the target class, as we assume that these represent potentially interesting rules. We also examine the distribution of the rules graphically, to assess whether particular classes of rules are eliminated. We show that removing overlapping rules substantially reduces rule set size in most cases, and alters the character of a rule set less than if the standard parameters are used to constrain the rule set to the same size. Based on our results, we aim to extend the Apriori algorithm to incorporate the suppression of overlapping rules.

The process of data collection and data dissemination may, however, result in an inherent risk of privacy threats. Some sensitive or private information about individuals, businesses and organizations needs to be suppressed before it is shared or published. The privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) has thus become an important issue in recent years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called SIF-IDF for modifying original databases in order to hide sensitive itemsets. It is a greedy approach based on the concept borrowed from the Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) in text mining. The above concept is used to evaluate the similarity degrees between the items in transactions and the desired sensitive itemsets and then selects appropriate items in some transactions to hide. The proposed algorithm can easily make good trade-offs between privacy preserving and execution time. Experimental results also show the performance of the proposed approach.

However, most existing fuzzy mining techniques adopt Apriori-based techniques to deal with the problem of mining fuzzy frequent itemsets, and thus their execution efficiency is not good. In this paper, we thus propose an efficient mining approach to speed up the efficiency of finding fuzzy frequent itemsets from databases. In particular, a data-reduction strategy is designed to effectively help prune unpromising fuzzy terms in transactions at each pass in comparison with the other existing algorithms. Through a series of experimental evaluations, the results reveal that the proposed approach runs faster than the existing fuzzy mining algorithms on several synthetic and real datasets under different parameter settings.

Driven by modern applications in genetics and brain sciences, accurate and efficient learning of large-scale BN structures from high-dimensional data becomes a challenging problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Sparse Bayesian Network (SBN) structure learning algorithm that employs a novel formulation involving one L1-norm penalty term to impose sparsity and another penalty term to ensure that the learned BN is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-a required property of BNs. Through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on 11 moderate and large benchmark networks with various sample sizes, we show that SBN leads to improved learning accuracy, scalability, and efficiency as compared with 10 existing popular BN learning algorithms. We apply SBN to a real-world application of brain connectivity modeling for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reveal findings that could lead to advancements in AD research.

Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. Data mining is widely used and has significant applications in various domains. However, current data mining toolkits cannot meet the requirement of applications with large-scale databases in terms of speed. In this paper, we propose three techniques to speedup fundamental problems in data mining algorithms on the CUDA platform: scalable thread scheduling scheme for irregular pattern, parallel distributed top-k scheme, and parallel high dimension reduction scheme. They play a key role in our CUDA-based implementation of three representative data mining algorithms, CU-Apriori, CU-KNN, and CU-K-means. These parallel implementations outperform the other state-of-the-art implementations significantly on a HP xw8600 workstation with a Tesla C1060 GPU and a Core-quad Intel Xeon CPU. Our results have shown that GPU + CUDA parallel architecture is feasible and promising for data mining applications.

Price prediction is a problem of great complexity and, usually, some technical indicators are used to predict market trends. The main difficulty in using technical indicators lies in deciding a set of parameter values. We proposed the use of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to obtain the best parameter values belonging to a collection of indicators that will help in the buying and selling of shares. The experimental results indicate that our MOEA offers a solution to the problem by obtaining results that improve those obtained through technical indicators with standard parameters. In order to reduce execution time is necessary to parallelize the executions. Parallelization results show that distributing the workload of indicators in multiple processors to improve performance is recommended. This parallelization has been performed taking advantage of the idle time in a corporate technology infrastructure. We have configured a small parallel grid using the students Labs of a Computer Science University College.

J	Kamiran, F; Zliobaite, I; Calders, T				Kamiran, Faisal; Zliobaite, Indre; Calders, Toon			Quantifying explainable discrimination and removing illegal discrimination in automated decision making	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; Independence; Discrimination-aware data mining	ECONOMICS	Recently, the following discrimination-aware classification problem was introduced. Historical data used for supervised learning may contain discrimination, for instance, with respect to gender. The question addressed by discrimination-aware techniques is, given sensitive attribute, how to train discrimination-free classifiers on such historical data that are discriminative, with respect to the given sensitive attribute. Existing techniques that deal with this problem aim at removing all discrimination and do not take into account that part of the discrimination may be explainable by other attributes. For example, in a job application, the education level of a job candidate could be such an explainable attribute. If the data contain many highly educated male candidates and only few highly educated women, a difference in acceptance rates between woman and man does not necessarily reflect gender discrimination, as it could be explained by the different levels of education. Even though selecting on education level would result in more males being accepted, a difference with respect to such a criterion would not be considered to be undesirable, nor illegal. Current state-of-the-art techniques, however, do not take such gender-neutral explanations into account and tend to overreact and actually start reverse discriminating, as we will show in this paper. Therefore, we introduce and analyze the refined notion of conditional non-discrimination in classifier design. We show that some of the differences in decisions across the sensitive groups can be explainable and are hence tolerable. Therefore, we develop methodology for quantifying the explainable discrimination and algorithmic techniques for removing the illegal discrimination when one or more attributes are considered as explanatory. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world classification datasets demonstrates that the new techniques are superior to the old ones in this new context, as they succeed in removing almost exclusively the undesirable discrimination, while leaving the explainable differences unchanged, allowing for differences in decisions as long as they are explainable.

J	Kamran, M; Farooq, M				Kamran, M.; Farooq, Muddassar			A Formal Usability Constraints Model for Watermarking of Outsourced Datasets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Data usability; knowledge-preserving; ownership-preserving data mining; right protection; watermarking datasets	RELATIONAL DATA; PROTECTION	The large datasets are being mined to extract hidden knowledge and patterns that assist decision makers in making effective, efficient, and timely decisions in an ever increasing competitive world. This type of "knowledge-driven" data mining activity is not possible without sharing the "datasets" between their owners and data mining experts (or corporations); as a consequence, protecting ownership (by embedding a watermark) on the datasets is becoming relevant. The most important challenge in watermarking (to be mined) datasets is: how to preserve knowledge in features or attributes? Usually, an owner needs to manually define "Usability constraints" for each type of dataset to preserve the contained knowledge. The major contribution of this paper is a novel formal model that facilitates a data owner to define usability constraints-to preserve the knowledge contained in the dataset-in an automated fashion. The model aims at preserving "classification potential" of each feature and other major characteristics of datasets that play an important role during the mining process of data; as a result, learning statistics and decision-making rules also remain intact. We have implemented our model and integrated it with a new watermark embedding algorithm to prove that the inserted watermark not only preserves the knowledge contained in a dataset but also significantly enhances watermark security compared with existing techniques. We have tested our model on 25 different data-mining datasets to show its efficacy, effectiveness, and the ability to adapt and generalize.

A hybrid OLAP-association rule mining based quality management system for extracting defect patterns in the garment industry	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Quality management; Garment industry; Garment defect; Association rule mining; OLAP	GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; TIME	In today's garment industry, garment defects have to be minimized so as to fulfill the expectations of demanding customers who seek products of high quality but low cost. However, without any data mining tools to manage massive data related to quality, it is difficult to investigate the hidden patterns among defects which are important information for improving the quality of garments. This paper presents a hybrid OLAP-association rule mining based quality management system (HQMS) to extract defect patterns in the garment industry. The mined results indicate the relationship between defects which serves as a reference for defect prediction, root cause identification and the formulation of proactive measures for quality improvement. Because real-time access to desirable information is crucial for survival under the severe competition, the system is equipped with Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) features so that manufacturers are able to explore the required data in a timely manner. The integration of OLAP and association rule mining allows data mining to be applied on a multidimensional basis. A pilot run of the HQMS is undertaken in a garment manufacturing company to demonstrate how OLAP and association rule mining are effective in discovering patterns among product defects. The results indicate that the HQMS contributes significantly to the formulation of quality improvement in the industry. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Lee, C. K. H.; Choy, K. L.; Ho, G.

A study on abnormal event correlation analysis for convergence security monitor	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Convergence security; Correlation analysis; Security monitor		Recently, the leak of domestic core technology of major business in Korea and the subsequent damage, has been increasing every year. Financial losses due to this leak are estimated to be about 220 trillion, which is equivalent to the gross budget of Korea Besides. Currently, the paradigm of industrial security has been changed from simple installation of security equipment to efficient management and control market. Leakage of internal material is able to be prevented, blocked and tracking afterward innovatively through enterprise risk management and security control by fusion of physical security system (entrance control system, vision security system etc.) and IT integrated security control system. It can be possible to setup systematical converging security control process in short term by achieving an effect to running expert organization without additional investment for current physical security and IT security personnel, and it is needed to firmly setup the acquisition and integrated control of IT security and physical security, connected tracking control when security issue is happened, definition for terms of information leakage and security violation and real-time observation, rapid determination and reaction/corrective action for trial of security violation and information leakage, phased and systematic security policy by individual technology. The majority of the leaks are caused by former and current staff members, cooperated businesses, scientists and investment companies. This shows that the sources of the leaks are internal personnel. In this manner, we can infer that the management and plan of personnel security has not implemented sound practices to prevent technology leak by people. Therefore, this thesis suggests classifying methods of technology leak through clustering, one of the data mining methods about the information of internal personnel to prevent core technology leak from businesses.

However, existing mining trajectories utilizing high-utility itemsets may not offer firms sufficient business insights unless they can precisely assess the value of association rules, which may vary substantially depending on many business parameters included in the assessment. In this study, we propose a utility-based association-rule mining method that valuates association rules by measuring their specific business benefits accruing to firms. Based on previous studies, three key elements (opportunity, effectiveness, and probability) are identified to define and operationalize a users' preference as a utility function. To apply the utility-based mechanism to the processing of large transaction databases, we constructed functional algorithms, with heightened attention paid to their pruning strategies, and evaluated them based on real-world databases. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can provide users with greater business benefits than the high-utility itemset mining approach, suggesting several important strategic implications for both research and practice.

J	Leeke, M; Jhumka, A; Anand, SS				Leeke, Matthew; Jhumka, Arshad; Anand, Sarabjot Singh			Towards the Design of Efficient Error Detection Mechanisms for Transient Data Errors	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						software dependability; fault injection; data mining; error detection mechanisms; symbolic pattern learning	LIKELY PROGRAM INVARIANTS; FAULT-TOLERANCE; INJECTION; COST	A dependable software system must contain two dependability components: (i) error detection mechanisms (EDMs) and (ii) error recovery mechanisms. Currently, EDMs are generally designed based on some system specification or based on the experience of software engineers, with their efficiency typically being measured using fault injection and software measures such as coverage and latency. In contrast to finite-state programs, for which efficient EDMs can be obtained by design, no systematic design approach exists for real-world software systems. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing an approach for the design of highly efficient error detection predicates for EDMs for such software systems. Our approach is based on the use of data mining techniques to classify states as safe or failure-inducing. The results presented, under a transient data value fault model, demonstrate the viability of the approach for the development of efficient EDMs, as the EDMs generated yield a true positive rate of nearly 100% and a false positive rate close to 0% for the detection of failure-inducing states.

HMMs are widely used to model real-world systems. Like graph matching, some previous approaches compare HMMs by evaluating the correspondence, or goodness of match, between every pair of states, concentrating on the structure of the models instead of the statistics of the process being observed. To remedy this, we present a new metric space that compares the statistics of HMMs within a given level of statistical significance. Compared with the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is another widely used approach for measuring model similarity, our approach is a true metric, can always return an appropriate distance value, and provides a confidence measure on the metric value. Experimental results are given for a sample application, which quantify the similarity of HMMs of network traffic in the Tor anonymization system. This application is interesting since it considers models extracted from a system that is intentionally trying to obfuscate its internal workings. In the conclusion, we discuss applications in less-challenging domains, such as data mining.

Artificial metaplasticity prediction model for cognitive rehabilitation outcome in acquired brain injury patients	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Data mining; Artificial metaplasticity; Cognitive Rrehabilitation and acquired brain injury	DECISION-TREE ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PLASTICITY; REGRESSION; VARIABLES	Objective: The main purpose of this research is the novel use of artificial metaplasticity on multilayer perceptron (AMMLP) as a data mining tool for prediction the outcome of patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) after cognitive rehabilitation. The final goal aims at increasing knowledge in the field of rehabilitation theory based on cognitive affectation. Methods and materials: The data set used in this study contains records belonging to 123 ABI patients with moderate to severe cognitive affectation (according to Glasgow Coma Scale) that underwent rehabilitation at Institut Guttmann Neurorehabilitation Hospital (IG) using the tele-rehabilitation platform PREVIRNEC (c). The variables included in the analysis comprise the neuropsychological initial evaluation of the patient (cognitive affectation profile), the results of the rehabilitation tasks performed by the patient in PREVIRNEC (c) and the outcome of the patient after a 3-5 months treatment. To achieve the treatment outcome prediction, we apply and compare three different data mining techniques: the AMMLP model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and a C4.5 decision tree. Results: The prediction performance of the models was measured by ten-fold cross validation and several architectures were tested. The results obtained by the AMMLP model are clearly superior, with an average predictive performance of 91.56%. BPNN and C4.5 models have a prediction average accuracy of 80.18% and 89.91% respectively. The best single AMMLP model provided a specificity of 92.38%, a sensitivity of 91.76% and a prediction accuracy of 92.07%. Conclusions: The proposed prediction model presented in this study allows to increase the knowledge about the contributing factors of an ABI patient recovery and to estimate treatment efficacy in individual patients. The ability to predict treatment outcomes may provide new insights toward improving effectiveness and creating personalized therapeutic interventions based on clinical evidence.

We sought to use predictive data mining and high dimensional analytics of electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a highly accurate and clinically actionable 5 year life expectancy index. Materials and methods We developed the index using EHR data for 7463 patients >= 50 years old with >= 1 visit(s) in 2003 to a large, academic, multispecialty group practice. We extracted 980 attributes from the EHRs of the practices and affiliated hospitals. Correlation feature selection with greedy stepwise search was used to find the attribute subset with best average merit. Rotation forest ensembling with alternating decision tree as underlying classifier was used to predict 5 year mortality. Model performance was compared with the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Walter life expectancy method. Results Within 5 years of the last visit in 2003, 838 (11%) patients had died. The final model included 24 attributes: two demographic (age, sex), 10 comorbidity (eg, cardiovascular disease), one vital sign (mean diastolic blood pressure), two medications (loop diuretic use, digoxin use), six laboratory (eg, mean albumin), and three healthcare utilization (eg, the number of hospitalizations 1 year prior to the last visit in 2003). The index showed very good discrimination (c-statistic 0.86) and outperformed comparators. Conclusions The EHR based index successfully distinguished adults >= 50 years old with life expectancy > 5 years from those with life expectancy <= 5 years. This information could be used clinically to optimize preventive service use (eg, cancer screening in the elderly).

Groupwise Conditional Random Forests for Automatic Shape Classification and Contour Quality Assessment in Radiotherapy Planning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Data mining; decision forests; machine learning; pattern recognition and classification; radiation therapy; random forests; shape analysis	GRAPH CUTS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; LOCALIZATION; RETRIEVAL	Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer patients around the world. High quality treatment plans maximally radiate the targets while minimally radiating healthy organs at risk. In order to judge plan quality and safety, segmentations of the targets and organs at risk are created, and the amount of radiation that will be delivered to each structure is estimated prior to treatment. If the targets or organs at risk are mislabelled, or the segmentations are of poor quality, the safety of the radiation doses will be erroneously reviewed and an unsafe plan could proceed. We propose a technique to automatically label groups of segmentations of different structures from a radiation therapy plan for the joint purposes of providing quality assurance and data mining. Given one or more segmentations and an associated image we seek to assign medically meaningful labels to each segmentation and report the confidence of that label. Our method uses random forests to learn joint distributions over the training features, and then exploits a set of learned potential group configurations to build a conditional random field (CRF) that ensures the assignment of labels is consistent across the group of segmentations. The CRF is then solved via a constrained assignment problem. We validate our method on 1574 plans, consisting of 17 579 segmentations, demonstrating an overall classification accuracy of 91.58%. Our results also demonstrate the stability of RF with respect to tree depth and the number of splitting variables in large data sets.

Should we seek lessons that are global to multiple projects or just local to particular projects? This paper aims to comparatively evaluate local versus global lessons learned for effort estimation and defect prediction. We applied automated clustering tools to effort and defect datasets from the PROMISE repository. Rule learners generated lessons learned from all the data, from local projects, or just from each cluster. The results indicate that the lessons learned after combining small parts of different data sources (i.e., the clusters) were superior to either generalizations formed over all the data or local lessons formed from particular projects. We conclude that when researchers attempt to draw lessons from some historical data source, they should 1) ignore any existing local divisions into multiple sources, 2) cluster across all available data, then 3) restrict the learning of lessons to the clusters from other sources that are nearest to the test data.

In the era of Big Data, this problem becomes much more dramatic, since users may be literally overwhelmed by the cataract of data accessible in the most varied forms. With context-aware data tailoring, given a target application, in each specific context the system allows the user to access only the view which is relevant for that application in that context. Moreover, the relative importance of information to the same user in a different context or, reciprocally, to a different user in the same context, may vary enormously; for this reason, contextual preferences can be used to further refine the views associated with contexts, by imposing a ranking on the data of each context-aware view. In this paper, we propose a methodology and a system, PREMINE (PREference MINEr), where data mining is adopted to infer contextual preferences from the past interaction of the user with contextual views over a relational database, gathering knowledge in terms of association rules between each context and the relevant data.

Mining numerical association rules via multi-objective genetic algorithms	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Numerical association rule; Multi-objective genetic algorithms; Confidence; Comprehensibility; Interestingness; Rough value	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION	Association rule discovery is an ever increasing area of interest in data mining. Finding rules for attributes with numerical values is still a challenging point in the process of association rule discovery. Most of popular methods for association rule mining cannot be applied to the numerical data without data discretization. There have been efforts to resolve the problem of dealing with numeric data. These approaches suffer from problems which are discussed in this paper. This work proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm approach for mining association rules for numerical data. Several measures are defined in order to determine more efficient rules. Three measures, confidence, interestingness, and comprehensibility have been used as different objectives for our multi objective optimization which is amplified with genetic algorithms approach. Finally, the best rules are obtained through Pareto optimality. This method is based on the notion of rough patterns that use rough values defined with upper and lower intervals to represent a range or set of values. Mutation and crossover operators give a powerful exploration ability to the method and allow it to find out the best intervals of existing numerical values. The experimental results show that the generated rules by this method are more appropriate - based on several different characteristics - than the similar approaches' results, and our method outperforms these methods.

When the attributes do not properly describe the initial data, performance starts to degrade. Some algorithms address this problem by internally changing the representation space, but the newly constructed features rarely have any meaning. We seek to construct, in an unsupervised way, new attributes that are more appropriate for describing a given dataset and, at the same time, comprehensible for a human user. We propose two algorithms that construct the new attributes as conjunctions of the initial primitive attributes or their negations. The generated feature sets have reduced correlations between features and succeed in catching some of the hidden relations between individuals in a dataset. For example, a feature like would be true for non-urban images and is more informative than simple features expressing the presence or the absence of an object. The notion of Pareto optimality is used to evaluate feature sets and to obtain a balance between total correlation and the complexity of the resulted feature set. Statistical hypothesis testing is employed in order to automatically determine the values of the parameters used for constructing a data-dependent feature set. We experimentally show that our approaches achieve the construction of informative feature sets for multiple datasets.

J	Sadeghi, S; Beigy, H				Sadeghi, Sabereh; Beigy, Hamid			A NEW ENSEMBLE METHOD FOR FEATURE RANKING IN TEXT MINING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Text classification; dimensionality reduction; feature ranking; ensemble based learning algorithms	FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Dimensionality reduction is a necessary task in data mining when working with high dimensional data. A type of dimensionality reduction is feature selection. Feature selection based on feature ranking has received much attention by researchers. The major reasons are its scalability, ease of use, and fast computation. Feature ranking methods can be divided into different categories and may use different measures for ranking features. Recently, ensemble methods have entered in the field of ranking and achieved more accuracy among others. Accordingly, in this paper a Heterogeneous ensemble based algorithm for feature ranking is proposed. The base ranking methods in this ensemble structure are chosen from different categories like information theoretic, distance based, and statistical methods. The results of the base ranking methods are then fused into a final feature subset by means of genetic algorithm. The diversity of the base methods improves the quality of initial population of the genetic algorithm and thus reducing the convergence time of the genetic algorithm. In most of ranking methods, it's the user's task to determine the threshold for choosing the appropriate subset of features. It is a problem, which may cause the user to try many different values to select a good one. In the proposed algorithm, the difficulty of determining a proper threshold by the user is decreased. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on four different text datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all other five feature ranking methods used for comparison. One advantage of the proposed method is that it is independent to the classification method used for classification.

J	Sathiaraj, D; Triantaphyllou, E				Sathiaraj, David; Triantaphyllou, Evangelos			On Identifying Critical Nuggets of Information during Classification Tasks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; classification; critical nuggets; outliers; classification accuracy; class boundary; duality	DISTANCE-BASED OUTLIERS; DIMENSIONAL DATA SETS; MIXED-ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHMS	In large databases, there may exist critical nuggets-small collections of records or instances that contain domain-specific important information. This information can be used for future decision making such as labeling of critical, unlabeled data records and improving classification results by reducing false positive and false negative errors. This work introduces the idea of critical nuggets, proposes an innovative domain-independent method to measure criticality, suggests a heuristic to reduce the search space for finding critical nuggets, and isolates and validates critical nuggets from some real-world data sets. It seems that only a few subsets may qualify to be critical nuggets, underlying the importance of finding them. The proposed methodology can detect them. This work also identifies certain properties of critical nuggets and provides experimental validation of the properties. Experimental results also helped validate that critical nuggets can assist in improving classification accuracies in real-world data sets.

To do this, however, data needs to be analyzed in typically nontrivial refinement processes, which require technical expertise about methods and algorithms, experience with how a precise analysis should proceed, and knowledge about an exploding number of analytic approaches. To alleviate these problems, a plethora of different systems have been proposed that "intelligently" help users to analyze their data. This article provides a first survey to almost 30 years of research on intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs). It explicates the types of help IDAs can provide to users and the kinds of (background) knowledge they leverage to provide this help. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the systems developed over the past years, identifies their most important features, and sketches an ideal future IDA as well as the challenges on the road ahead.

First, DFT is applied to discover seasonal variation patterns, and two typical patterns were identified. Second, linear regression is used to determine influential variables, and a weighted similarity method derived from the amplitude of each DFT wave is applied for the SF assignment. The results obtained by DFT demonstrate promising assignment accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error of 4.27% for all data and 3.96% for the low seasonal household percentage subclass.

Moreover, its 3D structure complicates this clustering problem. We propose a centroid-based actionable 3D subspace clustering framework, named CATSeeker, which allows incorporation of domain knowledge, and achieves parameter insensitivity and excellent performance through a unique combination of singular value decomposition, numerical optimization, and 3D frequent itemset mining. Experimental results on synthetic, protein structural, and financial data show that CATSeeker significantly outperforms all the competing methods in terms of efficiency, parameter insensitivity, and cluster usefulness.

J	Tao, YY; Zhang, YZ; Cao, J; Huang, YL				Tao, Yanyun; Zhang, Yuzhen; Cao, Jian; Huang, Yalong			A module-level three-stage approach to the evolutionary design of sequential logic circuits	GENETIC PROGRAMMING AND EVOLVABLE MACHINES			English	Article						Evolutionary approach; Module-level; Three-stage; Sequential circuits; Data mining; Frequently evolved blocks; Redundant states	HARDWARE	In this study, we propose a module-level three-stage approach (TSA) to optimize the evolutionary design for synchronous sequential circuits. TSA has a three stages process, involving a genetic algorithm (GA), a pre-evolution, and a re-evolution. In the first stage, the GA simplifies the number of states and automatically searches the state assignment that can produce the circuit with small complexity. Then, the second stage evolves a set of high-performing circuits to acquire frequently evolved blocks, which will be re-used for more compact and simple solutions in the next stage. In this stage, a genetic programming (GP) is proposed for evolving the high-performing circuits and data mining is used as a finder of frequently evolved blocks in these circuits. In the final stage, the acquired blocks are encapsulated into the function and terminal set to produce a new population in the re-evolution. The blocks are expected to make the convergence faster and hence efficiently reduce the complexity of the evolved circuits. Seven problems of three types-sequence detectors, modulo-n counters and ISCAS89 circuits-are used to test our three-stage approach. The simulation results for these experiments are promising, and our approach is shown to be better than the other methods for sequential logic circuits design in terms of convergence time, success rate, and maximum fitness improvement across generations.

Commonly used density estimation methods such as kernel density estimator and -nearest neighbour density estimator have high time and space complexities which render them inapplicable in problems with big data. This weakness sets the fundamental limit in existing algorithms for all these tasks. We propose the first density estimation method, having average case sub-linear time complexity and constant space complexity in the number of instances, that stretches this fundamental limit to an extent that dealing with millions of data can now be done easily and quickly. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the new density estimator and verify the generality of the method by replacing existing density estimators with the new one in three current density-based algorithms, namely DBSCAN, LOF and Bayesian classifiers, representing three different data mining tasks of clustering, anomaly detection and classification. Our empirical evaluation results show that the new density estimation method significantly improves their time and space complexities, while maintaining or improving their task-specific performances in clustering, anomaly detection and classification. The new method empowers these algorithms, currently limited to small data size only, to process big data-setting a new benchmark for what density-based algorithms can achieve.

J	Vucetic, M; Hudec, M; Vujosevic, M				Vucetic, Miljan; Hudec, Miroslav; Vujosevic, Mirko			A new method for computing fuzzy functional dependencies in relational database systems	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fuzzy relational database; Fuzzy implication; Proximity relation; Fuzzy functional dependency; Data mining	APPROXIMATE DEPENDENCIES; IMPLICATION OPERATORS; REPRESENTATION; DISCOVERY; VALUES; MODELS; SETS	In this paper, we present a new method for computing fuzzy functional dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relational database systems. The method is based on the use of fuzzy implications. A literature analysis has shown that there is no algorithm that would enable the identification of attribute relationships in fuzzy relational schemas. This fact was the motive for development a new methodology in the analysis of fuzzy functional dependencies over a given set of attributes. Solving this, not so new problem, is not only research challenge having theoretical importance, but it also has practical significance. Possible applications of the proposed methodology include GIS, data mining, information retrieval, reducing data redundancy in fuzzy relations through implementation of logical database model, estimation of missing values etc. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, CS; Liu, YH; Chu, KC				Wang, Chun-Sheng; Liu, Ying-Ho; Chu, Kuo-Chung			Closed inter-sequence pattern mining	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Closed patterns; Data mining; Inter-sequence pattern	TRANSACTIONAL ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTEXTS; ITEMSETS	Inter-sequence pattern mining can find associations across several sequences in a sequence database, which can discover both a sequential pattern within a transaction and sequential patterns across several different transactions. However, inter-sequence pattern mining algorithms usually generate a large number of recurrent frequent patterns. We have observed mining closed inter-sequence patterns instead of frequent ones can lead to a more compact yet complete result set. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model of closed inter-sequence pattern mining and an efficient algorithm called CISP-Miner for mining such patterns, which enumerates closed inter-sequence patterns recursively along a search tree in a depth-first search manner. In addition, several effective pruning strategies and closure checking schemes are designed to reduce the search space and thus accelerate the algorithm. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CISP-Miner algorithm is very efficient and outperforms a compared EISP-Miner algorithm in most cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, YX; Zhang, YJ				Wang, Yu-Xiong; Zhang, Yu-Jin			Nonnegative Matrix Factorization: A Comprehensive Review	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; dimensionality reduction; multivariate data analysis; nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)	CONSTRAINED LEAST-SQUARES; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TENSOR FACTORIZATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FACE RECOGNITION; GRADIENT-METHOD; ALPHA-BETA; ALGORITHMS; INITIALIZATION; DIVERGENCES	Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a relatively novel paradigm for dimensionality reduction, has been in the ascendant since its inception. It incorporates the nonnegativity constraint and thus obtains the parts-based representation as well as enhancing the interpretability of the issue correspondingly. This survey paper mainly focuses on the theoretical research into NMF over the last 5 years, where the principles, basic models, properties, and algorithms of NMF along with its various modifications, extensions, and generalizations are summarized systematically. The existing NMF algorithms are divided into four categories: Basic NMF (BNMF), Constrained NMF (CNMF), Structured NMF (SNMF), and Generalized NMF (GNMF), upon which the design principles, characteristics, problems, relationships, and evolution of these algorithms are presented and analyzed comprehensively. Some related work not on NMF that NMF should learn from or has connections with is involved too. Moreover, some open issues remained to be solved are discussed. Several relevant application areas of NMF are also briefly described. This survey aims to construct an integrated, state-of-the-art framework for NMF concept, from which the follow-up research may benefit.

J	Wei, LY; Peng, WC; Lee, WC				Wei, Ling-Yin; Peng, Wen-Chih; Lee, Wang-Chien			Exploring Pattern-Aware Travel Routes for Trajectory Search	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Measurement; Experimentation; Trajectory pattern mining; trajectory search; route planning; data mining	SYSTEM	With the popularity of positioning devices, Web 2.0 technology, and trip sharing services, many users are willing to log and share their trips on the Web. Thus, trip planning Web sites are able to provide some new services by inferring Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) and recommending popular travel routes from trip trajectories. We argue that simply providing some travel routes consisting of popular ROIs to users is not sufficient. To tour around a wide geographical area, for example, a city, some users may prefer a trip to visit as many ROIs as possible, while others may like to stop by only a few ROIs for an in-depth visit. We refer to a trip fitting the former user group as an in-breadth trip and a trip suitable for the latter user group as an in-depth trip. Prior studies on trip planning have focused on mining ROIs and travel routes without considering these different preferences. In this article, given a spatial range and a user preference of depth/breadth specified by a user, we develop a Pattern-Aware Trajectory Search (PATS) framework to retrieve the top K trajectories passing through popular ROIs. PATS is novel because the returned travel trajectories, discovered from travel patterns hidden in trip trajectories, may represent the most valuable travel experiences of other travelers fitting the user's trip preference in terms of depth or breadth. The PATS framework comprises two components: travel behavior exploration and trajectory search. The travel behavior exploration component determines a set of ROIs along with their attractive scores by considering not only the popularity of the ROIs but also the travel sequential relationships among the ROIs. To capture the travel sequential relationships among ROIs and to derive their attractive scores, a user movement graph is constructed. For the trajectory search component of PATS, we formulate two trajectory score functions, the depth-trip score function and the breadth-trip score function, by taking into account the number of ROIs in a trajectory and their attractive scores. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm, namely, Bounded Trajectory Search (BTS), to efficiently retrieve the top K trajectories based on the two trajectory scores. The PATS framework is evaluated by experiments and user studies using a real dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed PATS framework.

J	Wu, XM; Satoh, S				Wu, Xiaomeng; Satoh, Shin'ichi			Ultrahigh-Speed TV Commercial Detection, Extraction, and Matching	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Content-based retrieval; data mining; search methods; video signal processing	SEQUENCE DETECTION; STREAMS; VIDEO	We describe a system based on exact-duplicate matching for detecting and localizing TV commercials in a video stream, clustering the exact duplicates, and detecting duplicate exact-duplicate clusters across video streams. A two-stage temporal recurrence hashing algorithm is used for the detection, localization, and clustering. The algorithm is fully unsupervised, generic, and ultrahigh speed. Another algorithm is used to integrate the video and audio streams to achieve higher performance extraction. Its sequence-and frame-level accuracies in testing were respectively 98.1% and 97.4%. A third algorithm uses a new bag-of-fingerprints model to detect duplicate exact-duplicate clusters across multiple streams. It is robust against decoding errors. Its contributions include: 1) fully unsupervised detection, extraction, and matching of exact duplicates; 2) more generic commercial detection than with the knowledge-based techniques; 3) ultrahigh-speed processing, which detected the TV commercials from a one-month video stream in less than 42 minutes, which is more than ten times faster than with state-of-the-art algorithms; and 4) more generic operation in terms of signal input, the performance of which is consistent between video and audio streams. Testing using a video database containing a ten-hour, a one-month, and a five-year video stream comprehensively demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of this system.

It is applicable in many fields which use the multi-way data, such as data mining, machine learning and computer vision. In this paper, we adapt operator splitting technique and convex relaxation technique to transform the original problem into a convex, unconstrained optimization problem and propose a fixed point iterative method to solve it. We also prove the convergence of the method under some assumptions. By using a continuation technique, we propose a fast and robust algorithm for solving the tensor completion problem, which is called FP-LRTC (Fixed Point for Low n-Rank Tensor Completion). Our numerical results on randomly generated and real tensor completion problems demonstrate that this algorithm is effective, especially for "easy" problems.

Conventional intercell interference coordination (ICIC) approaches are based on fixed or dynamic frequency reuse, which more or less underutilize frequency resources or reduce network-wide performance. As a result, the benefit brought by ICIC is questionable in practical networks. In this paper, we tackle this problem from the self-organizing network (SON) viewpoint by optimizing fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and adapting to dynamic traffic maps. The approach proposed by this paper formulates this problem as an optimization problem with multiple key performance indicators (Multi-KPIs), and a traffic-based dynamic spectrum management (DSM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the call drop and block ratio (CDBR) and to also improve the network throughput. To reduce further the cost of spectrum partition and assignment, we conduct data mining for the traffic maps from realistic networks and then obtain traffic stable states for a longer specific period of time. DSM based on the stable states (DSM-SS) approach brings further benefits for Long Term Evolution networks in terms of operational costs. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the traditional schemes.

J	Banu, RV; Nagaveni, N				Banu, R. Vidya; Nagaveni, N.			Evaluation of a perturbation-based technique for privacy preservation in a multi-party clustering scenario	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data transformation; Multi-party clustering; K-means clustering; Self-organising map; Geometrical data transformation method; Principal component analysis	MODEL	Data processing techniques and the growth of the intemet have resulted in a data explosion. The data that are now available may contain sensitive information that could, if misused, jeopardise the privacy of individuals. In today's web world, the privacy of personal and personal business information is a growing concern for individuals, corporate entities and governments. Preserving personal and sensitive information is critical to the success of today's data mining techniques. Preserving the privacy of data is even more crucial in critical sectors such as defence, health care and finance. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) addresses such issues by balancing the preservation of privacy and the utilisation of data. Traditionally, Geometrical Data Transformation Methods (GDTMs) have been widely used for privacy preserving clustering. The drawback of these methods is that geometric transformation functions are invertible, which results in a lower level of privacy protection. In this work, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based technique that preserves the privacy of sensitive information in a multi-party clustering scenario is proposed. The performance of this technique is evaluated further by applying a classical K-means clustering algorithm, as well as a machine learning-based clustering method on synthetic and real world datasets. The accuracy of clustering is computed before and after privacy-preserving transformation. The proposed PCA-based transformation method resulted in superior privacy protection and better performance when compared to the traditional GDTMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, the privacy issue in sharing trajectory data among different parties often creates an obstacle for effective data mining. In this paper, we study the challenges of anonymizing trajectory data: high dimensionality, sparseness, and sequentiality. Employing traditional privacy models and anonymization methods often leads to low data utility in the resulting data and ineffective data mining. In addressing these challenges, this is the first paper to introduce local suppression to achieve a tailored privacy model for trajectory data anonymization. The framework allows the adoption of various data utility metrics for different data mining tasks. As an illustration, we aim at preserving both instances of location-time doublets and frequent sequences in a trajectory database, both being the foundation of many trajectory data mining tasks. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data sets suggest that the framework is effective and efficient to overcome the challenges in trajectory data anonymization. In particular, compared with the previous works in the literature, our proposed local suppression method can significantly improve the data utility in anonymous trajectory data.

J	Chun, JY; Hong, D; Jeong, IR; Lee, DH				Chun, Ji Young; Hong, Dowon; Jeong, Ik Rae; Lee, Dong Hoon			Privacy-preserving disjunctive normal form-operations on distributed sets	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Set operation; DNF; Set union; Threshold set intersection	INTERSECTION; EFFICIENT; PROTOCOLS	Privacy-preserving set operations such as set union and set intersection on distributed sets are widely used in data mining in which the preservation of privacy is of the utmost concern. In this paper, we extended privacy-preserving set operations and considered privacy-preserving disjunctive normal form (DNF) operations on distributed sets. A privacy-preserving DNF operation on distributed sets can be used to find a set S-F satisfying S-F = (S-1,S-1 boolean AND ... boolean AND S-1,S-t2) boolean OR ... boolean OR (S-t1,S-1 boolean AND ... boolean AND S-t1,S-t2) without revealing any other information besides just the information which could be inferred from the DNF operations, where S-i,S-j is an element of {A(1), ..., An, (A(1)) over bar, ..., (A(n)) over bar} and set A(k) is known only to a party P-k. A complement set (A(k)) over bar is defined as (A(k)) over bar = (A(1) boolean OR ... boolean OR A(n)) - A(k). Using privacy-preserving DNF operations on distributed sets, it is possible to find set union, (threshold) set intersection, and a set of k-repeated elements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed architecture is based on a hierarchical and distributed strategy where the functionalities are structured on layers. SQL-injection attacks, one of the most dangerous attacks to online databases, are the focus of this research. The agents in each one of the layers are specialized in specific tasks, such as data gathering, data classification, and visualization. This study presents two key agents under a hybrid architecture: a classifier agent that incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning engine employing advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages, and a visualizer agent that integrates several techniques to facilitate the visual analysis of suspicious queries. The former incorporates a new classification model based on a mixture of a neural network and a Support Vector Machine in order to classify SQL queries in a reliable way. The latter combines clustering and neural projection techniques to support the visual analysis and identification of target attacks. The proposed approach was tested in a real-traffic case study and its experimental results, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this paper.

MapReduce with communication overlap (MaRCO)	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Cloud computing; Parallel computing; MapReduce; Performance optimization; Distributed processing; Large-scale data processing		MapReduce is a programming model from Google for cluster-based computing in domains such as search engines, machine learning, and data mining. MapReduce provides automatic data management and fault tolerance to improve programmability of clusters. MapReduce's execution model includes an all-map-to-all-reduce communication, called the shuffle, across the network bisection. Some MapReductions move large amounts of data (e.g., as much as the input data), stressing the bisection bandwidth and introducing significant runtime overhead. Optimizing such shuffle-heavy MapReduction's is important because (1) they include key applications (e.g., inverted indexing for search engines and data clustering for machine learning) and (2) they run longer than shuffle-light MapReductions (e.g., 5x longer). In MapReduce, the asynchronous nature of the shuffle results in some overlap between the shuffle and map. Unfortunately, this overlap is insufficient in shuffle-heavy MapReductions. We propose MapReduce with communication overlap (MaRCO) to achieve nearly full overlap via the novel idea of including reduce in the overlap. While MapReduce lazily performs reduce computation only after receiving all the map data, MaRCO employs eager reduce to process partial data from some map tasks while overlapping with other map tasks' communication. MaRCO's approach of hiding the latency of the inevitably high shuffle volume of shuffle-heavy MapReductions is fundamental for achieving performance. We implement MaRCO in Hadoop's MapReduce and show that on a 128-node Amazon EC2 cluster, MaRCO achieves 23% average speed-up over Hadoop for shuffle-heavy MapReductions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A Reward-and-Punishment-Based Approach for Concept Detection Using Adaptive Ontology Rules	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Algorithms; Design; Experimentation; Adaptive ontology rules; multimedia data mining; dynamic correlation; concept detection; model	VIDEO	Despite the fact that performance improvements have been reported in the last years, semantic concept detection in video remains a challenging problem. Existing concept detection techniques, with ontology rules, exploit the static correlations among primitive concepts but not the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations. The proposed method rewards (or punishes) detected primitive concepts using dynamic spatiotemporal correlations of the given ontology rules and updates these ontology rules based on the accuracy of detection. Adaptively learned ontology rules significantly help in improving the overall accuracy of concept detection as shown in the experimental result.

J	Bhattacharyya, S				Bhattacharyya, Siddhartha			Confidence in predictions from random tree ensembles	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Prediction confidence; Random forests; Conformal prediction; Classification; Data mining	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONFORMAL PREDICTION; RANDOM FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION	Obtaining an indication of confidence of predictions is desirable for many data mining applications. Predictions complemented with confidence levels can inform on the certainty or extent of reliability that may be associated with the prediction. This can be useful in varied application contexts where model outputs form the basis for potentially costly decisions, and in general across risk sensitive applications. The conformal prediction framework presents a novel approach for obtaining valid confidence measures associated with predictions from machine learning algorithms. Confidence levels are obtained from the underlying algorithm, using a non-conformity measure which indicates how 'atypical' a given example set is. The non-conformity measure is a key to determining the usefulness and efficiency of the approach. This paper considers inductive conformal prediction in the context of random tree ensembles like random forests, which have been noted to perform favorably across problems. Focusing on classification tasks, and considering realistic data contexts including class imbalance, we develop non-conformity measures for assessing the confidence of predicted class labels from random forests. We examine the performance of these measures on multiple data sets. Results demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the measures, their relative differences, and highlight the effectiveness of conformal prediction random forests for obtaining predictions with associated confidence.

It allows to identify structures in collections of objects by grouping them into classes, named clusters, in such a way that similarity of objects within any cluster is maximized and similarity of objects belonging to different clusters is minimized. In density-based clustering, a cluster is defined as a connected dense component and grows in the direction driven by the density. The basic structure of density-based clustering presents some common drawbacks: (i) parameters have to be set; (ii) the behavior of the algorithm is sensitive to the density of the starting object; and (iii) adjacent clusters of different densities could not be properly identified. In this paper, we address all the above problems. Our method, based on the concept of space stratification, efficiently identifies the different densities in the dataset and, accordingly, ranks the objects of the original space. Next, it exploits such a knowledge by projecting the original data into a space with one more dimension. It performs a density based clustering taking into account the reverse-nearest-neighbor of the objects. Our method also reduces the number of input parameters by giving a guideline to set them in a suitable way. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm is able to deal with clusters of different densities and outperforms the most popular algorithms DBSCAN and OPTICS in all the standard benchmark datasets.

Most CLV prediction models do not take into consideration the dynamics of the customer purchase behavior and changes of the marketing environment such as the adoption of different promotion policies. In this study, a framework for the dynamic CLV prediction using longitudinal data is presented. In the framework, both the dynamic customer purchase behavior and customized promotions are considered. An improved multiple kernel support vector regression (MK-SVR) approach is developed to predict the future CLV and select the best promotion using both the customer behavioral variables and controlled variable about multiple promotions. Computational experiments using two databases show that the MK-SVR exhibits good prediction performance and the usage of longitudinal data in the MK-SVR facilitate the dynamic prediction and promotion optimization.

J	Dhanasekar, V; Angamuthu, T				Dhanasekar, Vimalkumar; Angamuthu, Tamilarasi			An Efficient Approach for Effectual Mining of Relational Patterns from Multi-Relational Database	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; multi-relational data mining; relational pattern; tree pattern mining; multi-relational database; customer order database	CLASSIFICATION	Data mining is an extremely challenging and hopeful research topic due to its well-built application potential and the broad accessibility of the massive quantities of data in databases. Still, the rising significance of data mining in practical real world necessitates ever more complicated solutions while data includes of a huge amount of records which may be stored in various tables of a relational database. One of the possible solutions is multi-relational pattern mining, which is a form of data mining operating on data stored in multiple tables. Multi-relational pattern mining is an emerging research area and it has been received considerable attention among the researchers due to its various applications. In the proposed work, we have developed an efficient approach for effectual mining of relational patterns from multi-relational database. Initially, the multi-relational database is represented using a tree-based data structure without changing their relations. A tree pattern mining algorithm is devised and applied on the constructed tree-based data structure for extracting the frequent relational patterns. The experimentation is carried out on customer order database and the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in mining of relational patterns.

Efficient greedy feature selection for unsupervised learning	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature selection; Greedy algorithms; Unsupervised learning		Reducing the dimensionality of the data has been a challenging task in data mining and machine learning applications. In these applications, the existence of irrelevant and redundant features negatively affects the efficiency and effectiveness of different learning algorithms. Feature selection is one of the dimension reduction techniques, which has been used to allow a better understanding of data and improve the performance of other learning tasks. Although the selection of relevant features has been extensively studied in supervised learning, feature selection in the absence of class labels is still a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised feature selection, which efficiently selects features in a greedy manner. The paper first defines an effective criterion for unsupervised feature selection that measures the reconstruction error of the data matrix based on the selected subset of features. The paper then presents a novel algorithm for greedily minimizing the reconstruction error based on the features selected so far. The greedy algorithm is based on an efficient recursive formula for calculating the reconstruction error. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised feature selection.

J	Ford, BJ; Xu, HP; Valova, I				Ford, Benjamin J.; Xu, Haiping; Valova, Iren			A Real-Time Self-Adaptive Classifier for Identifying Suspicious Bidders in Online Auctions	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						self-adaptive classifier; incremental neural network; e-commerce; online auctions; auction fraud detection	AUTOMATED AUCTIONS; PERFORMANCE; REPUTATION; SOFTWARE; DESIGN; MODEL	With the significant increase of available item listings in popular online auction houses nowadays, it becomes nearly impossible to manually investigate the large amount of auctions and bidders for shill bidding activities, which are a major type of auction fraud in online auctions. Automated mechanisms such as data mining techniques were proved to be necessary to process this type of increasing workload. In this paper, we first present a framework of Real-Time Self-Adaptive Classifier (RT-SAC) for identifying suspicious bidders in online auctions using an incremental neural network approach. Then, we introduce a clustering module that characterizes bidder behaviors in measurable attributes and uses a hierarchical clustering mechanism to create training datasets. The neural network in RT-SAC is initialized with the training datasets, which consist of labeled historical auction data. Once initialized, the network can be trained incrementally to gradually adapt to new bidding data in real time, and thus, it supports efficient detection of suspicious bidders in online auctions.

Confirmation measures of association rule interestingness	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Confirmation; Evidential support; Interestingness; Association rule; Probability	DISCOVERY; SUPPORT	This paper considers advantages of measures of confirmation or evidential support in the context of interestingness of association rules. In particular, it is argued that the way in which they characterize positive/negative association has advantages over other measures such as null-invariant measures. Several properties are reviewed and proposed as requirements for an adequate confirmation measure in a data mining context. While none of the well-known confirmation measures satisfy all of these requirements, two new measures are proposed which do and one of these is shown to have a further advantage. Some results suggest that these measures are relatively stable when the number of null transactions varies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gullo, F; Domeniconi, C; Tagarelli, A				Gullo, Francesco; Domeniconi, Carlotta; Tagarelli, Andrea			Projective clustering ensembles	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Clustering; Clustering ensembles; Projective clustering; Multi-objective optimization	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; ALGORITHM; CONSENSUS; HIERARCHIES; MODEL	A considerable amount of work has been done in data clustering research during the last four decades, and a myriad of methods has been proposed focusing on different data types, proximity functions, cluster representation models, and cluster presentation. However, clustering remains a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature: it is well known that off-the-shelf clustering methods may discover different patterns in a given set of data, mainly because every clustering algorithm has its own bias resulting from the optimization of different criteria. This bias becomes even more important as in almost all real-world applications, data is inherently high-dimensional and multiple clustering solutions might be available for the same data collection. In this respect, the problems of projective clustering and clustering ensembles have been recently defined to deal with the high dimensionality and multiple clusterings issues, respectively. Nevertheless, despite such two issues can often be encountered together, existing approaches to the two problems have been developed independently of each other. In our earlier work Gullo et al. (Proceedings of the international conference on data mining (ICDM), 2009a) we introduced a novel clustering problem, called projective clustering ensembles (PCE): given a set (ensemble) of projective clustering solutions, the goal is to derive a projective consensus clustering, i.e., a projective clustering that complies with the information on object-to-cluster and the feature-to-cluster assignments given in the ensemble. In this paper, we enhance our previous study and provide theoretical and experimental insights into the PCE problem. PCE is formalized as an optimization problem and is designed to satisfy desirable requirements on independence from the specific clustering ensemble algorithm, ability to handle hard as well as soft data clustering, and different feature weightings. Two PCE formulations are defined: a two-objective optimization problem, in which the two objective functions respectively account for the object- and feature-based representations of the solutions in the ensemble, and a single-objective optimization problem, in which the object- and feature-based representations are embedded into a single function to measure the distance error between the projective consensus clustering and the projective ensemble. The significance of the proposed methods for solving the PCE problem has been shown through an extensive experimental evaluation based on several datasets and comparatively with projective clustering and clustering ensemble baselines.

J	He, M; Vittal, V; Zhang, JS				He, Miao; Vittal, Vijay; Zhang, Junshan			Online Dynamic Security Assessment With Missing PMU Measurements: A Data Mining Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Boosting; data mining; decision tree; ensemble learning; missing PMU data; online dynamic security assessment; random subspace method; transient stability	DECISION TREES; POWER-SYSTEMS	A data mining approach using ensemble decision trees (DTs) learning is proposed for online dynamic security assessment (DSA), with the objective of mitigating the impact of possibly missing PMU data. Specifically, multiple small DTs are first trained offline using a random subspace method. In particular, the developed random subspace method exploits the hierarchy of wide-area monitoring system (WAMS), the locational information of attributes, and the availability of PMU measurements, so as to improve the overall robustness of the ensemble to missing data. Then, the performance of the trained small DTs is re-checked by using new cases in near real-time. In online DSA, viable small DTs are identified in case of missing PMU data, and a boosting algorithm is employed to quantify the voting weights of viable small DTs. The security classification decision for online DSA is obtained via a weighted voting of viable small DTs. A case study using the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	Hu, YH; Wu, F; Liao, YJ				Hu, Ya-Han; Wu, Fan; Liao, Yi-Jiun			An efficient tree-based algorithm for mining sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Data mining; Sequential patterns; PLWAP-tree; Multiple minimum supports	ASSOCIATION RULES	Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is an important technique for determining time-related behavior in sequence databases. In real-life applications, the frequencies for various items in a sequence database are not exactly equal. If all items are set with the same minimum support, the rare item problem may result, meaning that we are unable to effectively retrieve interesting patterns regardless of whether minsup is set too high or too low. Liu (2006) first included the concept of multiple minimum supports (MMSs) to SPM. It allows users to specify the minimum item support (MIS) for each item according to its natural frequency. A generalized sequential pattern-based algorithm, named Multiple Supports - Generalized Sequential Pattern (MS-GSP), was also developed to mine complete set of sequential patterns. However, the MS-GSP adopts candidate generate-and-test approach, which has been recognized as a costly and time-consuming method in pattern discovery. For the efficient mining of sequential patterns with MMSs, this study first proposes a compact data structure, called a Preorder Linked Multiple Supports tree (PLMS-tree), to store and compress the entire sequence database. Based on a PLMS-tree, we develop an efficient algorithm, Multiple Supports - Conditional Pattern growth (MSCP-growth), to discover the complete set of patterns. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach achieves more preferable findings than the MS-GSP and the conventional SPM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many people read news, communicate with friends and purchase goods online. These activities are usually done via web browsing, and web browsers record information about these activities. The recorded data can be used to understand web browsing behavior of users and improve their browsing experience. For example, website usability and the personalization of online services could both benefit from knowledge of user browsing behavior. A number of methods including data mining, text processing and visualization have been used to uncover user browsing patterns. However, these methods are mainly used to analyze and gain insights into collective behavior patterns of either a large amount of separate web users or users within an online community over a prolonged period of time. Very few systems are available for analyzing the detailed behavior of a single user within a relatively short and specific period of time. In an attempt to shorten this gap, we have developed a visual analytic system called WeBeVis. This system offers three different ways of visualizing web browsing data based on our proposed visual metaphors. It also provides a common interface for users to interact with the visualizations. In this paper, we describe this system and present a user study of it. We show that by visualizing the web browsing history of a user, we are able to uncover interesting patterns in the way that individuals use the web.

Detecting the crowdedness spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many applications. An intuitive method is to cluster the objects in areas to get the density information. Unfortunately, the data capturing vehicle mobility possesses some new features, such as highly mobile environments, supremely limited size of sample objects, and nonuniform biased samples, and all these features have raised new challenges that make traditional density-based clustering algorithms fail to retrieve the real clustering property of objects, making the results less meaningful. In this paper, we propose a novel nondensity-based approach called mobility-based clustering. The key idea is that sample objects are employed as "sensors" to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility rather than the "object representatives." As such, the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated. Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified, and techniques to compensate these effects are accordingly proposed. Furthermore, taking the detected crowdedness spots as a label of the taxi, we can identify one particular taxi to be a crowdedness taxi that crosses a number of different crowdedness spots. We evaluate the performance of our methods and baseline approaches based on real traffic situations (to retrieve the real traffic crowdedness) and real-life data sets. Finally, the interesting findings are provided for further discussions.

However, it is always difficult for users to understand, evaluate, and explain the clustering results in the spaces with dimension greater than three. Although high-dimensional visualization of clustering technology can express clustering results well, it still has significant limitations. In this paper, a visualization cluster analysis method based on the minimum distance spectrum (MinDS) is proposed, aimed at reducing the problems of clustering multidimensional datasets. First, the concept of MinDS is defined based on the distance between high-dimensional data. MinDS can map any dataset from high-dimensional space to a lower dimension to determine whether the data set is separable. Next, a clustering method which can automatically determine the number of categories is designed based on MinDS. This method is not only able to cluster a dataset with clear boundaries, but can also cluster the dataset with fuzzy boundaries through the edge corrosion strategy based on the energy of each data point. In addition, strategies for removing noise and identifying outliers are designed to clean datasets according to the characteristics of MinDS.

The proposed classifier separates lower risk patients from higher risk ones, using standard long-term heart rate variability (HRV) measures. Patients are labeled as lower or higher risk according to the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA). A retrospective analysis on two public Holter databases was performed, analyzing the data of 12 patients suffering from mild CHF (NYHA I and II), labeled as lower risk, and 32 suffering from severe CHF (NYHA III and IV), labeled as higher risk. Only patients with a fraction of total heartbeats intervals (RR) classified as normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (NN/RR) higher than 80% were selected as eligible in order to have a satisfactory signal quality. Classification and regression tree (CART) was employed to develop the classifiers. A total of 30 higher risk and 11 lower risk patients were included in the analysis. The proposed classification trees achieved a sensitivity and a specificity rate of 93.3% and 63.6%, respectively, in identifying higher risk patients. Finally, the rules obtained by CART are comprehensible and consistent with the consensus showed by previous studies that depressed HRV is a useful tool for risk assessment in patients suffering from CHF.

It is an extension of data mining to image domain. The main objective of this paper is to apply image mining in the domain such as breast mammograms to classify and detect the cancerous tissue. Mammogram image can be classified into normal, benign, and malignant class. Total of 26 features including histogram intensity features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features are extracted from mammogram images. A hybrid approach of feature selection is proposed, which approximately reduces 75% of the features, and new decision tree is used for classification. The most interesting one is that branch and bound algorithm that is used for feature selection provides the best optimal features and no where it is applied or used for gray-level co-occurrence matrix feature selection from mammogram. Experiments have been taken for a data set of 300 images taken from MIAS of different types with the aim of improving the accuracy by generating minimum number of rules to cover more patterns. The accuracy obtained by this method is approximately 97.7%, which is highly encouraging.

Mammogram breast X-ray imaging is considered the most effective, low-cost, and reliable method in early detection of breast cancer. Although general rules for the differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesion exist, only 15-30% of masses referred for surgical biopsy are actually malignant. Physician experience of detecting breast cancer can be assisted by using some computerized feature extraction and classification algorithms. Computer-aided classification system was used to help in diagnosing abnormalities faster than traditional screening program without the drawback attribute to human factors. In this work, an approach is proposed to develop a computer-aided classification system for cancer detection from digital mammograms. The proposed system consists of three major steps. The first step is region of interest (ROI) extraction of 256 x 256 pixels size. The second step is the feature extraction; we used a set of 26 features, and we found that these features are capable of differentiating between normal and cancerous breast tissues in order to minimize the classification error. The third step is the classification process; we used the technique of the association rule mining to classify between normal and cancerous tissues. The proposed system was shown to have the large potential for cancer detection from digital mammograms.

One high accuracy classifier used for this purpose is based on association rules. In the past, some researches showed that classification based on association rules (or class-association rules - CARS) has higher accuracy than that of other rule-based methods such as ILA and C4.5. However, mining CARs consumes more time because it mines a complete rule set. Therefore, improving the execution time for mining CARs is one of the main problems with this method that needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a new method for mining class-association rule. Firstly, we design a tree structure for the storage frequent itemsets of datasets. Some theorems for pruning nodes and computing information in the tree are developed after that, and then, based on the theorems, we propose an efficient algorithm for mining CARS. Experimental results show that our approach is more efficient than those used previously. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Nguyen, Loan T.

Correctly using large and sophisticated APIs can represent a challenge due to hidden assumptions and requirements. Numerous approaches have been developed to infer properties of APIs, intended to guide their use by developers. With each approach come new definitions of API properties, new techniques for inferring these properties, and new ways to assess their correctness and usefulness. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of over a decade of research on automated property inference for APIs. Our survey provides a synthesis of this complex technical field along different dimensions of analysis: properties inferred, mining techniques, and empirical results. In particular, we derive a classification and organization of over 60 techniques into five different categories based on the type of API property inferred: unordered usage patterns, sequential usage patterns, behavioral specifications, migration mappings, and general information.

First, the paper shows how to preprocess quiz data and how to create several data matrices for use in the process of knowledge discovery. Next, the proposed algorithm that uses grammar-guided genetic programming is described and compared with both classical and recent soft-computing association rule mining algorithms. Then, different objective and subjective rule evaluation measures are used to select the most interesting and useful rules. Experiments have been carried out by using real data of university students enrolled on an artificial intelligence practice Moodle's course on the CLIPS programming language. Some examples of these rules are shown, together with the feedback that they provide to instructors making decisions about how to improve quizzes and courses. Finally, starting with the information provided by the rules, the CLIPS quiz and course have been updated. These innovations have been evaluated by comparing the performance achieved by students before and after applying the changes using one control group and two different experimental groups.

A knowledge-based clinical toxicology consultant for diagnosing multiple exposures	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Knowledge-based systems; Decision support systems; Data mining; Multiple disorder diagnosis; Differential diagnosis; Clinical toxicology	DISORDER DIAGNOSIS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; MODEL; ASSOCIATION; SETH	Objective: This paper presents continued research toward the development of a knowledge-based system for the diagnosis of human toxic exposures. In particular, this research focuses on the challenging task of diagnosing exposures to multiple toxins. Although only 10% of toxic exposures in the United States involve multiple toxins, multiple exposures account for more than half of all toxin-related fatalities. Using simple medical mathematics, we seek to produce a practical decision support system capable of supplying useful information to aid in the diagnosis of complex cases involving multiple unknown substances. Methods: The system is automatically trained using data mining techniques to extract prior probabilities and likelihood ratios from a database managed by the Florida Poison Information Center (FPIC). When supplied with observed clinical effects, the system produces a ranked list of the most plausible toxic exposures. During testing, the system diagnosed toxins at three levels: identifying the substance, identifying the toxin's major and minor categories, and identifying the toxin's major category alone. To enable comparison between these three levels, accuracy was calculated as the percentage of exposures correctly identified in top 10% of trained diagnoses. Results: System evaluation utilized a dataset of 8901 multiple exposure cases and 37,617 single exposure cases. Initial system testing using only multiple exposure cases yielded poor results, with diagnosis accuracies ranging from 18.5% to 50.1%. Further investigation revealed that the system's inability to diagnose multiple disorders resulted from insufficient data and that the clinical effects observed in multiple exposures are dominated by a single substance. Including single exposures when training, the system achieved accuracies as high as 83.5% when diagnosing the primary contributors in multiple exposure cases by substance, 86.9% when diagnosing by major and minor categories, and 79.9% when diagnosing by major category alone. Conclusions: Although the system failed to completely diagnose exposures to multiple toxins, the ability to identify the primary contributor in such cases may prove valuable in aiding medical personnel as they seek to diagnose and treat patients. As time passes and more cases are added to the FPIC database, we believe system accuracy will continue to improve, producing a viable decision support system for clinical toxicology.

Data mining agent conversations: A qualitative approach to multiagent systems analysis	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Agent communication language; Interaction protocol; Interaction analysis; Data mining; Agent-oriented software engineering		This paper presents a novel method for analysing the behaviour of multiagent systems on the basis of the semantically rich information provided by agent communication languages and interaction protocols specified at the knowledge level. More low-level communication mechanisms only allow for a quantitative analysis of the occurrence of message types, the frequency of message sequences, and the empirical distributions of parameter values. Quite differently, the semantics of languages and protocols in multiagent systems can help to extract qualitative properties of observed conversations among agents. This can be achieved by interpreting the logical constraints associated with protocol execution paths or individual messages as the context of an observed interaction, and using them as features of learning samples. The contexts "mined" from such analyses, or context models, can then be used for various tasks, e.g. for predicting others' future responses (useful when trying to make strategic communication decisions to achieve a particular outcome), to support ontological alignment (by comparing the properties of logical constraints attached to messages across participating agents), or to assess the trustworthiness of agents (by verifying the logical coherence of their behaviour). This paper details a formal approach that describes our notion of context models in multiagent conversations, an implementation of this approach in a practical tool for mining qualitative context models, and experimental results to illustrate its use and utility.

Statistical data mining of streaming motion data for activity and fall recognition in assistive environments	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Streaming motion data; Fall detection; Visual data; Cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PROJECTION PURSUIT; ALGORITHMS	The analysis of human motion data is interesting in the context of activity recognition or emergency event detection, especially in the case of elderly or disabled people living independently in their homes. Several techniques have been proposed for identifying such distress situations using either motion, audio and video sensors on the monitored subject (wearable sensors) or devices installed at the surrounding environment. Visual data captured from the user's environment, using overhead cameras along with motion data, which are collected from accelerometers on the subject's body, can be fed to activity detection systems that can detect emergency situations like falls and injuries. The output of these sensors is data streams that require real time recognition, especially in such emergency situations. In this paper, we study motion and activity related streaming data and we propose classification schemes using traditional classification approaches. However, such approaches may not be always applicable for immediate alarm triggering and fall prevention or when CPU power and memory resources are limited (e.g. running the detection algorithm on a mobile device such as smartphones). To this end, we also propose a statistical mining methodology that may be used for real time motion data processing. The paper includes details of the stream data analysis methodology incorporated in the activity recognition and fall detection system along with an initial evaluation of the achieved accuracy in detecting falls. The results are promising and indicate that using the proposed methodology real time fall detection is feasible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tasoulis, S. K.; Plagianakos, V.

J	Tu, Y; Yang, ZJ				Tu, Yan; Yang, Zijiang			An enhanced Customer Relationship Management classification framework with Partial Focus Feature Reduction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customer Relationship Management; Classification; Feature selection; Imbalanced classification; Ensemble classification	MODEL	Effective data mining solutions have for long been anticipated in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to accurately predict customer behavior, but from various industry research and case studies we have observed sub-optimal CRM classification models due to inferior data quality inherent to CRM data set. In this paper, one type of CRM data with a distinctive distribution pattern of Reduced Dimensionality is discussed.

Hence, the need for adequate performance measures has become more important than ever. In this paper, a cost-benefit analysis framework is formalized in order to define performance measures which are aligned with the main objectives of the end users, i.e., profit maximization. A new performance measure is defined, the expected maximum profit criterion. This general framework is then applied to the customer churn problem with its particular cost-benefit structure. The advantage of this approach is that it assists companies with selecting the classifier which maximizes the profit. Moreover, it aids with the practical implementation in the sense that it provides guidance about the fraction of the customer base to be included in the retention campaign.

Sociologists have studied this question for many years. According to some famous sociologists, social links are driven by social intersections. Actors who affiliate with the shared intersections tend to become interpersonally linked and form a cluster. In the social network, an actor cluster could be a clique or a group of several smaller-sized cliques. Thus we can conclude that a social network is composed of superposed cliques of different sizes. However, sociologists did not verify the theory in large scale data due to lack of computing ability. Motivated by this challenge, incorporated with the theory, we utilize data mining technologies to study the evolution patterns of large scale social networks in real world. Then, we propose a novel Clique-superposition generative model, which generates undirected weighted networks. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model can generate networks with static and time evolving patterns observed not only in earlier literature but also in our work.

A well-known privacy model for protecting identity disclosure is k-anonymity. The main goal of anonymizing classification data is to protect individual privacy while maintaining the utility of the data in building classification models. In this paper, we present an approach based on rough sets for measuring the data quality and guiding the process of anonymization operations. First, we make use of the attribute reduction theory of rough sets and introduce the conditional entropy to measure the classification data quality of anonymized datasets. Then, we extend conditional entropy under single-level granulation to hierarchical conditional entropy under multi-level granulation, and study its properties by dynamically coarsening and refining attribute values. Guided by these properties, we develop an efficient search metric and present a novel algorithm for achieving k-anonymity, Hierarchical Conditional Entropy-based Top-Down Refinement (HCE-TDR), which combines rough set theory and attribute value taxonomies. Theoretical analysis and experiments on real world datasets show that our algorithm is efficient and improves data utility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, D; Mabu, S; Hirasawa, K				Zhang, Deng; Mabu, Shingo; Hirasawa, Kotaro			Robust intelligent PCA-based face recognition framework using GNP-fuzzy data mining	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						complicated illumination database; face recognition; genetic-based clustering; GNP-fuzzy data mining; principal component analysis	LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; EXTRACTION; MODELS; LDA	Traditional principal component analysis (PCA) based face recognition algorithms have a low recognition accuracy due to the influence of noise and illumination changes. This paper proposes a robust, intelligent PCA-based face recognition framework in the complicated illumination database when using multiple training images per person (MTIP-CID). There are mainly two improvements in the proposed method. One is that a face-recognition-oriented genetic-based clustering algorithm is introduced to reduce the influence of a large number of classes on the classification accuracy in the MTIP-CID. The other is that a classifier based on fuzzy class association rules (FCARs) is applied to mine the inherent relationships between eigenfaces and to improve the robustness of PCA-based face recognition in noisy environments. Experimental results on the extended Yale-B database demonstrate that the proposed framework performs better and is more robust against noise compared with other traditional face recognition algorithms, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and local binary patterns (LBPs).

J	Garcia-Pedrajas, N; de Haro-Garcia, A; Perez-Rodriguez, J				Garcia-Pedrajas, Nicolas; de Haro-Garcia, Aida; Perez-Rodriguez, Javier			A scalable approach to simultaneous evolutionary instance and feature selection	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Simultaneous instance and feature selection; Instance selection; Feature selection; Instance-based learning; Very large problems	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PROTOTYPE SELECTION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; CONSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; ENSEMBLES; ISSUES	An enormous amount of information is continually being produced in current research, which poses a challenge for data mining algorithms. Many of the problems in extremely active research areas, such as bioinformatics, security and intrusion detection and text mining, involve large or enormous datasets. These datasets pose serious problems for many data mining algorithms. One method to address very large datasets is data reduction. Among the most useful data reduction methods is simultaneous instance and feature selection. This method achieves a considerable reduction in the training data while maintaining, or even improving, the performance of the data-mining algorithm. However, it suffers from a high degree of scalability problems, even for medium-sized datasets. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary simultaneous instance and feature selection algorithm that is scalable to millions of instances and thousands of features. This proposal is based on the divide-and-conquer principle combined with bookkeeping. The divide-and-conquer principle allows the execution of the algorithm in linear time. Furthermore, the proposed method is easy to implement using a parallel environment and can work without loading the entire dataset into memory. Using 50 medium-sized datasets, we will demonstrate our method's ability to match the results of state-of-the-art instance and feature selection methods while significantly reducing the time requirements. Using 13 very large datasets, we will demonstrate the scalability of our proposal to millions of instances and thousands of features. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Breve, F; Zhao, L				Breve, Fabricio; Zhao, Liang			Fuzzy community structure detection by particle competition and cooperation	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Graph-based method; Community detection; Particle competition and cooperation; Overlapping nodes; Outliers	COMPLEX NETWORKS	Identification and classification of overlapping nodes in networks are important topics in data mining. In this paper, a network-based (graph-based) semi-supervised learning method is proposed. It is based on competition and cooperation among walking particles in a network to uncover overlapping nodes by generating continuous-valued outputs (soft labels), corresponding to the levels of membership from the nodes to each of the communities. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to detect overlapping data items in a data set of general form, such as a vector-based data set, once it is transformed to a network. Usually, label propagation involves risks of error amplification. In order to avoid this problem, the proposed method offers a mechanism to identify outliers among the labeled data items, and consequently prevents error propagation from such outliers. Computer simulations carried out for synthetic and real-world data sets provide a numeric quantification of the performance of the method.

In this paper we seek to better understand viral videos on YouTube by analyzing sharing and its relationship to video popularity using millions of YouTube videos. The socialness of a video is quantified by classifying the referrer sources for video views as social (e.g. an emailed link, Facebook referral) or non-social (e.g. a link from related videos). We find that viewership patterns of highly social videos are very different from less social videos. For example, the highly social videos rise to, and fall from, their peak popularity more quickly than less social videos. We also find that not all highly social videos become popular, and not all popular videos are highly social. By using our insights on viral videos we are able develop a method for ranking blogs and websites on their ability to spread viral videos.

Characterization and detection of taxpayers with false invoices using data mining techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						False invoices; Fraud detection; Data mining; Clustering; Prediction	NETWORK	In this paper we give evidence that it is possible to characterize and detect those potential users of false invoices in a given year, depending on the information in their tax payment, their historical performance and characteristics, using different types of data mining techniques. First, clustering algorithms like SUM and neural gas are used to identify groups of similar behaviour in the universe of taxpayers. Then decision trees, neural networks and Bayesian networks are used to identify those variables that are related to conduct of fraud and/or no fraud, detect patterns of associated behaviour and establishing to what extent cases of fraud and/or no fraud can be detected with the available information. This will help identify patterns of fraud and generate knowledge that can be used in the audit work performed by the Tax Administration of Chile (in Spanish Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII)) to detect this type of tax crime.

In this algorithm, a view weight is assigned to each view to identify the compactness of the view and a variable weight is also assigned to each variable in the view to identify the importance of the variable. Both view weights and variable weights are used in the distance function to determine the clusters of objects. In the new algorithm, two additional steps are added to the iterative k-means clustering process to automatically compute the view weights and the variable weights. We used two real-life data sets to investigate the properties of two types of weights in TW-k-means and investigated the difference between the weights of TW-k-means and the weights of the individual variable weighting method. The experiments have revealed the convergence property of the view weights in TW-k-means. We compared TW-k-means with five clustering algorithms on three real-life data sets and the results have shown that the TW-k-means algorithm significantly outperformed the other five clustering algorithms in four evaluation indices.

Data mining on partial discharge signals of power transformer's defect models	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; power transformer defect; partial discharge	TEXTURE ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	Partial discharge (PD) is a common phenomenon that occurs in the insulation of high-voltage equipment, such as transformers, and has a damaging effect on the insulation. If data mining techniques are used to extract special specifications and features for different types of PDs in power transformers or other power equipment, one can diagnose the insulation condition of such equipment by its continuous online monitoring. These diagnosis results can be used to develop precise preventive measures and maintenance procedures. This maintenance would cost less and can be carried out in a shorter time. Consequently, the lifetime expectancy of the transformers will be improved. In this article, experimental models are developed to simulate some of the PD types that can occur in a power transformer. Using these models, some of the features that can differentiate those PD types are extracted through texture analysis. Two classification algorithms are used for the separation of PD sources, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors algorithm. It is anticipated that these models can help us to identify the type of PD fault in a transformer when the required PD measured data are available. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Deng, ZH				Deng, Zhihong			Mining Top-Rank-k Erasable Itemsets by PID_lists	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							ASSOCIATION RULES; FREQUENT ITEMSETS	Mining erasable itemsets are one of new emerging data mining tasks. In this paper, we present a new data representation called a PID_list, which keeps track of the id_nums (identification number) of products that include an itemset. On the basis of the PID_list, we propose a new algorithm called VM for mining top-rank-k erasable itemsets efficiently. The VM algorithm can avoid the time-consuming process of calculating the gain of the candidate itemsets and lots of scans of the databases. Therefore, it can accelerate the task of mining greatly. For evaluating the VM algorithm, we have conducted experiments on six synthetic product databases.

J	Ghosh, S; Mitra, S				Ghosh, Sampreeti; Mitra, Sushmita			Clustering large data with uncertainty	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; CLARANS; Medoid; Fuzzy sets; Clustering		A new algorithm is designed for handling fuzziness while mining large data. A new novel cost function weighted by fuzzy membership, is proposed in the framework of CLARANS. A new scalable approximation to the maximum number of neighbors, explored at each node, is developed; thus reducing the computational time for large data while eliminating the need for user-defined (heuristic) parameters in the existing equation. The goodness of the generated clusters is evaluated in terms of Xie-Beni validity index. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, over both synthetic and real data sets, in terms of goodness of clustering. It is interesting to note that our algorithm always converges to the globally best values at the optimal number of partitions. Moreover compared to existing fuzzy algorithms, FCLARANS without scanning the whole dataset, searching small number of neighbors, is able to handle the uncertainty due to overlapping nature of the various partitions. This is the main motivation of fuzzification of the algorithm CLARANS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, HY; Letourneau, S				Guo, Hongyu; Letourneau, Sylvain			Iterative classification for multiple target attributes	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-target learning; Multitask learning; Iterative classification; Data mining	MULTILABEL CLASSIFICATION; LABELED CLASSIFICATION; RANKING; NETWORKS	Many real-world applications require the simultaneous prediction of multiple target attributes. The techniques currently available for these problems either employ a global model that simultaneously predicts all target attributes or rely on the aggregation of individual models, each predicting one target. This paper introduces a novel solution. Our approach employs an iterative classification strategy to exploit the relationships among multiple target attributes to achieve higher accuracy. The computation scheme is developed as a wrapper in which many standard single-target classification algorithms can be simply "plugged-in" to simultaneously predict multiple targets. An empirical evaluation using eight data sets shows that the proposed method outperforms (1) an approach that constructs independent classifiers for each target, (2) a multitask neural network method, and (3) ensembles of multi-objective decision trees in terms of simultaneously predicting all target attributes correctly.

J	Guo, HY; Viktor, HL; Paquet, E				Guo, Hongyu; Viktor, Herna L.; Paquet, Eric			Reducing the size of databases for multirelational classification: a subgraph-based approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-relational classification; Relational data mining	RELATIONAL DATABASES; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; AGGREGATION; TUTORIAL; SUPPORT	Multirelational classification aims to discover patterns across multiple interlinked tables (relations) in a relational database. In many large organizations, such a database often spans numerous departments and/or subdivisions, which are involved in different aspects of the enterprise such as customer profiling, fraud detection, inventory management, financial management, and so on. When considering classification, different phases of the knowledge discovery process are affected by economic utility. For instance, in the data preprocessing process, one must consider the cost associated with acquiring, cleaning, and transforming large volumes of data. When training and testing the data mining models, one has to consider the impact of the data size on the running time of the learning algorithm. In order to address these utility-based issues, the paper presents an approach to create a pruned database for multirelational classification, while minimizing predictive performance loss on the final model. Our method identifies a set of strongly uncorrelated subgraphs from the original database schema, to use for training, and discards all others. The experiments performed show that our strategy is able to, without sacrificing predictive accuracy, significantly reduce the size of the databases, in terms of the number of relations, tuples, and attributes.The approach prunes the sizes of databases by as much as 94 %. Such reduction also results in decreasing computational cost of the learning process. The method improves the multirelational learning algorithms' execution time by as much as 80 %. In particular, our results demonstrate that one may build an accurate model with only a small subset of the provided database.

These methods aim to identify a subset of the original features with high discriminating power. Among them, the feature selection technique for unsupervised tasks is more attractive since the cost to obtain the labels of the data and/or the information between classes is often high. On the other hand, the low-dimensional manifold of the "same" class data is usually revealed by considering the local invariance of the data structure, it may not be adequate to deal with unsupervised tasks where the class information is completely absent. In this paper, a novel feature selection method, called Minimum-maximum local structure information Laplacian Score (MMLS), is proposed to minimize the within-locality information (i.e., preserving the manifold structure of the "same" class data) and to maximize the between-locality information (i.e., maximizing the information between the manifold structures of the "different" class data) at the same time.

Michael			A Method for Mining Infrequent Causal Associations and Its Application in Finding Adverse Drug Reaction Signal Pairs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Adverse drug reactions; association rules; data mining algorithms; interestingness measure; recognition primed decision model	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; RULES; ALGORITHM; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; SURVEILLANCE; GENERATION; SUPPORT	In many real-world applications, it is important to mine causal relationships where an event or event pattern causes certain outcomes with low probability. Discovering this kind of causal relationships can help us prevent or correct negative outcomes caused by their antecedents. In this paper, we propose an innovative data mining framework and apply it to mine potential causal associations in electronic patient data sets where the drug-related events of interest occur infrequently. Specifically, we created a novel interestingness measure, exclusive causal-leverage, based on a computational, fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we previously developed. On the basis of this new measure, a data mining algorithm was developed to mine the causal relationship between drugs and their associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The algorithm was tested on real patient data retrieved from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan. The retrieved data included 16,206 patients (15,605 male, 601 female). The exclusive causal-leverage was employed to rank the potential causal associations between each of the three selected drugs (i.e., enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) and 3,954 recorded symptoms, each of which corresponded to a potential ADR. The top 10 drug-symptom pairs for each drug were evaluated by the physicians on our project team. The numbers of symptoms considered as likely real ADRs for enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin were 8, 7, and 6, respectively. These preliminary results indicate the usefulness of our method in finding potential ADR signal pairs for further analysis (e. g., epidemiology study) and investigation (e. g., case review) by drug safety professionals.

J	Joshi, D; Samal, A; Soh, LK				Joshi, Deepti; Samal, Ashok; Soh, Leen-Kiat			Spatio-temporal polygonal clustering with space and time as first-class citizens	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Spatio-temporal data mining; Temporal data analysis; Polygonal clustering; Drought analysis; Trend analysis		Detecting spatio-temporal clusters, i.e. clusters of objects similar to each other occurring together across space and time, has important real-world applications such as climate change, drought analysis, detection of outbreak of epidemics (e.g. bird flu), bioterrorist attacks (e.g. anthrax release), and detection of increased military activity. Research in spatio-temporal clustering has focused on grouping individual objects with similar trajectories, detecting moving clusters, or discovering convoys of objects. However, most of these solutions are based on using a piece-meal approach where snapshot clusters are formed at each time stamp and then the series of snapshot clusters are analyzed to discover moving clusters. This approach has two fundamental limitations. First, it is point-based and is not readily applicable to polygonal datasets. Second, its static analysis approach at each time slice is susceptible to inaccurate tracking of dynamic cluster especially when clusters change over both time and space. In this paper we present a spatio-temporal polygonal clustering algorithm known as the Spatio-Temporal Polygonal Clustering (STPC) algorithm. STPC clusters spatial polygons taking into account their spatial and topological properties, treating time as a first-class citizen, and integrating density-based clustering with moving cluster analysis. Our experiments on the drought analysis application, flu spread analysis and crime cluster detection show the validity and robustness of our algorithm in an important geospatial application.

A data-mining approach is applied to predict rainfall in a watershed basin at Oxford, Iowa, based on radar reflectivity and tipping-bucket (TB) data. Five data-mining algorithms, neural network, random forest, classification and regression tree, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, are employed to build prediction models. The algorithm offering the highest accuracy is selected for further study. Model I is the baseline model constructed from radar data covering Oxford. Model II predicts rainfall from radar and TB data collected at Oxford. Model III is constructed from the radar and TB data collected at South Amana (16 km west of Oxford) and Iowa City (25 km east of Oxford). The computation results indicate that the three models offer similar accuracy when predicting rainfall at current time. Model II performs better than the other two models when predicting rainfall at future time horizons.

J	Liao, SH; Chou, SY				Liao, Shu-Hsien; Chou, Shan-Yuan			Data mining investigation of co-movements on the Taiwan and China stock markets for future investment portfolio	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cross-national stock market; Stock market investment portfolio; Co-movements; Data mining; Association rules; Cluster analysis	RETURNS; INVESTORS; INDEXES; PRICES	On June 29, 2010, Taiwan signed an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China as a major step to open markets between Taiwan and China. Thus, the ECFA will contribute by creating a closer relationship between China and Taiwan through economic and market interactions. Co-movements of the world's national financial market indexes are a popular research topic in the finance literature. Some studies examine the co-movements and the benefits of international financial market portfolio diversification/integration and economic performance. Thus, this study investigates the co-movement in the Taiwan and China (Hong Kong) stock markets under the ECFA using a data mining approach, including association rules and clustering analysis.

In the field of data mining for moving objects, the problem of anomaly detection is a hot topic. Based on the development of anomalous trajectory detection of moving objects, this paper introduces the classical trajectory outlier detection (TRAOD) algorithm, and then proposes a density-based trajectory outlier detection (DBTOD) algorithm, which compensates the disadvantages of the TRAOD algorithm that it is unable to detect anomalous defects when the trajectory is local and dense. The results of employing the proposed algorithm to Elk1993 and Deer1995 datasets are also presented, which show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Based on users' traveling preferences elicited from their travel experiences exposed on social media sites by sharing geotagged photos, we propose a new method for recommending tourist locations that are relevant to users (i.e., personalization) in the given context (i.e., context awareness). We obtain user-specific travel preferences from his/her travel history in one city and use these to recommend tourist locations in another city. Our technique is illustrated on a sample of publicly available Flickr dataset containing photos taken in various cities of China. Results show that our context-aware personalized method is able to predict tourists' preferences in a new or unknown city more precisely and generate better recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art landmark recommendation methods.

Goal attainment on long tail web sites: An information foraging approach	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information Foraging Theory; Long tail; Data mining; Clickstream analysis	CLICKSTREAM DATA; BROWSING BEHAVIOR; TASK-COMPLETION; ONLINE; NAVIGATION; CHOICE; DEPTH	The long tail has attracted substantial theoretical as well as practical interest, yet there have been few empirical studies that have explicitly examined the factors that drive online conversions at these sites. This research tests several hypotheses derived from Information Foraging Theory (IFT) that pertain to goal achievement on long tail Web sites. IFT introduced concepts of information patches and information scent to model information seeking behavior of individuals, but has mostly been tested in production rule environments where the theory is used to simulate user behavior. Testing IFT-driven hypotheses on real data required learning information patches and scents using an inductive approach and in this paper we adapt existing algorithms for these discovery tasks. Our results based on clickstream data from forty-seven small business Web sites show both the existence of valuable information patches and information scent trails as well as their importance in explaining conversion on these sites. The majority of the hypotheses were supported and we discuss the implications of this for researchers and practitioners. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[McCart, J.

Generating rules from data mining for collaboration moderator services	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Collaborative projects; Moderators; Knowledge discovery; Data mining; Virtual enterprise; Virtual organization	SYSTEM	A Moderator is a knowledge based system that supports collaborative working by raising awareness of the priorities and requirements of other team members. However, the amount of advice a Moderator can provide is limited by the knowledge it contains on team members. The use of data mining techniques can contribute towards automating the process of knowledge acquisition for a Moderator and enable hidden data patterns and relationships to be discovered to facilitate the moderation process. A novel approach is presented, consisting of a knowledge discovery framework which provides a semi-automatic methodology to generate rules by inserting relationships discovered as a result of data mining into a generic template. To demonstrate the knowledge discovery framework methodology an application case is described. The application case acquires knowledge for a Moderator to make project partners aware of how to best formulate a proposal for a European research project by data mining summaries of successful past projects. Findings from the application case are presented.	[Palmer, C.; Harding, J. A.; Swarnkar, R.; Das, B. P.; Young, R. I.

J	Pham, DS; Saha, B; Phung, DQ; Venkatesh, S				Pham, Duc-Son; Saha, Budhaditya; Phung, Dinh Q.; Venkatesh, Svetha			Detection of cross-channel anomalies	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Anomaly detection; Multiple channels; Topic modeling; Residual subspace analysis; Text data analysis; Video surveillance; Data mining; Collaborative subspace learning	STREAMS	The data deluge has created a great challenge for data mining applications wherein the rare topics of interest are often buried in the flood of major headlines. We identify and formulate a novel problem: cross-channel anomaly detection from multiple data channels. Cross-channel anomalies are common among the individual channel anomalies and are often portent of significant events. Central to this new problem is a development of theoretical foundation and methodology. Using the spectral approach, we propose a two-stage detection method: anomaly detection at a single-channel level, followed by the detection of cross-channel anomalies from the amalgamation of single-channel anomalies. We also derive the extension of the proposed detection method to an online settings, which automatically adapts to changes in the data over time at low computational complexity using incremental algorithms. Our mathematical analysis shows that our method is likely to reduce the false alarm rate by establishing theoretical results on the reduction of an impurity index. We demonstrate our method in two applications: document understanding with multiple text corpora and detection of repeated anomalies in large-scale video surveillance. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with related state-of-art methods, including the one-class SVM and principal component pursuit. In addition, our framework can be deployed in a decentralized manner, lending itself for large-scale data stream analysis.

J	Pimentel, BA; de Souza, RMCR				Pimentel, Bruno A.; de Souza, Renata M. C. R.			A multivariate fuzzy c-means method	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy c-means method; Unsupervised pattern recognition; Clustering; Membership degree	MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; SET THEORY; DISTANCES; MEDOIDS	Fuzzy c-means (FCMs) is an important and popular unsupervised partitioning algorithm used in several application domains such as pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Although the FCM has shown good performance in detecting clusters, the membership values for each individual computed to each of the clusters cannot indicate how well the individuals are classified. In this paper, a new approach to handle the memberships based on the inherent information in each feature is presented. The algorithm produces a membership matrix for each individual, the membership values are between zero and one and measure the similarity of this individual to the center of each cluster according to each feature. These values can change at each iteration of the algorithm and they are different from one feature to another and from one cluster to another in order to increase the performance of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. To obtain a fuzzy partition by class of the input data set, a way to compute the class membership values is also proposed in this work. Experiments with synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed approach produces good quality of clustering. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

CDV has been implemented in verification testbenches using supervised learning techniques to model the relationship between coverage events and stimuli generation, providing a feedback between them. One commonly used technique is the classification- or decision-tree data mining, which has shown to be appropriate due to the easy modeling. Learning techniques are applied in two steps: training and application. Training is made on one or more sets of examples, which relate datasets to pre-determined classes. Precision of results by applying the predictive learning concept has shown to be sensitive to the size of the training set and the amount of imbalance of associated classes, this last meaning the number of datasets associated to each class is very different from each other. This work presents experiments on the manipulation of data mining training sets, by changing the size and reducing the imbalances, in order to check their influence on the CDV efficiency. To do that, a circuit example with a large input space and strong class imbalance was selected from the application domain of multimedia systems and another one, with a small input space that affects the coverage occurrences, was selected from the communication area.

A Data-Mining Model for Protection of FACTS-Based Transmission Line	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						Distance relaying; fault-zone identification; random forests (RFs); support vector machine (SVM); thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC); unified power-flow controller (UPFC)	SCHEME; SYSTEM	This paper presents a data-mining model for fault-zone identification of a flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS)-based transmission line including a thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC) and unified power-flow controller (UPFC), using ensemble decision trees. Given the randomness in the ensemble of decision trees stacked inside the random forests model, it provides effective decision on fault-zone identification. Half-cycle postfault current and voltage samples from the fault inception are used as an input vector against target output "1" for the fault after TCSC/UPFC and "-1" for the fault before TCSC/UPFC for fault-zone identification. The algorithm is tested on simulated fault data with wide variations in operating parameters of the power system network, including noisy environment providing a reliability measure of 99% with faster response time (3/4th cycle from fault inception). The results of the presented approach using the RF model indicate reliable identification of the fault zone in FACTS-based transmission lines.

J	Sang, Y; Jin, YW; Li, KQ; Qi, H				Sang, Yu; Jin, Yingwei; Li, Keqiu; Qi, Heng			UniDis: a universal discretization technique	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Discretization; Inconsistency; Entropy; J4.8 decision tree; Naive Bayes classifier	CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; MODEL; SETS	Discretization techniques have played an important role in machine learning and data mining as most methods in such areas require that the training data set contains only discrete attributes. Data discretization unification (DDU), one of the state-of-the-art discretization techniques, trades off classification errors and the number of discretized intervals, and unifies existing discretization criteria. However, it suffers from two deficiencies. First, the efficiency of DDU is very low as it conducts a large number of parameters to search good results, which does not still guarantee to obtain an optimal solution. Second, DDU does not take into account the number of inconsistent records produced by discretization, which leads to unnecessary information loss. To overcome the above deficiencies, this paper presents a Uni versal Dis cretization technique, namely UniDis. We first develop a non-parametric normalized discretization criteria which avoids the effect of relatively large difference between classification errors and the number of discretized intervals on discretization results. In addition, we define a new entropy-based measure of inconsistency for multi-dimensional variables to effectively control information loss while producing a concise summarization of continuous variables. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm to guarantee better discretization based on the non-parametric normalized discretization criteria and the entropy-based inconsistency. Besides theoretical analysis, experimental results demonstrate that our approach is statistically comparable to DDU evaluated by a popular statistical test and it yields a better discretization scheme which significantly improves the accuracy of classification than previously other known discretization methods except for DDU by running J4.8 decision tree and Naive Bayes classifier.

J	Srinivasan, S; Ramakrishnan, S				Srinivasan, Sujatha; Ramakrishnan, Sivakumar			A social intelligent system for multi-objective optimization of classification rules using cultural algorithms	COMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-objective optimization; Classification rules; Evolutionary algorithms; Social intelligence; Cultural algorithm; Data mining	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION; DISCOVERY; FUZZY; INDUCTION; DESIGN	Cultural algorithms (CA) use social intelligence to solve problems in optimization. The CA is a class of evolutionary computational models inspired from observing the cultural evolutionary process in nature. Cultural algorithms employ a basic set of knowledge sources, each related to knowledge observed in various animal species. Knowledge from these sources is then combined to influence the decisions of the individual agents in solving problems. Classification using "IF-THEN" rules comes under descriptive knowledge discovery in data mining and is the most sought out by users since they represent highly comprehensible form of knowledge. The rules have certain properties which make them useful forms of actionable knowledge to the users. The rules are evaluated using these properties represented as objective and subjective measures. The rule properties may be conflicting. Hence discovery of rules with specific properties is considered as a multi-objective optimization problem. In the current study an extended cultural algorithm which applies social intelligence in the data mining domain to present users with a set of rules optimized according to user specified metrics is proposed.

J	Tseng, FC				Tseng, Fan-Chen			Mining frequent itemsets in large databases: The hierarchical partitioning approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent itemsets; Frequent closed itemsets; Frequent Pattern List (FPL); Hierarchical partitioning	CLOSED ITEMSETS	Although many methods have been proposed to enhance the efficiencies of data mining, little research has been devoted to the issue of scalability - that is, the problem of mining frequent itemsets when the size of the database is very large. This study proposes a methodology, hierarchical partitioning, for mining frequent itemsets in large databases, based on a novel data structure called the Frequent Pattern List (FPL). One of the major features of the FPL is its ability to partition the database, and thus transform the database into a set of sub-databases of manageable sizes. As a result, a divide-and-conquer approach can be developed to perform the desired data-mining tasks. Experimental results show that hierarchical partitioning is capable of mining frequent itemsets and frequent closed itemsets in very large databases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Verma, A; Wei, XP; Kusiak, A				Verma, Anoop; Wei, Xiupeng; Kusiak, Andrew			Predicting the total suspended solids in wastewater: A data-mining approach	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Total suspended solids; Data-mining; Influent flow rate; Prediction; Wastewater treatment	NEURAL-NETWORK; OPTIMIZATION; QUALITY; SYSTEMS	Total suspended solids (TSS) are a major pollutant that affects waterways all over the world. Predicting the values of TSS is of interest to quality control of wastewater processing. Due to infrequent measurements, time series data for TSS are constructed using influent flow rate and influent carbonaceous bio-chemical oxygen demand (CBOD). We investigated different scenarios of daily average influent CBOD and influent flow rate measured at 15 min intervals. Then, we used five data-mining algorithms, i.e., multi-layered perceptron, k-nearest neighbor, multi-variate adaptive regression spline, support vector machine, and random forest, to construct day-ahead, time-series prediction models for TSS. Historical TSS values were used as input parameters to predict current and future values of TSS. A sliding-window approach was used to improve the results of the predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zorrilla, M; Garcia-Saiz, D				Zorrilla, Marta; Garcia-Saiz, Diego			A service oriented architecture to provide data mining services for non-expert data miners	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Analytics service; BI-as-a-Service; Knowledge discovery database; Data mining; Service-oriented architecture; Web Services	MANAGEMENT; RETENTION; PATTERNS	In today's competitive market, companies need to use discovery knowledge techniques to make better, more informed decisions. But these techniques are out of the reach of most users as the knowledge discovery process requires an incredible amount of expertise. Additionally, business intelligence vendors are moving their systems to the cloud in order to provide services which offer companies cost-savings, better performance and faster access to new applications. This work joins both facets. It describes a data mining service addressed to non-expert data miners which can be delivered as Software-as-a-Service. Its main advantage is that by simply indicating where the data file is, the service itself is able to perform all the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques to open black box data mining models	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Sensitivity analysis; Visualization; Input importance; Supervised data mining; Regression; Classification	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DESIGN	In this paper, we propose a new visualization approach based on a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to extract human understandable knowledge from supervised learning black box data mining models, such as Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and ensembles, including Random Forests (RFs). Five SA methods (three of which are purely new) and four measures of input importance (one novel) are presented. Also, the SA approach is adapted to handle discrete variables and to aggregate multiple sensitivity responses. Moreover, several visualizations for the SA results are introduced, such as input pair importance color matrix and variable effect characteristic surface. A wide range of experiments was performed in order to test the SA methods and measures by fitting four well-known models (NN, SVM, RF and decision trees) to synthetic datasets (five regression and five classification tasks). In addition, the visualization capabilities of the SA are demonstrated using four real-world datasets (e.g., bank direct marketing and white wine quality). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chiang, WY				Chiang, Wen-Yu			Applying data mining on customer relationship management system for leisure coffee-shop industry: a case study in Taiwan	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article								The objective of this research is to identify high-value markets by using the data mining technologies and a new model. The well-known Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is applied to process the market segmentation of the customer benefit market; and a new model [based on RecencyFrequencyMonetary' (RFM) model] is applied to process customer value markets for leisure coffee-shop industry. The results show the relationships between the two types of markets (benefit and customer value), which are presented by fuzzy and nonfuzzy association rules. These rules can be applied to customer relationship management systems for obtaining useful and high-value markets. The results can help leisure coffee-shop industry to acquire knowledge of customers, and to identify the explicit customer values for marketing plans. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Finding email correspondents in social networks accurately, though may seem to be straightforward at a first glance, is challenging. Most of the existing online social networking sites recommend possible matches by comparing the information of email accounts and social network profiles, such as display names and email addresses. However, as shown empirically in this paper, such methods may not be effective in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been carefully and thoroughly addressed in research. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem and develop a practical data mining approach. We find that using only the profiles or the graph structures is far from effective. Our method utilizes the similarity between email accounts and social network user profiles, and at the same time explores the similarity between the email communication network and the social network under investigation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two real data sets on emails and Facebook.

J	Di Fatta, G; Blasa, F; Cafiero, S; Fortino, G				Di Fatta, Giuseppe; Blasa, Francesco; Cafiero, Simone; Fortino, Giancarlo			Fault tolerant decentralised K-Means clustering for asynchronous large-scale networks	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Distributed clustering; K-Means; Peer-to-peer data mining; Gossip protocols; Epidemic protocols; Extreme scale computing	TO-PEER NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS; ENVIRONMENTS	The K-Means algorithm for cluster analysis is one of the most influential and popular data mining methods. Its straightforward parallel formulation is well suited for distributed memory systems with reliable interconnection networks, such as massively parallel processors and clusters of workstations. However, in large-scale geographically distributed systems the straightforward parallel algorithm can be rendered useless by a single communication failure or high latency in communication paths. The lack of scalable and fault tolerant global communication and synchronisation methods in large-scale systems has hindered the adoption of the K-Means algorithm for applications in large networked systems such as wireless sensor networks, peer-to-peer systems and mobile ad hoc networks. This work proposes a fully distributed K-Means algorithm (Epidemic K-Means) which does not require global communication and is intrinsically fault tolerant. The proposed distributed K-Means algorithm provides a clustering solution which can approximate the solution of an ideal centralised algorithm over the aggregated data as closely as desired. A comparative performance analysis is carried out against the state of the art sampling methods and shows that the proposed method overcomes the limitations of the sampling-based approaches for skewed clusters distributions. The experimental analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm is very accurate and fault tolerant under unreliable network conditions (message loss and node failures) and is suitable for asynchronous networks of very large and extreme scale.

Hence, a theoretical analysis is presented for feature extraction and pattern recognition via torque analysis. In this analysis, impacts of the saturation profile, stator slots and the fault severity are taken into account. So, using torque spectra, an efficient index is introduced for demagnetization fault diagnosis in SMPMSMs. Based on the extracted features and the recognized pattern, time delay embedding (TDE) approach as a competent data mining technique is utilized to process the developed torque. Then, a criterion function is proposed to detect demagnetization fault. Furthermore, this criterion is used to estimate fault severity and determine demagnetization percentage. The two-dimensional (2-D) time stepping finite element method (TSFEM) is employed to model the SMPMSM under different demagnetization levels. The 3-D TSFEM is used to prove the theoretical and 2-D TSFEM results.

Given a finite ground set X and a constraint t, find the minimum number of consistent subsets that cover X, where a subset of X is consistent if it satisfies t. The MCSC problem generalizes the traditional set covering problem and has minimum clique partition (MCP), a dual problem of graph coloring, as an instance. Many common data mining tasks in rule learning, clustering, and pattern mining can be formulated as MCSC instances. In particular, we discuss the minimum rule set (MRS) problem that minimizes model complexity of decision rules, the converse k-clustering problem that minimizes the number of clusters, and the pattern summarization problem that minimizes the number of patterns. For any of these MCSC instances, our proposed generic algorithm CAG can be directly applicable. CAG starts by constructing a maximal optimal partial solution, then performs an example-driven specific-to-general search on a dynamically maintained bipartite assignment graph to simultaneously learn a set of consistent subsets with small cardinality covering the ground set.

J	Gelbard, R				Gelbard, Roy			"Padding" bitmaps to support similarity and mining	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Bitmap-index; Data representation; Similarity index; Cluster analysis; Classification; Data mining	ALGORITHMS	The current paper presents a novel approach to bitmap-indexing for data mining purposes. Currently bitmap-indexing enables efficient data storage and retrieval, but is limited in terms of similarity measurement, and hence as regards classification, clustering and data mining. Bitmap-indexes mainly fit nominal discrete attributes and thus unattractive for widespread use, which requires the ability to handle continuous data in a raw format. The current research describes a scheme for representing ordinal and continuous data by applying the concept of "padding" where each discrete nominal data value is transformed into a range of nominal-discrete values. This "padding" is done by adding adjacent bits "around" the original value (bin). The padding factor, i.e., the number of adjacent bits added, is calculated from the first and second derivative degrees of each attribute's domain-distribution. The padded representation better supports similarity measures, and therefore improves the accuracy of clustering and mining. The advantages of padding bitmaps are demonstrated on Fisher's Iris dataset.

J	Guil, F; Bailon, A; Alvarez, JA; Marin, R				Guil, Francisco; Bailon, Antonio; Alvarez, Jose A.; Marin, Roque			Mining generalized temporal patterns based on fuzzy counting	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Temporal data mining; Fuzzy sets; Temporal patterns; Event-based sequences	INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; INTER-TRANSACTION; SEQUENCES; SETS	Event-based sequences are a kind of pattern based on temporal associations with two essential characteristics: they are syntactically simple and have a great expressive power. For this reason, event-based sequence mining is an interesting solution to the problem of knowledge discovery in dynamic domains, mainly characterized by a time-varying nature. The inter-transactional model has led to the design of algorithms aimed to obtain this sort of patterns from time-stamped datasets. These algorithms extend the well-known Apriori algorithm, by explicitly adding the temporal context where associations among frequent events occurs. This leads to the possibility of extracting a larger number of patterns with a potential interest in decision making. However, its usefulness is diminished in those datasets where the characteristics of variability and uncertainty are present, which is a common issue in real domains. This is due to the rigidity of the counting method, which uses an exact measure of distance between temporal events. As a solution, we propose a generalization of the temporal mining process, which implies a relaxation of the counting method including the concept of approximate temporal distance between events. In particular, in this paper we present an algorithm, called TSETfuzzy-Miner, which incorporates a fuzzy-based counting technique in order to extract general, flexible, and practical temporal patterns taking into account the particular characteristics of real domains.

J	Hu, YH; Huang, TCK; Kao, YH				Hu, Ya-Han; Huang, Tony Cheng-Kui; Kao, Yu-Hua			Knowledge discovery of weighted RFM sequential patterns from customer sequence databases	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Data mining; Sequential patterns; RFM analysis; Constraint-based mining	PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION; LIFETIME VALUE; HYBRID; MODEL	In today's business environment, there is tremendous interest in the mining of interesting patterns for superior decision making. Although many successful customer relationship management (CRM) applications have been developed based on sequential pattern mining techniques, they basically assume that the importance of each customer is the same. Previous studies in CRM show that not all customers make the same contribution to a business, and it is indispensible to evaluate customer value before developing effective marketing strategies. Therefore, this study includes the concepts of recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis in the sequential pattern mining process. For a given subsequence, each customer sequence contributes its own recency, frequency, and monetary scores to represent customer importance. An efficient algorithm is developed to discover sequential patterns with high recency, frequency, and monetary scores. Empirical results show that the proposed method is efficient and can effectively discover more valuable patterns than conventional frequent pattern mining. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data Mining of Supersecondary Structure Homology between Light Chains of Immunogloblins and MHC Molecules: Absence of the Common Conformational Fragment in the Human IgM Rheumatoid Factor	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							T-CELL-RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; INHIBITORY RECEPTOR; PEPTIDE-BINDING; RECOGNITION; COMPLEX; ANTIBODY; CODE; SPECTROSCOPY; REPERTOIRE	It is shown that fuzzy search and data mining techniques of supersecondary structure homology for subunits of proteins using conformational code patterns of alpha-helix-type (3 beta 5 alpha 4 beta) and beta-sheet-type (6 alpha 4 beta 4 beta) fragments can be used to extract correlations between fragments of MHC class I molecules and the light chain of immunoglobulins. The new method of conformational pattern analysis with fuzzy search of structural code homology reflects well the shape of main chain rather than secondary structure in comparison with the DSSP method. Further, the data mining technique using the combination of h- and s-fragment patterns can quantify the supersecondary structure homology between any subunits of proteins with different amino acid sequences. Characteristic fragment patterns (string "shhshss"), which were sandwiched between two identical amino acid sequences His and Pro, were found in light chains of various types of immunogloblins, alpha-chain and beta-2 microglobulin of MHC class I and alpha-chain and beta-chain of MHC class II, but not in heavy chains of Fab immunoglobulin fragments and T cell receptors (TCR). Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR) are related by the conformational fragment (string "shhshss") to beta-2 microglobulins as a type of pair forms (string "sohsss"). Further, human IgM rheumatoid factor, one of the immunogloblins, did not strongly exhibit the conformational fragment pattern. Nonclassic MHC class I molecules CD1D, MIC-A, and MIC-B, which have functions to activate NKT, NK, and T cells, did not also clearly show the patterns. These code-driven mining techniques can be utilized as a metadata-generating tool for systems biology to elucidate the biological function of such conformational fragments of MHC I and II molecules, which come in contact with various signal ligands on the surface of T cells and natural killer cells.

J	Lee, S; Choi, K; Suh, Y				Lee, Seungsup; Choi, Keunho; Suh, Yongmoo			A personalized trustworthy seller recommendation in an open market	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Recommendation system; Content-based filtering; Data mining; Classification analysis	CREDIT SCORING MODELS; ONLINE; TRUST; MECHANISMS; REPUTATION; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS	Although more and more customers are buying products on online stores, they have a difficulty in selecting a both trustworthy and suitable seller who sells a product they want to buy since there is a plenty number of sellers who sell the same product with different options. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a personalized trustworthy seller recommendation system for the customers of an open market in Korea. To that end, we first developed a module which classifies sellers into trustworthy one or not using a classification technique such as decision tree, and then developed another module which makes use of the content-based filtering method to find best-matching top k sellers among the selected trustworthy sellers. Experimental results show that our approach is worthwhile to take. This study makes a contribution at least in that to our knowledge it is the first attempt to recommend sellers, not products as done in most other studies, to customers.

All existing online portfolio selection strategies focus on the first order information of a portfolio vector, though the second order information may also be beneficial to a strategy. Moreover, empirical evidence shows that relative stock prices may follow the mean reversion property, which has not been fully exploited by existing strategies. This article proposes a novel online portfolio selection strategy named Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion (CWMR). Inspired by the mean reversion principle in finance and confidence weighted online learning technique in machine learning, CWMR models the portfolio vector as a Gaussian distribution, and sequentially updates the distribution by following the mean reversion trading principle. CWMR's closed-form updates clearly reflect the mean reversion trading idea. We also present several variants of CWMR algorithms, including a CWMR mixture algorithm that is theoretical universal. Empirically, CWMR strategy is able to effectively exploit the power of mean reversion for online portfolio selection. Extensive experiments on various real markets show that the proposed strategy is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental testbed including source codes and data sets is available online.(1)	[Li, Bin; Hoi, Steven C.

How to make better decisions on the huge amount of data is an urgent task. Knowledge acquisition through data mining becomes one of the most important directions to support scientific decision making; however, the knowledge discovered from data mining may not work effectively because most of it describes only static knowledge, not how-to-do knowledge. In this paper, we describe our approach of dealing with this problem, starting with two existing methods: MCLP (Multiple Criteria Linear Programming)-based method classifies the web data sets and find the best match elements, but the models obtained are unexplainable; decision tree methods can obtain explainable rules, but they are static know-what knowledge -- for example, we still don't know how to transfer from class bad to class good. In order to convert from such passive result to actionable knowledge, we focus on a new methodology for discovering actionable know-how knowledge, which is based on decision tree rules and Extension set theory. As a second order mining method, our approach can extract a set of hidden patterns describing how to change churn customers' behaviors and provide "from can't to can, from bad to good" rules. It can provide successful decision making support on the transformation of the customer chum. A case study of a web company has shown that our method is feasible and effective. In addition, the case study also has the reference value for data mining in other web businesses.

A tree-network model was proposed to depict the characteristics of SMS seed users who have such three features as "ahead of time", "mass texting" and "numerous retransmissions". For acquiring the established network model's width and depth, a clustering algorithm based on density was adopted and a recursion algorithm was designed to solve such problems. An objective, comprehensive and scale-free evaluation function was further presented to rank the potential seed users by using the width and the depth obtained above. Furthermore, the model's empirical analysis was made based on part of the Shenzhen's cell phone SMS data in February of 2012. The model is effective and applicable as a powerful tool to solve the SMS seed users' mining problem. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ling, Q; Wen, ZW; Yin, WT				Ling, Qing; Wen, Zaiwen; Yin, Wotao			Decentralized Jointly Sparse Optimization by Reweighted l(q) Minimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Decentralized algorithm; jointly sparse optimization; non-convex model	NETWORKS; REGRESSION; RECOVERY; SIGNALS	A set of vectors (or signals) are jointly sparse if all their nonzero entries are found on a small number of rows (or columns). Consider a network of agents {i} that collaboratively recover a set of jointly sparse vectors {x((i))} from their linear measurements {y((i))}. Assume that every agent i collects its own measurement y((i)) and aims to recover its own vector x((i)) taking advantages of the joint sparsity structure. This paper proposes novel decentralized algorithms to recover these vectors in a way that every agent runs a recovery algorithm and exchanges with its neighbors only the estimated joint support of the vectors. The agents will obtain their solutions through collaboration while keeping their vectors' values and measurements private. As such, the proposed approach finds applications in distributed human action recognition, cooperative spectrum sensing, decentralized event detection, as well as collaborative data mining. We use a non-convex minimization model and propose algorithms that alternate between support consensus and vector update. The latter step is based on reweighted l(q) iterations, where q can be 1 or 2. We numerically compare the proposed decentralized algorithms with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approaches have strong recovery performance and converge reasonably fast.

J	Mahmood, T; Shaikh, GM				Mahmood, Tariq; Shaikh, Ghulam Mujtaba			Adaptive Automated Teller Machines	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Automated Teller Machines; Adaptive interfaces; Process mining; Data mining; Efficient usage time; Usability		Nowadays, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) provide significant online support to bank customers. A limitation of ATM usage is that customers often have to wait in a queue, especially at ATMs installed at busy locations. Also, old people tend to consume more ATM usage time, possibly frustrating customers in the queue. In these situations, ATMs should "adapt" to the behavior of the customers to minimize the usage time. To this end, we apply data mining techniques to an ATM transaction dataset obtained from an international bank based in Kuwait. We pre-process this dataset, and convert it into a specific XML format to mine it through the ProM (process mining) tool. Our results reveal that customers withdraw money most frequently, followed by purchases (through an ATM card) and balance inquiry transactions. Customers re-do these transactions frequently, and also employ them one after the other. We acquire the distributions of the withdrawn amount, based on individual customers, the location (ATM terminal) and time of the withdrawl. Based on these results, we have proposed a set of five adaptive ATM interfaces, which show only frequent transactions and frequently-withdrawn amounts, display the current balance autonomously, and query explicitly for viewing purchase history, or for performing another withdrawl. An online survey on 216 ATM customers reveals that a majority of customers are willing to use these interfaces for minimizing their usage time. Our work has been approved by the banking authority of Pakistan, and we are currently implementing our interfaces for a Pakistani bank. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Progressive CFM-Miner: An Algorithm to Mine CFM - Sequential Patterns from a Progressive Database	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sequential pattern mining; CFM-PrefixSpan; Progressive database; updated CFM-tree; progressive CFM patterns; algorithms	GROWTH METHODS; CONSTRAINTS	Sequential pattern mining is a vital data mining task to discover the frequently occurring patterns in sequence databases. As databases develop, the problem of maintaining sequential patterns over an extensively long period of time turn into essential, since a large number of new records may be added to a database. To reflect the current state of the database where previous sequential patterns would become irrelevant and new sequential patterns might appear, there is a need for efficient algorithms to update, maintain and manage the information discovered. Several efficient algorithms for maintaining sequential patterns have been developed. Here, we have presented an efficient algorithm to handle the maintenance problem of CFM-sequential patterns (Compact, Frequent, Monetary-constraints based sequential patterns). In order to efficiently capture the dynamic nature of data addition and deletion into the mining problem, initially, we construct the updated CFM-tree using the CFM patterns obtained from the static database. Then, the database gets updated from the distributed sources that have data which may be static, inserted, or deleted. Whenever the database is updated from the multiple sources, CFM tree is also updated by including the updated sequence. Then, the updated CFM-tree is used to mine the progressive CFM-patterns using the proposed tree pattern mining algorithm. Finally, the experimentation is carried out using the synthetic and real life distributed databases that are given to the progressive CFM-miner. The experimental results and analysis provides better results in terms of the generated number of sequential patterns, execution time and the memory usage over the existing IncSpan algorithm.

J	Marilly, E; Gonguet, A; Martinot, O; Pain, F				Marilly, Emmanuel; Gonguet, Arnaud; Martinot, Olivier; Pain, Frederique			Gesture Interactions With Video: From Algorithms to User Evaluation	BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							VISION	In the context of immersive communications that aim to enable natural experiences and interactions among people, objects, and the environment, we propose a method to enable natural video interactions through hand gesture recognition between users and a video meeting system. An end-to-end study was performed: we started with the development of specific gesture recognition algorithms and concluded with a user evaluation to validate our results. Gestures and their associated functionalities were identified via a user survey which focused on distinguishing two concepts which are often confused: hand posture and hand gesture (i.e., static versus dynamic). Our recognition process was composed of two main tasks: hand posture recognition (i.e., skin segmentation, background subtraction, region combination, feature extraction, and classification) and hand gesture recognition (tracking and recognition). Our approach combined a signal similarity study with a data-mining tool for dynamic gesture recognition. We focused on the experimentation and user evaluation to improve our approach, taking into account user feedback and analyzing performance in different environments and for different users.

J	Nori, F; Deypir, M; Sadreddini, MH				Nori, Fatemeh; Deypir, Mahmood; Sadreddini, Mohamad Hadi			A sliding window based algorithm for frequent closed itemset mining over data streams	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Closed frequent itemsets; Data stream; Sliding window; Concept change; Data mining	TRANSACTIONAL DATA STREAMS	Frequent pattern mining over data streams is an important problem in the context of data mining and knowledge discovery. Mining frequent closed itemsets within sliding window instead of complete set of frequent itemset is very interesting since it needs a limited amount of memory and processing power. Moreover, handling concept change within a compact set of closed patterns is faster. However, it requires flexible and efficient data structures as well as intuitive algorithms. In this paper, we have introduced an effective and efficient algorithm for closed frequent itemset mining over data streams operating in the sliding window model. This algorithm uses a novel data structure for storing transactions of the window and corresponding frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, the support of a new frequent closed itemset is efficiently computed and an old pattern is removed from the monitoring set when it is no longer frequent closed itemset. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data streams show that the proposed algorithm is superior to previously devised algorithms in terms of runtime and memory usage.

In this paper, the Sinclair matrix has been projected onto the circular polarization basis and is decomposed into five parameters that are invariant to the relative phase Phi, the Faraday rotation Omega, and the target orientation Psi without any information loss. The physical interpretation of these parameters, useful for target classification studies, is found in the wave-particle nature of radar scattering phenomenon given the circular polarization of elemental packets of energy. The proposed deterministic target decomposition is based on the left-orthogonal special unitary SU(2) basis, decomposing the signal backscattered by point targets, represented by the target vector, via six special unitary SU(4) rotation matrices, and by providing full resolution and lossless analysis. Comparisons between the proposed deterministic target decomposition and the Cameron, Kennaugh, Krogager, and Touzi decompositions are also pointed out. Generally, the proposed decomposition provides simpler interpretation, faster parameter extraction, and better generalization properties for the analysis of nonreciprocal or random targets. Several polarimetric SAR/ISAR data sets of UWB data, airborne fully polarimetric EMISAR data, and spaceborne RADARSAT2 are used for illustrating the effectiveness and the usefulness of this decomposition for the classification of point targets. Results are very promising for application use in the next generation of high-resolution spaceborne and airborne Pol-SAR and Pol-ISAR systems.

J	Park, D; Yu, J; Park, JS; Kim, MS				Park, Daihee; Yu, Jaehak; Park, Jun-Sang; Kim, Myung-Sup			NetCube: a comprehensive network traffic analysis model based on multidimensional OLAP data cube	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Network traffic monitoring and analysis are essential for effective network operation and resource management. In particular, multidimensional analysis for long-term traffic data is necessary for comprehensive understanding of the traffic trend and effective quality-of-service provision considering the extremely dynamic behavior of the current Internet, where various types of traffic occur from high-speed network links and greatly increasing number of applications. However, only limited analysis results are provided, as the existing network traffic analysis tools and systems are developed and deployed focusing on their own specialized analysis purposes. Consequently, it is difficult to understand the network comprehensively and deeply, which increases the necessity for multilateral analysis of long-term traffic data. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic analysis model for large volumes of Internet traffic accumulated over a long period of time. The NetCube, the proposed network traffic analysis model using online analytical processing (OLAP) on a multidimensional data cube, provides an easy and fast way to construct a multidimensional traffic analysis system for comprehensive and detailed analysis of long-term traffic data by utilizing simple OLAP operations and powerful data-mining techniques on various abstraction levels of traffic data to complete the analysis purpose. We validate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed NetCube traffic analysis model by implementing a traffic analysis system and applying it to our campus network.

Each temporal point process is related to the behavior of an entity. As a result, clustering of temporal point processes can help differentiate between entities, thereby revealing patterns of behaviors. This study proposes a hierarchical cluster method for clustering temporal point processes based on the discrete Frechet (DF) distance. The DF cluster method is divided into four steps: (1) constructing a DF similarity matrix between temporal point processes; (2) constructing a complete linkage hierarchical tree based on the DF similarity matrix; (3) clustering the point processes with a threshold determined by locating the local maxima on the curve of the pseudo-F statistic (an index which measures the separability between clusters and the compactness in clusters); and (4) identifying inner patterns for each cluster formed by a series of dense intervals, each of which contains at least one event of all processes of the cluster. The contributions of the article are: (1) the proposed DF cluster method can cluster temporal point processes into different groups and (2) more importantly, it can identify the inner pattern of each cluster. Two synthetic data sets were created to illustrate the DF distance between temporal point process clusters (the first data set) and validate the proposed DF cluster method (the second data set), respectively. An experiment and a comparison with a method based on dynamic time warping show that DF cluster successfully identifies the preconfigured patterns in the second synthetic data set. The cluster method was then applied to a population migration history data set for the Northern Plains of the United States, revealing some interesting population migration patterns.

We aim to study the properties of one of the more commonly available but historically unreliable types of data: administrative diagnoses in the form of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) codes. We use differential entropy of ICD9 code time series as a surrogate measure for disease time course and also explore Gaussian kernel smoothing to characterize the time course of diseases in a more fine-grained way. Compared to a gold standard created by a panel of clinicians, the first model classified diseases into acute and chronic groups with a receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.83. In the second model, several characteristic temporal profiles were observed including permanent, chronic, and acute. In addition, condition dynamics such as the refractory period for giving birth following childbirth were observed. These models demonstrate that ICD9 codes, despite well-documented concerns, contain valid and potentially valuable temporal information.

J	Podgorelec, V; Sprogar, M; Pohorec, S				Podgorelec, Vili; Sprogar, Matej; Pohorec, Sandi			Evolutionary design of decision trees	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							INDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION	Decision tree (DT) is one of the most popular symbolic machine learning approaches to classification with a wide range of applications. Decision trees are especially attractive in data mining. It has an intuitive representation and is, therefore, easy to understand and interpret, also by nontechnical experts. The most important and critical aspect of DTs is the process of their construction. Several induction algorithms exist that use the recursive top-down principle to divide training objects into subgroups based on different statistical measures in order to achieve homogeneous subgroups. Although being robust and fast, generally providing good results, their deterministic and heuristic nature can lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, alternative approaches have developed which try to overcome the drawbacks of classical induction. One of the most viable approaches seems to be the use of evolutionary algorithms, which can produce better DTs as they are searching for globally optimal solutions, evaluating potential solutions with regard to different criteria. We review the process of evolutionary design of DTs, providing the description of the most common approaches as well as referring to recognized specializations. The overall process is first explained and later demonstrated in a step-by-step case study using a dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository.

A data mining system for providing analytical information on brain tumors to public health decision makers	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Data analysis; Ontology; Decision support system; Information system; Brain neoplasms; Health services administration	DATA WAREHOUSE; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; CARE; SUPPORT; STANDARD	Cancer is the leading cause of death in economically developed countries and the second leading cause of death in developing countries. Malignant brain neoplasms are among the most devastating and incurable forms of cancer, and their treatment may be excessively complex and costly. Public health decision makers require significant amounts of analytical information to manage public treatment programs for these patients. Data mining, a technology that is used to produce analytically useful information, has been employed successfully with medical data. However, the large-scale adoption of this technique has been limited thus far because it is difficult to use, especially for non-expert users. One way to facilitate data mining by non-expert users is to automate the process. Our aim is to present an automated data mining system that allows public health decision makers to access analytical information regarding brain tumors. The emphasis in this study is the use of ontology in an automated data mining process. The non-experts who tried the system obtained useful information about the treatment of brain tumors. These results suggest that future work should be conducted in this area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Santos, R. S.; Parente de Oliveira, J.

J	Silva, JD; Hruschka, ER				Silva, Jonathan de Andrade; Hruschka, Eduardo Raul			An experimental study on the use of nearest neighbor-based imputation algorithms for classification tasks	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Imputation; Missing values	MISSING VALUE ESTIMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MICROARRAY DATA; PRIVACY	The substitution of missing values, also called imputation, is an important data preparation task for data mining applications. Imputation algorithms have been traditionally compared in terms of the similarity between imputed and original values. However, this traditional approach, sometimes referred to as prediction ability, does not allow inferring the influence of imputed values in the ultimate modeling tasks (e.g., in classification). Based on an extensive experimental work, we study the influence of five nearest-neighbor based imputation algorithms (KNNImpute, SKNN, IKNNImpute, KMI and EACImpute) and two simple algorithms widely used in practice (Mean Imputation and Majority Method) on classification problems. In order to experimentally assess these algorithms, simulations of missing values were performed on six datasets by means of two missingness mechanisms: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR). The latter allows the probabilities of missingness to depend on observed data but not on missing data, whereas the former occurs when the distribution of missingness does not depend on the observed data either. The quality of the imputed values is assessed by two measures: prediction ability and classification bias. Experimental results show that IKNNImpute outperforms the other algorithms in the MCAR mechanism. KNNImpute, SKNN and EACImpute, by their turn, provided the best results in the MAR mechanism. Finally, our experiments also show that best prediction results (in terms of mean squared errors) do not necessarily yield to less classification bias. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The problem is amplified when names are collected from heterogeneous sources. This is the case in the Scholarometer system, which performs bibliometric analysis by cross-correlating author names in user queries with those retrieved from digital libraries. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. Our goal is to detect ambiguous names at query time by mining digital library annotation data, thereby decreasing noise in the bibliometric analysis. We explore three kinds of heuristic features based on citations, metadata, and crowdsourced topics in a supervised learning framework. The proposed approach achieves almost 80% accuracy. Finally, we compare the performance of ambiguous author detection in Scholarometer using Google Scholar against a baseline based on Microsoft Academic Search. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paradigm is introduced together with new semantic subgroup discovery systems SDM-search for enriched gene sets (SEGS) and SDM-Aleph. These systems are made publicly available in the new SDM-Toolkit for semantic data mining. The toolkit is implemented in the Orange4WS data mining platform that supports knowledge discovery workflow construction from local and distributed data mining services. On the basis of the experimental evaluation of semantic subgroup discovery systems on two publicly available biomedical datasets, the paper results in a thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluation of SDM-SEGS and SDM-Aleph and their comparison with SEGS, a system for enriched gene set discovery from microarray data.

J	Vicient, C; Sanchez, D; Moreno, A				Vicient, Carlos; Sanchez, David; Moreno, Antonio			An automatic approach for ontology-based feature extraction from heterogeneous textual resources	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Information extraction; Feature extraction; Ontologies; Wikipedia	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; SEMANTIC WEB; ANNOTATION; SYSTEM	Data mining algorithms such as data classification or clustering methods exploit features of entities to characterise, group or classify them according to their resemblance. In the past, many feature extraction methods focused on the analysis of numerical or categorical properties. In recent years, motivated by the success of the Information Society and the WWW, which has made available enormous amounts of textual electronic resources, researchers have proposed semantic data classification and clustering methods that exploit textual data at a conceptual level. To do so, these methods rely on pre-annotated inputs in which text has been mapped to their formal semantics according to one or several knowledge structures (e.g. ontologies, taxonomies). Hence, they are hampered by the bottleneck introduced by the manual semantic mapping process. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a domain-independent, automatic and unsupervised method to detect relevant features from heterogeneous textual resources, associating them to concepts modelled in a background ontology. The method has been applied to raw text resources and also to semi-structured ones (Wikipedia articles). It has been tested in the Tourism domain, showing promising results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Events detected during monitoring are temporally correlated, which is helpful to resource allocation, job scheduling, and failure prediction. To discover the correlations among detected events, many existing approaches concentrate detected events into an event database and perform data mining on it. We argue that these approaches are not scalable to large scale distributed systems as monitored events grow so fast that event correlation discovering can hardly be done with the power of a single computer. In this paper, we present a decentralized approach to efficiently detect events, filter irrelative events, and discover their temporal correlations. We propose a MapReduce-based algorithm, MapReduce-Apriori, to data mining event association rules, which utilizes the computational resource of multiple dedicated nodes of the system. Experimental results show that our decentralized event correlation mining algorithm achieves nearly ideal speedup compared to centralized mining approaches. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Wu, S; Wang, SR				Wu, Shu; Wang, Shengrui			Information-Theoretic Outlier Detection for Large-Scale Categorical Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Outlier detection; holoentropy; total correlation; outlier factor; attribute weighting; greedy algorithms	ANOMALY DETECTION; LOCAL OUTLIERS; DATA SETS; SUPPORT	Outlier detection can usually be considered as a pre-processing step for locating, in a data set, those objects that do not conform to well-defined notions of expected behavior. It is very important in data mining for discovering novel or rare events, anomalies, vicious actions, exceptional phenomena, etc. We are investigating outlier detection for categorical data sets. This problem is especially challenging because of the difficulty of defining a meaningful similarity measure for categorical data. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of outliers and an optimization model of outlier detection, via a new concept of holoentropy that takes both entropy and total correlation into consideration. Based on this model, we define a function for the outlier factor of an object which is solely determined by the object itself and can be updated efficiently. We propose two practical 1-parameter outlier detection methods, named ITB-SS and ITB-SP, which require no user-defined parameters for deciding whether an object is an outlier. Users need only provide the number of outliers they want to detect. Experimental results show that ITB-SS and ITB-SP are more effective and efficient than mainstream methods and can be used to deal with both large and high-dimensional data sets where existing algorithms fail.

It performs clustering by embedding data points in a low-dimensional subspace derived from the similarity matrix. Compared to traditional clustering algorithms, PIC is simple, fast and relatively scalable. However, it requires the data and its associated similarity matrix fit into memory, which makes the algorithm infeasible for big data applications. This paper attempts to expand PIC's data scalability by implementing a parallel power iteration clustering (p-PIC). While this paper focuses on exploring different parallelization strategies and implementation details for minimizing computation and communication costs, we have also paid great attention to ensuring the algorithm works well on low-end commodity computers (COTS-based clusters and general purpose servers found at most commercial cloud providers). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed p-PIC algorithm is highly scalable to both data and compute resources. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhen, Y; Yeung, DY				Zhen, Yi; Yeung, Dit-Yan			Active hashing and its application to image and text retrieval	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Active hashing; Semi-supervised hashing; Hashing; Hash function learning	APPROXIMATE NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; DIMENSIONS	In recent years, hashing-based methods for large-scale similarity search have sparked considerable research interests in the data mining and machine learning communities. While unsupervised hashing-based methods have achieved promising successes for metric similarity, they cannot handle semantic similarity which is usually given in the form of labeled point pairs. To overcome this limitation, some attempts have recently been made on semi-supervised hashing which aims at learning hash functions from both metric and semantic similarity simultaneously. Existing semi-supervised hashing methods can be regarded as passive hashing since they assume that the labeled pairs are provided in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called active hashing, which can actively select the most informative labeled pairs for hash function learning. Specifically, it identifies the most informative points to label and constructs labeled pairs accordingly. Under this framework, we use data uncertainty as a measure of informativeness and develop a batch mode algorithm to speed up active selection. We empirically compare our method with a state-of-the-art passive hashing method on two benchmark data sets, showing that the proposed method can reduce labeling cost as well as overcome the limitations of passive hashing.

Dragon exploration system on marine sponge compounds interactions	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Sponge compounds interactions; Natural products; Text-mining; Information integration; Knowledge base	NATURAL-PRODUCTS; CELL-CYCLE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DRUG DISCOVERY; VARIOLIN-B; CANCER; GENES; PHOSPHORYLATION; CANDIDATES; ANTITUMOR	Background: Natural products are considered a rich source of new chemical structures that may lead to the therapeutic agents in all major disease areas. About 50% of the drugs introduced in the market in the last 20 years were natural products/derivatives or natural products mimics, which clearly shows the influence of natural products in drug discovery. Results: In an effort to further support the research in this field, we have developed an integrative knowledge base on Marine Sponge Compounds Interactions (Dragon Exploration System on Marine Sponge Compounds Interactions - DESMSCI) as a web resource. This knowledge base provides information about the associations of the sponge compounds with different biological concepts such as human genes or proteins, diseases, as well as pathways, based on the literature information available in PubMed and information deposited in several other databases. As such, DESMSCI is aimed as a research support resource for problems on the utilization of marine sponge compounds. DESMSCI allows visualization of relationships between different chemical compounds and biological concepts through textual and tabular views, graphs and relational networks. In addition, DESMSCI has built in hypotheses discovery module that generates potentially new/interesting associations among different biomedical concepts. We also present a case study derived from the hypotheses generated by DESMSCI which provides a possible novel mode of action for variolins in Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: DESMSCI is the first publicly available (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/desmsci) comprehensive resource where users can explore information, compiled by text-and data-mining approaches, on biological and chemical data related to sponge compounds.

For regression problem, extreme learning machine (ELM) can get better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed. However, the enlarging volume of datasets makes regression by ELM on very large scale datasets a challenging task. Through analyzing the mechanism of ELM algorithm, an efficient parallel ELM for regression is designed and implemented based on MapReduce framework, which is a simple but powerful parallel programming technique currently. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel ELM for regression can efficiently handle very large datasets on commodity hardware with a good performance on different evaluation criterions, including speedup, scaleup and sizeup.

J	Kulluk, S; Ozbakir, L; Baykasoglu, A				Kulluk, Sinem; Ozbakir, Lale; Baykasoglu, Adil			Fuzzy DIFACONN-miner: A novel approach for fuzzy rule extraction from neural networks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Artificial neural networks; Fuzzy rule based systems	CLASSIFICATION	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are mathematical models inspired from the biological nervous system. They have the ability of predicting, learning from experiences and generalizing from previous examples. An important drawback of ANNs is their very limited explanation capability, mainly due to the fact that knowledge embedded within ANNs is distributed over the activations and the connection weights. Therefore, one of the main challenges in the recent decades is to extract classification rules from ANNs. This paper presents a novel approach to extract fuzzy classification rules (FCR) from ANNs because of the fact that fuzzy rules are more interpretable and cope better with pervasive uncertainty and vagueness with respect to crisp rules. A soft computing based algorithm is developed to generate fuzzy rules based on a data mining tool (DIFACONN-miner), which was recently developed by the authors. Fuzzy DIFA-CONN-miner algorithm can extract fuzzy classification rules from datasets containing both categorical and continuous attributes.

Random forests for feature selection in QSPR Models - an application for predicting standard enthalpy of formation of hydrocarbons	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Feature selection; Variable importance; High dimensional data; Random forests; Data-mining; Property prediction; QSPR; Hybrid methodology	QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; VARIABLE SELECTION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SUBSET-SELECTION; NEURAL NETWORKS; QSAR MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION	Background: One of the main topics in the development of quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) predictive models is the identification of the subset of variables that represent the structure of a molecule and which are predictors for a given property. There are several automated feature selection methods, ranging from backward, forward or stepwise procedures, to further elaborated methodologies such as evolutionary programming. The problem lies in selecting the minimum subset of descriptors that can predict a certain property with a good performance, computationally efficient and in a more robust way, since the presence of irrelevant or redundant features can cause poor generalization capacity. In this paper an alternative selection method, based on Random Forests to determine the variable importance is proposed in the context of QSPR regression problems, with an application to a manually curated dataset for predicting standard enthalpy of formation. The subsequent predictive models are trained with support vector machines introducing the variables sequentially from a ranked list based on the variable importance. Results: The model generalizes well even with a high dimensional dataset and in the presence of highly correlated variables. The feature selection step was shown to yield lower prediction errors with RMSE values 23% lower than without feature selection, albeit using only 6% of the total number of variables (89 from the original 1485). The proposed approach further compared favourably with other feature selection methods and dimension reduction of the feature space. The predictive model was selected using a 10-fold cross validation procedure and, after selection, it was validated with an independent set to assess its performance when applied to new data and the results were similar to the ones obtained for the training set, supporting the robustness of the proposed approach. Conclusions: The proposed methodology seemingly improves the prediction performance of standard enthalpy of formation of hydrocarbons using a limited set of molecular descriptors, providing faster and more cost-effective calculation of descriptors by reducing their numbers, and providing a better understanding of the underlying relationship between the molecular structure represented by descriptors and the property of interest.

Mephu			Looking for a structural characterization of the sparseness measure of (frequent closed) itemset contexts	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Sparseness measure; Formal concept analysis; Succinct system of minimal generators; Extraction context; Closed itemset; Minimal generator	ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; MINIMAL GENERATORS; CONCEPT LATTICES; PATTERNS; REPRESENTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; DATABASES; SEARCH; DISCOVERY	It is widely recognized that the performances of frequent-pattern mining algorithms are closely dependent on data being handled, i.e., sparse or dense. The same situation applies to the efficiency of concise representations of frequently occurring patterns with respect to the extraction task and the obtained compactness rates, as well as for other data mining techniques such as clustering, and for the mining algorithms of different pattern classes such as hypergraphs. In this paper, we raise a fundamental question: how can we formally define the sparseness of an arbitrary context and assess its value? As an answer, based on the framework of the succinct system of minimal generators, we present an innovative characterization of context sparseness, as well as a new sparseness measure which results from the aggregation of two complementary measures, namely the succinctness and compactness measures of each equivalence class, induced by the Galois closure operator. Experiments carried out mainly attain a finer classification of benchmark contexts and, then, confirm our viewpoint that the "dense" and "sparse" labels are not absolute. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Huang, TCK				Huang, Tony Cheng-Kui			Discovery of fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports and adjustable membership functions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Sequential pattern; Multiple minimum support; Adjustable membership function; Quantitative data	MINING ASSOCIATION RULES; MAXIMUM CONSTRAINTS; GENERATION	The objective of mining quantitative sequential patterns is to discover complete sets of sequential patterns with quantities in databases. Although this novel type of pattern considers information, compared to traditional sequential patterns, it contains a sharp boundary problem; that is, when the quantity of an item is near the boundary of two predetermined quantity intervals, it can be either ignored or overemphasized. Hong et al. proposed a new type of pattern, called a fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern (FQSP), to solve this problem. Although this type of pattern provides summary information to expedite decision making, FQSPs confront unrealistic circumstances, that is, they offer only a unique minimum support (min_sup) to all items for the whole database. A higher min_sup fails to find rare items with higher profit, whereas a lower min_sup leads to a combinatorial explosion problem. Instead of this type of mechanism, we used the idea of multiple minimum supports to mine an FQSP. Furthermore, the utility of FQSP is also disturbed because this approach uses only a single membership function without considering the price-quantity relation. The idea of adjustable membership functions was also provided to address this problem. This study proposes a new model to discover an FQSP with both multiple minimum supports and adjustable membership functions. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets demonstrated the computational efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of the model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Hwang, JY; Lee, S; Chung, BH; Cho, HS; Nyang, D				Hwang, Jung Yeon; Lee, Sokjoon; Chung, Byung-Ho; Cho, Hyun Sook; Nyang, DaeHun			Group signatures with controllable linkability for dynamic membership	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Group signature; Anonymity; Traceability; Non-frameability; Linkability; Join	SIZE GROUP SIGNATURES; RANDOM ORACLES; ANONYMOUS CREDENTIALS; EFFICIENT REVOCATION; BLIND SIGNATURES; FOUNDATIONS; ASSUMPTIONS; SCHEME	In this paper we present a novel group signature scheme for dynamic membership which enables fine-grained control over the release of user information. This scheme could be widely used for various anonymity-based applications such as privacy-preserving data mining and customized anonymous authentication owing to a useful property called controllable linkability. A valid signer is able to create signatures that hide his or her identity as normal group signatures but can be anonymously linked regardless of changes to the membership status of the signer and without exposure of the history of the joining and revocation. From signatures, only linkage information can be disclosed, with a special linking key. Using this controllable linkability and the controllable anonymity of a group signature, anonymity may be flexibly or elaborately controlled according to a desired level. To begin construction of our scheme, we first introduce the Decision Linear Combination (DLC) assumption in a so-called gap Diffie-Hellman group where the DDH problem is tractable but the CDH problem is hard, and we prove that this assumption can be guaranteed in generic bilinear groups. To identify security requirements more precisely, we formally present definitions of anonymity, traceability, non-frameabilty, and linkability. We then prove that our scheme achieves all these security properties in the random oracle model. Our scheme supporting controllable linkability yields a short signature that is only 33.3% longer than the best-known normal group signature. Furthermore, we show that our scheme is comparable to the group signature scheme in terms of the amount of computation for basic operations such as signing, verification, and the key update caused by revocation. Finally, using the linkability for dynamic. membership, computation overhead in opening signer's identity can be significantly reduced or minimized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The relational Naive Bayes classifier exploits independence assumptions to achieve scalability. We introduce a weaker independence assumption to the effect that information from different data tables is independent given the class label. The independence assumption entails a closed-form formula for combining probabilistic predictions based on decision trees learned on different database tables. Logistic regression learns different weights for information from different tables and prunes irrelevant tables. In experiments, learning was very fast with competitive accuracy.

The focus is on improving LMSs (Learning Management Systems) or e-learning systems by predicting behavior patterns of students and adjusting the structure of these electronic courses. An existing learning management system is improved by using data mining techniques and increasing the efficiency of the courses using custom modules. This study presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the system. Future work should relate to the continued improvement of the PDCA-created system, as well as the introduction of additional modules and a comparative analysis of the presented and future results.

The user side of sustainability: Modeling behavior and energy usage in the home	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Smart environments; Machine learning; Energy; Anomaly detection	CONSUMPTION; BUILDINGS	Society is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that our lifestyle choices make on energy usage and the environment. As a result, research attention is being directed toward green technology, environmentally-friendly building designs, and smart grids. This paper looks at the user side of sustainability. In particular, it looks at energy consumption in everyday home environments to examine the relationship between behavioral patterns and energy consumption. It first demonstrates how data mining techniques may be used to find patterns and anomalies in smart home-based energy data. Next, it describes a method to correlate home-based activities with electricity usage. Finally, it describes how this information could inform users about their personal energy consumption and to support activities in a more energy-efficient manner. These approaches are validated by using real energy data collected in a set of smart home testbeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, CY; Lan, TH; Chan, CH				Cheng, Chen-Yang; Lan, Tsuo-Hung; Chan, Chin-Hong			An improved localization algorithm with wireless heartbeat monitoring system for patient safety in psychiatric wards	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Wireless sensor network; Localization; Healthcare; Data mining	TECHNOLOGY; EVOLUTION; HEALTH	Psychiatric patients often require continuous monitoring to keep them out of dangerous situations. Accordingly, hospitals hire additional staff to monitor patients' vital signs, maintain patient safety, and ensure that patients do not leave the hospital without notice. However, ward staff have difficulty knowing whenever a psychiatric patient is stepping into potential danger zones or encountering any safety threat. This paper reports the development of a wireless monitoring system to improve patient safety in psychiatric wards and reduce avoidable risks. The proposed system can ease the workload of nurses, help locate patients, and monitor patients' heartbeats. A two-step clustering localization algorithm is proposed for use in tracking patients' locations. This study marks for the first time that heartbeat detection using a ZigBee-based platform with localization function has been proposed. A proof-of-concept system is developed to understand the current hardware challenges and to enable functional analysis of the proposed ZigBee-based patient localization system. The error distance of the proposed localization algorithm is approximately 1 m. Its location accuracy is 90% with the error distance of up to 3 m. The proposed system is expected to improve patient safety significantly in psychiatric wards at low cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Enright, CG; Madden, MG; Madden, N				Enright, Catherine G.; Madden, Michael G.; Madden, Niall			Bayesian networks for mathematical models: Techniques for automatic construction and efficient inference	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Ordinary differential equations; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Adaptive time stepping; Particle filtering		Expert knowledge in the form of mathematical models can be considered sufficient statistics of all prior experimentation in the domain, embodying generic or abstract knowledge of it. When used in a probabilistic framework, such models provide a sound foundation for data mining, inference, and decision making under uncertainty. We describe a methodology for encapsulating knowledge in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). The resulting DBN framework can handle both data and model uncertainty in a principled manner, can be used for temporal data mining with noisy and missing data, and can be used to re-estimate model parameters automatically using data streams. We propose an alternative to the fixed time step inference used in standard DBNs. In our algorithm, the DBN automatically adapts the time step lengths to suit the dynamics in each step. The resulting system allows us to efficiently infer probable values of hidden variables using multiple time series of evidence, some of which may be sparse, noisy or incomplete. We evaluate our approach with a DBN based on a variant of the van der Pol oscillator, and demonstrate an example where it gives more accurate results than the standard approach, but using only one tenth the number of time steps. We also apply our approach to a real-world example in critical care medicine. By incorporating knowledge in the form of an existing ODE model, we have built a DBN framework for efficiently predicting individualised patient responses using the available bedside and lab data.

Many of the problems in extremely active research areas, such as bioinformatics, security and intrusion detection, or text mining, share the following two features: large data sets and class-imbalanced distribution of samples. Although many methods have been proposed for dealing with class-imbalanced data sets, most of these methods are not scalable to the very large data sets common to those research fields. In this paper, we propose a new approach to dealing with the class-imbalance problem that is scalable to data sets with many millions of instances and hundreds of features. This proposal is based on the divide-and-conquer principle combined with application of the selection process to balanced subsets of the whole data set. This divide-and-conquer principle allows the execution of the algorithm in linear time. Furthermore, the proposed method is easy to implement using a parallel environment and can work without loading the whole data set into memory. Using 40 class-imbalanced medium-sized data sets, we will demonstrate our method's ability to improve the results of state-of-the-art instance selection methods for class-imbalanced data sets. Using three very large data sets, we will show the scalability of our proposal to millions of instances and hundreds of features.

J	Guns, T; Nijssen, S; De Raedt, L				Guns, Tias; Nijssen, Siegfried; De Raedt, Luc			k-Pattern Set Mining under Constraints	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; pattern set mining; constraints; constraint programming	ITEMSETS	We introduce the problem of k-pattern set mining, concerned with finding a set of k related patterns under constraints. This contrasts to regular pattern mining, where one searches for many individual patterns. The k-pattern set mining problem is a very general problem that can be instantiated to a wide variety of well-known mining tasks including concept-learning, rule-learning, redescription mining, conceptual clustering and tiling. To this end, we formulate a large number of constraints for use in k-pattern set mining, both at the local level, that is, on individual patterns, and on the global level, that is, on the overall pattern set. Building general solvers for the pattern set mining problem remains a challenge. Here, we investigate to what extent constraint programming (CP) can be used as a general solution strategy. We present a mapping of pattern set constraints to constraints currently available in CP. This allows us to investigate a large number of settings within a unified framework and to gain insight in the possibilities and limitations of these solvers. This is important as it allows us to create guidelines in how to model new problems successfully and how to model existing problems more efficiently. It also opens up the way for other solver technologies.

J	Hellal, A; Ben Romdhane, L				Hellal, Aya; Ben Romdhane, Lotfi			NODAR: mining globally distributed substructures from a single labeled graph	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent subgraph mining; Subgraph isomorphism; DFS code; SMNOES measure; BFS	FREQUENT SUBGRAPHS; ALGORITHM	Data mining in structured and semi-structured data focuses on frequent data values. However, in graph data mining, the focus is on common specific topologies. Graph mining, although its ubiquity, is a difficult task since it requires subgraph isomorphism which is known to be NP-complete. In order to effectively prune the search space and thereby save computational time, a graph mining algorithm requires that the support measure of a pattern to be no greater than that of its subpatterns. This property of the support measure is referred to in the literature as the down-closure, anti-monotonicity or admissibility. Unfortunately, when mining a single labeled graph, simply counting the occurrences of a graph pattern may not have the down-closure property. For this, most existing approaches mine frequent substructures in a set of labeled graphs (called also the transactional setting) and few efforts have been devoted to mining frequent globally distributed substructures in a single labeled graph. In this paper, we propose a graph mining algorithm, called NODAR(Non-Overlapping embeDding based grAph mineR), for computing common and globally distributed substructures in a single labeled graph. NODAR adopts the Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy and is based on the SMNOES (Size of Maximum Non Overlapping Embedding Set) as support measure. The core idea of NODAR is to automatically extract frequent subpatterns; and thus without frequency computation thanks to the down-closure property of SMNOES. By adopting this strategy in the computation of frequent substructures, NODAR reduces the number of subgraph isomorphism tests needed to compute pattern frequencies. Experimental results on monograph and transactional graph databases; and comparison with well-known probabilistic and exact algorithms; prove the efficacy of NODAR.

J	Hospedales, TM; Gong, SG; Xiang, T				Hospedales, Timothy M.; Gong, Shaogang; Xiang, Tao			Finding Rare Classes: Active Learning with Generative and Discriminative Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Active learning; rare class discovery; imbalanced learning; classification; generative models; discriminative models	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS	Discovering rare categories and classifying new instances of them are important data mining issues in many fields, but fully supervised learning of a rare class classifier is prohibitively costly in labeling effort. There has therefore been increasing interest both in active discovery: to identify new classes quickly, and active learning: to train classifiers with minimal supervision. These goals occur together in practice and are intrinsically related because examples of each class are required to train a classifier. Nevertheless, very few studies have tried to optimise them together, meaning that data mining for rare classes in new domains makes inefficient use of human supervision. Developing active learning algorithms to optimise both rare class discovery and classification simultaneously is challenging because discovery and classification have conflicting requirements in query criteria. In this paper, we address these issues with two contributions: a unified active learning model to jointly discover new categories and learn to classify them by adapting query criteria online; and a classifier combination algorithm that switches generative and discriminative classifiers as learning progresses. Extensive evaluation on a batch of standard UCI and vision data sets demonstrates the superiority of this approach over existing methods.

J	Hosseini, MS; Eftekhari-Moghadam, AM				Hosseini, Monireh-Sadat; Eftekhari-Moghadam, Amir-Masoud			Fuzzy rule-based reasoning approach for event detection and annotation of broadcast soccer video	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Decision tree; Event detection; Fuzzy rule-based reasoning; Soccer video annotation; Video summarization	SPORTS VIDEO; PERSONALIZED RETRIEVAL; KNOWLEDGE; TRACKING; NETWORK; ACQUISITION; FRAMEWORK; FEATURES; SYSTEM	This paper presents an approach for event detection and annotation of broadcast soccer video. It benefits from the fact that occurrence of some audiovisual features demonstrates remarkable patterns for detection of semantic events. However, the goal of this paper is to propose a flexible system that can be able to be used with minimum reliance on predefined sequences of features and domain knowledge derivative structures. To achieve this goal, we design a fuzzy rule-based reasoning system as a classifier which adopts statistical information from a set of audiovisual features as its crisp input values and produces semantic concepts corresponding to the occurred events. A set of tuples is created by discretization and fuzzification of continuous feature vectors derived from the training data. We extract the hidden knowledge among the tuples and correlation between the features and related events by constructing a decision tree (DT). A set of fuzzy rules is generated by traversing each path from root toward leaf nodes of constructed DT. These rules are inserted in fuzzy rule base of designed fuzzy system and employed by fuzzy inference engine to perform decision-making process and predict the occurred events in input video.

J	Huang, XL; Wang, G; Hu, F				Huang, Xin-Lin; Wang, Gang; Hu, Fei			Multitask Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks via Spatiotemporal Data Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive radio network (CRN); Dirichlet process (DP); hidden Markov model (HMM); spatiotemporal data mining; spectrum sensing	MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSION; CONSENSUS; FREQUENCY; SYSTEMS; SCHEME; ROBUST; LENGTH	Recently, compressive sensing (CS) and spectrum sensing have been two hot topics in the signal processing and cognitive radio network (CRN) fields, respectively. Due to the sampling rate limitation of the analog-to-digital converter in spectrum-sensing circuits, some works have proposed integrating these two techniques to achieve low-overhead spectrum sensing in CRNs. These works aim to minimize spectrum reconstruction errors based on linear regression methods, and l(1)-norm is typically used to make a tradeoff between spectrum sparseness and reconstruction accuracy. However, since the interference range of primary users is limited, multiple clusters in the CRN may not share a common sparse spectrum, and thus, the l(1)-norm may not be appropriate to handle all clusters in CS inversion. Hence, we propose a novel multitask spectrum-sensing method based on spatiotemporal data mining methods. In each cluster, we assume that the spectrum sensing is executed in a synchronized way. The cluster head (CH) manages the operations, and a common sparseness hyperparameter is used to make a consensus decision. Among multiple clusters, synchronized CS sampling is not required in our scheme; instead, the Dirichlet process prior is employed to make an automatic grouping of the spectrum-sensing results among different clusters with a common sparseness hyperparameter shared inside each group. To exploit the time-domain relevance among consecutive CS observations, a hidden Markov model is employed to describe the relationship between the hidden subcarrier states and the consecutive CS observations, and the Viterbi algorithm is used to make an accurate spectrum decision for each secondary user. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can successfully exploit the spatiotemporal relationship to achieve higher spectrum-sensing performance in terms of normalized mean square error, probability of correct detection, and probability of false alarm, compared with a few other related works.

Self-care can improve the competence of elderly participants in managing their own health conditions without leaving home. This main purpose of this study is to understand the self-care behavior of elderly participants in a developed self-care service system that provides self-care service and to analyze the daily self-care activities and health status of elders who live at home alone. To understand elder self-care patterns, log data from actual cases of elder self-care service were collected and analysed by Web usage mining. This study analysed 3391 sessions of 157 elders for the month of March, 2012. First, self-care use cycle, time, function numbers, and the depth and extent (range) of services were statistically analysed. Association rules were then used for data mining to find relationship between these functions of self-care behavior. Second, data from interest-based representation schemes were used to construct elder sessions. The ART2-enhance K-mean algorithm was then used to mine cluster patterns. Finally, sequential profiles for elder self-care behavior patterns were captured by applying sequence-based representation schemes in association with Markov models and ART2-enhanced K-mean clustering algorithms for sequence behavior mining cluster patterns for the elders. The analysis results can be used for research in medicine, public health, nursing and psychology and for policy-making in the health care domain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, in real applications, sequence items shown in a record may have some relation. For example, in mining students' learning portfolios, the learning progressions must contain learning objects with forward-directed relations. Namely, the learning objects (items) themselves are evidence of a pre-existing relationship. In addition, most sequence mining algorithms assume the sequence records in databases are all of the same age. Each data record is observed at the same starting and ending point. But, according to the occurrences of events in a given period, the lengths of some sequences are longer than others. Hence the sequences with longer time spans might contain longer patterns than those with shorter time spans. As a result, the frequency of possible patterns shown in longer sequences might be underestimated due to fewer of records. This research proposed two methods, FSP and FSP-LC, to analyze forward sequence data. Latter, a real-life database which records all employee progression histories in a large company was used to verify and explain the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can mine specific and longer sequences to further improve and re-design their personnel systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

USING STATISTICAL MEASURES FOR FEATURE RANKING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Feature ranking; feature selection; class probability density; histogram	FEATURE-SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FUZZY ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER	Feature ranking is a fundamental preprocess for feature selection, before performing any data mining task. Essentially, when there are too many features in the problem, dimensionality reduction through discarding weak features is highly desirable. In this paper, we have developed an efficient feature ranking algorithm for selecting the more relevant features prior to derivation of classification predictors. Regardless the ranking criteria which rely on the training error of a predictor based on a feature, our approach is distance-based, employing only the statistical distribution of classes in each feature. It uses a scoring function as ranking criterion to evaluate the correlation measure between each feature and the classes. This function comprises three measures for each class: the statistical between-class distance, the interclass overlapping measure, and an estimate of class impurity. In order to compute the statistical parameters, used in these measures, a normalized form of histogram, obtained for each class, is employed as its a priori probability density. Since the proposed algorithm examines each feature individually, it provides a fast and cost-effective method for feature ranking. We have tested the effectiveness of our approach on some benchmark data sets with high dimensions. For this purpose, some top-ranked features are selected and are used in some rule-based classifiers as the target data mining task. Comparing with some popular feature ranking methods, the experimental results show that our approach has better performance as it can identify the more relevant features eventuate to lower classification error.

J	McAllister, RA; Angryk, RA				McAllister, Richard A.; Angryk, Rafal A.			Abstracting for Dimensionality Reduction in Text Classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								There is a growing interest in efficient models of text mining and an emergent need for new data structures that address word relationships. Detailed knowledge about the taxonomic environment of keywords that are used in text documents can provide valuable insight into the nature of the subject matter contained therein. Such insight may be used to enhance the data structures used in the text data mining task as relationships become usefully apparent. A popular scalable technique used to infer these relationships, while reducing dimensionality, has been Latent Semantic Analysis. We present a new approach, which uses an ontology of lexical abstractions to create abstraction profiles of documents and uses these profiles to perform text organization based on a process that we call frequent abstraction analysis. We introduce TATOO, the Text Abstraction TOOlkit, which is a full implementation of this new approach. We present our data model via an example of how taxonomically derived abstractions can be used to supplement semantic data structures for the text classification task.

The huge interest in clustering has led to a possibly three-digit number of algorithms with the k-means family probably the most widely used group of methods. Besides classic bivalent approaches, clustering algorithms belonging to the domain of soft computing have been proposed and successfully applied in the past four decades. Bezdek's fuzzy c-means is a prominent example for such soft computing cluster algorithms with many effective real life applications. More recently, Lingras and West enriched this area by introducing rough k-means. In this article we compare k-means to fuzzy c-means and rough k-means as important representatives of soft clustering. On the basis of this comparison, we then survey important extensions and derivatives of these algorithms; our particular interest here is on hybrid clustering, merging fuzzy and rough concepts. We also give some examples where k-means, rough k-means, and fuzzy c-means have been used in studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Price, S; Flach, PA; Spiegler, S; Bailey, C; Rogers, N				Price, Simon; Flach, Peter A.; Spiegler, Sebastian; Bailey, Christopher; Rogers, Nikki			SubSift web services and workflows for profiling and comparing scientists and their published works	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Workflows; Web services; Ranking		Scientific researchers, laboratories, organisations and research communities can be profiled and compared by analysing their published works, including documents ranging from academic papers to web sites, blog posts and Twitter feeds. This paper describes how the vector space model from information retrieval, more normally associated with full text search, has been employed in the open source SubSift software to support workflows to profile and compare such collections of documents. SubSift was originally designed to match submitted conference or journal papers to potential peer reviewers based on the similarity between the paper's abstract and the reviewer's publications as found in online bibliographic databases such as Google Scholar. The software is implemented as a family of RESTful web services that, composed into a re-useable workflow, have already been used to support several major data mining conferences. Alternative workflows and service compositions are now enabling other interesting applications, such as expert finding for the press and media, organisational profiling, and suggesting potential interdisciplinary research partners. This work is a useful generalisation and proof-of-concept realisation of an engineering solution to enable RESTful services to be assembled in workflows to analyse general content in a way that is not immediately available elsewhere. The challenges and lessons learned in the implementation and use of SubSift are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Reddy, KN; Ravi, V				Reddy, Kalam Narendar; Ravi, Vadlamani			Differential evolution trained kernel principal component WNN and kernel binary quantile regression: Application to banking	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Kernel methods; Kernel binary quantile regression; Kernel principal component analysis; Wavelet neural network; Differential evolution	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; WAVELET NEURAL-NETWORK; FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION; DATA MINING APPROACH; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; POWER TRANSFORMERS; CORPORATE FAILURE	In this paper, two novel kernel based soft computing techniques viz., Differential Evolution trained Kernel Principal Component Wavelet Neural Network (DE-KPCWNN) and DE trained Kernel Binary Quantile Regression (DE-KBQR) are proposed for classification. While, the former can solve multi-class classification problems, the latter can solve binary classification problems only. In the proposed DE-KPCWNN technique, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is applied to input data to get Kernel Principal Components, on which we will employ WNN. Then, DE is used to train the resulting KPCWNN. In DE-KBQR we applied Kernel technique on the input data to get Kernel Matrix, on which we will employ BQR. Then, DE is used to train the resulting KBQR. Several experiments are conducted on four bankruptcy datasets, three benchmark datasets and two Credit scoring datasets to assess the effectiveness of the proposed classification techniques. The results indicate that the proposed Soft Computing hybrids for classification are efficient than the existing classification techniques. Out of the two, DE-KBQR performed relatively better compared to DE-KPCWNN on a majority of binary classification problems. This is the significant outcome of this study. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Schumaker, RP				Schumaker, Robert P.			Machine learning the harness track: Crowdsourcing and varying race history	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Business intelligence; Data mining; Support Vector Regression; Harness racing; S&C Racing system; Crowdsourcing; Dr. Z System	NEURAL-NETWORKS; MARKET; PREDICTION; EFFICIENCY	Racing prediction schemes have been with mankind a long time. From following crowd wisdom and betting on favorites to mathematical methods like the Dr. Z System, we introduce a different class of prediction system, the S&C Racing system that derives from machine learning. We demonstrate the S&C Racing system using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict finishes and analyzed it on fifteen months of harness raring data from Northfield Park, Ohio. We found that within the domain of harness racing, our system outperforms crowds and Dr. Z Bettors in returns per dollar wagered on seven of the most frequently used wagers: Win $1.08 return, Place $230, Show $2.55, Exacta $1924, Quiniela $18.93, Trifecta $3.56 and Trifecta Box $21.05. Furthermore, we also analyzed a range of race histories and found that a four race history maximized system accuracy and payout. The implications of this work suggest that an informational inequality exists within the harness racing market that was exploited by S&C Racing. While interesting, the implications of machine learning in this domain show promise. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PIS regression transforms a set of correlated explanatory variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables, which is appropriate in the presence of multicollinearity. PLS-DA performs a PLS regression with a dichotomous dependent variable. The performance of this technique is compared to the performance of 8 algorithms widely used in bankruptcy prediction. In terms of accuracy, precision, F-score, Type I error and Type II error, results are similar; no algorithm outperforms the others. Behind performance, each algorithm assigns a score to each bank and classifies it as solvent or failed. These results have been analyzed by means of contingency tables, correlations, cluster analysis and reduction dimensionality techniques. PLS-DA results are very close to those obtained by Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, XL; Lin, HF				Sun, Xiaoling; Lin, Hongfei			Topical community detection from mining user tagging behavior and interest	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						network analysis; data mining; cluster analysis		With the development of Web2.0, social tagging systems in which users can freely choose tags to annotate resources according to their interests have attracted much attention. In particular, literature on the emergence of collective intelligence in social tagging systems has increased. In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model to detect latent topical communities among users. Social tags and resource contents are leveraged to model user interest in two similar and correlated ways. Our primary goal is to capture user tagging behavior and interest and discover the emergent topical community structure. The communities should be groups of users with frequent social interactions as well as similar topical interests, which would have important research implications for personalized information services. Experimental results on two real social tagging data sets with different genres have shown that the proposed generative model more accurately models user interest and detects high-quality and meaningful topical communities.

Anonymization of Centralized and Distributed Social Networks by Sequential Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Social networks; clustering; privacy preserving data mining; distributed computation		We study the problem of privacy-preservation in social networks. We consider the distributed setting in which the network data is split between several data holders. The goal is to arrive at an anonymized view of the unified network without revealing to any of the data holders information about links between nodes that are controlled by other data holders. To that end, we start with the centralized setting and offer two variants of an anonymization algorithm which is based on sequential clustering (Sq). Our algorithms significantly outperform the SaNGreeA algorithm due to Campan and Truta which is the leading algorithm for achieving anonymity in networks by means of clustering. We then devise secure distributed versions of our algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of privacy preservation in distributed social networks. We conclude by outlining future research proposals in that direction.

However, generating rules is not an end in itself because their applicability is not straightforward especially when their number is large. Ideally, the ultimate user would like to use these rules to decide which actions to undertake. In the literature, this notion is usually referred to as actionability. We propose a new framework to address actionability. Our goal is to lighten the burden of analyzing a large set of classification rules when the user is confronted to an "unsatisfactory situation" and needs help to decide about the appropriate actions to remedy to this situation. The method consists in comparing the situation to a set of classification rules. For this purpose, we propose a new framework for learning action recommendations dealing with complex notions of feasibility and quality of actions. Our approach has been motivated by an environmental application aiming at building a tool to help specialists in charge of the management of a catchment to preserve stream-water quality. The results show the utility of this methodology with regard to enhancing the actionability of a set of classification rules in a real-world application.

J	Tsai, CF; Eberle, W; Chu, CY				Tsai, Chih-Fong; Eberle, William; Chu, Chi-Yuan			Genetic algorithms in feature and instance selection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Genetic algorithms; Feature selection; Instance selection; Data mining; Data preprocessing	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFIER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; OUTLIER DETECTION; REDUCTION; OPTIMIZATION	Feature selection and instance selection are two important data preprocessing steps in data mining, where the former is aimed at removing some irrelevant and/or redundant features from a given dataset and the latter at discarding the faulty data. Genetic algorithms have been widely used for these tasks in related studies. However, these two data preprocessing tasks are generally considered separately in literature. It is unknown what the performance differences would be when feature and instance selection and feature or instance selection are performed individually. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform feature selection and instance selection based on genetic algorithms using different priorities to examine the classification performances over different domain datasets. The experimental results obtained from four small and large scale datasets containing various numbers of features and data samples show that performing both feature and instance selection usually make the classifiers (i.e., support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor) perform slightly poorer than feature selection or instance selection individually. However, while there is not a significant difference in classification accuracy between these different data preprocessing methods, the combination of feature and instance selection largely reduces the computational effort of training the classifiers, as opposed to performing feature and instance selection individually. Considering both classification effectiveness and efficiency, we demonstrate that performing feature selection first and instance selection second is the optimal solution for data preprocessing in data mining. Both SVM and k-NN classifiers provide similar classification accuracy to the baselines (i.e., those without data preprocessing). The decisions regarding which data preprocessing task to perform for different dataset scales are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strength-based learning classifier systems revisited: Effective rule evolution in supervised classification tasks	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Learning classifier systems (LCS); Strength-based fitness; Accuracy-based fitness; Supervised learning; Pattern classification	ACCURACY; XCS; ALGORITHMS; MODELS; ZCS	Learning classifier systems (LCS) are machine learning systems designed to work for both multi-step and single-step decision tasks. The latter case presents an interesting challenge for such algorithms, especially when they are applied to real-world data mining (DM) problems. The present investigation departs from the popular approach of applying accuracy-based LCS to single-step classification and aims to uncover the potential of strength-based LCS in such tasks. Although the latter family of algorithms have often been associated with poor generalization and performance, we aim at alleviating these problems by defining appropriate extensions to the traditional strength-based LCS framework. These extensions are detailed and their effect on system performance is studied through the application of the proposed algorithm on a set of artificial problems, designed to challenge its scalability and generalization abilities. The comparison of the proposed algorithm with UCS, its state-of-the-art accuracy-based counterpart, emphasizes the effects of our extended strength-based approach and validates its competitiveness in multi-class problems with various class distributions. Overall, our work presents an investigation of strength-based LCS in the domain of supervised classification. Our extensive analysis of the learning dynamics involved in these systems provides proof of their potential as real-world DM tools, inducing tractable rule-based classification models, even in the presence of severe class imbalances.

Personal bankruptcy, which usually results in significant losses to creditors, is a rapidly increasing yet little understood phenomenon. The most commonly used methods in personal bankruptcy prediction are credit scoring models. Some data mining models have also been investigated in this domain. Neither the scoring models nor the existing data mining methods adequately take sequence information in credit card data into account. In our system, sequence patterns, obtained by developing sequence mining techniques and applying them to credit card data from one major Canadian bank, are employed as main predictors. The mined sequence patterns, which we refer to as bankruptcy features, are represented in low-dimensional vector space. From the new feature space, which can be extended with some existing prediction-capable features (e.g., credit score), a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is built to combine these mined and already existing features. Our system is readily comprehensible and demonstrates promising prediction performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, ZQ; Wang, JF; Wang, CG				Zhao, Zongqu; Wang, Junfeng; Wang, Chonggang			An unknown malware detection scheme based on the features of graph	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						malware detection; graph-based method; function call graph; data mining	MALICIOUS EXECUTABLES; ENSEMBLE	The traditional malware detection schemes based on specific signature give an unsatisfactory performance as disposing the previously unknown malware, so the general features of binary files should be explored to solve this problem. Recently, classification algorithms were employed successfully to choose the features in unknown malicious code, and most of the works use byte or operation code sequence n-gram representation of the executables. However, these n-gram representations are heavily dependent on the training data. In this paper, we present a graph-based method to detect unknown malware. The function call graph of an executable, which includes the functions and the call relations between them, is selected as the representation of the executable in this method. The features are defined according to both the statistical information and the topology of the function call graph. They are extracted and processed through machine learning to classify unknown Portable Executable files. For the sake of fixed sum of the features, the graph-based method can avoid so many features found in other methods. In our experiments, three types of malware datasets were tested, and as high as 96.8% accuracy can be achieved. Furthermore, it can achieve 92.1% accuracy when only 5% of the dataset is served as training set. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Li, CZ; Xu, ZB; Luo, T				Li, Chun-Zhong; Xu, Zong-Ben; Luo, Tao			A heuristic hierarchical clustering based on multiple similarity measurements	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Data mining; Agglomerative clustering; Heuristic; Blurring; Top-down; Structural nearest neighbor	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; MEAN SHIFT	Similarity is the core problem of clustering. Clustering algorithms that are based on a certain, fixed type of similarity are not sufficient to explore complicated structures. In this paper, a constructing method for multiple similarity is proposed to deal with complicated structures of data sets. Multiple similarity derives from the local modification of the initial similarity, based on the feedback information of elementary clusters. Combined with the proposed algorithm, the repeated modifications of local similarity measurement generate a hierarchical clustering result. Some synthetic and real data sets are employed to exhibit the superiority of the new clustering algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the scholar proposes a new approach for robust hierarchical clustering based on the distance function between each data object and the cluster centers. This method avoids the need to compute the distance of each data object to the cluster center. It saves running time. The experimental results showed that the best clusters were obtained using EIDA method, this suggests that this similarity measure would be applicable to sequence data sets.

J	Akgobek, O				Akgobek, Omer			A rule induction algorithm for knowledge discovery and classification	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; rule extraction; classification; data mining	MEDICAL DATA SETS; DECISION-TREE; ASSOCIATION RULE; ATTRIBUTES; ACCURACY; EXTRACTION; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	Classification and rule induction are key topics in the fields of decision making and knowledge discovery. The objective of this study is to present a new algorithm developed for automatic knowledge acquisition in data mining. The proposed algorithm has been named RES-2 ( Rule Extraction System). It aims at eliminating the pitfalls and disadvantages of the techniques and algorithms currently in use. The proposed algorithm makes use of the direct rule extraction approach, rather than the decision tree. For this purpose, it uses a set of examples to induce general rules. In this study, 15 datasets consisting of multiclass values with different properties and sizes and obtained from the University of California, Irvine, have been used. Classification accuracy and rule count have been used to test the proposed method. This method presents an alternative 3-step method to classify categorical, binary, and continuous data by taking advantage of algorithms for data mining classification and decision rule generation. The method aims at improving the classification accuracy of the algorithms that extract the decision rules. Experimental studies were conducted on the benchmark datasets and the results of the comparisons with some known algorithms for decision rule generation have shown that the proposed method performs classification with a higher accuracy and generates fewer rules.

This has paved way to gather large amount of data on a day to day basis in an incremental way, making LMS data suitable for incremental learning through data mining techniques. The data mining technique which is employed in this research is clustering. This paper focuses on challenges involved in the instantaneous knowledge extraction from such an environment where streams of heterogeneous log records are generated every moment. In obtaining the overall knowledge from such LMS data, we have proposed a novel idea in which instead of reprocessing the entire data from the beginning, we processed only the recent chunk of data (incremental part) and append the obtained knowledge to the knowledge extracted from previous chunk(s). Obtained results when compared with teachers handling the modules/subjects match exactly with the expected results.

Naive Bayes technique implemented by creating tables of training; the sets of these tables were generated by using four factors that affect employee's continuity in their jobs. The training tables used to predict the classification of other (unclassified) instances, and tabulate the results of conditional and prior probabilities to test unknown instance for classification. The information obtained can classify unknown instances for employment in the labor market. In Decision Tree technique, a model was constructed from a dataset in the form of a tree, created by a process known as splitting on the value of attributes. The Decision Rules, which was constructed from Decision Trees of rules gave the best results, therefore we recommended using this method in predicting labor market. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Organizing this data has become one of the biggest problems in Computer Science. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, highlighting those related to the Data Mining area, specifically the clustering algorithms. However, these algorithms are still a computational challenge because of the volume of data that needs to be processed. We found in the literature some proposals to make these algorithms feasible, and, recently, those related to parallelization on graphics processing units (GPUs) have presented good results. In this work we present the G-DBSCAN, a GPU parallel version of one of the most widely used clustering algorithms, the DBSCAN. Although there are other parallel versions of this algorithm, our technique distinguishes itself by the simplicity with which the data are indexed, using graphs, allowing various parallelization opportunities to be explored. In our evaluation we show that the G-DBSCAN using GPU, can be over 100x faster than its sequential version using CPU.

Mammogram Image Feature Selection using Unsupervised Tolerance Rough Set Relative Reduct Algorithm	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, INFORMATICS AND MEDICAL ENGINEERING (PRIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering (PRIME)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Salem, INDIA		Periyar Univ, Dept Comp Sci	Rough Set Theory; Unsupervised Feature Selection; Tolerance Rough Set; Tolerance Quick Reduct; PSO - Relative Reduct; Mammography		Feature Selection (FS) aims to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original features. Rough set theory (RST) has been used as such a tool with much success. In the supervised FS methods, various feature subsets are evaluated using an evaluation function or metric to select only those features which are related to the decision classes of the data under consideration. However, for many data mining applications, decision class labels are often unknown or incomplete, thus indicating the significance of unsupervised feature selection. However, in unsupervised learning, decision class labels are not provided. The problem is that not all features are important. Some of the features may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this paper, a novel unsupervised feature selection in mammogram image, using tolerance rough set based relative reduct is proposed. And also, compared with Tolerance Quick Reduct and PSO - Relative Reduct unsupervised feature selection methods. A typical mammogram image processing system generally consists of mammogram image acquisition, pre-processing of image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The proposed method is used to reduce features from the extracted features and the method is compared with existing unsupervised features selection methods. The proposed method is evaluated through clustering and classification algorithms in K-means and WEKA.	[Aroquiaraj, I.

Due to its high prevalence, early detections are necessary so as to avoid vision loss. This paper aims to discuss the design and development of a retinopathy predictive system which is based on data mining and case based reasoning (CBR). To be specific, C5.0 was used to produce the decision tree whereas k-nearest neighbour and Hamming distance algorithms were used to select the three most similar cases for every new case entered into the system. Then a voting mechanism makes the final prediction. Results show that the hybrid system has a better accuracy prediction rate (85%) compared to C5.0 (76%) and CBR (73%) implemented solely.

Job-shop scheduling is one of the well-known hardest combinatorial optimization problems. This paper considers the problem of finding schedule for a job shop to minimize the makespan using Decision Tree algorithm. This approach involves preprocessing of scheduling data into an appropriate data file, discovering the key scheduling concepts and representing of the data mining results in way that enables its use for job scheduling. In decision tree based approach, the attribute selection greatly influences the predictive accuracy and hence this approach also considers creation of additional attributes. The proposed approach is compared with literature and work is complement to the traditional methods.

The data collected and analyzed generally contains huge number of dimensions or attributes and it may be the case that not all of the attributes are necessary for the data mining task to be performed on the data. Traditionally data dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis or Linear Discriminant analysis have been used to address this problem. But, these methods move the original data to a transformed space. However, the need might be to remain in the original attribute space and identify the key attributes for data analysis. This need has given rise to the research area of feature subset selection. In this paper we have used solid angle measure to tackle the problem of dimension reduction in OCT retinal data. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a frequently used and established medical imaging technique. It is widely used, among other application, to obtain high-resolution images of the retina and the anterior segment of the eye. Solid angle measure is used to characterize and select features obtained from OCT retinal images. The application of solid angle in feature selection, as proposed in this paper, is a unique approach to OCT image data mining. The experimental results with real life datasets presented in this paper will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

More worrisome, review processes are frequently questioned, and often non-transparent. This work advocates applying computer science methods and tools to the computer science review process. As an initial exploration, we data mine the submissions, bids, reviews, and decisions from a recent top-tier computer networking conference. We empirically test several common hypotheses, including the existence of readability, citation, call-for-paper adherence, and topical bias. From our findings, we hypothesize review process methods to improve fairness, efficiency, and transparency.			rbeverly@nps.edu; mallman@icir.org					Allman M., 2008, WOWCS; ALLMAN M, 2008, COMPUT COMMUN REV, V38, P47; Almeroth K., 2012, NETW C STAT; Anderson T.

In telecom industry it becomes even more important to identify which value added services(VAS) would be successful with a given customer segment. VAS provide a flexible revenue model that can be customized to different customer segments based on several attributes such as usage and preferences. Selecting and customizing VAS provides a wide canvas to the operators for maximizing their returns on the customer portfolio. Computational intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been successfully used for data mining and machine learning. These techniques provide a mathematical framework for identifying customers profiles and patterns in large datasets that representing the customers' data and their preferences. In this paper, we propose a methodology using SVM and ANN techniques to classify telecom customer data and identify the VAS best suited for the customer segment. We test our results with the SVM yielding high prediction accuracy for the unknown public test data with Radial Basis Function(RBF) Kernel using grid search technique.

We found out a correlation between weather conditions and the speech quality. The GSM technology is the most widely utilized communication standard which it is now coming to its bandwidth limitation especially in big cities and densely populated areas. Under such circumstances, even a minor weather change and rain could be a decisive factor causing changes in the quality of service. We have obtained both meteorological data and Mean Opinion Score value specifying the current speech quality in the GSM network. Those data are evaluated and compiled via statistical methods, whose accomplishment is dataset competent to be utilized by more advanced data mining methods. According to space distribution and fragmentation, our team has chosen set of suitable methods used to find data-mining, data analysis and correlation. As a computation result, our team found out the correlation between current rain density and the speech quality. Results from the MOS tests are reported, and an analysis of the obtained speech samples is presented. Outcomes are summarized and potential further directions for the continuation of research are discussed.

A picture affords domain registration, signal correlation, entity association, and user appeal; however it is assumed that the context exploitation of the picture is well-characterized for content extraction. With enormous amounts of data available from videos, images, documents, emails, and news reports; there is a need to do context search and indexing for content retrieval. The challenges include (1) Fusion: data mining and association, (2) Utility: metrics analysis of data uncertainty for information quality, (3) Search: an ontology for efficient queries, (4) Index: through metadata storage techniques, (5) Obtain: data access and dissemination, and (6) Navigate: presentation and linking. All of these issues are important for enormous data coordination for a machine or user that seeks to relevant information to answer queries.

On-going collaborations between clinicians and computer scientists are looking at the application of knowledge discovery in databases to the area of patient diagnosis, based on clinical records. A fuzzy rule-based system for risk estimation of cardiovascular patients is proposed. It uses a group of fuzzy rules as a knowledge representation about data pertaining to cardiovascular patients. Several algorithms for the discovery of an easily readable and understandable group of fuzzy rules are formalized and analysed. The accuracy of risk estimation and the interpretability of fuzzy rules are discussed. Our study shows, in comparison to other algorithms used in knowledge discovery, that classification with a group of fuzzy rules is a useful technique for risk estimation of cardiovascular patients.

Adaptive methods help find relevant data, create models, and characterize the model quality. These methods also can measure the conformity of this non-traditional data with fusion system products including situation modeling and mission impact prediction. Non-traditional data can improve the quantity, quality, availability, timeliness, and diversity of the baseline fusion system sources and therefore can improve prediction and estimation accuracy and robustness at all levels of fusion. Techniques are described that automatically learn to characterize and search non-traditional contextual data to enable operators integrate the data with the high-level fusion systems and ontologies. These techniques apply the extension of the Data Fusion & Resource Management Dual Node Network (DNN) technical architecture at Level 4. The DNN architecture supports effectively assessment and management of the expanded portfolio of data sources, entities of interest, models, and algorithms including data pattern discovery and context conformity. Affordable model-driven and data-driven data mining methods to discover unknown models from non-traditional and 'big data' sources are used to automatically learn entity behaviors and correlations with fusion products, [14 and 15]. This paper describes our context assessment software development, and the demonstration of context assessment of non-traditional data to compare to an intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance fusion product based upon an IED POIs workflow.

The typical patient record is filled with typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities, syntax errors and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. In the paper we depict the process of mining a large dataset of similar to 50,000-120,000 records x 20 attributes in database tables, originating from the hospital information system (thanks go to the University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic) recording over 11 years. The proposed technique has an important impact on reduction of the processing time of loosely structured textual records for experts. Note that this project is an ongoing process (and research) and new data are irregularly received from the medical facility, justifying the need for robust and fool-proof algorithms.

The precision obtained with these techniques depends largely on the quality of the discretization performed. Moreover, in many real-world applications, data from which the discretization is carried out, are imprecise. In this paper we address both problems by proposing an algorithm to obtain a fuzzy discretization of numerical attributes from input data that show imprecise values in both numerical and nominal attributes. To evaluate the proposed algorithm we analyze the results on a set of datasets from different real-world problems.	[Cadenas, J. M.; Garrido, M.

As a result, issues related to data quality have become more crucial and have consumed a majority of the time and budget of data mining projects. One problem for researchers is the lack of low quality data in order to test their techniques with this data type. Also, as far as we know, there is no software tool focused on the create/manage low quality datasets which treats, in the widest possible way, the low quality data and helps us to create repositories with low quality datasets for testing and comparison of data mining techniques and algorithms. For this reason, we present in this paper a software tool which can create/manage low quality datasets. Among other things, the tool can transform a dataset by adding low quality data, removing and replacing any data, constructing a fuzzy partition of the attributes, etc. It also allows different input/output formats of the dataset.

In this paper, we use the Bayesian network (BN) classifiers and data mining technology to diagnose different kinds of rotor faults in machinery fault simulator (MFS) under varied loads. First of all, three kinds of popular BN classifiers are introduced as the diagnosis model for rotor fault, and the fault diagnosis modeling methods based on BN classifiers is established by data mining. Then, a MFS is introduced and applied to generate the vibration data of system with different rotor faults under varied loads, as dataset 1, dataset 2 and dataset 3. At last, the dataset 1 generated by MFS is used to demonstrate the rotor fault diagnosis process with BN classifiers. The same procedures are also implemented for dataset 2 and dataset 3 to show the difference of diagnosis results under varied loads.
