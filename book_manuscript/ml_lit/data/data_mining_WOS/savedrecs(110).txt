A scalable algorithm for mining maximal frequent sequences using a sample	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; maximal frequent sequences; sampling; signatures; prefix tree; performance analysis	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	In this paper, we propose an efficient scalable algorithm for mining Maximal Sequential Patterns using Sampling (MSPS). The MSPS algorithm reduces much more search space than other algorithms because both the subsequence infrequency-based pruning and the supersequence frequency-based pruning are applied. In MSPS, a sampling technique is used to identify long frequent sequences earlier, instead of enumerating all their subsequences. We propose how to adjust the user-specified minimum support level for mining a sample of the database to achieve better overall performance. This method makes sampling more efficient when the minimum support is small. A signature-based method and a hash-based method are developed for the subsequence infrequency-based pruning when the seed set of frequent sequences for the candidate generation is too big to be loaded into memory. A prefix tree structure is developed to count the candidate sequences of different sizes during the database scanning, and it also facilitates the customer sequence trimming. Our experiments showed MSPS has very good performance and better scalability than other algorithms.

Web services (or simply services) are loosely coupled software components that are published, discovered, and invoked across the Web. As the use of Web service grows, in order to correctly interact with them, it is important to understand the business protocols that provide clients with the information on how to interact with services. In dynamic Web service environments, service providers need to constantly adapt their business protocols for reflecting the restrictions and requirements proposed by new applications, new business strategies, and new laws, or for fixing problems found in the protocol definition. However, the effective management of such a protocol evolution raises critical problems: one of the most critical issues is how to handle instances running under the old protocol when it has been changed. Simple solutions, such as aborting them or allowing them to continue to run according to the old protocol, can be considered, but they are inapplicable for many reasons (for example, the loss of work already done and the critical nature of work). In this article, we present a framework that supports service managers in managing the business protocol evolution by providing several features, such as a variety of protocol change impact analyses automatically determining which ongoing instances can be migrated to the new version of protocol, and data mining techniques inferring interaction patterns used for classifying ongoing instances migrateable to the new protocol. To support the protocol evolution process, we have also developed database-backed GUI tools on top of our existing system. The proposed approach and tools can help service managers in managing the evolution of ongoing instances when the business protocols of services with which they are interacting have changed.

Mining Maximal Frequent Item-set (MFI) is an alternative to address the problem. Set-Enumeration Tree (SET) is a common data structure used in several MFI mining algorithms. For this kind of algorithm, the process of mining MFI's can also be viewed as the process of searching in set-enumeration tree. To reduce the search space, in this paper, a new algorithm, Index-MaxMiner, for mining MFI is proposed by employing a hybrid search strategy blending breadth-first and depth-first. Firstly, the index array is proposed, and based on bitmap, an algorithm for computing index array is presented. By adding subsume index to frequent items, Index-MaxMiner discovers the candidate MFI's using breadth-first search at one time, which avoids first-level nodes that would not participate in the answer set and reduces drastically the number of candidate itemsets. Then, for candidate MFI's, depth-first search strategy is used to generate all MFI's. Thus, the jumping search in SET is implemented, and the search space is reduced greatly. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient especially for dense datasets.

CRISP-DM proposes processes and tasks that you have to carry out to develop a Data Mining project. A task proposed by CRISP-DM is the cost estimation of the Data Mining project. In software development a lot of methods are described to estimate the costs of project development (SLIM, SEER-SEM, PRICE-S and COCOMO). These methods are not appropriate in the case of Data Mining projects because in Data Mining software development is not the first goal. Some methods have been proposed to estimate some phases of a Data Mining project, but there is no method to estimate the global cost of a generic Data Mining project. The lack of Data Mining project estimation methods is because of many real-life project failures due to the non-realistic estimation at the beginning of the projects. Consequently, in this paper we propose to design and validate a parametric cost estimation model, similar to COCOMO or SLIM in software development, for Data Mining projects (DMCoMo1). The drivers of the model will be proposed first and later the equation of the model will be proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Aimed at discovering temporal patterns with during relationship (during-temporal patterns, DTPs), which is deemed common and potentially valuable in real-world applications, this paper presents an approach to finding such DTPs by investigating some of their properties and incorporating them as desirable pruning strategies into the corresponding algorithm, so as to optimize the mining process. Results from synthetic reveal that the algorithm is efficient and linearly scalable with regard to the number of temporal events.

Many publications compare a new proposition - if at all - with one or two competitors or even with a so called "naive" ad hoc solution.

Following, we survey the relevant proposals in the area of context-aware pervasive computing, data mining and granular computing discussing their potentials and limitations with regard to their adoption in the development of context-aware pervasive services. On these bases, we propose the W4 model for contextual data and show how it can represent a simple yet effective model to enable flexible general-purpose management of contextual knowledge by pervasive services.

J	Choo, YH; Abu Bakar, A; Hamdan, AR				Choo, Yun-Huoy; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza; Hamdan, Abdul Razak			The fitness-rough: A new attribute reduction method based on statistical and rough set theory	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						attribute reduction; fitness degree; information loss; rough reducts; heuristic rule	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; INFORMATION; DEPENDENCY	Attribute reduction has become an important pre-processing task to reduce the complexity of the data mining task. Rough reducts, statistical methods and correlation-based methods have gradually contributed towards improving attribute reduction techniques to a certain extent. Statistical methods are generally lower in computational complexity compared to the rough reducts and the correlation-based methods, but many have proven that the rough reducts method is significant in reducing important attributes without causing too much information loss. Correlation-based methods on the other hand evaluate features as a subset instead of individual attribute. In this paper, we propose a combination of statistical and rough set methods to reduce important attributes in a simpler way while maintaining a lesser degree of information loss from the raw data. The fitness-rough method (FsR) indicates important attributes from raw data and it is further simplified to a more compact information table. Besides that, we have also looked into the problem of information loss in this method. Ten UCI machine learning datasets were used as testing sets on the proposed method as compared to the classical rough reducts (RR) method, the statistical entropy ( ENT) method and the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. Experimental results show that our method has performed comparatively well with higher reduction strength and smaller rules set against the benchmarking methods, especially in medium size datasets. However, the FsR method is basically less efficient when used on mix-mode and nominal datasets as the non-quantitative attributes involved in these datasets are normally pre-categorised.

Nevertheless, use of local patterns is limited by their huge number and computational costs. Several approaches (e.g., condensed representations, pattern set discovery) aim at selecting or grouping local patterns to provide a global view of the data. In this paper, we propose the idea of global constraints to write queries addressing global patterns as sets of local patterns. Usefulness of global constraints is to take into account relationships between local patterns, such relations expressing a user bias according to its expectation (e.g., search of exceptions, top-k patterns). We think that global constraints are a powerful way to get meaningful patterns. We propose the generic Approximate-and-Push approach to mine patterns under global constraints and we give a method for the case of the top-k patterns w.r.t. any measure. Experiments show its efficiency since it was not feasible to mine such patterns beforehand.

However most algorithms typically just find a single explanation of the data even though alternatives could exist. In this work, we explore a general purpose approach to find an alternative clustering of the data with the aid of mustlink and cannot-link constraints. This problem has received little attention in the literature and since our approach can be incorporated into the many clustering algorithms that use a distance function, compares favorably with existing work.

Unlike the standard rough set model the indiscernibility relation in our paper is based on a quasi-order, not necessarily an equivalence relation. Feature selection, though algorithmically difficult in general, appears to be easier in many cases of scaled many-valued contexts, because the difficulties can at least partially be projected to the scale contexts. We propose a heuristic algorithm for this.

Although a number of RR-based methods have been proposed for various data mining computations, no study has systematically compared them to find optimal RR schemes. The difficulty of comparison lies in the fact that to compare two PPDM schemes, one needs to consider two conflicting metrics: privacy and utility. An optimal scheme based on one metric is usually the worst based on the other metric. In this paper, we first describe a method to quantify privacy and utility. We formulate the quantification as estimate problems, and use estimate theories to derive quantification. We then use an evolutionary multi-objective optimization method to find optimal disguise matrices for the randomized response technique.

Innovative computational methods for transcriptomic data analysis: A case study in the use of FPT for practical algorithm design and implementation	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Model Transformation Track held at the 21st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing	APR   23, 2006-APR 27, 5006	Dijon, FRANCE	ACM		transcriptomic data analysis; fixed-parameter tractability; graph algorithms	PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; EXPRESSION DATA-ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MICROARRAY DATA; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; COEXPRESSION NETWORKS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; ORGANIZATION; RADIATION; PATHWAYS	Tools of molecular biology and the evolving tools of genomics can now be exploited to study the genetic regulatory mechanisms that control cellular responses to a wide variety of stimuli. These responses are highly complex, and involve many genes and gene products. The main objectives of this paper are to describe a novel research program centered on understanding these responses by ( i) developing powerful graph algorithms that exploit the innovative principles of fixed parameter tractability in order to generate distilled gene sets; ( ii) producing scalable, high performance parallel and distributed implementations of these algorithms utilizing cutting-edge computing platforms and auxiliary resources; ( iii) employing these implementations to identify gene sets suggestive of co-regulation; and ( iv) performing sequence analysis and genomic data mining to examine, winnow and highlight the most promising gene sets for more detailed investigation. As a case study, we describe our work aimed at elucidating genetic regulatory mechanisms that control cellular responses to low-dose ionizing radiation ( IR). A low-dose exposure, as defined here, is an exposure of at most 10 cGy ( rads). While the consequences of high doses of radiation are well known, the net outcome of low-dose exposures continues to be debated, with support in the literature for both detrimental and beneficial effects. We use genome-scale gene expression data collected in response to low-dose IR exposure in vivo to identify the pathways that are activated or repressed as a tissue responds to the radiation insult. The driving motivation is that knowledge of these pathways will help clarify and interpret physiological responses to IR, which will advance our understanding of the health consequences of low-dose radiation exposures.

In this paper, we proposed two efficient one-pass algorithms, MHUI-BIT and MHUI-TID, for mining high utility itemsets from data streams within a transaction-sensitive sliding window. Two effective representations of item information and an extended lexicographical tree-based summary data structure are developed to improve the efficiency of mining high utility itemsets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform than the existing algorithms for mining high utility itemsets from data streams.

We propose algorithms based on (1) the geometric mean estimator, for all 0 < alpha <= 2, and (2) the harmonic mean estimator, only for small alpha (e.g., alpha < 0.344). Compared with the previous classical work [27], our main contributions include: The general sample complexity bound for alpha not equal 1, 2. For alpha = 1, [27] provided a nice argument based on the inverse of Cauchy density about the median, leading to a sample complexity bound, although they did not provide the constants and their proof restricted to be "small enough." For general alpha = 1, 2, however, the task becomes much more difficult. [27] provided the "conceptual promise" that the sample complexity bound similar to that for alpha = 1 should exist for general alpha, if a "non-uniform algorithm based on t-quantile" could be implemented. Such a conceptual algorithm was only for supporting the arguments in [27], not a real implementation. We consider this is one of the main problems left open in [27]. In this study, we propose a practical algorithm based on the geometric mean estimator and derive the sample complexity bound for all 0 < alpha <= 2. The practical and optimal algorithm for alpha = 0+ The l(0) norm is an important case. Stable random projections can provide an approximation to the l(0) norm using alpha -> 0+. We provide an algorithm based on the harmonic mean estimator, which is simple and statistically optimal. Its tail bounds are sharper than the bounds derived based on the geometric mean. We also discover a (possibly surprising) fact: in boolean data, stable random projections using alpha = 0+ with the harmonic mean estimator will be about twice as accurate as (l(2)) normal random projections. Because high-dimensional boolean data are common, we expect this fact will be practically quite useful. The precise theoretical analysis and practical implications We provide the precise constants in the tail bounds for both the geometric mean and harmonic mean estimators. We also provide the variances (either exact or asymptotic) for the proposed estimators. These results can assist practitioners to choose sample sizes accurately.

The main challenge lies in modeling the adversary's background knowledge. We propose a novel approach to deal with such attacks. In this approach, one first mines knowledge from the data to be released and then uses the mining results as the background knowledge when anonymizing the data. The rationale of our approach is that if certain facts or background knowledge exist, they should manifest themselves in the data and we should be able to find them using data mining techniques. One intriguing aspect of our approach is that one can argue that it improves both privacy and utility at the same time, as it both protects against background knowledge attacks and better preserves the features in the data. We then present the Injector framework for data anonymization. Injector mines negative association rules from the data to be released and uses them in the anonymization process. We also develop an efficient anonymization algorithm to compute the injected tables that incorporates background knowledge. Experimental results show that Injector reduces privacy risks against background knowledge attacks while improving data utility.

Non-Technical Loss Analysis for Detection of Electricity Theft using Support Vector Machines	2008 IEEE 2ND INTERNATIONAL POWER AND ENERGY CONFERENCE: PECON, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Power and Energy Conference (PECon 2008)	DEC 01-03, 2008	Johor Bahru, MALAYSIA	IEEE		Support vector machine; intelligent system; electricity theft; non-technical loss; load profile		Electricity consumer dishonesty is a problem faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards Non-Technical Loss (NTL) analysis for electric utilities using a novel intelligence-based technique, Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to electricity theft. The proposed model preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite for fraud based on irregularities and abnormal consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining and involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. The SVM based approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields classification classes that are used to shortlist potential fraud suspects for onsite inspection, based on significant behavior that emerges due to irregularities in consumption. Simulation results prove the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by TNB in order to reduce NTL activities.

Two models, GDM and OGDM, which are based on another representation model - OGRM are developed and tested on eighty seven known offender groups where nine of them were terrorist cells. GDM, which is basically depending on police arrest data and "caught together" information, performed well on terrorist groups, whereas OGDM, which uses a feature matching on year-wise offender components from arrest and demographics data, performed better on non-terrorist groups. OGDM uses a terror crime modus operandi ontology which enabled matching of similar crimes.

Often, what is required is that images taken in the same place, of the same thing, or of the same person be conceptually grouped together. This work focuses on grouping images containing the same object, despite significant changes in scale, viewpoint and partial occlusions, in very large (1M+) image collections automatically gathered from Flickr The scale of the data and the extreme variation in imaging conditions makes the problem very challenging. We describe a scalable method that first computes a matching graph over all the images. Image groups can then be mined from this graph using standard clustering techniques. The novelty we bring is that both the matching graph and the clustering methods are able to use the spatial consistency between the images arising from the common object (if there is one). We demonstrate our methods on a publicly available dataset of 5K images of Oxford, a 37K image dataset containing images of the Statue of Liberty and a much larger 1M image dataset of Rome. This is, to our knowledge, the largest dataset to which image-based data mining has been applied.

The former usually refers to the application of nowadays' technology to agriculture. Due to the use of sensors and GPS technology, in today's agriculture many data are collected. Making use of those data via IT often leads to dramatic improvements in efficiency. For this purpose, the challenge is to change these raw data into useful information. In this paper we deal with neural networks and their usage in mining these data. Our particular focus is whether neural networks can be used for predicting wheat yield from cheaply-available in-season data. Once this prediction is possible, the industrial application is quite straightforward: use data mining with neural networks for, e.g., optimizing fertilizer usage, in economic or environmental terms.

In order to promote a wider application of this technology, the teachers and course designers need specific methods and tools for supporting their work. In that sense, data mining is a promising technology. In fact, data mining techniques have already been used in E-learning systems, but most of the times their application is oriented to provide better support to students; little work has been done for assisting adaptive hypermedia authors through data mining. In this paper we present a proposal for using data mining for improving an adaptive hypermedia system. A tool implementing the proposed approach is also presented, along with examples of how data mining technology can assist teachers.

In recent years, negative association rule mining has attracted remarkable attention. This paper presents a notion of validity for both positive and negative association rules, which is considered intuitive and necessary. Then, a mining algorithm to find all rules in light of completeness is proposed. In doing so, several pruning strategies based on the upward closure property are developed and incorporated into the algorithm so as to guarantee the computational efficiency.

High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and data utility. On one hand re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequently occur in transactions, called moles. On the other hand, data mining applications typically depend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions, called nuggets. Thus the problem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. A challenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and are tangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem, The novelty lies in a compact border data structure that eliminates the need of generating all moles and nuggets.

Individual models are based on preferred learning styles dimensions, according to which students focus on different types of information and show different performances in educational process. Building individual models of learners allows for adjusting teaching paths and materials into their needs. In the presented approach, students are divided into groups by unsupervised classification. Application of two-phase hierarchical clustering algorithm which enables tutors to determine such parameters as maximal number of groups, clustering threshold and weights for different learning style dimensions is described. Experimental results connected with modeling real groups of students are discussed.

Many classification methods have been presented in the literatures to tackle this problem. The decision tree method is a particularly effective method to build a classifier from the sample data. Decision tree classification method has higher prediction accuracy for the problems of classification, and can automatically generate classification rules. However, the original sample data sets used to generate the decision tree classification model often contain many noise or redundant data. These data will have a great impact on the prediction accuracy of the classifier. Therefore, it is necessary and very important to preprocess the original sample data. On this issue, a very effective approach is the rough sets. In rough sets theory, a basic problem that can be tackled using rough sets approach is reduction of redundant attributes. This paper presents a new credit scoring approach based on combination of rough sets theory and decision tree theory. The results of this study indicate that the process of reduction of attribute is very effective and our approach has good performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

J	Xiang, Y; Jia, N				Xiang, Yang; Jia, Ning			Modeling causal reinforcement and undermining for efficient CPT elicitation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						knowledge engineering; probabilistic reasoning; uncertainty; knowledge acquisition; knowledge modeling; elicitation methods		Representation of uncertain knowledge by using a Bayesian network requires the acquisition of a conditional probability table (CPT) for each variable. The CPT can be acquired by data mining or elicitation. When data are insufficient for supporting mining, causal modeling such as the noisy-OR aids elicitation by reducing the number of probability parameters to be acquired from human experts. Multiple causes can reinforce each other in producing the effect or can undermine the impact of each other. Most existing causal models do not consider causal interactions from the perspective of reinforcement or undermining. Our analysis shows that none can represent both interactions. Except for the RNOR, other models also limit parameters to probabilities of single-cause events. We present the first general causal model, that is, the nonimpeding noisy-AND tree, that allows encoding of both reinforcement and undermining. It supports efficient CPT acquisition by elicitating a partial ordering of causes in terms of a tree topology, plus the necessary numerical parameters. It also allows the incorporation of probabilities for multicause events.

J	Park, NH; Lee, WS				Park, Nam Hun; Lee, Won Suk			Cell trees: An adaptive synopsis structure for clustering multi-dimensional on-line data streams	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data streams; clustering; data mining; grid-based clustering; adaptive memory utilization	FREQUENT ITEMSETS	To effectively trace the clusters of recently generated data elements in an on-line data stream, a sibling list and a cell tree are proposed in this paper. Initially, the multi-dimensional data space of a data stream is partitioned into mutually exclusive equal-sized grid-cells. Each grid-cell monitors the recent distribution statistics of data elements within its range. The old distribution statistics of each grid-cell are diminished by a predefined decay rate as time goes by, so that the effect of the obsolete information on the current result of clustering can be eliminated without maintaining any data element physically. Given a partitioning factor h, a dense grid-cell is partitioned into It equal-size smaller grid-cells. Such partitioning is continued until a grid-cell becomes the smallest one called a unit grid-cell. Conversely, a set of consecutive sparse grid-cells can be merged into a single grid-cell. A sibling list is a structure to manage the set of all grid-cells in a one-dimensional data space and it acts as an index for locating a specific grid-cell. Upon creating a dense unit grid-cell on a one-dimensional data space, a new sibling list for another dimension is created as a child of the grid-cell. In such a way, a cell tree is created. By repeating this process, a multi-dimensional dense unit grid-cell is identified by a path of a cell tree. Furthermore, in order to confine the usage of memory space, the size of a unit grid-cell is adaptively minimized such that the result of clustering becomes as accurate as possible at all times. The proposed method is comparatively analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strategies for improving the modeling and interpretability of Bayesian networks	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						knowledge discovery; Markov chains; Bayesian networks; multivariate regression		One of the main factors for the knowledge discovery success is related to the comprehensibility of the patterns discovered by applying data mining techniques. Amongst which we can point out the Bayesian networks as one of the most prominent when considering the easiness of knowledge interpretation achieved. Bayesian networks, however, present limitations and disadvantages regarding their use and applicability. This paper presents an extension for the improvement of Bayesian networks, treating aspects such as performance, as well as interpretability and use of their results; incorporating genetic algorithms in the model, multivariate regression for structure learning and temporal aspects using Markov chains.

J	Li, JY; Yang, Q				Li, Jinyan; Yang, Qiang			Strong compound-risk factors: Efficient discovery through emerging patterns and contrast sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						compound-risk factors; emerging patterns; odds ratio (OR); relative risk (RR)	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; ODDS RATIOS MISLEAD; COMMON; SATISFACTION; OUTCOMES; PATIENT	Odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) (risk ratio), and absolute risk reduction (ARR) (risk difference) are biostatistics measurements that are widely used for identifying significant risk factors in dichotomous groups of subjects. In the past, they have often been used to assess simple risk factors. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compound-risk factors to broaden the applicability of these statistical tests for assessing factor interplays. We observe that compound-risk factors with a high risk ratio or a big risk difference have an one-to-one correspondence to strong emerging patterns or strong contrast sets-two types of patterns that have been extensively studied in the data mining field. Such a relationship has been unknown to researchers in the past, and efficient algorithms for discovering strong compound-risk factors have been lacking. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework and a new algorithm that unify the discovery of compound-risk factors that have a strong OR, risk ratio, or a risk difference. Our method guarantees that all patterns meeting a certain test threshold can be efficiently discovered. Our contribution thus represents the first of its kind in linking the risk ratios and ORs to pattern mining algorithms, making it possible to find compound-risk factors in large-scale data sets. In addition, we show that using compound-risk factors can improve classification accuracy in probabilistic learning algorithms on several disease data sets, because these compound-risk factors capture the interdependency between important data attributes.

J	Chang, YC; Lai, PC; Lee, MT				Chang, Yang-Chi; Lai, Po-Chuan; Lee, Meng-Tsung			An integrated approach for operational knowledge acquisition of refuse incinerators	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						rule-based knowledge; refuse incinerator; data mining; feature selection; decision tree classification	FLOATING SEARCH METHODS; FEATURE-SELECTION; CROSS-VALIDATION; DECISION-TREE; EXAMPLES; WASTE	Refuse incinerator operation poses a tremendous challenge for efficient supervision due to the highly complexity of physical and chemical mechanisms inside the systems. It is difficult to comprehend operational knowledge without thorough study and long-term on site experiments. Fortunately, many sensors are installed in incineration plants and tremendous amounts of raw data about daily practices and system states are recorded to assist operations. Without proper analysis, however, these data are not beneficial to operators. An integrated approach is adopted in the current study using feature selection and data mining techniques. Feature selection was initially applied to cope with the heavy computation burden due to the huge data set. Data dimension can be reduced by discarding redundant information and leaving only relevant features for further analysis. Data mining analysis is then utilized to build two decision tree models based on steam production and NO, emission target attributes. Implicit incinerator system relations, represented by production rules and predicting accuracies, can be acquired from the decision tree models. Such rule-based knowledge is expected to facilitate on-site operations and enhance refuse incinerator efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This approach uses data-mining technology to extract the optimal relay settings information from a large data set of system parameters. This data is constructed from offline simulation analyses of events and consequences. The mining of these consequences defines the boundary limits of the threshold settings that could. secure the detection of islanding operations under: minimum detectable zones, multiple distributed resources (DRs), diverse distributed resource technologies, various operating conditions, and different network topologies. The approach is tested on a typical DG with multiple distributed resources, and the results indicate that this approach can be used effectively to support the setting relay decision.

J	Ramakrishnan, R; Chen, BC				Ramakrishnan, Raghu; Chen, Bee-Chung			Exploratory mining in cube space	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; exploratory analysis; OLAP; cube; feature space; multidimensional data model		Data Mining has evolved as a new discipline at the intersection of several existing areas, including Database Systems, Machine Learning, Optimization, and Statistics. An important question is whether the field has matured to the point where it has originated substantial new problems and techniques that distinguish it from its parent disciplines. In this paper, we discuss a class of new problems and techniques that show great promise for exploratory mining, while synthesizing and generalizing ideas from the parent disciplines. While the class of problems we discuss is broad, there is a common underlying objective-to look beyond a single data-mining step (e.g., data summarization or model construction) and address the combined process of data selection and transformation, parameter and algorithm selection, and model construction. The fundamental difficulty lies in the large space of alternative choices at each step, and good solutions must provide a natural framework for managing this complexity. We regard this as a grand challenge for Data Mining, and see the ideas discussed here as promising initial steps towards a rigorous exploratory framework that supports the entire process.

Incremental development of CBR strategies for computing project cost probabilities	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						case based reasoning; transformational analogy; derivational analogy; cost estimation; probability distribution; data mining	CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; WEB	This paper presents three CBR systems that have been developed over seven years in collaboration with two industrial partners. In this research, case based reasoning (CBR) is used to compute costs of construction projects. In contrast with previous work in the field of CBR, the focus is on choosing strategies that are compatible with user needs and characteristics. Comparing the three strategies reveals advantages and drawbacks while illustrating a "real-life" evolution of a CBR architecture in an industrial context. An important conclusion is that the ways users perform tasks have a direct influence on the best architecture for the CBR system (e.g. transformational/derivational analogy). Incremental development of strategies in the final system improves user interaction, expedites time consuming tasks and favours identification of synergy between techniques such as CBR and data mining.

As a consequence, we obtain an incremental quasi-polynomial time algorithm for generating all maximal integer feasible solutions for a given monotone system of separable inequalities, for generating all p-inefficient points of a given discrete probability distribution, and for generating all maximal hyper-rectangles which contain a specified fraction of points of a given set in R-n. This provides a substantial improvement over previously known exponential time algorithms for these generation problems related to Integer and Stochastic Programming, and Data Mining. Furthermore, we give an incremental polynomial time generation algorithm for monotone systems with fixed number of separable inequalities, implying that for discrete probability distributions with independent coordinates, both p-efficient and p-inefficient points can be separately generated in incremental polynomial time.

J	Liu, H; Xiang, BR; Qu, LB				Liu, Hao; Xiang, Bingren; Qu, Lingbo			The application of rough sets in SAR analysis of N1-site substituted fluoroquinolones	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						rough set (RS); SAR; quinolones; AMI; MNDO3; hydrogen bond	ANTIBACTERIALS; STRAINS	The 3 dimension structure-activity relationships (3D-SAR) for N1-site substituted fluoroquinolones that used as antibiotics were performed with RS (rough sets) method. The process of RS is a concise nonlinear process, it has broad application foreground in the data mining of nonlinear life course. In this paper, initially the parameters of N1-site substituted quinolones were computed with the semi-empirical method: AM I (Austin model) and MNDO3 (modified neglect diatomic overlap), and the information table is composed of the parameters (condition attributes) and biology activity (decision attributes). According to the analysis of rough sets method, the core and reduction of attributes set were obtained, then the decision rules were extracted. The results indicate that LUMO, A5, A3 and dipole, etc. have the great contribution to the activity of NI-site substituted fluoroquinolones. Integrating the related biological research of fluoroquinolones resistance, the binary hydrogen bond mechanism of fluoroquinolones is brought forward. It implies that fluoroquinolones realize their function as electron donors as well as electron acceptors in its function process, and the process is finished by the formation of two hydrogen bonds (6-site F and 3-site OH). The mutation of bacteria makes it hard to form hydrogen bonds, then cause the fluoroquinolones resistance. The result also indicates that moderate dipole and Delta H-f are helpful to fluoroquinolones to be absorbed by the human body and act on bacteria. As a nonlinear system, RS theory can extract the special relation in the database, it has nonlinear character compared with PCA (Principal Component Analysis), PLS (Partial Least Square), etc., and the result has unambiguous physical meaning compared with ANN (Artificial Neuron Network), etc. The result is very succinct and pointed, it is instructive to the study of pharmacody function process, resistance mechanism of fluoroquinolones and development of new fluoroquinolones.

In contrast to previous sampling-based studies, we treat the problem as an optimization problem where, given a workload of queries, we select a stratified random sample of the original data such that the error in answering the workload queries using the sample is minimized. A key novelty of our approach is that we can tailor the choice of samples to be robust, even for workloads that are "similar" but not necessarily identical to the given workload. Finally, our techniques recognize the importance of taking into account the variance in the data distribution in a principled manner. We show how our solution can be implemented on a database system, and present results of extensive experiments on Microsoft SQL Server that demonstrate the superior quality of our method compared to previous work.

The LNS problems model the simultaneous detection of multiple mutually related surfaces in three or higher dimensional medical images. Although we prove that the d-D LNS problem (d >= 3) on a general ordered multi-column graph is NP-hard, the (special) ordered multi-column graphs that model medical image segmentation have the self-closure structures and thus admit polynomial time exact algorithms for solving the LNS problems. Our shaped geometric regions of an optimal total volume in a d-D weighted voxel grid. The NSV problems find applications in medical image segmentation and data mining. Our techniques yield the first polynomial time exact algorithms for several high dimensional medical image segmentation problems. Experiments and comparisons based on real medical data showed that our LNS algorithms and software are computationally efficient and produce highly accurate and consistent segmentation results.

Multimode acoustic emission (AE) sensor installed on the drive cover is designed for tracking air bearing (AB) and slider modes. Monitored modal changes at the AB and slider bandwidth correlate to the weak head disc interface (HDI) interactions such as lubricant modulation and particles induced defects. Two or three orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity can be achieved by a combination of advanced sensors, data acquisition hardware and digital signal processing algorithms. Continuous and Discrete Wavelet Transform and Joint Time-Frequency analyses are implemented for the AB modal data mining process. Performance of the newly developed technology is demonstrated on a normally operating hard disc drive (HDD).

Multi-objective evolutionary optimization for constructing neural networks for virtual reality visual data mining: Application to geophysical prospecting	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Computational Intelligence in Earth and Environmental Siences	2006	Vancouver, CANADA			visual data mining; virtual reality; multi-objective optimization; neural networks; geophysical prospecting	REPRESENTATION	A method for the construction of virtual reality spaces for visual data mining using multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithms on nonlinear discriminant (NDA) neural networks is presented. Two neural network layers (the output and the last hidden) are used for the construction of simultaneous solutions for: (i) a supervised classification of data patterns and (ii) an unsupervised similarity structure preservation between the original data matrix and its image in the new space. A set of spaces are constructed from selected solutions along the Pareto front. This strategy represents a conceptual improvement over spaces computed by single-objective optimization. In addition, genetic programming (in particular gene expression programming) is used for finding analytic representations of the complex mappings generating the spaces (a composition of NDA and orthogonal principal components). The presented approach is domain independent and is illustrated via application to the geophysical prospecting of caves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yildiz, OT; Dikmen, O				Yildiz, Olcay Taner; Dikmen, Onur			Parallel univariate decision trees	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						decision trees; parallel processing; univariate decision trees; linear discriminant trees		Univariate decision tree algorithms are widely used in data mining because (i) they are easy to learn (ii) when trained they can be expressed in rule based manner. In several applications mainly including data mining, the dataset to be learned is very large. In those cases it is highly desirable to construct univariate decision trees in reasonable time. This may be accomplished by parallelizing univariate decision tree algorithms. In this paper, we first present two different univariate decision tree algorithms C4.5 and univariate linear discriminant tree. We show how to parallelize these algorithms in three ways: (i) feature based; (ii) node based; (iii) data based manners. Experimental results show that performance of the parallelizations highly depend on the dataset and the node based parallelization demonstrate good speedups. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This is largely due to the introduction of more sophisticated data collection tools and the possibility of observing large datasets at increased higher frequencies. This paper aims to investigate the current methodologies used for the detection of time series discord sub-sequences and especially those with periodicity. A strategy will be suggested to use classical data mining techniques and statistical decision making to take advantage of the special features of the time series to make the detection more efficient and more objective. An entropy-based measure will also be introduced as an alternative to the Euclidean distance measure for identifying discord sub-sequences.

A SOM-based data mining strategy for adaptive modelling of an offset lithographic printing process	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						adaptive modelling; data mining; self-organizing map; committee; neural networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ONLINE; COMBINATION	This paper is concerned with a SOM-based data mining strategy for adaptive modelling of a slowly varying process. The aim is to follow the process in a way that makes a representative up-to-date data set of a reasonable size available at any time. The technique developed allows analysis and filtering of redundant data, detection of the need to update the process models and the core-module of the system itself and creation of process models of adaptive, data-dependent complexity. Experimental investigations performed using data from a slowly varying offset lithographic printing process have shown that the tools developed can follow the process and make the necessary adaptations of the data set and the process models. A low-process modelling error has been obtained by employing data-dependent committees for modelling the process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, XJ				Huang, Xiangji			Comparison of interestingness measures for web usage mining: An empirical study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						web log mining; interestingness measures; association rule mining; sequential pattern mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	A common problem in mining association rules or sequential patterns is that a large number of rules or patterns can be generated from a database, making it impossible for a human analyst to digest the results. Solutions to the problem include, among others, using interestingness measures to identify interesting rules or patterns and pruning rules that are considered redundant. Various interestingness measures have been proposed, but little work has been reported on the effectiveness of the measures on real-world applications. We present an application of Web usage mining to a large collection of Livelink log data. Livelink is a web-based product of Open Text Corporation, which provides automatic management and retrieval of different types of information objects over an intranet, an extranet or the Internet. We report our experience in preprocessing raw log data, mining association rules and sequential patterns from the log data, and identifying interesting rules and patterns by use of interestingness measures and some pruning methods. In particular, we evaluate a number of interestingness measures in terms of their effectiveness in finding interesting association rules and sequential patterns. Our results show that some measures are much more effective than others.

The proposal is motivated by the idea that the selection process of candidates in the splitting point selection can be made more flexible as to achieve a faster computation while retaining classification accuracy. We compare the performance of the HPM against Fayyad's method, as the latter is the improved version of the standard C4.5 algorithm on the search of splitting points. We demonstrate that HPM is more efficient, in some cases by as much as 50%, while producing essentially the same classification for six different data sets. Our result supports the relaxation of instance boundaries (RIB) as a valid approach that can be explored to achieve more efficient computations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We analyze both the computational and the security aspects of the algorithms. The algorithms inherit the excellent generalization performance of AdaBoost. Experiments indicate that the algorithms are better than AdaBoost executed separately by the participants, and that, independently of the number of participants, they perform close to AdaBoost executed using the entire data set.

Mining this flow makes it necessary to cope with uncertainty, as only a part of the stream can be stored. In this paper, we evaluate a statistical technique which biases the estimation of the support of patterns, so as to maximize either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the degradation of the other criterion. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed tend to demonstrate its potential, as it remains robust even under significant distribution drifts. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Standard data-mining techniques typically assume that records can be accessed multiple times and so do not naturally extend to streaming data. Algorithms for mining streams must be able to extract all necessary information from records with only one, or perhaps a few, passes over the data. We present the Streaming Random Forests algorithm, an online and incremental stream classification algorithm that extends Breiman's Random Forests algorithm. The Streaming Random Forests algorithm grows multiple decision trees, and classifies unlabelled records based on the plurality of tree votes. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the Streaming Random Forests algorithm on several datasets, and show that its accuracy is comparable to the standard Random Forest algorithm.

This transition from a stand-alone technology, in the control of the knowledgeable few, to a widely accessible and usable technology will require the development of standards. These standards need to be designed to address various aspects of KD ranging from the actual process of applying the technology in a business environment, so as to make the process more transparent and repeatable, through to the representation of knowledge generated and the support for application developers. The large variety of data and model formats that researchers and practitioners have to deal with and the lack of procedural support in KD have prompted a number of standardization efforts in recent years, led by industry and supported by the KD community at large. This paper provides an overview of the most prominent of these standards and highlights how they relate to each other using some example applications of these standards.

In recent years the theoretical computer science community has generated a number of approximation algorithms for consensus clustering and similar problems. These algorithms run in polynomial time, with performance guaranteed to be at most a certain factor worse than optimal. We investigate the feasibility of the approximation algorithms, in an attempt to link data-mining and theoretical research. On realistic data sets, algorithms with quadratic running times are impractical. Unfortunately these and even worse running times are typical of approximation algorithms. To circumvent this, we sample from the data, run the "slow" algorithms on the sample, and then build a consensus clustering from the seed sample clustering, using a range of techniques. These unsampling techniques are in fact almost as good at creating consensus partitionings as the approximation and data-mining algorithms themselves. We find that one of the latest approximation algorithms is not only fast and effective, but also easy to describe, making it an ideal choice.

Classification models are built by using underlying data. In principle, the models built with more data yield better results. However, the relationship between the available data and the performance is not well understood, except that the accuracy of a classification model has diminishing improvements as a function of data size. In this paper, we present an approach for an early assessment of the extracted knowledge (classification models) in the terms of performance (accuracy), based on the amount of data used. The assessment is based on the observation of the performance on smaller sample sizes. The solution is formally defined and used in an experiment. In experiments we show the correctness and utility of the approach.

This recognition process is based on domain-specific knowledge that can be acquired automatically by applying data mining techniques. The spatial dimension of page layout makes classification methods developed in inductive logic programming (ILP) and multi-relational data mining (MRDM) the most suitable candidates for this specific task. In this paper, both approaches are considered and empirically compared on three different data sets consisting of multi-page articles published in an international journal and historical documents. The ILP method is able to learn recursive logical theories that express dependencies between logical components, while the MRDM method extends the naive Bayesian classifier to data stored in multiple tables of a relational database. Experimental results confirm the importance of the spatial dimension for this application and show that the ILP method tends to be conservative with a high ( low) percentage of omission ( commission) errors, while the probabilistic nature of the MRDM method allows us to tradeoff between the two types of error.

Due to inherent noise or data diversity, it is crucial to address the issue of approximation, if one wants to mine patterns that are potentially interesting with tolerable variations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network and propose a method called gApprox. gApprox not only finds approximate network patterns, which is the key for many knowledge discovery applications on structural data, but also enriches the library of graph mining methodologies by introducing several novel techniques such as: (1) a complete and redundancy-free strategy to explore the new pattern space faced by gApprox; and (2) transform "frequent in an approximate sense" into an anti-monotonic constraint so that it can be pushed deep into the mining process. Systematic empirical studies on both real and synthetic data sets show that frequent approximate patterns mined from the worm protein-protein interaction network are biologically interesting and gApprox is both effective and efficient.

We describe a new metadata approach to elicit semantic information from environmental data and implement semantics-based techniques to assist users in integrating, navigating, and mining multiple environmental data sources. Our system contains specifications of various environmental data sources and the relationships that are formed among them. User requests are augmented with semantically related data sources and automatically presented as a visual semantic network. In addition, we present a methodology for data navigation and pattern discovery using multi-resolution browsing and data mining. The data semantics are captured and utilized in terms of their patterns and trends at multiple levels of resolution. We present the efficacy of our methodology through experimental results.

Effective and dependable selection procedures are of vital importance to machine learning and data mining. The suggested approach is based on the multiple agent paradigm. The authors propose using JABAT middleware as a tool and the original instance reduction procedure as a method for selecting reference vectors under multiple objectives. The paper contains a brief introduction to the multiple objective optimization, followed by the formulation of the multiple-objective, agent-based, reference vectors selection optimization problem. Further sections of the paper provide details on the proposed algorithm generating a non-dominated (or Pareto-optimal) set of reference vector sets. To validate the approach the computational experiment has been planned and carried out. Presentation and discussion of experiment results conclude the paper.

Efficient Incremental Constrained Clustering	KDD-2007 PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	AUG 12-15, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Clustering; Constraints; Algorithms		Clustering with constraints is an emerging area of data mining research. However, most work assumes that the con straints are given as one large batch. In this paper we explore the situation where the constraints are incrementally given. In this way the user after seeing a clustering can provide positive and negative feedback via constraints to critique a clustering solution. We consider the problem of efficiently updating a clustering to satisfy the new and old constraints rather than re-clustering the entire data set. We show that the problem of incremental clustering under constraints is NP-hard in general, but identify several sufficient conditions which lead to efficiently solvable versions. These translate into a set of rules on the types of constraints that can be added and constraint set properties that must be maintained. We demonstrate that this approach is more efficient than re-clustering the entire data set and has several other advantages.	[Davidson, Ian; Ravi, S.

J	Eberle, W; Holder, L				Eberle, William; Holder, Lawrence			Anomaly detection in data represented as graphs	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						graph-based anomaly detection; minimum description length principle; information theoretic compression		An important area of data mining is anomaly detection, particularly for fraud. However, little work has been done in terms of detecting anomalies in data that is represented as a graph. In this paper we present graph-based approaches to uncovering anomalies in domains where the anomalies consist of unexpected entity/relationship alterations that closely resemble non-anomalous behavior. We have developed three algorithms for the purpose of detecting anomalies in all three types of possible graph changes: label modifications, vertex/edge insertions and vertex/edge deletions. Each of our algorithms focuses on one of these anomalous types, using the minimum description length principle to first discover the normative pattern. Once the common pattern is known, each algorithm then uses a different approach to discover particular anomalous types. In this paper, we validate all three approaches using synthetic data, verifying that each of the algorithms on graphs and anomalies of varying sizes, are able to detect the anomalies with very high detection rates and minimal false positives. We then further validate the algorithms using real-world cargo data and actual fraud scenarios injected into the data set with 100% accuracy and no false positives. Each of these algorithms demonstrates the usefulness of examining a graph-based representation of data for the purposes of detecting fraud.

The new ensemble was designed with a two-level architecture to improve the generalization ability. The new incoming cases are first bootstrapped to generate data as inputs to the first level classical learning classifier systems. The second level contains a plurality-vote module to determine the final classification by combining the classification results of the first level learning classifier systems. Each learning classifier system in the first level consists of two major modules, a genetic algorithm module for facilitating rule-discovery and a reinforcement learning module for adjusting the strength of the corresponding rules when rewards are received from the environment. We propose a revised Wilson's compact rule algorithm for generation of the compact rule set from the population set to improve the readability of the model. Two experiments were conducted. One was data mining of medical data and the other was steganalysis of images. The experimental results have shown that the new ensemble produced better performance on incremental data mining and better generalization than the single learning classifier system and other supervised learning methods. The results also showed that the compact rules were more interpretable.

In decision tree approach is most useful in classification problem. With this technique, tree is constructed to model the classification process. There are two basic steps in the technique: building the tree and applying the tree to the database. This paper describes a proposed C5.0 classifier that performs rulesets, cross validation and boosting for original C5.0 in order to reduce the optimization of error ratio. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of medial data set like hypothyroid. It is shown that, the performance of a classifier on the training cases from which it was constructed gives a poor estimate by sampling or using a separate test file, either way, the classifier-is evaluated on cases that were not used to build and evaluate the classifier are both are large. If the cases in hypothyroid.data and hypothyroid.test were to be shuffled and divided into a new 2772 case training set and a 1000 case test set, C5.0 might construct a different classifier with a lower or higher error rate on the test cases. An important feature of sees is its ability to classifiers called rulesets. The ruleset has an error rate 0.5% on the test cases. The standard errors of the means provide an estimate of the variability of results. One way to get a more reliable estimate of predictive is by f-fold -cross- validation. The error rate of a classifier produced from all the cases is estimated as the ratio of the total number of errors on the hold-out cases to the total number of cases. The Boost option with x trials instructs Sees to construct up to x classifiers in this manner. Trials over numerous datasets, large and small, show that on average 10-classifier boosting reduces the error rate for test cases by about 25%.

Neighborhood graphs are interesting representations of this problem in a multidimensional space. However, several problems related to neighborhood graphs are under research and require detailed work to solve them. These problems are mainly related to their high construction costs and to their updating difficulties.

Some studies showed a positive relationship between HRT and breast cancer onset, but other studies have not confirmed, these results. To clarify the contradictory outcomes in the relationships between HRT and the onset of breast cancer, we have designed an intelligent data mining model (IDM), which is able to find proper prognostic factors for cancer onset and provides alternate measures in interpretation of outcome of clinical data through hierarchies of attributes. Methods: Based on the selection criteria, we selected 22 sets of random and case-control studies of the last 15 years, which identified any involvements of HRT with breast cancer. We analyzed the relationship between HRT and breast cancer using an IDM model consisting of data mining algorithms and public domain data mining tools. Prognostic factors which underline the for etiological dispositions of breast cancer were identified. Results: The variables which are closely associated with cancer onset to some degree are age 60-69, age at menopause oophorectomy. An implementation of IDM model on overall pooled data indicated that there is no significant relationship between breast cancer onset and HRT. It is suggested that HRT patients with specific physiological and pathological conditions related with the higher ranks of prognostic factors may have a greater chance to get breast cancer. Conclusion: The results of this study may guide biomedical research directed at establishing the causal relationships between various medications and their complications, allowing an accurate assessment of efficacy and side effects of new therapeutic treatment in clinical trials without reliance on a large control population.

Organizations' critical crises can induce severe consequences or even disasters if wrong decisions are made. The World Wide Web provides an unprecedented freedom for the public to discuss one's opinions which impact much on the progress of the crisis. Based on the study of web mining and its relative techniques, a combined web mining model was presented. It consists of web mining, text mining, data mining and human experience knowledge. All knowledge from each part was saved in database through a knowledge management platform. Its application shows that utilizing the combined model for crisis management can improve the quality of decisions.

This paper also describes a practical application in the field of Data Mining. This application is the Iris flower classification problem. This problem has already been extensively studied with other techniques, and therefore this allows the comparison with other tools. Results show how this technique improves the results obtained with other techniques. Moreover, the obtained networks are simpler than the existing ones, with a lower number of hidden neurons and connections, and the additional advantage that there has been a discrimination of the input variables. As it is explained in the text, this variable discrimination gives new knowledge to the problem, since now it is possible to know which variables are important to achieve good results.

In this paper we propose a novel ensemble method to combine a finite number of Self Organizing Maps, we called this model Fusion-SOM. In the fusion process the nodes with similar Voronoi polygons are merged in one fused node and the neighborhood relation is given by links that measures the similarity between these fused nodes. The aim of combining the SOM is to improve the quality and robustness of the topological representation of the single model. Computational experiments show that the Fusion-SOM model effectively preserves the topology of the input space and improves the representation of the single SOM. We report the performance results using synthetic and real datasets, the latter obtained from a benchmark site.

Various approaches to intrusion detection are currently being used, but they are relatively ineffective. Artificial Intelligence plays a driving role in security services. This paper proposes a dynamic model of intelligent intrusion detection system, based on a specific AI approach for intrusion detection. The techniques that are being investigated include fuzzy logic with network profiling, which uses simple data mining techniques to process the network data. The proposed hybrid system combines anomaly and misuse detection. Simple fuzzy rules allow us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We use DARPA dataset for training and benchmarking.

Using available expert knowledge in conjunction with a structured process of data mining, thresholds associated with features representing each stage of a CB's operation may be defined and used to characterize varying states of the CB condition. The knowledge and understanding of the satisfactory and unsatisfactory breaker condition can be gained and made explicit from the analysis of captured trip signature data and subsequently used to form the basis of condition assessment and diagnostic rules implemented in a decision support system, used to inform condition-based decisions affecting CB maintenance. This paper proposes a data mining method for the analysis of condition monitoring data, and demonstrates this method in its discovery of useful knowledge from trip coil data captured from a population of Scottish Power - Energy Networks' in-service CBs. This knowledge then forms the basis of a decision support system for the condition assessment of these CBs during routine trip testing.

However, the rule generation procedure is very time-consuming when encountering large data set. Besides, traditional classifier building is organized in several separate phases which may also degrade the efficiency of these approaches. In this paper, a new class based associative classification approach (CACA) is proposed. The class label is taken good advantage of in the rule mining step so as to cut down the searching space. The proposed algorithm also synchronize the rule generation and classifier building phases, shrinking the rule mining space when building the classifier to help speed up the rule generation.

J	Tatti, N				Tatti, Nikolaj			Distances between data sets based on summary statistics	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						data mining theory; complex data; binary data; itemsets		The concepts of similarity and distance are crucial in data mining. We consider the problem of defining the distance between two data sets by comparing summary statistics computed from the data sets. The initial definition of our distance is based on geometrical notions of certain sets of distributions. We show that this distance can be computed in cubic time and that it has several intuitive properties. We also show that this distance is the unique Mahalanobis distance satisfying certain assumptions. We also demonstrate that if we are dealing with binary data sets, then the distance can be represented naturally by certain parity functions, and that it can be evaluated in linear time. Our empirical tests with real world data show that the distance works well.

Clique is a popular model to represent dense structures, and widely used because of its simplicity and ease in handling. Pseudo cliques are natural extension of cliques which are subgraphs obtained by removing small number of edges from cliques. We here define a pseudo clique by a subgraph such that the ratio of the number of its edges compared to that of the clique with the same number of vertices is no less than a given threshold value. In this paper, we address the problem of enumerating all pseudo cliques for given a graph and a threshold value. We first show that it seems to be difficult to obtain polynomial time algorithms using straightforward divide and conquer approaches. Then, we propose a polynomial time, polynomial delay in precise, algorithm based on reverse search. We show the efficiency of our algorithm in practice by computational experiments.

Detection of change over time is a prime example, comparing databases from two branches is another one. The key problem is to discover the patterns that describe the difference. Emerging patterns provide only a partial answer to this question. In previous work, we showed that the data distribution can be captured in a pattern-based model using compression [12]. Here, we extend this approach to define a generic dissimilarity measure on databases. Moreover, we show that this approach can identify those patterns that characterise the differences between two distributions. Experimental results show that our method provides a well-founded way to independently measure database dissimilarity that allows for thorough inspection of the actual differences. This illustrates the use of our approach in real world data mining.

It creates unprecedented opportunities for laxge-scale knowledge discovery from database. Data mining (DM) technology has emerged as a means of performing this discovery. It is a useful tool in many fields such as marketing, decision making, etc. There are countless researchers working on designing efficient data mining techniques, methods, and algorithms. Unfortunately, most data mining researchers pay much attention to technique problems for developing data mining models and methods, while little to basic issues of data mining. What is data mining? What is the product of a data mining process? What are we doing in a data mining process? What is the rule we should obey in a data mining process? In this paper, we will address these questions and propose our answers based on a conceptual data mining model. Our answer would be "data mining is a process of knowledge transformation". It is consistent with the process of human knowledge understanding. Based on analysis of the user-driven and "data-driven" data mining approaches proposed by many other researchers, a conceptual knowledge transformation model and a conceptual domain-oriented data-driven data mining (3DM) model are proposed. It integrates user-driven data mining and data-driven data mining into one system. Some future works for developing such a 3DM data mining system are proposed.

Consumers who concern about the environment are increasing. Promotion of green products has been recognized as a basic method of solving resource waste and improving environment pollution. Since this kind of products and traditional product exit in the market simultaneously in the early stage of development, production resources for serving green products are relatively limited and it causes the inconvenience and higher price for obtaining a green product. Therefore, it is an important subject that how to identify customers who are willing, to pay more or sacrifice his/her convenience. Through the affirmation of the target customers and through the perfect marketing channel through an effective tracing system, enterprises can really transmit the selling information to the users who are willing to buy and enable the enterprises to recycle the used products effectively and make more profit. In this study, we applied data mining techniques to cope with this problem; a list of questionnaires was performed to carry out the preferences of the customers' behavior and preferences. After clustering the customers, a bi-objective nonlinear problem was constructed with MAUT, the target customers can be found to be the foundation of marketing for selling the right goods to the right person in a correct way.

Classification is the topic of a dialogue game between two agents, based on an argument scheme and critical questions designed for use by agents whose knowledge of the domain comes from data mining. Each agent has its own set of examples which it can mine to find arguments based on association rules for and against a classification of a new instance. These arguments are exchanged in order to classify the instance. We describe the dialogue game, and in particular discuss the strategic considerations which agents can use to select their moves.

J	Wu, Q; Bell, DA; Prasad, G; McGinnity, TM				Wu, QingXiang; Bell, David A.; Prasad, Girijesh; McGinnity, Thomas Martin			A distribution-index-based discretizer for decision-making with symbolic AI approaches	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; information theory; decision support	ATTRIBUTES	When symbolic AI approaches are applied to handle continuous valued attributes, there is a requirement to transform the continuous attribute values to symbolic data. In this paper, a novel distribution-index-based discretizer is proposed for such a transformation. Based on definitions of dichotomic entropy and a compound distributional index, a simple criterion is applied to discretize continuous attributes adaptively. The dichotomic entropy indicates the homogeneity degree of the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine the best splitting point. The compound distributional index combines both the homogeneity degrees of attribute value distributions and the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine which interval should be split further; thus, a potentially improved solution of the discretization problem can be found efficiently. Based on multiple reducts in rough set theory, a multiknowledge approach can attain high decision accuracy for information systems with a large number of attributes and missing values. In this paper, our discretizer is combined with the multiknowledge approach to further improve decision accuracy for information systems with continuous attributes. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new discretizer can improve not only the multiknowledge approach, but also the naive Bayes classifier and the C5.0 tree.

Behavior scoring models have been widely used by financial institutions to forecast customer's future credit performance. In this paper, a hybrid GA+SVM model, which uses genetic algorithm (GA) to search the promising subsets of features and multi-class support vector machines (SVM) to make behavior scoring prediction, is presented. A real life credit data set in a major Chinese commercial bank is selected as the experimental data to compare the classification accuracy rate with other traditional behavior scoring models. The experimental results show that GA+SVM can obtain better performance than other models.

Complex events are sets of data points that correspond to interesting or unusual patterns in the underlying phenomenon that the network monitors. Our approach is inspired from time-series data mining techniques and transforms a stream of real-valued sensor readings into a symbolic representation. Complex event detection is then performed using distance metrics, allowing us to detect events that are difficult or even impossible to describe using traditional declarative SQL-like languages and thresholds. We have tested our approach with four distinct data sets and the experimental results were encouraging in all cases. We have implemented our approach for the TinyOS and Contiki Operating Systems, for the Sky mote platform.

These research efforts largely assumed that XML documents are static. However, in reality, the documents are rarely static. In this paper, we propose a novel research problem called XML structural delta mining. The objective of XML structural delta mining is to discover knowledge by analyzing structural evolution pattern (also called structural delta) of history of XML documents. Unlike existing approaches, XML structural delta mining focuses on the dynamic and temporal features of XML data. Furthermore, the data source for this novel mining technique is a sequence of historical versions of an XML document rather than a set of snapshot XML documents. Such mining technique can be useful in many applications such as change detection for very large XML documents, efficient XML indexing, XML search engine, etc. Our aim in this paper is not to provide a specific solution to a particular mining problem. Rather, we present the vision of the mining framework and present the issues and challenges for three types of XML structural delta mining: identifying various interesting structures, discovering association rules from structural deltas, and structural change pattern-based classification.

J	Jiang, WX				Jiang, Wenxin			On the consistency of Bayesian variable selection for high dimensional binary regression and classification	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; GENE SELECTION; CONVERGENCE; MODELS; RATES	Modern data mining and bioinformatics have presented an important playground for statistical learning techniques, where the number of input variables is possibly much larger than the sample size of the training data. In supervised learning, logistic regression or probit regression can be used to model a binary output and form perceptron classification rules based on Bayesian inference. We use a prior to select a limited number of candidate variables to enter the model, applying a popular method with selection indicators. We show that this approach can induce posterior estimates of the regression functions that are consistently estimating the truth, if the true regression model is sparse in the sense that the aggregated size of the regression coefficients are bounded. The estimated regression functions therefore can also produce consistent classifiers that are asymptotically optimal for predicting future binary outputs. These provide theoretical justifications for some recent empirical successes in microarray data analysis.

J	Marascu, A; Masseglia, F				Marascu, Alice; Masseglia, Florent			Mining sequential patterns from data streams: a centroid approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data streams; sequential patterns; Web usage mining; clustering sequences; alignment		In recent years, emerging applications introduced new constraints for data mining methods. These constraints are typical of a new kind of data: the data streams. In data stream processing, memory usage is restricted, new elements are generated continuously and have to be considered in a linear time, no blocking operator can be performed and the data can be examined only once. At this time, only a few methods has been proposed for mining sequential patterns in data streams. We argue that the main reason is the combinatory phenomenon related to sequential pattern mining. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on sequences alignment for mining approximate sequential patterns in Web usage data streams. To meet the constraint of one scan, a greedy clustering algorithm associated to an alignment method is proposed. We will show that our proposal is able to extract relevant sequences with very low thresholds.

Privacy, however, is a concern. In many situations it is required that data mining should be conducted without any privacy being violated. In response to this requirement, in this paper we propose an effective distributed privacy-preserving data mining approach called SDDM. SDDM is characterized by its ability to resist collusion.

J	Yang, GZ				Yang, Guizhen			Computational aspects of mining maximal frequent patterns	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; complexity; maximal frequent patterns; #P-complete	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; COMPLEXITY	In this paper we study the complexity-theoretic aspects of mining maximal frequent patterns, from the perspective of counting the number of all distinct solutions. We present the first formal proof that the problem of counting the number of maximal frequent itemsets in a database of transactions, given an arbitrary support threshold, is #P-complete, thereby providing theoretical evidence that the problem of mining maximal frequent itemsets is NP-hard. We also extend our complexity analysis to other similar data mining problems that deal with complex data structures, such as sequences, trees, and graphs. We investigate several variants of these mining problems in which the patterns of interest are subsequences, subtrees, or subgraphs, and show that the associated problems of counting the number of maximal frequent patterns are all either #P-complete or #P-hard.

J	Asano, Y; Nishizeki, T; Toyoda, M; Kitsuregawa, M				Asano, Yasuhito; Nishizeki, Takao; Toyoda, Masashi; Kitsuregawa, Masaru			Mining communities on the web using a max-flow and a site-oriented framework	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						web; data mining; site; max-flow; site-oriented framework		There are several methods for mining communities on the Web using hyperlinks. One of the well-known ones is a max-flow based method proposed by Flake et al. The method adopts a page-oriented framework, that is, it uses a page on the Web as a unit of information, like other methods including HITS and trawling. Recently, Asano et al. built a site-oriented framework which uses a site as a unit of information, and they experimentally showed that trawling on the site-oriented framework often outputs significantly better communities than trawling on the page-oriented framework. However, it has not been known whether the site-oriented framework is effective in mining communities through the max-flow based method. In this paper, we first point out several problems of the max-flow based method, mainly owing to the page-oriented framework, and then propose solutions to the problems by utilizing several advantages of the site-oriented framework. Computational experiments reveal that our max-flow based method on the site-oriented framework is very effective in mining communities, related to the topics of given pages, in comparison with the original max-flow based method on the page-oriented framework.

J	Li, JY; Jones, J				Li, Jiuyong; Jones, Jason			Using multiple and negative target rules to make classifiers more understandable	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						classification; association rules; negative and multiple rules		One major goal for data mining is to understand data. Rule based methods are better than other methods in making mining results comprehensible. However, current rule based classifiers make use of a small number of rules and a default prediction to build a concise predictive model. This reduces the explanatory ability of the rule based classifier. In this paper, we propose to use multiple and negative target rules to improve explanatory ability of rule based classifiers. We show experimentally that this understandability is not at the cost of accuracy of rule based classifiers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yukizane, T; Ohi, S; Miyano, E; Hirose, H				Yukizane, Takahiro; Ohi, Shin-ya; Miyano, Eiji; Hirose, Hideo			The bump hunting method using the genetic algorithm with the extreme-value statistics	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; data science; bump hunting; genetic algorithm; extreme-value statistics; trade-off curve; decision tree; bootstrap		In difficult classification problems of the z-dimensional points into two groups giving 0-1 responses due to the messy data structure, we try to find the denser regions for the favorable customers of response 1, instead of finding the boundaries to separate the two groups. Such regions are called the bumps, and finding the boundaries of the bumps is called the bump hunting. The main objective of this paper is to find the largest region of the bumps under a specified ratio of the number of the points of response 1 to the total. Then, we may obtain a trade-off curve between the number of points of response 1 and the specified ratio. The decision tree method with the Gini's index will provide the simple-shaped boundaries for the bumps if the marginal density for response 1 shows a rather simple or monotonic shape. Since the computing time searching for the optimal trees will cost much because of the NP-hardness of the problem, some random search methods, e.g., the genetic algorithm adapted to the tree, are useful. Due to the existence of many local maxima unlike the ordinary genetic algorithm search results, the extreme-value statistics will be useful to estimate the global optimum number of captured points; this also guarantees the accuracy of the semi-optimal solution with the simple descriptive rules. This combined method of genetic algorithm search and extreme-value statistics use is new. We apply this method to some artificial messy data case which mimics the real customer database, showing a successful result. The reliability of the solution is discussed.

J	Alhammady, H; Ramamohanarao, K				Alhammady, H; Ramamohanarao, K			Using emerging patterns to construct weighted decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						classification; data mining		Decision trees (DTs) represent one of the most important and popular solutions to the problem of classification. They have been shown to have excellent performance in the field of data mining and machine learning. However, the problem of DTs is that they are built using data instances assigned to crisp classes. In this paper, we generalize decision trees so that they can take into account weighted classes assigned to the training data instances. Moreover, we propose a novel method for discovering weights for the training instances. Our method is based on emerging patterns (EPs). EPs are those itemsets whose supports ( probabilities) in one class are significantly higher than their supports ( probabilities) in the other classes. Our experimental evaluation shows that the new proposed method has good performance and excellent noise tolerance.

A new user mobility oriented predictive scheme called PCAC-RR is proposed for call admission control and resource reservation. The main goal is to reduce the call dropping probability and the call blocking probability, and to maximize the bandwidth utilization. By analyzing the previous movements of the mobile users, we generate local and global mobility profiles for mobile users, which are utilized effectively in the prediction of the future path of a mobile user. Extensive simulation is used to study the performance of the proposed technique and to compare its performance with other two techniques: FR-CAT2 and PR-CAT4. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a significantly better performance compared to the other two schemes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bichindaritz, I; Akkineni, S				Bichindaritz, I; Akkineni, S			Concept mining for indexing medical literature	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; text mining; concept learning; medical informatics	COMPLEMENTARY LITERATURES; DISCOVERY; RETRIEVAL	This article addresses the task of mining concepts from biomedical literature to index and search through a documents base. This research takes place within the Telemakus project, which has for goal to support and facilitate the knowledge discovery process by providing retrieval, visual, and interaction tools to mine and map research findings from research literature in the field of aging. A concept mining component automating research findings extraction such as the one presented here, would permit Telemakus to be efficiently applied to other domains. The main strategy that has been followed in this project has been to mine front the legends of the documents the research findings as relationships between concepts from the medical literature. The concept mining proceeds through stages of syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, relationships building, and ranking. Evaluation results are presented at the end and show that the system learns concepts and relationships between them with good recall, and that these concepts can be used for indexing the documents. Future improvements of the system are also presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, CC; Liang, WY				Huang, Chun-Che; Liang, Wen Yau			Explication and sharing of design knowledge through a novel product design approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						data mining; data warehouse/data mart; knowledge management; modular products; product design; web services	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; EXPERT-SYSTEM; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT	At the beginning of the 21st century, the emergence of knowledge management is viewed as a natural evolution. Knowledge management is defined as the formal management of knowledge for facilitating creation, access, and reuse of knowledge, typically by using advanced technology. To be easily communicated and shared, tacit knowledge has to be explicated as explicit knowledge (e.g., in product specification or a scientific formula or production rules); and this explicit knowledge has to be shared as applicable data through the use of information technology. Product design is such a business process that a great part of the design knowledge is often a tacit type, being difficult to share, or available only in forms of natural language documents. However, the expertise recorded in these documents is an essential resource of successful competition in the market. This paper presents a knowledge explication and sharing approach; specifically focusing on the knowledge management of modular product design. The solution approach involves modeling modular products, formulating the explicit knowledge, discovering new design knowledge with data mining, and sharing the knowledge with web services technology. The proposed approach is to be applied to an actual case of motherboard design/assembly in one of the largest PC manufacturing enterprises.

It has been shown that an is an element of-approximate summary can be maintained so that, given a quantile query d (phi, is an element of), the data item at rank [phi N] may be approximately obtained within the rank error precision is an element of N over all N data items in a data stream or in a sliding window. However, scalable online processing of massive continuous quantile queries with different phi and is an element of poses a new challenge because the summary is continuously updated with new arrivals of data items. In this paper, first we aim to dramatically reduce the number of distinct query results by grouping a set of different queries into a cluster so that they can be processed virtually as a single query while the precision requirements from users can be retained. Second, we aim to minimize the total query processing costs. Efficient algorithms are developed to minimize the total number of times for reprocessing clusters and to produce the minimum number of clusters, respectively. The techniques are extended to maintain near-optimal clustering when queries are registered and removed in an arbitrary fashion against whole data streams or sliding windows. In addition to theoretical analysis, our performance study indicates that the proposed techniques are indeed scalable with respect to the number of input queries as well as the number of items and the item arrival rate in a data stream.

This research is part of a long-term study to examine systematically CRM factors that affect design decisions for CRH data warehouses in order to build a taxonomy of CRM analyses and to determine the impact of those analyses on CRM data warehousing design decisions. This article presents the design implications that CRM poses to data warehousing and then proposes a robust multidimensional starter model that supports CRM analyses. Additional research contributions include the introduction of two new measures, percent success ratio and CRM suitability ratio by which CRM models can be evaluated, the identification of and classification of CRM queries, and a preliminary heuristic for designing data warehouses to support CRM analyses.

The derived scoring function was used to generate a focused set that was screened for alpha 7 nAChR, resulting in the identification of novel alpha 7 ligands easily amenable to chemical modification. Finally, the same scoring function was applied retrospectively to other in-house sets screened for the same target in the same assay. The results and performance of the method are described in detail.

However, the predictive performance of the rules developed by some economic experts in the past has decreased dramatically for the current stock market. In this paper, C4.5 decision tree classification method was adopted to construct a model for stock prediction based on the fundamental stock data, from which a set of stock selection rules was derived. The experimental results showed that the generated rules have exceptional predictive performance. Moreover, it also demonstrated that the C4.5 decision tree classification model can work efficiently on the high noise stock data domain.

Most examples of spatial analysis consider aggregate characteristics over a number of coarsely defined regions rather than point processes. However, criminal events are point processes and should be modeled as such. In this paper, we combine recent advances in discrete choice theory and data mining to develop point process models for spatial analysis. We use this new methodology to analyze and predict the spatial behavior of criminals, and more generally, latent decision makers. The paper compares the performance of this methodology to more traditional hot spot methods of crime analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

This paper focuses on air quality assessment and demonstrates the added value of applying data mining techniques in operational decision-making. More specifically, the application of Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR) classifier is investigated. An enhanced FLR learning algorithm is presented that employs a sigmoid valuation function for introducing tunable non-linearities. The FLR classifier is applied here beyond the unit-hypercube. The FLR with a sigmoid positive valuation function demonstrates an improved performance on a dataset from the region of Valencia, Spain regarding an environmental problem. Descriptive decision-making knowledge (i.e. rules) for classification is also induced.

Agents are distributed and can move through different nodes in a network, so their interactions can occur concurrently and from many different sites. Also, agents are autonomous entities with a variety of possible behaviours, which can evolve. during their lives by adapting to changes in the environment and new interaction patterns. Furthermore, the number of agents can vary during system execution, from a few dozens to thousands or more. Therefore, the number of interactions can be huge and it is difficult to follow up their occurrence and relationships. In order to solve these issues we propose the use of a set of data mining tools, the ACLAnalyser, which processes the results of the execution of large scale multi-agent systems in a monitored environment. This has been integrated with an agent development toolset, the INGENIAS Development Kit, in order to facilitate the verification of multi-agent system models at the design level rather than at the programming level.

Most existing video analysis techniques focus on the low level visual features of video data. However, there is a "semantic gap" between the machine-readable features and the high level human concepts i.e. human understanding of the video content. In this paper, an interactive platform for semantic video mining and retrieval is proposed using Relevance Feedback (RF), a popular technique in the area of Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR). By tracking semantic objects in a video and then modeling spatio-temporal events based on object trajectories and object interactions, the proposed interactive learning algorithm in the platform is able to mine the spatio-temporal data extracted from the video. An iterative learning process is involved in the proposed platform which is guided by the user's response to the retrieved results. Although the proposed video retrieval platform is intended for general use and can be tailored to many applications, we focus on its application in traffic surveillance video database retrieval to demonstrate the design details. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by our experiments on real-life traffic surveillance videos.

The data mining results are used to expand query terms and to re-estimate some of the parameters used in a probabilistic weighting function. We evaluate the data mining based feedback method on the TREC HARD data set. The results show that data mining can be successfully applied to improve the text retrieval performance.

J	Lancieri, L; Durand, N				Lancieri, L; Durand, N			Internet user behavior: Compared study of the access traces and application to the discovery of communities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						data mining; Internet; redundancy; self-similarity; user modeling		With an ever-increasing emphasis on human activity (idea exchange, shopping, gaming, etc.) being mediated through the data network, the understanding of Internet users' behavior has become a rising challenge. Research dealing with the analysis and modeling of Internet user behavior can be roughly split in to two main approaches. The first is based on sociocognitive observation of users' practices in a standardized context. The second approach focuses on the analysis of productions and the traces of users' activity. This paper relates to the latter approach and presents a comparative analysis of Internet navigation traces (URLs versus keywords) to characterize individual or group-of-users' behavior when accessing the Web. The proposed models are based on the study of accesses redundancy seen as global static parameters and from the angle of time evolution. We also study the use of these models, in particular, to categorize a population of users in communities of interests. This study enables us to draw some conclusions on the compared performances of the two kinds of trace exploitation, as raw information, as well as the self-similar properties of the models.

Abundant knowledge exists in historical data but it is hard to find and summarize this in a traditional way. This paper proposes a method of operation optimization based on data mining in a power plant. ne basic structure of the operation optimization based on data mining is established and the improved fuzzy association rule mining is introduced to find the optimization values from the quantitative data in a power plant. Based on the historical data of a 300MW unit, the optimal values of the operating parameters are found by using data mining techniques. The optimal values are provided to guide the operation online and experiment results show that excellent performance is achieved in the power plant.

J	Lin, WY; Tseng, MC				Lin, Wen-Yang; Tseng, Ming-Cheng			Automated support specification for efficient mining of interesting association rules	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; decision support systems; association rules; support specification		In recent years, the weakness of the canonical support-confidence framework for associations mining has been widely studied. One of the difficulties in applying association rules mining is the setting of support constraints. A high-support constraint avoids the combinatorial explosion in discovering frequent itemsets, but at the expense of missing interesting patterns of low support. Instead of seeking a way to set the appropriate support constraints, all current approaches leave the users in charge of the support setting, which, however, puts the users in a dilemma. This paper is an effort to answer this long-standing open question. According to the notion of confidence and lift measures, we propose an automatic support specification for efficiently mining high-confidence and positive-lift associations without consulting the users. Experimental results show that the proposed method is not only good at discovering high-confidence and positive-lift associations, but also effective in reducing spurious frequent itemsets.

Least-squares multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a well known Exploratory Data Analysis family of techniques that produce dissimilarity or distance preserving layouts in a non-linear way. In this framework, the issue of visualizing large multidimensional datasets through MDS-based methods is addressed. An original scheme providing very accurate layouts of large datasets is introduced. It is a compromise between the computational complexity O(N-5/2) and the accuracy of the solution that makes it suitable both for visualization of fairly large datasets and preprocessing in pattern recognition tasks.

In this paper we propose a novel technique for dynamic analysis of software systems to identify the implementation of the software features that are specified through a number offeature-specific task scenarios. The execution of task scenarios and application of data mining algorithm sequential pattern discovery on the generated traces allow us to extract common functionality associated with the corresponding feature-specific task scenarios. The extracted patterns are used to identify the groups of corefunctions that implement software features. The proposed approach can be used for program comprehension andjeature to source code assignment. A case study on the Unix Xfig drawing tool has been provided.

The pipelined data mining approach introduced in [1] using two clustering algorithms in combination with rough sets and extended with genetic programming, is investigated with the purpose of discovering important subsets of attributes in high dimensional data. Their classification ability is described in terms of both collections of rules and analytic functions obtained by genetic programming (gene expression programming). The Leader and several k-means algorithms are used as procedures for attribute set simplification of the information systems later presented to rough sets algorithms. Visual data raining techniques including virtual reality were used for inspecting results. The data mining process is setup using high throughput distributed computing techniques. This approach was applied to Breast Cancer microarray data and it led to subsets of genes with high discrimination power with respect to the decision classes.

Most bird song analysis tools produce a large amount of spectral and temporal attributes from the acoustic signal. The identification of distinctive features has become critical in resource constrained applications such as habitat monitoring by sensor networks. Reducing computational requirements makes affordable to run a classifier on devices with power consumption constraints, such as nodes in a sensor network. Experimental results demonstrate that considerable dimensionality reduction can be achieved without significant loss in classification efficiency.

As there was no fast and effective detection method of suspected SARS cases,this paper proposes a computer aided SARS detection system (CADSARS) based on data mining techniques. 'Typical pneumonia' and SARS X-Ray chest radiographs were collected. Feature extraction of these images was performed after segmenting out pulmonary fields. Feature vectors were then constructed to build rules for the discrimination of SARS and 'typical pneumonia'. Three methods were used to classify these images: C4.5, neural network and CART. Final results show that about 70.94% SARS cases can be detected. ROC charts and confusion matrix by these three methods are given and analyzed. Association rules mining was used to find whether there exists difference of lesions' location between SARS and pneumonia cases.

Data mining techniques have been used extensively as approaches to detect interesting patterns in large databases. In bioinformatics, clustering algorithm technique for data mining can be applied to find underlying genetic and biological interactions, without considering prior information from datasets. However, many clustering algorithms are practically available, and different clustering algorithms may generate dissimilar clustering results due to bio-data characteristics and experimental assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous clustering ensemble scheme that uses a genetic algorithm to generate high quality and robust clustering results with characteristics of bio-data. The proposed method combines results of various clustering algorithms and crossover operation of genetic algorithm, and is founded on the concept of using the evolutionary processes to select the most commonly-inherited characteristics. Our framework proved to be available on real data set and the optimal clustering results generated by means of our proposed method are detailed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better clustering results than applying a single best clustering algorithm.

However, most of the proposed algorithms in time series data mining community belong to the unsupervised approach, without considering the class separability capability of features that is important for classification. In this paper we propose a supervised feature extraction approach by selecting discriminating wavelet coefficients to improve the time series classification accuracy. After wavelet transformation, few wavelet coefficients with higher class separability capability are selected as features. We apply three feature evaluation criteria, i.e., Fisher's discriminant ratio, divergence, and Bhattacharyya distance. Experiments performed on several benchmark time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this trend, Appliance Service Provider (ASP) has distinguished itself by helping manage middle and small enterprises' data, providing appliance Support, and saving supply chain link cost. Through the ASP platform, searching partners and organizing of a supply chain have been in vogue. Thus a special manufacturing resources (MR) retrieval system is paramount for the ASP platform based manufacturing resources management in dynamic environments. In this research, we study manufacturing resources taxonomy, and employ artificial intelligence domain knowledge, then propose a manufacturing resource multi-layer retrieval model. In the paper we also bring forward MR knowledge expression method and way of knowledge database design. The whole I system structure and its working principle are illustrated in the paper.

Most current network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) employ either misuse detection or anomaly detection. However, misuse detection cannot detect unknown intrusions, and anomaly detection usually has high false positive rate. To overcome the limitations of both techniques, we incorporate both anomaly and misuse detection into the NIDS. In this paper, we present our framework of the hybrid system. The system combines the misuse detection and anomaly detection components in which the random forests algorithm is applied. We discuss the advantages of the framework and also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

The de facto standard for reliable data transfers is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Despite improvements in TCP over the years (to reduce overhead and achieve higher throughput), it is still a common experience for the end-to-end data rates of wide area data mining and data analysis applications to be inefficient. This paper introduces a library called SABUL (Simple Available Bandwidth Utilization Library) which merges features of UDP and TCP to produce a light-weight protocol with flow control, rate control and reliable transmission mechanisms that is designed for data intensive applications over wide area high performance networks. In this paper, we describe the library and give experimental evidence of its effectiveness.

Existing data mining algorithms can incrementally mine the sequential patterns from databases with binary values. Temporal transactions with quantitative values are commonly seen in real world applications. In addition, several methods have been proposed for representing uncertain data in a database. In this paper, a fuzzy data mining algorithm for incremental mining of sequential patterns from quantitative databases is proposed. Proposed algorithm called IQSP algorithm uses the fuzzy grid notion to generate fuzzy sequential patterns validated on the updated database containing the transactions in the original database and in the incremental database. It uses the information about sequential patterns that are already mined from original database and avoids start-from-scratch process. Also, it minimizes the number of candidates to check as well as number of scans to original database by identifying the potential sequences in incremental database.

J	Castro, J; Georgiopoulos, M; Demara, R; Gonzalez, A				Castro, J; Georgiopoulos, M; Demara, R; Gonzalez, A			Data-partitioning using the Hilbert space filling curves: Effect on the speed of convergence of Fuzzy ARTMAP for large database problems	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Fuzzy-ARTMAP; Hilbert space-filling curve; data mining; data-partitioning	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; ARCHITECTURE; RECOGNITION	The Fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm has been proven to be one of the premier neural network architectures for classification problems. One of the properties of Fuzzy ARTMAP, which can be both an asset and a liability, is its capacity to produce new nodes (templates) on demand to represent classification categories. This property allows Fuzzy ARTMAP to automatically adapt to the database without having to a priori specify its network size. On the other hand, it has the undesirable side effect that large databases might produce a large network size (node proliferation) that can dramatically slow down the training speed of the algorithm. To address the slow convergence speed of Fuzzy ARTMAP for large database problems, we propose the use of space-filling curves, specifically the Hilbert space-filling curves (HSFC). Hilbert space-filling curves allow us to divide the problem into smaller sub-problems, each focusing on a smaller than the original dataset. For learning each partition of data, a different Fuzzy ARTMAP network is used. Through this divide-and-conquer approach we are avoiding the node proliferation problem, and consequently we speedup Fuzzy ARTMAP's training. Results have been produced for a two-class, 16-dimensional Gaussian data, and on the Forest database, available at the UCI repository. Our results indicate that the Hilbert space-filling curve approach reduces the time that it takes to train Fuzzy ARTMAP without affecting the generalization performance attained by Fuzzy ARTMAP trained on the original large dataset. Given that the resulting smaller datasets that the HSFC approach produces can independently be learned by different Fuzzy ARTMAP networks, we have also implemented and tested a parallel implementation of this approach on a Beowulf cluster of workstations that further speeds up Fuzzy ARTMAP's convergence to a solution for large database problems.

During recent years, visual data mining has become an important tool within the life sciences and drug discovery area with the potential to help avoiding data analysis from turning into a bottleneck. In this paper, we present InfVis, a platform-independent visual data mining tool for chemists, who usually only have little experience with classical data mining, tools, for the visualization, exploration, and analysis of multivariate data sets. InfVis represents multidimensional data sets by using intuitive 3D glyph information visualization techniques. Interactive and dynamic tools such as dynamic query devices allow real-time, interactive data set manipulations and support the user in the identification of relationships and patterns. InfVis has been implemented in Java and Java3D and can be run on a broad range of platforms and operating systems. It can also be embedded as an applet in Web-based interfaces. We will present in this paper examples detailing the analysis of a reaction database that demonstrate how InfVis assists chemists in identifying and extracting hidden information.

The system consists of several modules including a database backbone, brain structure identification and localization, segmentation, registration, visual feature extraction, clustering/classification and query modules. Our newly developed anatomical landmark localization and brain structure identification method facilitates navigation through an image data and extracts useful information for segmentation, registration and query modules. The database stores T1-, T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI and ictal/interictal SPECT modalities with associated clinical data. We confine the visual feature extractors within anatomical structures to support semantically rich content-based procedures. The proposed system serves as a research tool to evaluate a vast number of hypotheses regarding the condition such as resection of the hippocampus with a relatively small volume and high average signal intensity on FLAIR. Once the database is populated, using data mining tools, partially invisible correlations between different modalities of data, modeled in database schema, can be discovered. The design and implementation aspects of the proposed system are the main focus of this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tsumoto, S; Hirano, S				Tsumoto, S; Hirano, S			Automated discovery of chronological patterns in long time-series medical datasets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Data mining in time-series medical databases has been receiving considerable attention because it provides a way of revealing useful information hidden in the database, for example, relationships between the temporal course of examination results and the onset time of diseases. This article presents a new method for finding similar patterns in temporal sequences. The method is a hybridization of phase-constraint multiscale matching and rough clustering. Multiscale matching enables us to cross-scale a comparison of the sequences, namely, it enables us to compare temporal patterns by partially changing observation scales. Rough clustering enables us to construct interpretable clusters of the sequences even if their similarities are given as relative similarities. We combine these methods and cluster the sequences according to the multiscale similarity of patterns. Experimental results on the chronic hepatitis dataset showed that clusters demonstrating interesting temporal patterns were successfully discovered. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present an automatic LCD methodology that adopts statistical measurement functions to discover correlations from databases' attributes. Our methodology automatically pairs attribute groups having potential linear correlations, measures the linear correlation of each pair of attribute groups, and confirms the discovered correlation. The methodology is evaluated in two sets of experiments. The results demonstrate the methodology's ability to facilitate linear correlation discovery for databases with a large amount of data.

We answer this question by providing tight upper bounds, derived from a combinatorial result from the sixties by Kruskal and Katona. Our result is useful to secure existing algorithms from a combinatorial explosion of the number of candidate patterns.

J	Nie, ZQ; Kambhampati, S; Nambiar, U				Nie, ZQ; Kambhampati, S; Nambiar, U			Effectively mining and using coverage and overlap statistics for data integration	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						query optimization for data integration; coverage and overlap statistics; association rule mining		Recent work in data integration has shown the importance of statistical information about the coverage and overlap of sources for efficient query processing. Despite this recognition, there are no effective approaches for learning the needed statistics. The key challenge in learning such statistics is keeping the number of needed statistics low enough to have the storage and learning costs manageable. In this paper, we present a set of connected techniques that estimate the coverage and overlap statistics, while keeping the needed statistics tightly under control. Our approach uses a hierarchical classification of the queries and threshold-based variants of familiar data mining techniques to dynamically decide the level of resolution at which to learn the statistics. We describe the details of our method, and present experimental results demonstrating the efficiency of the learning algorithms and the effectiveness of the learned statistics over both controlled data sources and in the context of BibFinder with autonomous online sources.

The number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched without pushing the constraint into the search. Previous works have pushed antimonotone and monotone constraints. However, many useful constraints are neither antimonotone nor monotone. We consider a general class of aggregate constraints of the form f(v)thetasigma, where f is an arithmetic function of SQL-like aggregates and theta is one of <, &LE;, &GE;, >. We propose a novel pushing technique, called Divide-and-Approximate, to push such constraints. The idea is to recursively divide the search space and approximate the given constraint using antimonotone or monotone constraints in subspaces. This technique applies to a class called separable constraints, which properly contains all constraints built by an arithmetic function f of all SQL aggregates.

We propose a distributed system, named ARES that takes advantage of the use of a multi-relational approach to mine spatial association rules. It supports spatial database coupling and discovery of multi-level spatial association rules as a means for spatial data exploration. We also present some criteria to bias the search and to filter the discovered rules according to user's expectations. Finally, we show the applicability of our proposal to two different real world domains, namely, document image processing and geo-referenced analysis of census data.

In fact, data mining models and patterns, in order to ensure a required statistical significance, represent a large number of individuals and thus conceal individual identities: this is the case of the minimum support threshold in association rule mining. In this paper we show that this belief is ill-founded. By shifting the concept of k-anonymity from data to patterns, we formally characterize the notion of a threat to anonymity in the context of pattern discovery, and provide a methodology to efficiently and effectively identify all possible such threats that might arise from the disclosure of a set of extracted patterns.

A powerful technique for this purpose is the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA-based clustering algorithms are effective when the data sets are found in the same location. In applications where the large data sets are physically far apart, moving huge amounts of data to a single location can become an impractical, or even impossible, task. A way around this problem was proposed in [10], where truncated singular value decompositions (SVDs) are computed locally and used to reduce the communication costs. Unfortunately, truncated SVDs introduce local approximation errors that could add up and would adversely affect the accuracy of the final PCA. In this paper, we introduce a new method to compute the PCA without incurring local approximation errors. In addition, we consider the situation of updating the PCA when new data arrive at the various locations.

A typical important case concerns formal concept mining (i.e., maximal rectangles of true values or associated closed sets by means of the so-called Galois connection). It has been applied with some success to, e.g., gene expression data analysis where objects denote biological situations and attributes denote gene expression properties. However in such real-life application domains, it turns out that the Galois association is a too strong one when considering intrinsically noisy data. It is clear that strong associations that would however accept a bounded number of exceptions would be extremely useful. We study the new pattern domain of &alpha;/&beta; concepts, i.e., consistent maximal bi-sets with less than a false values per row and less than &beta; false values per column. We provide a complete algorithm that computes all the &alpha;/&beta; concepts based on the generation of concept unions pruned thanks to anti-monotonic constraints. An experimental validation on synthetic data is given. It illustrates that more relevant associations can be discovered in noisy data.

This work proposes a sampling-based method to find frequent patterns. The proposed method contains three phases. In the first phase, we draw a small sample of data to estimate the set of frequent patterns, denoted as F-S. The second phase computes the actual supports of the patterns in F-S as well as identifies a subset of patterns in F-S that need to be further examined in the next phase. Finally, the third phase explores this set and finds all missing frequent patterns. The empirical results show that our algorithm is efficient, about two or three times faster than the well-known FP-growth algorithm.

Naive Bayes has been widely used in data mining as a simple and effective classification and ranking algorithm. Since its conditional independence assumption is rarely true, numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve naive Bayes, for example, SBC[1] and TAN[2]. Indeed, the experimental results show that SBC and TAN achieve a significant improvement in term of classification accuracy. However, unfortunately, our experiments also show that SBC and TAN perform even worse than naive Bayes in ranking measured by AUC[3,4](the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). This fact raises the question of whether we can improve Naive Bayes with both accurate classification and ranking? In this paper, responding to this question, we present a new learning algorithm called One Dependence Augmented Naive Bayes(ODANB). Our motivation is to develop a new algorithm to improve Naive Bayes' performance not only on classification measured by accuracy but also on ranking measured by AUC. We experimentally tested our algorithm, using the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka[5], and compared it to Naive Bayes, SBC and TAN. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms significantly in yielding accurate ranking, yet at the same time outperforms all the other algorithms slightly in tern-is of classification accuracy.

As a latest member in distributed computing technology family, the grid computing can play an increasingly important role with the progress of the DDM technology in recent years. This paper analyzed the drawback of existing DDM systems and put forward a service-oriented architecture of DDM on the grid. The mining algorithm and distributed data sets in the proposed framework are abstracted as Web Service Resource (WS-Resource), which can cooperate to perform DDM as required dynamically. Finally, a grid based on local area network was built with Globus Toolkit 4.0Beta and the algorithm of WS-Resource, dataset WS-Resource for data mining on the grid are developed.

Time series discords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. As we will show, discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.

While an extensive research has been carried out for discovering positive patterns, little has been offered for discovering patterns with negation. An amount of frequent patterns with negation is usually huge and exceeds the number of frequent positive patterns by orders of magnitude. The problem can be significantly alleviated by applying the generalized disjunction-free literal sets representation, which is a concise lossless representation of all frequent patterns, both with and without negation. In this paper, we offer new efficient algorithm GDFLR-SO-Apriori for discovering this representation and evaluate it against the GDFLR-Apriori algorithm.

Frequent patterns are used for discovering association rules, episode rules, sequential patterns and clusters. The number of frequent patterns is usually huge. In order to alleviate this problem, a number of lossless representations of frequent patterns have been proposed recently. Theoretical works prove that frequent closed itemsets and models based on generalized disjunction-free sets or non-derivable itemsets are minimal representations of frequent patterns. Experiments prove further that the latter representations are by a few orders of magnitude more concise than the former one. The offered models were intended to represent only frequent patterns without negation. In this article, we offer a lossless representation based on generalized disjunction-free sets that represents frequent patterns both with and without negation. An algorithm for discovering this representation is also provided.

The goal is to group structured objects, i.e. data collected at different sites, such that data inside each cluster models the continuity of socio-economic or geographic environment, while separate clusters model variation over the space. Continuity is evaluated according to the spatial organization arising in data, namely discrete spatial structure, expressing the (spatial) relations between separate sites implicitly defined by their geometrical representation and positioning. Data collected within sites that are (transitively) connected in the discrete spatial structure are clustered together according to the Similarity on multi-relational descriptions representing their internal structure. CORSO is a novel spatial data mining method that resorts to a multi-relational approach to learn relational spatial data and exploits the concept of neighborhood to capture relational constraints embedded in the discrete spatial structure. Relational data are expressed in a first-order formalism and similarity among structured objects is computed as degree of matching with respect to a common generalization. The application to real-world spatial data is reported.

It has practical importance in a wide of variety of applications such as text, web-log and market basket data analysis. Typically, the data that arises in these applications is arranged as a two-way contingency or co-occurrence table. In this paper, we embed the block clustering problem in the mixture approach. We propose a Poisson block mixture model and adopting the classification maximum likelihood principle we perform a new algorithm. Simplicity, fast convergence and scalability are the major advantages of the proposed approach.

One of the most popular approaches to find the information is to extract frequent subtrees from a set of XML trees. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, EXiT-B, for efficiently extracting maximal frequent subtrees from a set of XML documents. The main contribution of our algorithm is that there is no need to perform tree join operation during the phase of generating maximal frequent subtrees. Thus, the task of finding maximal frequent subtrees can be significantly simplified comparing to the previous approaches.

Correspondingly, the typical practice is to store the data on disk in row major order. While this practice is reasonable in many cases, it is not necessarily the best practice when computation is dominated by column-based statistics. This short note discusses the performance tradeoffs between row major and column major storage of data in the context of statistical data analysis. A comparison of a software package utilizing column major storage and one using row major storage confirms our results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This integration contributes to the further progress in both above areas and provides practitioners with a new kind of technology of distributed intelligent systems. However, this integration generates a number of new non-typical problems both in areas, data mining and multi-agent systems. This fact is explicitly confirmed by the tasks of multi-agent distributed learning where new problems are mostly caused by the fact that data mining and learning procedures are always interactive and if learning data are distributed and private then multiple humans supported by distributed software should be involved in these procedures. Therefore, special means are needed to coordinate their activities in order to achieve consistency and integrity of the final solutions. The paper considers one of the key problems of the multi-agent distributed learning: development of the distributed classification systems' ontology. The paper analyzes the basic aspects of this weakly studied though important and challenging problem and proposes several solutions capable to constitute a basis for ontology design technology as applied to distributed data mining, learning and classification.

J	Smith, AD				Smith, AD			Exploring online dating and customer relationship management	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						customer relations; electronic commerce; consumer behaviour	STRATEGY	Purpose - To explore and add insight to the online-dating services phenomena which is the next product and beneficiary of the internet revolution that offers customers a convenient and affordable alternate to traditional methods of dating. Design/methodology/approach - Empirically investigated through conceptual models and statistical methods was the value proposition of online matchmaking services, which boils down to the ability to provide appropriate matches through successfully business-to-customer (B2C) customer service enhanced by the web and based on sound customer relations management practices. Findings - The differentiation of the marketplace includes unique ways to collect user-based information and customized, proprietary algorithms that generate what are believed to be the best matches, based on user and matchmaking service criteria. Online dating services use statistics, data mining, and activity monitoring to provide appropriate matches; thus, differentiating their services and understanding the success of their product offering. Research limitations/implications - The basic strategic business model created by online dating industry that is researched in this paper is built around B2C customer service in a privacy and security conscious environment. Internet dating service providers are gaining increased acceptance though successful use of customized software that helps generate a potential valued-added match for the masses. Practical implications - What most companies do not define as clearly are the many privacy issues and possible protection against the people they may come in contact with through using these services. The industry has to be particular careful about the legal ramifications since much of the information it gathers from its customers must remain private and confidential in order to succeed and gain a larger market share. Originality/value - It is apparent that online dating services are concerned with privacy and confidentiality issues as high priority by management. To date, no academic-based research has surfaced concerning this emerging online industry and the information exchanges required to ensure a safe environment.

Starting from more than 1000 features derived from pitch, energy and MFCC time series, the most relevant features in respect to the data are selected from this set by removing correlated features. The features selected for acted and realistic emotions are analysed and show significant differences. All features are computed automatically and we also contrast automatically with manually units of analysis. A higher degree of automation did not prove to be a disadvantage in terms of recognition accuracy.

There have been two types of privacy proposed concerning data mining. The first type of privacy, called output privacy, is that the data is altered so that the mining result will preserve certain privacy. The second type of privacy, called input privacy, is that the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected. In output privacy, given specific rules to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association, classification and clustering rules have been proposed However, to specify hidden rules, entire data mining process needs to be executed For some applications, we are only interested in hiding certain sensitive predictive rules that contain given items. A predictive association rule set is the smallest rule set that makes the same prediction as the whole association rule set by confidence priority [14]. In this work, we assume that only sensitive items are given and propose two algorithms, ISL (Increase Support of LHS) and DSR (Decrease Support of RHS), to replace data by unknowns in database so that sensitive predicative rules containing specified items on the left hand side of rule cannot be inferred through association rule mining. Examples illustrating the proposed algorithms are given. The characteristics of the algorithms are analyzed The efficiency of the proposed approach is further compared with Saygin etc [22] approach. It is observed that our approach required less number of databases scanning and prune more number of hidden rules. However, our approach must hide all rules containing the hidden items on the left hand side, where Saygin etc approach can hide any specitic rule.

The existing approaches for classification have been developed mainly based on exploring the intrinsic structure of dataset itself, less or no emphasis paid on simulating human sensation and perception. Understanding data is, however, highly relevant to how one senses and perceives the data. In this talk we initiate an approach for classification based on simulating the human visual sensation and perception principle. The core idea is to treat a data set as an image, and to mine the knowledge from the data in accordance with the way we observe and perceive the image. The algorithm, visual classification algorithm (VCA), from the proposed approach is formulated. We provide a series of simulations to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is not only effective but also efficient. In particular, we show that VCA can very often bring a significant reduction of computation effort without loss of prediction capability, as compared with the prevalently adopted SVM approach. The simulations further show that the new approach potentially is very encouraging and useful.

One of the crucial issues is to find a right mixture of them. For discovering this type of knowledge, we consider "rule + exception", or rule-plus-exception, strategies. Results from psychology, expert systems, genetic algorithms, and machine learning and data mining are summarized and compared, and their implications to knowledge management and discovery are examined. The study motivates and establishes a basis for the design and implementation of new algorithms for the discovery of "rule + exception" type knowledge.

With this algorithm, the scans is less in transaction database, only one time in little and middle transaction database, and not more than two times in large database. In the algorithm, when the transaction database is scanned, the transaction items are saved in unit triplet, and the count of every transaction item is saved in 1-dimension array so that the frequent itemsets are generated in memory. So I/O spending is reduced greatly. The experimental results show that our algorithm is very promising.

In this paper we propose the Data Mining Template Library, a collection of generic containers and algorithms for FPM, as well as persistency and database management classes. DMTL provides a systematic solution to a whole class of common FPM tasks like itemset, sequence, tree and graph mining. DMTL is extensible, scalable, and high-performance for rapid response on massive datasets. Our experiments show that DMTL is competitive with special purpose algorithms designed for a particular pattern type, especially as database sizes increase.

D-GridMST employs the notion of a grid to partition the data space involved and uses density criteria to extract representative points from spatial databases, on which a global MST of representatives is constructed. Such an MST is partitioned according to users' clustering specification and used to label data points in the respective distributed spatial database thereafter. D-GridMST is characterized by fast speed, low space requirement and small network transferring overhead. Experimental results show that D-GridMST is effective since it is able to produce exactly the same clustering result as that produced in the centralized paradigm, making D-GridMST a promising tool for clustering large distributed spatial databases.

In terms of multilevel concept, we consider the complex problem that locations and services are of hierarchical structures. We propose a new data mining method named two-dimensional multilevel (2-DML) association rules mining, which can efficiently discover the associated service request patterns by taking into account the multilevel properties of locations and services. The discovered patterns can be effectively utilized in real applications like location-based and personalized services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing this research issue. Some variations of the 2-DML method with different properties in terms of execution efficiency and memory efficiency were also developed. Through empirical' evaluation, the proposed methods are shown to deliver good performance in terms of efficiency and scalability under various system conditions.

In our framework, domain knowledge is represented by way of deductive rules, and data mining algorithms are specified by means of iterative user-defined aggregates and implemented by means of user-defined predicates. This choice allows us to exploit the full expressive power of deductive rules without loosing in performance. Iterative user-defined aggregates have a fixed scheme, in which user-defined predicates are to be added. This feature allows the modularization of data mining algorithms, thus providing a way to integrate the proper domain knowledge exploitation in the right point. As a case study, the paper presents how user-defined aggregates can be exploited to specify and implement a version of the a priori algorithm. Some performance analyzes and comparisons are discussed in order to show the effectiveness of the approach.

In particular, the addition of a granularity dimension to a temporal logic makes it possible to specify in a concise way reactive systems whose behaviour can be naturally modeled with respect to a (possibly infinite) set of differently-grained temporal domains. Suitable extensions of the monadic second-order theory of k successors have been proposed in the literature to capture the notion of time granularity. In this paper, we provide the monadic second-order theories of downward unbounded layered structures, which are infinitely refinable structures consisting of a coarsest domain and an infinite number of finer and finer domains, and of upward unbounded layered structures, which consist of a finest domain and an infinite number of coarser and coarser domains, with expressively complete and elementarily decidable temporal logic counterparts. We obtain such a result in two steps. First, we define a new class of combined automata, called temporalized automata, which can be proved to be the automata-theoretic counterpart of temporalized logics, and show that relevant properties, such as closure under Boolean operations, decidability, and expressive equivalence with respect to temporal logics, transfer from component automata to temporalized ones. Then, we exploit the correspondence between temporalized logics and automata to reduce the task of finding the temporal logic counterparts of the given theories of time granularity to the easier one of finding temporalized automata counterparts of them.

J	Hu, XH; Cercone, N				Hu, XH; Cercone, N			A data warehouse/online analytic processing framework for web usage mining and business intelligence reporting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2002)	MAY, 2002	HONOLULU, HAWAII					Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to discover usage patterns and behaviors from web data (clickstream, purchase information, customer information, etc.) in order to understand and serve e-commerce customers better and improve the online business. In this article, we present a general data warehouse/online analytic processing (OLAP) framework for web usage mining and business intelligence reporting. When we integrate the web data warehouse construction, data mining, and OLAP into the e-commerce system, this tight integration dramatically reduces the time and effort for web usage mining, business intelligence reporting, and mining deployment. Our data warehouse/OLAP framework consists of four phases: data capture, webhouse construction (clickstream marts), pattern discovery and cube construction, and pattern evaluation and deployment. We discuss data transformation operations for web usage mining and business reporting in clickstream, session, and customer levels; describe the problems and challenging issues in each phase in detail; provide plausible solutions to the issues; and demonstrate the framework with some examples from some real web sites. Our data warehouse/ OLAP framework has been integrated into some commercial e-commerce systems. We believe this data warehouse/OLAP framework would be very useful for developing any real-world web usage mining and business intelligence reporting systems. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Hou, TH; Huang, CC				Hou, TH; Huang, CC			Application of fuzzy logic and variable precision rough set approach in a remote monitoring manufacturing process for diagnosis rule induction	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						fuzzy sets; rough sets; data mining; remote monitoring; E-maintenance	MODEL	Rough set has been shown to be a valuable approach to mine rules from a remote monitoring manufacturing process. In this research, an application of the fuzzy set theory with the fuzzy variable precision rough set approach for mining the causal relationship rules from the database of a remote monitoring manufacturing process is presented. The membership function in the fuzzy set theory is used to transfer the data entries into fuzzy sets, and the fuzzy variable precision rough set approach is applied to extract rules from the fuzzy sets. It is found that the induced rules are identical to the practical knowledge and fault diagnosis thinking of human operators. The induced rules are then compared with the rules induced by the original rough set approach. The comparison shows that the rules induced by the fuzzy rough set are expressed in linguistic forms, and are evaluated by plausibility and future effectiveness measures. The fuzzy rough set approach, being less sensitive to noisy data, induces better rules than the original rough set approach.

J	Yang, J; Wang, W; Yu, PS				Yang, J; Wang, W; Yu, PS			Discovering high-order periodic patterns	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						asynchronous pattern; data mining; frequent pattern; meta-pattem; periodic pattern	SEQUENCES	Discovery of periodic patterns in time series data has become an active research area with many applications. These patterns can be hierarchical in nature, where a higher-level pattern may consist of repetitions of lower-level patterns. Unfortunately, the presence of noise may prevent these higher-level patterns from being recognized in the sense that two portions (of a data sequence) that support the same (high-level) pattern may have different layouts of occurrences of basic symbols. There may not exist any common representation in terms of raw symbol combinations; and hence such (high-level) pattern may not be expressed by any previous model (defined on raw symbols or symbol combinations) and would not be properly recognized by any existing method. In this paper, we propose a novel model, namely meta-pattern, to capture these high-level patterns. As a more flexible model, the number of potential meta-patterns could be very large. A substantial difficulty lies in how to identify the proper pattern candidates. However, the well-known Apriori property is not able to provide sufficient pruning power. A new property, namely component location property, is identified and used to conduct the candidate generation so that an efficient computation-based mining algorithm can be developed. Last, but not least, we apply our algorithm to some real and synthetic sequences and some interesting patterns are discovered.

This paper proposes a personalized defection detection and prevention procedure based on the observation that potential defectors have a tendency to take a couple of months or weeks to gradually change their behaviour (i.e., trim-out their usage volume) before their eventual withdrawal. For this purpose, we suggest a SOM (Self-Organizing Map) based procedure to determine the possible states of customer behaviour from past behaviour data. Based on this state representation, potential defectors are detected by comparing their monitored trajectories of behaviour states with frequent and confident trajectories of past defectors. Also, the proposed procedure is extended to prevent the defection of potential defectors by recommending the desirable behaviour state for the next period so as to lower the likelihood of defection. For the evaluation of the proposed procedure, a case study has been conducted for a Korean online game site. The result demonstrates that the proposed procedure is effective for defection prevention and efficiently detects potential defectors without deterioration of prediction accuracy when compared to that of the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) neural networks.

Visualisation is a classic information technology for optimising scientific return. We are developing a number of generic on-line visualisation tools as a component of the Australian Virtual Observatory project. The tools will be deployed within the framework of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), and follow agreed-upon standards to make them accessible by other programs and people. We and our IVOA partners plan to utilise new information technologies (such as grid computing and web services) to advance the scientific return of existing and future instrumentation. Here we present a new tool - VOlume - which visualises point data. Visualisation of astronomical data normally requires the local installation of complex software, the downloading of potentially large datasets, and very often time-consuming and tedious data format conversions. VOlume enables the astronomer to visualise data using just a web browser and plug-in. This is achieved using IVOA standards which allow us to pass data between Web Services, Java Servlet Technology and Common Gateway Interface programs. Data from a catalogue server can be streamed in eXtensible Mark-up Language format to a servlet which produces Virtual Reality Modeling Language output. The user selects elements of the catalogue to map to geometry and then visualises the result in a browser plug-in such as Cortona or FreeWRL. Other than requiring an input VOTable format file, VOlume is very general. While its major use will likely be to display and explore astronomical source catalogues, it can easily render other important parameter fields such as the sky and redshift coverage of proposed surveys or the sampling of the visibility plane by a rotation-synthesis interferometer.

In practice, this type of system cannot adapt to changing or new requirements emergent in the problem domain. As a result of survey, 85% of DW projects failed to meet their intended objectives. In this paper, an internal linkage and communication channel, namely an ontology service-based match and translation among user interface, DW, and enterprise information systems, is developed, which implements unified naming and directory of ontology services, metadata management and rule generation for ontology mapping and query parsing among conceptual view, analytical view and physical view from top down. A system prototype on top of realistic telecom environment shows that our intelligence integration solution presents much stronger power to deal with operational decision making user-friendly and adaptively compared with those simply combining BI products available from vendors.

The k-means and EM algorithms are two of the most important algorithms in the Mixture Model-based clustering and tessellations. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering strategy which shares common features with both the EM and k-means algorithms. Our methods also lead to more general tessellations of a spatial region with respect to a continuous and possibly anisotropic density distribution. Moreover, we propose some probabilistic methods for the construction of these clusterings and tessellations corresponding to a continuous density distribution. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach. In addition, we also discuss the parallel implementation and performance of our algorithms on some distributed memory systems.

Highly sophisticated methods have been developed, using the full power of recent advances in computation. Many of these methods would have been simply inconceivable to earlier generations. However, most of these advances have largely taken place within the context of the classical supervised classification paradigm of data analysis. That is, a classification rule is constructed based on a given 'design sample' of data, with known and well-defined classes, and this rule is then used to classify future objects. This paper argues that this paradigm is often, perhaps typically, an over-idealisation of the practical realities of supervised classification problems. Furthermore, it is also argued that the sequential nature of the statistical modelling process means that the large gains in predictive accuracy are achieved early in the modelling process. Putting these two facts together leads to the suspicion that the apparent superiority of the highly sophisticated methods is often illusory: simple methods are often equally effective or even superior in classifying new data points.

A recommender system is an intermediary program (or an agent) with a user interface that automatically and intelligently generates a list of information which suits an individual's needs. Two information filtering methods for providing the recommended information are considered: (1) by analyzing the information content, i.e., content-based filtering, and (2) by referencing other user access behaviors, i.e., collaborative filtering. By using the data mining algorithms, the information filtering processes can be performed prior to the actual recommending process. As a result, the system response time could be improved and thus, making the framework scalable.

Intelligent methods such as neural networks, fuzzy sets, decision trees, and expert systems are, slowly but steadily, applied in the medical fields. Recently, rough set theory is a new intelligent technique was used for the discovery of data dependencies, data reduction, approximate set classification, and rule induction from databases. In this paper, we present a rough set method for generating classification rules from a set of observed 360 samples of the breast cancer data. The attributes are selected, normalized and then the rough set dependency rules are generated directly from the real value attribute vector. Then the rough set reduction technique is applied to find all reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for classification. Experimental results from applying the rough set analysis to the set of data samples are given and evaluated. In addition, the generated rules are also compared to the well-known IDS classifier algorithm. The study showed that the theory of rough sets seems to be a useful toot for inductive learning and a valuable aid for building expert systems.

In this paper, we present a new subspace clustering method, called SCI (Subspace Clustering based on Information), to solve this problem. The SCI combines Shannon information with grid-based and density-based clustering techniques. The design of clustering algorithms is equivalent to construct an equivalent relationship among data points. Therefore, we propose an equivalent relationship, named density-connected, to identify the main bodies of clusters. For the purpose of noise detection and cluster boundary discovery, we also use the grid approach to devise a new cohesive mechanism to merge data points of borders into clusters and to filter out the noises. However, the curse of dimensionality is a well-known serious problem of using grid approach on high dimensional data sets because the number of the grid cells grows exponentially in dimensions. To strike a compromise between the randomness and the structure, we propose an automatic method for attribute selection based on the Shannon information. With the merit of only requiring one data scan, algorithm SCI is very efficient with its run time being linear to the size of the input data set. As shown by our experimental results, SCI is very powerful to discover arbitrary shapes of clusters.

Previous studies have considered synchronous periodic patterns where misaligned occurrences are not allowed. However, asynchronous periodic pattern mining has received less attention and was only been discussed for a sequence of symbols where each time point contains one event. In this paper, we propose a more general model of asynchronous periodic patterns from a sequence of symbol sets where a time slot can contain multiple events. Three parameters min_rep, max_dis, and global-rep are employed to specify the minimum number of repetitions required for a valid segment of non-disrupted pattern occurrences, the maximum allowed disturbance between two successive valid segments. and the total repetitions required for a valid sequence. A four-phase algorithm is devised to discover periodic patterns from a temporal database presented in vertical format. The experiments demonstrate good performance and scalability with large frequent patterns.

An important aspect to increase user support and user orientation is to use a history mechanism that, first of all, provides un- and redoing functionality. In this paper, we present a new approach to include such history functionality into a VDM framework. Therefore, we introduce the theoretical background, outline design and implementation aspects of a history management unit, and conclude with a discussion showing the usefulness of our history management in a VDM framework.

As a promising data mining approach, multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) has been successfully applied to classify credit cardholders' behavior into two or multiple-groups for business intelligence. The objective of this paper is to study the stability of MCLP in classifying credit cardholders' behavior by using cross-validation and ensemble techniques. An overview of the two-group MCLP model formulation and a description of the dataset used in this paper are introduced first. Then cross-validation and ensemble methods are tested respectively As the results demonstrated, the classification rates of cross-validation and ensemble methods are close to the rates of using MCLP alone. In other words, MCLP is a relatively stable method in classifying credit cardholders' behavior.

From this approach is derived a NP complete optimization criterion for supervised learning, the area under the ROC curve. This optimization criterion, tackled with evolution strategies, is experimentally compared to the structural risk criterion tackled by quadratic optimization in Support Vector Machines. Comparable results are obtained on a set of benchmark problems in the Irvine repository, within a fraction of the SVM computational cost. Additionally, the variety of solutions provided by evolutionary computation can be exploited for visually inspecting the contributing factors of the phenomenon under study.

As a result, the demand for highly automated data analysis and interpretation systems and tools is growing fast. Besides data growth, there has been an accelerating trend towards the sharing of computational resources (raw data storage and compute power, but also information and sophisticated information systems) via emerging Grid technologies. Both the impending data avalanche and the relentless desire to share computational resources present new challenges and opportunities for future data management, analysis and interpretation systems. This position paper analyzes some of these challenges and opportunities, and outlines the DataMiningGrid project, which will investigate and develop technology for future Grid-based data mining infrastructures.

There is growing evidence that integrating classification and association rule mining together can produce more efficient and accurate classifiers than traditional classification techniques. In this paper, the problem of producing rules with multiple labels is investigated. We propose a new associative classification approach called multi-class, multi-label associative classification (MMAC). This paper also presents three measures for evaluating the accuracy of data mining classification approaches to a wide range of traditional and multi-label classification problems. Results for 28 different datasets show that the MMAC approach is an accurate and effective classification technique, highly competitive and scalable in comparison with other classification approaches.

A noteworthy feature of the proposed model is to consider ordered siblings by modeling the dependencies of a node in a tree on the elder sibling as well as the parent. This model is reasonably extended from a variety of existing probabilistic models for strings and trees. We further propose a new learning/mining method to estimate the parameters of this model, based on an EM algorithm. This is also an extension of those for various simpler probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models and hidden tree Markov models. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and real-world data sets, comparing the results with those of several simpler probabilistic models. Experimental results have shown that our proposed method outperforms the other methods compared, being statistically significant in all cases tested. This result tells us that the proposed methodology is highly effective for mining labeled ordered trees, which have recently emerged as one of the typical data structures in numerous data mining domains, including the web, text mining and bioinformatics.

In this paper we investigate data mining as a technique for masking data, therefore, termed data mining based privacy protection. This approach incorporates partially the requirement of a targeted data mining task into the process of masking data so that essential structure is preserved in the masked data. The idea is simple but novel: we explore the data generalization concept from data mining as a way to hide detailed information, rather than discover trends and patterns. Once the data is masked, standard data mining techniques can be applied without modification. Our work demonstrated another positive use of data mining technology: not only can it discover useful patterns, but also mask private information. We consider the following privacy problem: a data holder wants to release a version of data for building classification models, but wants to protect against linking the released data to an external source for inferring sensitive information. We adapt an iterative bottom-up generalization from data mining to generalize the data. The generalized data remains useful to classification but becomes difficult to link to other sources. The generalization space is specified by a hierarchical structure of generalizations. A key is identifying the best generalization to climb up the hierarchy at each iteration. Enumerating all candidate generalizations is impractical. We present a scalable solution that examines at most one generalization in each iteration for each attribute involved in the linking.

Identification of spatial outliers can lead to the discovery of unexpected, useful spatial patterns for further analysis. Drawbacks of the existing methods are that they can only detect outliers under attributes when the attributive correlation isn't considered and the normal objects tend to be falsely detected as spatial outliers when their neighborhood contains true spatial outliers. This paper presents a spatial outlier detection algorithm to overcome the disadvantages. In addition, the results demonstrated that our approach could accurately detect spatial outliers when the attributive correlation was calculated, and our approach not only avoided detecting false spatial outliers but also found true spatial outliers ignored by the existing methods in a real-world geographical data set.

In this paper, an artificial Ants Sleeping Model (ASM) and an Adaptive Artificial Ants Clustering Algorithm (A(4)C) are presented to solve the clustering problem in data mining by simulating the behaviors of social ant colonies. In the ASM model, each datum is represented by an agent. The agents' environment is a two-dimensional grid. In A(4)C, the agents can form into high-quality clusters by making simple moves according to little local information from its neighborhood and the parameters are selected and adjusted adaptively. Experimental results on clustering benchmarks show the ASM and A(4)C are simpler, easier to implement, and more efficient than previous methods.

While this design has allo-wed new applications and usage models to flourish, it also makes the job of network management significantly more challenging. This paper describes a new method of traffic characterization that automatically groups traffic into minimal clusters of conspicuous consumption. Rather than providing a static analysis specialized to capture flows, applications, or network-to-network traffic matrices, our approach dynamically produces hybrid traffic definitions that match the underlying usage. For example, rather than report five hundred small flows, or the amount of TCP traffic to port 80, or the "top ten hosts", our method might reveal that a certain percent of traffic was used by TCP connections between AOL clients and a particular group of Web servers. Similarly, our technique can be used to automatically classify new traffic patterns, such as network worms or peer-to-peer applications, without knowing the structure of such traffic a priori. We describe a series of algorithms for constructing these traffic clusters and minimizing their representation. In addition, we describe the design of our prototype system, AutoFocus and our experiences using it to discover the dominant and unusual modes of usage on several different production networks.

A Bayesian network is generated from a data set and the Markov blanket of the class variable is applied to the feature subset selection task. The general rule extraction method is simple and consists of employing the clustering process in the examples of each class separately. In this way, clusters of similar examples are found for each class. These clusters can be viewed as subclasses and can, consequently, be modeled into logical rules. In this context, the problem of finding the optimal number of classification rules can be viewed as the problem of finding the best number of clusters. The Clustering Genetic Algorithm can find the best clustering in a data set, according to the Average Silhouette Width criterion, and it was applied to extract classification rules. The proposed methodology is illustrated by means of simulations in three data sets that are benchmarks for data-mining methods-Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Mushroom, and Congressional Voting Records. The rules extracted with all the attributes are compared to those extracted with the features belonging to the Markov blanket and the obtained results show that the proposed method is very promising.

The proposed method performs very well when compared to existing methods for estimating the median as well as arbitrary quantiles for a wide range of densities. In addition to explaining the method and presenting the results of the simulation study, we discuss intuition behind the method and demonstrate empirically, for certain densities, that the proposed estimator converges to the sample quantile.

J	Richards, D; Malik, U				Richards, D; Malik, U			Multi-level knowledge discovery from rule bases	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SYSTEMS	The discovery of multi-level knowledge is important to allow queries at and across different levels of abstraction. While there are some similarities between our research and that of others in this area, the work reported in this paper does not directly involve databases and is differently motivated. Our research is interested in taking data in the form of rule-bases and finding multi-level knowledge. This paper describes our motivation, our preferred technique for acquiring the initial knowledge known as Ripple-Down Rules, the use of Formal Concept Analysis to develop an abstraction hierarchy, and our application of these ideas to knowledge bases from the domain of chemical pathology. We also provide an example of how the approach can be applied to other prepositional knowledge bases and suggest that it can be used as an additional phase to many existing data mining approaches.

GDT-RS is a soft hybrid induction system, and RSBR is used for discretization of real valued attributes as a pre-processing step realized before the GDT-RS starts. We argue that discretization of continuous valued attributes is an important pre-processing step in the rule discovery process. We illustrate the quality of rules discovered by GDT-RS is strongly affected by the result of discretization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To choose an appropriate parameter for a specific kernel is an important research issue in the data mining area. In this paper we propose an automatic parameter selection approach for polynomial kernel. The algorithm is tested on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The parameter selection is considered on the basis of prior information of the data distribution and Bayesian inference. The new approach is tested on different sizes of benchmark datasets with binary class problems as well as multi class classification problems.

Generally, only intra-tuple relationships between the attributes and the target field are found, while inter-tuple relationships are not considered and (inter-table) relationships between several tuples of distinct tables are not even explorable. Disregarding inter-table relationships can be a severe limitation in many real-word applications that involve the prediction of numerical values from data that are naturally organized in a relational model involving several tables (multi-relational model). In this paper, we present a new data mining algorithm, named Mr-SMOTI, which induces model trees from a multi-relational model. A model tree is a tree-structured prediction model whose leaves are associated with multiple linear regression models. The particular feature of Mr-SMOTI is that internal nodes of the induced model tree can be of two types: regression nodes, which add a variable to some multiple linear models according to a stepwise strategy, and split nodes, which perform tests on attributes or the join condition and eventually partition the training set. The induced model tree is a multi-relational pattern that can be represented by means of selection graphs, which can be translated into SQL, or equivalently into first order logic expressions.

Clustering using self-organizing maps is applied to produce multiple targets. In this paper, we propose that an amalgamation of SOM and association rule theory may hold the key to a more generic solution, less reliant on initial supervision and redundant user interaction. The results of clustering stem words from text documents could be utilised to derive association rules which designate the applicability of documents to the user. A four stage process is consequently detailed, demonstrating a generic example of how a graphical derivation of associations may be derived from a repository of text documents, or even a set of synopses of many such repositories. This research demonstrates the feasibility of applying such processes for data mining and knowledge discovery.

However it is well known that most general association rule discovery methods find too many rules, many of which are uninteresting rules. Furthermore, the performances of many such algorithms deteriorate when the minimum support is low. They fail to find many interesting rules even when support is low, particularly in the case of significantly unbalanced classes. In this paper we present an algorithm which finds association rules based on a set of new interestingness criteria. The algorithm is applied to a real-world health data set and successfully identifies groups of patients with high risk of adverse reaction to certain drugs. A statistically guided method of selecting appropriate features has also been developed. Initial results have shown that the proposed algorithm can find interesting patterns from data sets with unbalanced class distributions without performance loss.

Clustering is perhaps the most frequently used data mining algorithm, being useful in it's own right as an exploratory technique, and also as a subroutine in more complex data mining algorithms such as rule discovery, indexing, summarization, anomaly detection, and classification. Given these two facts, it is hardly surprising that time series clustering has attracted much attention. The data to be clustered can be in one of two formats: many individual time series, or a single time series, from which individual time series are extracted with a sliding window. Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms, the latter case has received much attention. In this work we make an amazing claim. Clustering of streaming time series is completely meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from streaming time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising, since it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work.

A Bayesian network, in general, is widely accepted as an effective graphical model for analyzing biomedical data to determine associations among variables and to make probabilistic predictions of the expected values of hidden variables. This paper presents Bayesian network-based analysis of infertility patient data, which have been collected from the IVF clinic in a general hospital for two years. Through learning Bayesian networks from the clinical data, we identify the significant factors and their dependence relationships in determining the pregnancy of an infertility patient we classify the patient data into two classes (pregnant and not-pregnant) using the learned Bayesian network classifiers. From this medical data mining, we discovered the new domain knowledge that the age of female partner and stimulants like hCG, FSH, LH, Clomiphene, Parlodel and GnRH play the key role in pregnancy of an infertility patient. Through the experiments for investigating the prediction accuracy, Bayesian network classifiers showed the higher accuracy than non-Bayesian classifiers such as the decision tree and k-NN classifier.

The efficiency of data mining algorithms is strongly needed with data becoming larger and larger. In this paper, we present a new fast clustering algorithm called CURD, which means Clustering Using References and Density. Its creativity is capturing the shape and extent of a cluster with references, and then it analyzes the data based on the references. CURD preserves the ability of density based clustering method's good advantages, and it is much efficient because of its nearly linear time complexity, so it can be used in mining very large databases. Both our theoretic analysis and experimental results confirm that CURD can discover clusters with arbitrary shape and is insensitive to noise data; In the meanwhile, its executing efficiency is much higher than R*-tree based DBSCAN algorithm.

Search on these data types is not restricted to the classic problems of mining association rules and classification, but similarity search is also a frequently applied operation. Access methods for multidimensional numerical data are inappropriate for this problem and specialized indexes are needed. We propose a method that represents set data as bitmaps (signatures) and organizes them into a hierarchical index, suitable for similarity search and other related query types. In contrast to a previous technique, the, signature tree is dynamic and does not rely on hardwired constants. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets show that it is robust to different data characteristics, scalable to the database size and efficient for various queries.

J	Millard, NJ				Millard, NJ			A million segments of one - how personal should customer relationship management get?	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article								The foundation upon which customer relationship management (CRM) stands is a single, definitive view of customers which spans functions, channels, products and customer types and drives every customer interaction. CRM purports to recreate the, traditional corner shop' experience to millions of clients. However, as techniques for data mining and pattern matching allow companies to build a relationship with customers, customers are questioning whether they actually want to have a relationship with companies. As CRM becomes more personalised, is it providing the experience that customers want? Are companies spending on personalised CRM only to reap limited benefits? This paper considers the different ways that companies such as Capital One, First Direct, Amazon and Tesco are personalising a CRM experience and examines the resulting relationship that they develop with their customers. Ultimately, the future of personalised CRM is dependent on non-intrusive, mutually beneficial and cost-effective strategies delivered through the appropriate medium for the customer. This requires recognition that CRM is more than just deployment of technology. It is a fusion of strategy, process and technology. Companies need to consider what customers want from them and whether the personalised solution that is being proposed reaps financial benefits. Building a million segments of one may work for some companies but others need to consider what kind of relationship their customers want from them and what they (and their customers) can gain from the data that they gather.

Mapping preserves the important information of the data, and in order to be useful, fulfils the needs of a human observer. We have proposed a self-organizing map (SOM)-based approach for visual surface inspection. The method provides the advantages of unsupervised learning and an intuitive user interface that allows one to very easily set and tune the class boundaries based on observations made on visualization, for example, to adapt to changing conditions or material. There are, however, some problems with a SOM. It does not address the true distances between data, and it has a tendency to ignore rare samples in the training set at the expense of more accurate representation of common samples. In this paper, some alternative methods for a SOM are evaluated. These methods, PCA, MDS, LLE, ISOMAP, and GTM, are used to reduce dimensionality in order to visualize the data. Their principal differences are discussed and performances quantitatively evaluated in a few special classification cases, such as in wood inspection using centile features. For the test material experimented with, SOM and GTM outperform the others when classification performance is considered.

To better understand patterns of usage, analysis should take the semantics of visited URLs into account. This paper presents a framework for enhancing Web usage records with formal semantics based on an ontology underlying the site. Besides, it elicits automated methods of mapping URLs to application events. Using the ontology's taxonomy, we describe user actions at different levels of abstractions. Using the ontology's concepts and relations, we capture the multitude of user interests expressed by a visit to one page. We employ our ideas in an application of SEAL, a framework for semantic portals that uses Semantic Web technologies to support communities of interest. Different realizations of semantically enriched user tracking are discussed and related to other approaches. We describe first results from a prototypical system, and discuss benefits of Conceptual User Tracking for Web usage mining.

These methods incorporate recent advances in rough set theory related to coping with the uncertainty in making obstacle classification decisions either during the operation of a mobile robot. Obstacle classification is based on the evaluation of data acquired by proximity sensors connected to a line-crawling robot useful in inspecting power transmission lines. A fairly large proximity sensor data set has been used as means of bench-marking the proposed classification methods, and also to facilitate comparison with other published studies of the same data set. Using 10-fold cross validated paired t-test, this paper compares the rough set classification learning method with the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) classification learning method.

In this paper, we present the architecture and the logical foundations for the management of the produced knowledge artifacts, which we call patterns. To this end, we first introduce the concept of Pattern-Base Management System; then, we provide the logical foundations of a general framework based on the notions of pattern types and pattern classes, which stand for the intensional and extensional description of pattern instances, respectively. The framework is general and extensible enough to cover a broad range of real-world patterns, each of which is characterized by its structure, the related underlying data, an expression that carries the semantics of the pattern, and measurements of how successful the representation of raw data is. Finally, some remarkable types of relationships between patterns are discussed.

Knowledge representations for tree structured data are quite important to discover interesting features which such tree structured data have. In this paper, as a representation of structural features we propose a structured ordered tree pattern, called a term tree, which is a rooted tree pattern consisting of ordered children and structured variables. A variable in a term tree can be substituted by an arbitrary tree. Deciding whether or not each given tree structured data has structural features is a core problem for data mining of large tree structured data. We consider a problem of deciding whether or not a term tree t matches a tree T, that is, T is obtained from t by substituting some trees for variables in t. Such a problem is called a membership problem for t and T. Given a term tree t and a tree T, we present an O(nN) time algorithm of solving the membership problem for t and T, where n and N are the numbers of vertices in t and T, respectively. We also report some experiments on applying our matching algorithm to a collection of real Web documents.

Most previous studies require the specification of a minimum support threshold to perform the mining. However, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate threshold in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an alternative task: mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns of length no less than min_l, where k is the desired number of closed sequential patterns to be mined, and min_l is the minimum length of each pattern. We mine closed patterns since they are compact representations of frequent patterns. We developed an efficient algorithm, called TSP, which makes use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k closed sequential patterns to perform dynamic support-raising and projected database-pruning. Our extensive performance study shows that TSP outperforms the closed sequential pattern mining algorithm even when the latter is running with the best tuned minimum support threshold.

Thus, there is a pressing need for more general mechanisms for extending DBMSs to support efficiently database-centric data mining appliacations. To satisfy this need, we propose a new extensibility mechanism for SQL-compliant DBMSs, and demonstrate its power in supporting decision support applications. The key extension is the ability of defining new table functions and aggregate functions in SQL-rather than in external procedural languages as Object-Relational (O-R) DBMSs currently do. This simple extension turns SQL into a powerful language for decision-support applications, including ROLAPs, time-series queries, stream-oriented processing, and data mining functions. First, we discuss the use of ATLaS for data mining applications, and then the architecture and techniques used in its realization.

We show that these are powerful instruments in the finance data mining domain, especially when dealing with signal decomposition and approximation obtained through wavelet and cosine packet dictionaries. With intra-daily temporal series, some features in the underlying stochastic processes may remain undetected by standard models applied to the observed data; thus, capturing the latent dependencies and extracting features such as hidden periodic components represent crucial tasks. Independent Component Analysis results to be particularly relevant for the scopes of suggesting a better compromise for the time and frequency resolution pursuit and a better efficiency and accuracy of the Matching Pursuit performance.

J	Drobics, M; Bodenhofer, U; Winiwarter, W				Drobics, M; Bodenhofer, U; Winiwarter, W			Mining clusters and corresponding interpretable descriptions - a three-stage approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering; data analysis; fuzzy logic; inductive learning; self-organizing map	MAPS	This paper presents a three-stage approach to data mining which puts special emphasis on the visualization and interpretability of the results. In the first stage, the input data are represented by a self-organizing map in order to allow visualization and to reduce the amount of data while removing noise, outliers and missing values. Then this preprocessed information is used to identify and display fuzzy clusters of similarity. Finally, descriptions close to natural language are computed for these clusters in order to provide the analyst with qualitative information. This is accomplished by generating fuzzy rules using an inductive learning method. The proposed approach is applied to three case studies, including image data and real-world data sets. The results illustrate the robustness, intuitiveness and wide applicability of the method.

In this paper we introduce frequency to information transformation (FIT) as a novel method of extracting information content of complex signals. Because FIT uses a priori knowledge and is a comparative technique, it is well suited for data mining and knowledge discovery from complex data. In this paper, we introduce FIT and compare it to established methods used in automated conditioning and knowledge discovery in proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) spectra. FIT transformation was applied to a collection of 80 one-dimensional (ID) H-1-NMR spectra of 23 N-linked oligosaccharides. Three classification methods, namely, cluster analysis, Bayesian analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to demonstrate the advantages of FIT in information and knowledge extraction in comparison with classical methods such as frequency-based filtering, nonlinear and piecewise linear curve fitting, and correlation coefficient analysis.

One characteristic of these Apriori-based algorithms is that candidate itemsets are generated in rounds, with the size of the itemsets incremented by one per round. The number of database scans required by Apriori-based algorithms thus depends on the size of the biggest frequent itemsets. In this paper, we devise a more general candidate set generation algorithm, LGen, which generates candidate itemsets of multiple sizes during each database scan. We present an algorithm FindLarge which uses LGen to find frequent itemsets. We show that, given a reasonable set of suggested frequent itemsets, FindLarge can significantly reduce the number of I/O passes required. In the best cases, only two passes are sufficient to discover all the frequent itemsets irrespective of the size of the biggest ones. Two I/O-saving algorithms, namely DIC and Pincher-Search, are compared with FindLarge in a series of experiments. We discuss the conditions under which FindLarge significantly outperforms the others in terms of I/O efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lopes, S; Petit, JM; Toumani, F				Lopes, S; Petit, JM; Toumani, F			Discovering interesting inclusion dependencies: application to logical database tuning	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						relational model; inclusion dependencies; knowledge discovery in databases; data mining; self-tuning databases	RELATIONAL DATABASES; FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; MODEL; DESIGN	Inclusion dependencies together with functional dependencies form the most important data dependencies used in practice. Inclusion dependencies are important for various database applications such as database design and maintenance, semantic query optimization and efficient view maintenance of data warehouse. Existing approaches for discovering inclusion dependencies consist in producing the whole set of inclusion dependencies holding in a database, leaving the task of selecting the interesting ones to an expert user. In this paper, we take another look at the problem of discovering inclusion dependencies. We exploit the logical navigation, inherently available in relational databases through workloads of SQL statements, as a guess to automatically find out only interesting inclusion dependencies. This assumption leads us to devise a tractable algorithm for discovering interesting inclusion dependencies. Within this framework, approximate dependencies, i.e. inclusion dependencies which almost hold, are also considered. As an example, we present a novel application, namely self-tuning the logical database design, where the discovered inclusion dependencies can be used effectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Applications from various domains have adopted this technique to perform data analysis, efficiently. Several issues need to be addressed when such techniques apply on data these are bulk at,size and geographically distributed at various sites. In this paper we describe system architecture for a scalable and a portable distributed data mining application. The system contains modules for secure distributed. communication, database connectivity, organized data management and efficient data analysis for generating a global mining model. Performance evaluation of the system is also carried out and presented.

It has the following characteristics: (i) it encodes a complete set of rules in one single chromosome; (ii) each allele encodes one rule and each rule is represented by some non-binary symbolic values, (iii) the evolutionary process begins with the generation of an initial set of first-order rules (i.e., rules with one condition) using a probabilistic induction technique and based on these rules, rules of higher order (two or more conditions) are obtained iteratively; (iv) it adopts a steady-state reproduction scheme in which only two chromosomes are replaced every time; (v) when identifying interesting rules, an objective interestingness measure is used; and (vi) the fitness of a chromosome is defined in terms of the probability that the attribute values of a tuple can be correctly determined using the rules it encodes. Furthermore, dAR can also be used to mine the changes in discovered rules over time. This allows the accurate prediction of the future based on the historical data in the past. The experimental results on a synthetic database have shown that dAR is very effective at mining interesting association rules and their changes over time.

S	Browne, WNL		Lanzi, PL; Stolzmann, W; Wilson, SW		Browne, WNL			Balancing specificity and generality in a panmictic-based rule-discovery learning classifier system	LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Learning Classifier Systems (IWLCS 2002)	SEP 07-08, 2002	Granada, SPAIN				XCS	A Learning Classifier System has been developed based on industrial experience. Termed iLCS, the methods were designed and selected to function with common data properties found in industry. Interestingly, it considers a different strategy to XCS type systems, with the rule discovery being based panmictically. In order to show the worth of the iLCS approach, the benchmark data-mining application of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset was investigated. A competitive level of 95.3% performance was achieved; mainly due to the introduction of a generalisation pressure through a fitness to mate (termed fertility) that was decoupled from a fitness to effect (termed effectiveness). Despite no subsumption deletion being employed the real-valued rule-base was simple to understand, discovering similar patterns in the data to XCS. Much further testing of iLCS is required to confirm robustness and performance. Currently, the iLCS approach represents a flexible alternative to niche-based LCSs, which should further the advancement of the LCS field for industrial application.

Using the same word or vocabulary to describe different entities creates ambiguity, especially in the Web environment where the user population is large. To solve this problem, fuzzy association is used to capture the relationships among different index terms or keywords in the documents, i.e., each pair of words has an associated value to distinguish itself from the others. Therefore, the ambiguity in word usage is avoided. Experiments using data sets collected from two Web portals: Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and Open Directory, Project (dmoz.org) are conducted. We compare our approach to the vector space model with the cosine coefficient. The results show that our approach yields higher accuracy compared to the vector space model.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				In the paper we demonstrate how evolutionary search for functional optima can be used as a vehicle for data mining. That is, in the process of searching for optima in a multi-dimensional space we can keep track of the constraints that must be placed on related variables in order to move towards the optima. Thus, a side effect of evolutionary search can be the mining of constraints for related variables. Here we use a Cultural Algorithm framework to embed the search and store the results in regional schemata. An application to a large-scale real-world archaeological data set is presented.

We describe a simple yet powerful way of speeding up any form of frequency counting satisfying the monotonicity condition. Our method, the optimized segment support map (OSSM), is a light-weight structure which partitions the collection of transactions into m segments, so as to reduce the number of candidate patterns that require frequency counting. We study the following problems: (1) What is the optimal number of segments to be used; and (2) Given a user-determined m, what is the best segmentation/composition of the m segments? For Problem 1, we provide a thorough analysis and a theorem establishing the minimum value of m for which there is no accuracy lost in wring the OSSM. For Problem 2, we develop various algorithms and heuristics, which efficiently generate OSSMs that are compact and effective, to help facilitate segmentation.

Each DM technique has a specific background theory; therefore, different results are expected when applying multiple methods. The purpose of this study is to find the data format appropriate for each DM classification technique for wider applications, and efficiently to obtain trustworthy results. Considering the nature of medical data, categorical variables are sometimes useful for making decisions and can make it easier to extrapolate knowledge. In this study, three mathematical data categorization methods (Fusinter, minimum description length principle [MDLPC] and Chi-merge) were applied to accommodate five data mining classification techniques (statistics discriminant analysis, supervised classification with Neural Networks, Decision trees, Genetic supervised clustering and Bayesian classification [probability neural networks; PNN]) using a heart disease database with four types of data (continuous data, binary data, nominal data, and ordinal data). Compared with original or normalized data, data categorized by the MDLPC categorization method was found to perform better in most of the DM classification techniques used in this study. Categorical data is good for most DM classification techniques (e. g. classification of disease and non-disease groups) and is relatively easy to use for extracting medical knowledge.

Given a database of previous designs, this method identifies relationships between design components within this database. Further, the method transforms these relationships into explicit design knowledge that can be used to generate a 'heuristic-based' model of the design domain for use at the conceptual stage. This can be viewed as a knowledge extracting method for the conceptual design stage. Such a method is particularly interesting, as the conceptual stage typically lacks explicit models to describe the trade-offs that must be made when designing. The method uses either principal components analysis or self-organizing maps to identify the relationships, and this paper describes all the elements required by the method to successfully extract and verify design knowledge from design databases.

Especially clustering techniques are frequently used data mining tools for finding structure in the data set. They aim at the partition of a generally huge set of unarranged high-dimensional objects (observations) into homogeneous subsets (clusters). Usually the starting point is data without hypotheses about the data. Here a sample of Roman brick and tile is collected which is characterized by 19 chemical elements (variables). The sample size is 613 (Dolata (1999a)). An adaptive clustering algorithm is applied which can handle different scaling of the variables automatically. The number of clusters is investigated by using a simulation technique. Furthermore the importance of the variables is quantified in the same way. Afterwards this knowledge is used for both hierarchical clustering and the visualization of data and clusters by principal component analysis.

We present a classification method, which is equivalent to rough set based classification methods, but is scalable and applicable for large data sets. The proposed method is based on lazy learning idea [2] and Apriori algorithm for sequent item-set approaches [1]. In this method the set of decision rules matching the new object is generated directly from training set. Accept classification task, this method can be used for adaptive rule generation system where data is growing up in time.

Especially, the discovery of what we call chances, significant novel events are to be realized in this process. The example shown here is an application to questionnaire analysis, for understanding new behaviors of the Internet users. The Internet users are born and bred with face-to-face human relations in the real worid, but their interactions with WWW are distilling new value-criteria, keeping personal real-world senses of rationality, empathy, ethics, etc. In our method for aiding the discovery, base on the double-helix model, the in-depth interaction of the Internet, the personalities and the behaviors of people came to be understood with revealing unnoticed value-criteria.

S	Pierre, JM		Karagiannis, D; Reimer, U		Pierre, JM			Mining knowledge from text collections using automatically generated metadata	PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Practical Aspects of Knowledge Management	DEC 02-03, 2002	VIENNA, AUSTRIA	Univ Vienna, Inst Informat & Business Informat, Dept Knowledge Management				Data mining is typically applied to large databases of highly structured information in order to discover new knowledge. In businesses and institutions, the amount of information existing in repositories of text documents usually rivals or surpasses the amount found in relational databases. Though the amount of potentially valuable knowledge contained in document collections can be great, they are often difficult to analyze. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to efficiently discover knowledge embedded in these document repositories. In this paper we describe an approach for mining knowledge from text collections by applying data mining techniques to metadata records generated via automated text categorization. By controlling the set of metadata fields as well as the set of assigned categories we can customize the knowledge discovery task to address specific questions. As an example, we apply the approach to a large collection of product reviews and evaluate the performance of the knowledge discovery.

These vast quantities of data further have to be transformed into relevant value-added and "decision-quality" knowledge. It is against this background that the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases), a multidisciplinary field using computer learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, database technology, expert systems, and data visualization, appeared in the early 90's. In order to assess these technologies in the medical field, we have tested some of these techniques on a large database at our disposal, named DiabCare stemming from the WHO - DiabCare program for the application of the Saint-Vincent Declaration. It contains evaluation data on the health care of patients with diabetes, and in particular, its complications. So far, data analysis has been done using classical statistical methods, and we now intend to make use of such data-mining tools as Associations Rules and Decision and Classification Trees for further exploration of this database. The results presented here show that data mining techniques can be used successfully to extract knowledge from medical databases. The results obtained using Association Rules and especially Decision Trees are very promising.

The advantages of using SQL queries include their readability for non-experts and ease of integration with existing databases. The evolutionary algorithm (EA) used in our system is very different from existing EAs, but seems to be effective and efficient according to the experiments to date with three different testing data sets.

J	Shim, K; Srikant, R; Agrawal, R				Shim, K; Srikant, R; Agrawal, R			High-dimensional similarity joins	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; similar time sequences; similarity join		Many emerging data mining applications require a similarity join between points in a high-dimensional domain. We present a new algorithm that utilizes a new index structure, called the tree, for fast spatial similarity joins on high-dimensional points. This index structure reduces the number of neighboring leaf nodes that are considered for the join test, as well as the traversal cost of finding appropriate branches in the internal nodes. The storage cost for internal nodes is independent of the number of dimensions. Hence, the proposed index structure scales to high-dimensional data. We analyze the cost of the join for the tree and the R-tree family, and show that the tree will perform better for high-dimensional joins. Empirical evaluation, using synthetic and real-life data sets, shows that similarity join using the tree is twice to an order of magnitude faster than the R tree, with the performance gap increasing with the number of dimensions. We also discuss how some of the ideas of the tree can be applied to the R-tree family. These biased R-trees perform better than the corresponding traditional R-trees for high-dimensional similarity joins, but do not match the performance of the tree.

Recently grids, composed of large-scale, geographically distributed platforms working together, have emerged as effective architectures for high-performance decentralized computation. It is natural to consider grids as tools for distributed data-intensive applications such as data mining, but the underlying patterns of computation and data movement in such applications are different from those of more conventional high-performance computation. These differences require a different kind of grid, or at least a grid with significantly different emphases. This paper discusses the main issues, requirements, and design approaches for the implementation of grid-based knowledge discovery systems. Furthermore, some prospects and promising research directions in datacentric and knowledge-discovery oriented grids are outlined.

The TreeFinder algorithm aims at finding trees, such that their exactor perturbed copies are frequent in a collection of labelled trees. To cope with complexity issues, TreeFinder is correct but not complete: it finds a subset of the actually frequent trees. The default of completeness is experimentally investigated on artificial medium size datasets; it is shown that TreeFinder reaches completeness or falls short to it for a range of experimental settings.

Results from a qualitative survey of expert industrial software maintainers, their information needs and requirements when comprehending software are initially presented. We then review existing software tools which facilitate system level and program comprehension. Two successful methods from the fields of data mining and concept assignment are discussed, each addressing some of these requirements. Bile also describe how these methods can be coupled to produce a broader software comprehension method which partly satisfies all the requirements. Future directions including the closer integration of the techniques are also identified.

Although deigned for scalable management and data mining, the system can also support wide-area multicast and offers powerful aggregation mechanisms that permit applications to build customized virtual databases by extracting and summarizing data located throughout a large network. In contrast to other peer-to-peer systems, the Astrolabe hierarchy is purely an abstraction constructed by running our protocol on the participating hosts - there are no servers, and the system doesn't superimpose a specialized routing infrastructure or employ a DHT. This paper focuses on wide-area implementation challenges.

J	Lee, W; Fan, W				Lee, W; Fan, W			Mining system audit data: Opportunities and challenges	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article								Intrusion detection is an essential component of computer security mechanisms. It requires accurate and efficient analysis of a large amount of system and network audit data. It can thus be an application area of data mining. There are several characteristics of audit data: abundant raw data, rich system and network semantics, and ever "streaming". Accordingly, when developing data mining approaches, we need to focus on: feature extraction and construction, customization of (general) algorithms according to semantic information, and optimization of execution efficiency of the output models. In this paper, we describe a data mining framework for mining audit data for intrusion detection models. We discuss its advantages and limitations, and outline the open research problems.

The goal is to identify attributes suitable for evaluation and to aid in creating open data models. Methods: A three-stage visualization approach is applied. First, an overview of all classes in a database, second a detailed view of a specific class and third an analysis of individual attributes. Missing data is identified to enable specific efforts to improve data quality prior to analysis. For each class number of patients, attributes, and records per patient are provided. A condensed bar chart for each category of attributes (categorical, numerical, text and other) visualizes available content: The abscissa corresponds to the sequence of attributes; the ordinate represents completeness per attribute. By selection of a specific class, a detailed description is provided including mean completeness in each category as well as completeness per attribute. To analyse attributes that are collected at several time points per patient, a frequency distribution of records per patient can be generated. Results: The new methodology was applied to two clinical research databases consisting of 292 attributes (955 patients) and 224 attributes (610 patients), respectively, and resulted in major restructuring of the systems. A public website is provided for generation of mdplots.

J	Huyn, N				Huyn, N			Data analysis and mining in the life sciences	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article								Biotech companies routinely generate vast amounts of biological measurement data that must be analyzed rapidly and mined for diagnostic, prognostic, or drug evaluation purposes. While these data analysis tasks are critical to their success, they have not benefited from recent advances that emerged from database and KDD research. In this paper, we focus on two such tasks: on-line analysis of clinical study data, and mining broad datasets for biomarkers. We examine the new requirements that are not met by current data analysis technologies and we identify new database and KDD research to address these needs. We describe our experience implementing a Scientific OLAP system and a data mining platform for the support of biomarker discovery at SurroMed, and we outline some key technical challenges that must be overcome before data analysis and data mining technologies can be widely adopted in the biotech industry.

J	Kusiak, A; Law, IH; Dick, M				Kusiak, A; Law, IH; Dick, M			The G-algorithm for extraction of robust decision rules - Children's postoperative intra-atrial arrhythmia case study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						arrhythmia study; data mining; medical decision making; medical prognosis; rough sets	FONTAN OPERATION	Clinical medicine is facing a challenge of knowledge discovery from the growing volume of data. In this paper, a data mining algorithm (G-algorithm) is proposed for extraction of robust rules that can be used in clinical practice for better understanding and prevention of unwanted medical events. The G-algorithm is applied to the data set obtained for children born with a malformation of the heart (univentricular heart). As the result of the Fontan surgical procedure, designed to palliate the children, 10%-35% of patients postoperatively develop an arrhythmia known as the intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia. There is an obvious need to identify the children that may develop the tachycardia before the surgery is performed. Prior attempts to identify such children with statistical techniques have been unrewarding. The G-algorithm discussed in this paper shows that there exists an unambiguous relationship between measurable features and the tachycardia. The data set used in this study shows that, for 78.08% of infants, the occurrence of tachycardia can be accurately predicted. The authors' prior computational experience with diverse medical data sets indicates that the percentage of accurate predictions may become even higher if data on additional features is collected for a larger data set.

J	Barber, B; Hamilton, HJ				Barber, B; Hamilton, HJ			Parametric algorithms for mining share frequent itemsets	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery; data mining; itemsets; association rule mining; share based measures		Itemset share, the fraction of some numerical total contributed by items when they occur in itemsets, has been proposed as a measure of the importance of itemsets in association rule mining. The IAB and CAC algorithms are able to find share frequent itemsets that have infrequent subsets. These algorithms perform well, but they do not always find all possible share frequent itemsets. In this paper, we describe the incorporation of a threshold factor into these algorithms. The threshold factor can be used to increase the number of frequent itemsets found at a cost of an increase in the number of infrequent itemsets examined. The modified algorithms are tested on a large commercial database. Their behavior is examined using principles of classifier evaluation from machine learning.

A new approach to missing attribute values, called closest fit, is introduced in this paper. In this approach, for a given case (example) with a missing attribute value we search for another case that is as similar as possible to the given case. Cases can be considered as vectors of attribute values. The search is for the case that has as many as possible identical attribute values for symbolic attributes, or as the smallest possible value differences for numerical attributes. There are two possible ways to conduct a search: within the same class (concept) as the case with the missing attribute values, or for the entire set of all cases. For comparison, we also experimented with another approach to missing attribute values, where the missing values are replaced by the most common value of the attribute for symbolic attributes or by the average value for numerical attributes. All algorithms were implemented in the system OOMIS. Our experiments were performed on the preterm birth data sets provided by the Duke University Medical Center.

In FGBSPMA, each quantitative attribute is viewed as a linguistic variable, and can be divided into many candidate 1-dim fuzzy grids. FGBSPMA is consisted of two phases: one is to generate all the large 1-fuzzy sequences, the other is to generate all the fuzzy sequential patterns. FGBSPMA is a efficiently fuzzy sequential patterns mining algorithm, because FGBSPMA scans database only once and applies proper operations on rows of tables to generate large fuzzy sequences and fuzzy sequential patterns. An example is given to illustrate a detailed process for mining the fuzzy sequential patterns from a specified relation. From this example, we can show efficiency and usefulness of FGBSPMA.

One means of producing this diversity in nearest neighbour classifiers is to base the member classifiers on different feature subsets. In this paper we show four examples where this is the case. This has implications for the practice of feature subset selection (an important issue in CBR and data-mining) because it shows that, in some situations, there is no single best feature subset to represent a problem. We show that if diversity is emphasised in the development of the ensemble that the ensemble members appear to be local learners specializing in sub-domains of the problem space. The paper concludes with some proposals on how analysis of ensembles of local learners might provide insight on problem-space decomposition for hierarchical CBR.

We present an alternative, but complementary approach in which we search for empty regions in the data. We consider the problem of finding all maximal empty rectangles in large, two-dimensional data sets. We introduce a novel, scalable algorithm for finding all such rectangles. The algorithm achieves this with a single scan over a sorted data set and requires only a small bounded amount of memory. We also describe an algorithm to find all maximal empty hyper-rectangles in a multi-dimensional space. We consider the complexity of this search problem and present new bounds on the number of maximal empty hyper-rectangles. We briefly overview experimental results obtained by applying our algorithm to a synthetic data set.

In density biased sampling, the probability that a given point will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the dataset. We propose a general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in user requirements to sample for properties of interest, and can be tuned for specific data mining tasks. This allows great flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple random sampling. We describe our approach in derail, we analytically evaluate it, and show how it cart be optimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection. Finally we present a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed method, applying density-biased sampling on real and synthetic data sets, and employing clustering and outlier detection algorithms, thus highlighting the utility of our approach.

On-line journals pose new challenges in the areas of automated document analysis and content extraction, database citation records creation, data mining, and other document related applications. New techniques are needed to capture, classify, analyze, extract, modify, and reformat Web-based document information for Computer storage, access, and processing. At the National Library of Medicine (NLM) we are developing an automated system, temporarily code-named WebMARS for Web-Based Medical Article Record System, to create citation records for the MEDLINE (R) database. The system downloads and classifies Web document articles, parses and labels the article contents, extracts and reformats the citation information from the article, presents the entire citation to operators for reconciling (validation), and uploads the citation records to the MEDLINE database.

Both low and high level data is available and needs to be utilized. The information from lower levels is transferred to higher level using data histograms of lower level clusters. The clusters are formed and interpreted automatically so as to summarize the information given by the SOM, and to produce meaningful indicators that are useful also to problem domain experts.

The association rule discovery problem in particular has been widely studied. However; there are still some unresolved problems. For example, research on mining patterns in the evolution of numerical attributes is still lacking. This is both a challenging problem and one with significant practical application in business, science, and medicine. In this paper; we present a temporal association rule model for evolving numerical attributes. Metrics for qualifying a temporal association rule include the familiar measures of support and strength used in the traditional association rule mining and a new metric called density. The density metric not only gives us a way to extract the rules that best represent the data, but also provides an effective mechanism to prune the search space. An efficient algorithm is devised for mining temporal association rules, which utilizes all three thresholds (especially the strength) to prune the search space drastically. Moreover the resulting rules are represented in a concise manner via rule sets to reduce the output size. Experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.

The first of these taxonomies is based on knowledge of the mining objectives and mining algorithms. The second is based on various relationships that are found in data, including those between different types of data, different spatial locations of the data and different times of data capture. The paper then describes the ADaM data mining system, which was developed to address these requirements. The paper describes several data mining techniques that have been applied to remotely sensed data. The first type is target independent mining, which mines data for transients and trends, with mined results representing a highly concentrated form of the original data. The second type is the milling of vectors (representing multi-spectral or fused data) for association rules representing relationships between the various types of data represented by the elements of the vector. The third type mines data for association rules that characterize the texture of the data.

Uniform random sampling is frequently used in practice and also frequently criticized because it will miss small clusters. Many natural phenomena are known to follow Zipf's distribution and the inability of uniform sampling to find small clusters is of practical concern. Density Biased Sampling is proposed to probabilistically under-sample dense regions and oversample light regions. A weighted sample is used to preserve the densities of the original data. Density biased sampling naturally includes uniform sampling as a special case. A memory efficient algorithm is proposed that approximates density biased sampling using only a single scan of the data. We empirically evaluate density biased sampling using synthetic data sets that exhibit varying cluster size distributions finding up to a factor of six improvement over uniform sampling.

J	Lin, XM; Zhou, XM; Liu, CF				Lin, XM; Zhou, XM; Liu, CF			Efficient computation of a proximity matching in spatial databases	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						spatial query processing and data mining; database systems; algorithms		Spatial data mining recently emerges from a number of real applications, such as real-estate marketing, urban planning, weather forecasting, medical image analysis, road traffic accident analysis, etc. It demands for efficient solutions for many new, expensive, and complicated problems. In this paper, we investigate a proximity matching problem among clusters and features. The investigation involves proximity relationship measurement between clusters and features. We measure proximity in an average fashion to address possible non-uniform data distribution in a cluster. An efficient algorithm is proposed and evaluated to solve the problem. The algorithm applies a standard multistep paradigm in combining with novel lower and upper proximity bounds. The algorithm is implemented in several different modes. Our experiment results not only give a comparison among them but also illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Prior Knowledge in Economic Applications of Data Mining	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								A common form of prior knowledge in economic modelling concerns the monotonicity of relations between the dependent and explanatory variables. Monotonicity may also be an important requirement with a view toward explaining and justifying decisions based on such models. We explore the use of monotonicity constraints in classification tree algorithms. We present an application of monotonic classification trees to a problem in house pricing. In this preliminary study we found that the monotonic trees were only slightly worse in classification performance, but were much simpler than their non-monotonic counterparts.

J	Hilderman, RJ; Hamilton, HJ				Hilderman, Robert J.; Hamilton, Howard J.			Applying Objective Interestingness Measures in Data Mining Systems	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								One of the most important steps in any knowledge discovery task is the interpretation and evaluation of discovered patterns. To address this problem, various techniques, such as the chi-square test for independence, have been suggested to reduce the number of patterns presented to the user and to focus attention on those that are truly statistically significant. However, when mining a large database, the number of patterns discovered can remain large even after adjusting significance thresholds to eliminate spurious patterns. What is needed, then, is an effective measure to further assist in the interpretation and evaluation step that ranks the interestingness of the remaining patterns prior to presenting them to the user. In this paper, we describe a two-step pro cess for ranking the interestingness of discovered patterns that utilizes the chi-square test for independence in the first step and objective measures of interestingness in the second step. We show how this two-step process can be applied to ranking characterized / generalized association rules and data cubes.

The granule itself can be regarded a label of the collection (granule); it will be referred to as the canonical name of the granule. A relational model using these canonical names themselves as attribute values (their bit patterns or lists of members) is called a machine oriented data model. For moderate size databases, finding association rules, decision rules, and etc., are reduced to easy computation of set theoretical operations of these collections.

The characterization is typically made in terms of statistics drawn on system parameters such as CPU, I/O and network loads, and file access patterns. For example, NIDES maintains statistics on approximately 25 such parameters for each user. The cost of data collection, statistics computation, and intrusion detection are directly proportional to the number of parameters maintained per user. If we would like to achieve real-time responses to intrusion detection, then we need to minimize the number of parameters without adversely affecting the detection capabilities. In this chapter, we propose to use some of the feature reduction and selection techniques commonly used in data mining applications to reduce the computational and storage requirements of the intrusion detection methods. Since typically several of the user behavioral parameters are correlated, applying these techniques may reduce the number of parameters needed to represent the user behavior.

In this contribution we present the problems and the results of a retrospective, data driven analysis of two studies made in Frankfurt am Main between 1993 and 1997. Our approach includes the necessary steps of data mining, i.e. building up a data base, cleaning and preprocessing the data and finally choosing an adequate analysis for the medical patient data. We chose an architecture mainly based on a supervised neural network. The patient data is classified into two classes (survived and deceased). The importance of this classification for an early warning system is discussed.

That is the basis for computer-assisted radiology development. Further development of computer-assisted radiology is associated with the use of new intelligent capabilities such as multimedia support and data mining in order to discover the relevant knowledge for diagnosis. In this paper, we present our work on data mining in medical picture archiving systems. We use decision tree induction in order to learn the knowledge for computer-assisted image analysis. We are applying our method to interpretation of x-ray images for lung cancer diagnosis. We are describing describing our methodology on how to perform data mining on picture archiving systems and our tool for data mining. Results are given. The method has shown very good results so that we are going on to apply it to other medical image diagnosis tasks such as lymph node diagnosis in MRI and investigation of breast MRI.

It is different from existing evolutionary techniques in that it does not me indirect representations of a solution, such as bit strings or grammars. The algorithm uses decision trees of various sizes as individuals in the populations and operators, eg. crossover, are performed directly on the trees. When compared to C4.5 and CN2 on a benchmark of problems, BGP shows very good results.

In this paper, we present an n-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large data sets to predict the users' future requests. Since this is a prediction system, we cannot measure the recall in a traditional sense. I Ve, therefore, present the notion of applicability to give a measure of the ability to predict the next document. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show for n-gram based prediction when n is greater than three, we can increase precision by 20% or more for two realistic web logs. Also we present an efficient method that can compress our model to 30% of its original size so that the model can be loaded in main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web, including pre-sending, pre-fetching, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as web caching policies, Our tests are based on three realistic web logs. Our algorithm is implemented in a prediction system called WhatNext, which shows a marked improvement in precision and applicability over previous approaches.

Thus, it is highly expected that data mining methods will find interesting patterns from databases as reuse of stored data and be important for medical research and practice because human, beings cannot deal with such a huge amount of data.

In this paper we investigate the problem of data mining, that is, constructing decision rules from a set of primitive input data. The main contention is that there is a need to be able to generate decision rules and reason in presence of inconsistencies. Propositional default rides are generated in this paper. Based on Skowrons default rule generation method and our analysis of inconsistencies, we develop a method for default rule generation from a decision table and its corresponding reasoning method. Any Yet unseen object can be processed with the rides generated with our ride generating method and reasoning method.

A first generation of deductive database systems supported the notion of stratification for programs with negation and set aggregates. Stratification is simple to understand and efficient to implement but it is too restrictive; therefore, a second generation of systems seeks efficient support for more powerful semantics based on notions such as well-founded models and stable models. In this respect, a particularly powerful set of constructs is provided by the recently enhanced LDC++ system that supports (i) monotonic user-defined aggregates, (ii) XY-stratified programs, and (iii) the nondeterministic choice constructs under stable model semantics. This integrated set of primitives supports a terse formulation and efficient implementation for complex computations, such as greedy algorithms and data mining functions, yielding levels of expressive power unmatched by other deductive database systems.

It has been shown that such search procedures are problematic when applied to learning pseudo-independent (PI) models. Furthermore, some researchers have questioned whether PI models exist in practice. We present two non-trivial PI models which derive from a social study dataset. For one of them, the learned PI model reached ultimate prediction accuracy achievable given the data only, while using slightly more inference time than the learned non-PI model. These models provide evidence that PI models are not simply mathematical constructs. To develop efficient algorithms to learn PI models effectively we benefit from studying and understanding such models in depth. We further analyze how multiple PI submodels may interact in a larger domain model. Using this result, we show that the RML algorithm for learning PI models can learn moro complex PI models than previously known.

In this paper, we first formally analyze the facts that determine counting costs. Secondly, we present an on-line bitmap indexing technique to speed-up the counting process. Besides theoretical analysis, our implementation reports suggest that this indexing technique may reduce counting costs up to 50%, and almost at no costs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

For rule induction learning, we use an entropy function based on Hellinger divergence to measure the amount of information each inductive rule contains. For lazy learning, we also use the Hellinger measure to automatically generate attribute weights and to compute similarities between data values of non-numeric data types. Our system has been implemented and tested extensively on a number of well-known machine learning data sets. The performance of our system was favorable compared to those of other well-known classification learning techniques based on monostrategic learning methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, in analogy to data mining for structured databases, text mining is defined for textual collections. A central tool in text-mining is the analysis of concept relationship, which discovers connections between different concepts, as reflected in the collection. However, discovering these relationships is not sufficient, as they also have to be presented to the user in a meaningful and manageable way. In this paper we introduce a new family of visualization tools, which we coin circle graphs, which provide means for visualizing concept relationships mined from large collections. Circle graphs allow for instant appreciation of multiple relationships gathered from the entire collection. A special type of circle-graphs, called Trend Graphs, allows tracking of the evolution of relationships over time.

While most work on KDD has been concerned with structured databases, there has been little work on handling the huge amount of information that is available only in unstructured textual form. Given a collection of text documents, most approaches to text mining perform knowledge-discovery operations on labels associated with each document. At one extreme, these labels are keywords that represent the results of non-trivial keyword-labeling processes, and, at the other extreme, these labels are nothing more than a list of the words within the documents of interest. This paper presents an intermediate approach, one that we call text mining via information extraction, in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of events and phrases that are extracted from and label each document. These events plus additional higher-level entities are then organized in a hierarchical taxonomy and are used in the knowledge discovery process. This approach was implemented in the Textoscope system. Textoscope consists of a document retrieval module which converts retrieved documents from their native formats into SGML documents used by Textoscope; an information extraction engine, which is based on a powerful attribute grammar which is augmented by a rich background knowledge; a taxonomy-creation tool by which the user can help specify higher-level entities that inform the knowledge-discovery process; and a set of knowledge-discovery tools for the resulting event-labeled documents. We evaluate our approach on a collection of newswire stories extracted by Textoscope's own agent. Our results confirm that Text Mining via information extraction serves as an accurate and powerful technique by which to manage knowledge encapsulated in large document collections.

In this paper, we use a novel, fuzzy logic approach to perform hypothesis testing. The method involves four major steps: hypothesis formulation, data selection (sampling), hypothesis testing (data mining), and decision (results). In the hypothesis formulation step, a null hypothesis and set of alternative hypotheses are created using conjunctive antecedents and consequent functions. In the data selection step, a subset D of the set of all data in the database is chosen as a sample set. This sample should contain enough objects to be representative of the data to a certain degree of satisfaction. In the third step, the fuzzy implication is performed for the data in D for each hypothesis and the results are combined using some aggregation function. These results are used in the final step to determine if the null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. The method is applied to a real-world data set of medical diagnoses. The automated perception approach is used for comparing the mapping functions of fuzzy hypotheses, tested on different age groups ("young" and "old"). The results are compared to the "crisp" hypothesis testing.

Thus, in analogy to data mining for structured databases, text mining is defined for textual collections. A central tool in text mining is the analysis of concept relationship, which discovers connections between different concepts, as reflected in the corpus. Most previous work on text mining in general, and concept relationship in particular, viewed the entire corpus as one monolithic entity. However, large corpuses are often composed of documents with different characteristics, Most importantly, documents are often tagged with timestamps (e.g, news articles), and thus represent the state of the domain in different time periods. In this paper we introduce a new technique for analyzing and visualizing differences and similarities in the concept relationships, as they are reflected in different segments of the corpus. Focusing on the case of timestamped documents, we introduce Trend Graphs, which provide a graphical tool for analyzing and visualizing the dynamic changes in concept relationships over time. Trend Graphs thus provide a tool for tracking the evaluation of the corpus over time, highlighting trends and discontinuities.

This approach is based on the combination of Generalization Distribution Table (GDT) and the rough set methodology. The GDT provides a probabilistic basis for evaluating the strength of a rule. It is used to find the rules with larger strengths from possible rules. Furthermore, the rough set methodology is used to find minimal relative reducts from the set of rules with larger strengths. The strength of a rule represents the uncertainty of the rule, which is influenced by both unseen instances and noises. By using our approach, a minimal set of rules with larger strengths can be acquired from databases with noisy, incomplete data. We have applied this approach to discover rules from some real databases.

Approaches proposed so far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decision tree based on symbolic learning methods. In this paper, we use artificial neural network to mine classification rules. We present a novel approach, called LBSB, composed of two phases to extract rules from artificial neural network and discover knowledge in databases. Some experiments have demonstrated that our method generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

In order to turn this voluminous data into valuable information it is necessary to apply analysis techniques to build models and characteristics of data. This paper gives an overview of a range of techniques used for data analysis collectively known as data mining. Three broad categories of data mining techniques are suggested and the reader is introduced to popular algorithms within each category. References to additional algorithms are also presented so that the reader may gain more detailed information if required.

J	D'Haen, J; Van den Poel, D; Thorleuchter, D				D'Haen, Jeroen; Van den Poel, Dirk; Thorleuchter, Dirk			Predicting customer profitability during acquisition: Finding the optimal combination of data source and data mining technique	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Marketing analytics; Predictive analytics; Data source; B2B; Web mining; Web crawling; Bagging; Profitability; Customer acquisition; External commercial data	OPERATIONAL-RESEARCH; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; CHURN; MODEL	The customer acquisition process is generally a stressful undertaking for sales representatives. Luckily there are models that assist them in selecting the 'right' leads to pursue. Two factors play a role in this process: the probability of converting into a customer and the profitability once the lead is in fact a customer. This paper focuses on the latter. It makes two main contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, it investigates the predictive performance of two types of data: web data and commercially available data. The aim is to find out which of these two have the highest accuracy as input predictor for profitability and to research if they improve accuracy even more when combined. Secondly, the predictive performance of different data mining techniques is investigated. Results show that bagged decision trees are consistently higher in accuracy. Web data is better in predicting profitability than commercial data, but combining both is even better. The added value of commercial data is, although statistically significant, fairly limited.

J	Baecke, P; Van den Poel, D				Baecke, Philippe; Van den Poel, Dirk			Including spatial interdependence in customer acquisition models: A cross-category comparison	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customer intelligence; Data mining; Autologistic model; Multilevel model; Neighborhood effects; Spatial interdependence	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; AUTOLOGISTIC MODEL; ROC CURVE; REGRESSION; PRODUCT; CLASSIFICATION; DIFFUSION; VARIABLES; ACCURACY	Within analytical customer relationship management (CRM), customer acquisition models suffer the most from a lack of data quality because the information of potential customers is mostly limited to socio-demographic and lifestyle variables obtained from external data vendors. Particularly in this situation, taking advantage of the spatial correlation between customers can improve the predictive performance of these models. This study compares an autoregressive and hierarchical technique that both are able to incorporate spatial information in a model that can be applied on large datasets, which is typical for CRM. Predictive performances of these models are compared in an application that identifies potential new customers for 25 products and brands. The results show that when a discrete spatial variable is used to group customers into mutually exclusive neighborhoods, a multilevel model performs at least as well as, and for a large number of durable goods even significantly better than a frequently used autologistic model. Further, this application provides interesting insights for marketing decision makers. It indicates that especially for publicly consumed durable goods neighborhood effects can be identified. However, for more exclusive brands, incorporating spatial information will not always result in major predictive improvements. For these luxury products, the high spatial interdependence is mainly caused by homophily in which the spatial variable is a substitute for absent socio-demographic and lifestyle variables. As a result, these neighborhood variables lose a lot of predictive value on top of a traditional acquisition model that typically is based on such non-transactional variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kamiran, F; Calders, T				Kamiran, Faisal; Calders, Toon			Data preprocessing techniques for classification without discrimination	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; Preprocessing; Discrimination-aware data mining		Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.

J	Wu, LX; Qin, K; Liu, SJ				Wu, Li-xin; Qin, Kai; Liu, Shan-jun			GEOSS-Based Thermal Parameters Analysis for Earthquake Anomaly Recognition	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Earthquake; remote sensing; temperature	WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; TEMPERATURE-CHANGES; MAJOR EARTHQUAKES; SATELLITE; ABNORMALITIES; PRECURSORS; RADIATION; FAILURE; ROCKS	Although earthquakes are difficult to be predicted because of the complexity of the Earth system and the uncertainty of seismogenic processes, GEOSS provides multiple sources of observation data and brings a possibility to extract a thermal anomaly that would have a significant effect on earthquake prediction. Referring to the analysis on the lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere (LCA) coupling due to stress enhancement in seismogenic zone, six thermal parameters, including surface latent heat flux (SLHF), thermal infrared radiation (TIR), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), diurnal temperature range (DTR), atmospheric temperature, and skin temperature, are selected for GEOSS-based earthquake anomaly recognition (EAR). The inherent relations between the six thermal parameters are preliminarily introduced in consideration of possible LCA coupling. With over-quantity, quasi-synchronism, and geo-consistency being defined as three rules for data mining, a deviation-time-space-thermal (DTS-T) EAR method as well as its procedures are developed in this paper. With 2008 M7.3 Yutian earthquake, China, 2008 M8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, China, and 2010 M7.1 Christchurch earthquake, New Zealand, being examples of tectonic earthquakes, the technical procedures of DTS-T method are demonstrated, which show that the obtained compositive thermal anomaly has a significant effect on earthquake prediction.

J	Stumpfe, D; Bajorath, J				Stumpfe, Dagmar; Bajorath, Juergen			Frequency of Occurrence and Potency Range Distribution of Activity Cliffs in Bioactive Compounds	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY LANDSCAPE; MULTITARGET ACTIVITY CLIFFS; SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION; DATA SETS; DATABASE	We have systematically identified activity cliffs in bioactive compounds for which high-confidence potency data were available. Different molecular representations were utilized and similarity and potency difference criteria for activity cliffs were clearly defined. Cliff formation was studied across the global potency range observed for qualifying bioactive compounds. Depending on the specific representation of activity cliffs, between similar to 12% and 34% of all active compounds meeting the data selection criteria were involved in the formation of at least one activity cliff spanning a potency difference of at least two orders of magnitude. However, these cliffs involved only between similar to 4.7% and, similar to 5.7% of all compound pairs meeting the similarity criteria. Hence, in light of these findings, the formation of well-defined activity cliffs is a relatively rare event. Moreover, the potency range distribution of activity cliffs was analyzed in detail, revealing that most activity cliffs were formed between compounds with micro- and nanomolar potency, consistent with the global distribution of potency data. On the basis of our analysis, we propose a general definition of activity cliffs for data mining.

Thus, a novel Rough-Set-based data mining strategy has been formulated to resolve the inconsistency in a distance protective relay's decision system (i.e. a transformed relay event report) in such a way that the relay's timing characteristics hidden in its decision algorithm of protection operations have been successfully discovered. Using Rough Set Theory, the inherent uncertainty and vagueness in the relay event report have been resolved using the concepts of discernibility, elementary sets and set approximations. The timing characteristics that have been successfully discovered are in relation to the relay trip assertion activity, impedance element activation, fault characteristics, circuit breaker operation and its overall decision system approximation.

J	Baralis, E; Cagliero, L; Cerquitelli, T; Garza, P				Baralis, Elena; Cagliero, Luca; Cerquitelli, Tania; Garza, Paolo			Generalized association rule mining with constraints	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Generalized association rules; Data mining algorithms; Knowledge discovery; Context-aware mining; Network traffic analysis; Mining with constraints	INTRUSION DETECTION; DATABASES; PATTERNS	Generalized association rule extraction is a powerful tool to discover a high level view of the interesting patterns hidden in the analyzed data. However, since the patterns are extracted at any level of abstraction, the mined rule set may be too large to be effectively exploited in the decision making process. Thus, to discover valuable and interesting knowledge a post-processing step is usually required. This paper presents the CoGAR framework to efficiently support constrained generalized association rule mining. The generalization process of CoGAR exploits a (user-provided) multiple-taxonomy to drive an opportunistic itemset generalization process, which prevents discarding relevant but infrequent knowledge by aggregating features at different granularity levels. Besides the traditional support and confidence constraints, two further constraints are enforced: (i) schema constraints and (ii) the opportunistic confidence constraint. Schema constraints allow the analyst to specify the structure of the patterns of interest and drive the itemset mining phase. The opportunistic confidence constraint, a new constraint proposed in this paper, allows us to discriminate between significant and redundant rules by analyzing similar rules belonging to different abstraction levels. This constraint is enforced during the rule generation step. Experiments performed on real datasets collected in two different application domains show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed framework in mining constrained generalized association rules.

J	Lin, ZJ; Lyu, MR; King, I				Lin, Zhenjiang; Lyu, Michael R.; King, Irwin			MatchSim: a novel similarity measure based on maximum neighborhood matching	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Link-based similarity measure; Link analysis; Web mining; Maximum matching	TIME-SERIES; WEB	Measuring object similarity in a graph is a fundamental data- mining problem in various application domains, including Web linkage mining, social network analysis, information retrieval, and recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on the neighbor-based approach that is based on the intuition that "similar objects have similar neighbors" and propose a novel similarity measure called MatchSim. Our method recursively defines the similarity between two objects by the average similarity of the maximum-matched similar neighbor pairs between them. We show that MatchSim conforms to the basic intuition of similarity; therefore, it can overcome the counterintuitive contradiction in SimRank. Moreover, MatchSim can be viewed as an extension of the traditional neighbor-counting scheme by taking the similarities between neighbors into account, leading to higher flexibility. We present the MatchSim score computation process and prove its convergence. We also analyze its time and space complexity and suggest two accelerating techniques: (1) proposing a simple pruning strategy and (2) adopting an approximation algorithm for maximum matching computation. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that although our method is less efficient computationally, it outperforms classic methods in terms of accuracy.

In this work, we propose a novel ontology-based user profile learning. Particularly, we aim to learn context-enriched user profiles using data mining techniques and ontologies. We are interested in knowing to what extent data mining techniques can be used for user profile generation, and how to utilize ontologies for user profile improvement. The objective is to semantically enrich a user profile with contextual information by using association rules, Bayesian networks and ontologies in order to improve agent performance. At runtime, we learn which the relevant contexts to the user are based on the user's behavior observation. Then, we represent the relevant contexts learnt as ontology segments. The encouraging experimental results show the usefulness of including semantics into a user profile as well as the advantages of integrating agents and data mining using ontologies.

Nowadays it denotes the media environment and the communication of information in ubiquitous and pervasive environments. With the addition of intelligence, the new field of semantic ambient media was established. In recent years, the field of semantic ambient media has spread its span from only a few sub-areas, such as ambient advertising, to new ones, such as ambient-assisted living (AAL) and health-monitoring media, significantly supported by intelligence. The study presented in this paper provides an advanced introduction to the field of semantic ambient media including the solutions for threat issues and illustration of success stories of the field. It conducts a survey of the related work and presents a thorough discussion of it. The related work is grouped according to the coverage of the principles of semantic ambient media. Based on the state-of-the-art research, the future possibilities of the field are demonstrated, especially for the ambient-assisted living, audio-visual rendering of media objects, user design principles and the society impact of the field. The paper provides ideas for impacting ambient media and directions and questions for further research. It also discusses the potential of the combination of several research studies.

At present, the evaluation of SAR transfer potential from a data mining perspective is still in its infancy. Only recently, a first computational approach has been introduced to evaluate SAR transfer events. Here, a substructure relationship-based molecular network representation has been used as a starting point to systematically identify SAR transfer series in large compound data sets. For this purpose, a methodology is introduced that consists of two stages. For graph mining, an algorithm has been designed that extracts all parallel series from compound data sets. A parallel series is formed by two series of analogs with different core structures but pairwise corresponding substitution patterns. The SAR transfer potential of identified parallel series is then evaluated using a scoring function that emphasizes corresponding potency progression over many analog pairs and large potency ranges. The substructure relationship-based molecular network in combination with the graph mining algorithm currently represents the only generally applicable approach to systematically detect SAR transfer events in large compound data sets. The combined approach has been evaluated on a large number of compound data sets and shown to systematically identify SAR transfer series.

These range from personal collections to medical and scientific images that are currently collected in large databases. Many users and organizations now can acquire large numbers of images and it has been very important to retrieve relevant multimedia resources and to effectively locate matching images in the large databases. In this context, content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) have become very popular for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images with minimum human intervention. The research community are competing for more efficient and effective methods as CBIR systems may be heavily employed in serving time critical applications in scientific and medical domains. This paper proposes an extremely fast CBIR system which uses Multiple Support Vector Machines Ensemble. We have used Daubechies wavelet transformation for extracting the feature vectors of images. The reported test results are very promising. Using data mining techniques not only improved the efficiency of the CBIR systems, but they also improved the accuracy of the overall process.

This paper introduces a heuristic algorithm called BicFinder (The BicFinder software is available at: http://www.info.univ-angers.fr/pub/hao/BicFinder.html) for extracting biclusters from microarray data. BicFinder relies on a new evaluation function called Average Correspondence Similarity Index (ACSI) to assess the coherence of a given bicluster and utilizes a directed acyclic graph to construct its biclusters. The performance of BicFinder is evaluated on synthetic and three DNA microarray datasets. We test the biological significance using a gene annotation web-tool to show that our proposed algorithm is able to produce biologically relevant biclusters. Experimental results show that BicFinder is able to identify coherent and overlapping biclusters.

J	Cao, FY; Liang, JY; Li, DY; Bai, L; Dang, CY				Cao, Fuyuan; Liang, Jiye; Li, Deyu; Bai, Liang; Dang, Chuangyin			A dissimilarity measure for the k-Modes clustering algorithm	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Categorical data clustering; k-Modes algorithm; Rough membership function; Dissimilarity measure; Genetic taxonomy	ROUGH SET-THEORY; CATEGORICAL-DATA; SIMILARITY; ATTRIBUTES; VALUES	Clustering is one of the most important data mining techniques that partitions data according to some similarity criterion. The problems of clustering categorical data have attracted much attention from the data mining research community recently. As the extension of the k-Means algorithm, the k-Modes algorithm has been widely applied to categorical data clustering by replacing means with modes. In this paper, the limitations of the simple matching dissimilarity measure and Ng's dissimilarity measure are analyzed using some illustrative examples. Based on the idea of biological and genetic taxonomy and rough membership function, a new dissimilarity measure for the k-Modes algorithm is defined. A distinct characteristic of the new dissimilarity measure is to take account of the distribution of attribute values on the whole universe. A convergence study and time complexity of the k-Modes algorithm based on new dissimilarity measure indicates that it can be effectively used for large data sets. The results of comparative experiments on synthetic data sets and five real data sets from UCI show the effectiveness of the new dissimilarity measure, especially on data sets with biological and genetic taxonomy information.

J	Kulluk, S; Ozbakir, L; Baykasoglu, A				Kulluk, Sinem; Ozbakir, Lale; Baykasoglu, Adil			Training neural networks with harmony search algorithms for classification problems	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; Neural networks; Harmony search; Data mining; Learning	OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM	Training neural networks (NNs) is a complex task of great importance in the supervised learning area. However, performance of the NNs is mostly dependent on the success of training process, and therefore the training algorithm. This paper addresses the application of harmony search algorithms for the supervised training of feed-forward (FF) type NNs, which are frequently used for classification problems. In this paper, five different variants of harmony search algorithm are studied by giving special attention to Self-adaptive Global Best Harmony Search (SGHS) algorithm. A structure suitable to data representation of NNs is adapted to SGHS algorithm. The technique is empirically tested and verified by training NNs on six benchmark classification problems and a real-world problem. Among these benchmark problems two of them have binary classes and remaining four are n-ary classification problems. Real-world problem is related to the classification of most frequently encountered quality defect in a major textile company in Turkey. Overall training time, sum of squared errors, training and testing accuracies of SGHS algorithm, is compared with the other harmony search algorithms and the most widely used standard back-propagation (BP) algorithm. The experiments presented that the SGHS algorithm lends itself very well to the training of NNs and also highly competitive with the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy.

Providing accurate and reliable predictions is vital for both e-commerce companies and their customers. To offer such referrals, CF systems should have sufficient data. When data collected for CF purposes held by a central server, it is an easy task to provide recommendations. However, customers' preferences represented as ratings might be partitioned between two vendors. To supply trustworthy and correct predictions, such companies might desire to collaborate. Due to privacy concerns, financial fears, and legal issues; however, the parties may not want to disclose their data to each other. In this study, we scrutinize how to estimate item-based predictions on arbitrarily distributed data (ADD) between two e-commerce sites without deeply jeopardizing their privacy. We analyze our proposed scheme in terms of privacy; and demonstrate that the method does not intensely violate data owners' confidentiality. We conduct experiments using real data sets to show how coverage and quality of the predictions improve due to collaboration. We also investigate our scheme in terms of online performance; and demonstrate that supplementary online costs caused by privacy measures are negligible. Moreover, we perform trials to show how privacy concerns affect accuracy. Our results show that accuracy and coverage improve due to collaboration; and the proposed scheme is still able to offer truthful predictions with privacy concerns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hong, TP; Tung, YF; Wang, SL; Wu, YL; Wu, MT				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Tung, Ya-Fang; Wang, Shyue-Liang; Wu, Yu-Lung; Wu, Min-Thai			A multi-level ant-colony mining algorithm for membership functions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; Ant system; Ant colony system; Fuzzy set; Membership function; Multi-stage graph	FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; TRADE-OFF; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; NUMBER; TIME; ACO	Fuzzy data mining is used to extract fuzzy knowledge from linguistic or quantitative data. It is an extension of traditional data mining and the derived knowledge is relatively meaningful to human beings. In the past, we proposed a mining algorithm to find suitable membership functions for fuzzy association rules based on ant colony systems. In that approach, precision was limited by the use of binary bits to encode the membership functions. This paper elaborates on the original approach to increase the accuracy of results by adding multi-level processing. A multi-level ant colony framework is thus designed and an algorithm based on the structure is proposed to achieve the purpose. The proposed approach first transforms the fuzzy mining problem into a multi-stage graph, with each route representing a possible set of membership functions. The new approach then extends the previous one, using multi-level processing to solve the problem in which the maximum quantities of item values in the transactions may be large. The membership functions derived in a given level will be refined in the subsequent level. The final membership functions in the last level are then outputted to the rule-mining phase to find fuzzy association rules. Experiments are also performed to show the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-level ant colony systems mining approach can obtain improved results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is a new research discipline that has evolved significantly since the early work on idealistic process logs. Over the last years, process mining prototypes have incorporated elements from semantics and data mining and targeted visualisation techniques that are more user-friendly to business experts and process owners. In this article, we present a framework for evaluating different aspects of enterprise process flows and address practical challenges of state-of-the-art industrial process mining. We also explore the inherent strengths of the technology for more efficient process optimisation.

J	Podpecan, V; Zemenova, M; Lavrac, N				Podpecan, Vid; Zemenova, Monika; Lavrac, Nada			Orange4WS Environment for Service-Oriented Data Mining	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery; knowledge discovery ontology; e-science workflows; automated planning of data mining workflows	SUBGROUP DISCOVERY; SEARCH; SYSTEM	Novel data-mining tasks in e-science involve mining of distributed, highly heterogeneous data and knowledge sources. However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows. These new features are showcased in three real-world scenarios.

PSO is an efficient evolutionary optimization algorithm using the social behavior of living organisms to explore the search space. It is a relatively new population-based metaheuristic that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems. Furthermore, it is easy to code and robust to control parameters. To apply PROAFTN, the values of several parameters need to be determined prior to classification, such as boundaries of intervals and weights. In this study, the proposed technique is named PSOPRO, which utilizes PSO to elicit the PROAFTN parameters from examples during the learning process. To test the effectiveness of the methodology and the quality of the obtained models, PSOPRO is evaluated on 12 public-domain datasets and compared with the previous work applied on PROAFTN. The computational results demonstrate that PSOPRO is very competitive with respect to the most common classification algorithms. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

K.; Franklin, James			A text-based decision support system for financial sequence prediction	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Textual analysis; Decision support systems; Classifier based machine learning	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	Although most quantitative financial data are analyzed using traditional statistical, artificial intelligence or data mining techniques, the abundance of online electronic financial news articles has opened up new possibilities for intelligent systems that can extract and organize relevant knowledge automatically in a usable format. Most information extraction systems require a hand-built dictionary of templates and thus need continual modification to accommodate new patterns that are observed in the text. In this research, we propose a novel text-based decision support system (DSS) that (i) extracts event sequences from shallow text patterns, and (ii) predicts the likelihood of the occurrence of events using a classifier-based inference engine. The prediction relies on two major, but complementary, feature sets: adjacent events and a set of information-theoretic functions. In contrast to other approaches, the proposed text-based DSS gives explanatory hypotheses about its predictions from a coalition of intimations learned from the inference engine, while preserving robustness and without indulging in formalism. We investigate more than 2000 financial reports with 28,000 sentences. Experiments show that the prediction accuracy of our model outperforms similar statistical models by 7% for the seen data while significantly improving the prediction accuracy for the unseen data. Further comparisons substantiate the experimental findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chan, Samuel W.

J	Iam-On, N; Boongoen, T; Garrett, S; Price, C				Iam-On, Natthakan; Boongoen, Tossapon; Garrett, Simon; Price, Chris			A Link-Based Approach to the Cluster Ensemble Problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Clustering; cluster ensembles; cluster relations; link-based similarity; data mining	CLASS DISCOVERY; CONSENSUS; PARTITIONS; GRAPH	Cluster ensembles have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to standard cluster analysis, aggregating several input data clusterings to generate a single output clustering, with improved robustness and stability. From the early work, these techniques held great promise; however, most of them generate the final solution based on incomplete information of a cluster ensemble. The underlying ensemble-information matrix reflects only cluster-data point relations, while those among clusters are generally overlooked. This paper presents a new link-based approach to improve the conventional matrix. It achieves this using the similarity between clusters that are estimated from a link network model of the ensemble. In particular, three new link-based algorithms are proposed for the underlying similarity assessment. The final clustering result is generated from the refined matrix using two different consensus functions of feature-based and graph-based partitioning. This approach is the first to address and explicitly employ the relationship between input partitions, which has not been emphasized by recent studies of matrix refinement. The effectiveness of the link-based approach is empirically demonstrated over 10 data sets (synthetic and real) and three benchmark evaluation measures. The results suggest the new approach is able to efficiently extract information embedded in the input clusterings, and regularly illustrate higher clustering quality in comparison to several state-of-the-art techniques.

Multiple pheromone types and other extensions to the Ant-Miner classification rule discovery algorithm	SWARM INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Data mining; Classification; Multipheromone; Stubborn Ants	COLONY OPTIMIZATION	Ant-Miner is an ant-based algorithm for the discovery of classification rules. This paper proposes five extensions to Ant-Miner: (1) we utilize multiple types of pheromone, one for each permitted rule class, i.e. an ant first selects the rule class and then deposits the corresponding type of pheromone; (2) we use a quality contrast intensifier to magnify the reward of high-quality rules and to penalize low-quality rules in terms of pheromone update; (3) we allow the use of a logical negation operator in the antecedents of constructed rules; (4) we incorporate stubborn ants, an ACO variation in which an ant is allowed to take into consideration its own personal past history; (5) we use an ant colony behavior in which each ant is allowed to have its own values of the alpha and beta parameters (in a sense, to have its own personality). Empirical results on 23 datasets show improvements in the algorithm's performance in terms of predictive accuracy and simplicity of the generated rule set.

While existing research has significantly advanced the techniques for mining local and global patterns (the first two goals), very little attempt has been made to discover patterns across distributed databases (the third goal). Moreover, no framework currently exists to support the mining of all three types of patterns. This paper proposes solutions to discover patterns from distributed databases. More specifically, we consider pattern mining as a query process where the purpose is to discover patterns from distributed databases with patterns' relationships satisfying user specified query constraints. We argue that existing self-contained mining frameworks are neither efficient, nor feasible to fulfill the objective, mainly because their pattern pruning is single-database oriented. To solve the problem, we advocate a cross-database pruning concept and propose a collaborative pattern (CLAP) mining framework with cross-database pruning mechanisms for distributed pattern mining. In CLAP, distributed databases collaboratively exchange pattern information between sites so that each site can leverage information from other sites to gain cross-database pruning. Experimental results show that CLAP fits a niche position, and demonstrate that CLAP not only outperforms its other peers with significant runtime performance gains, but also helps find patterns incapable of being discovered by others.

J	Bandyopadhyay, S				Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra			Genetic algorithms for clustering and fuzzy clustering	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							PIXEL CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION DATA	Clustering has been an area of intensive research for several decades because of its multifaceted applications in innumerable domains. Clustering can be either Boolean, where a single data point belongs to exactly one cluster, or fuzzy, where a single data point can have nonzero belongingness to more than one cluster. Traditionally, optimization of some well-defined objective function has been the standard approach in both clustering and fuzzy clustering. Hence, researchers have investigated the utility of evolutionary computing and related techniques in this regard. The different approaches differ in their choice of the objective function and/or the optimization strategy used. In particular, clustering using genetic algorithms (GAs) has attracted attention of researchers, and has been studied extensively. This paper presents a short review of some of different approaches of GA-based clustering methods. Two techniques, one with fixed number of clusters and another with a variable number of fuzzy clusters, are described along with some experimental results on numerical as well as image data sets.

The contribution of four variable categories: customer information, card information, risk information, and transaction activity information are examined. The paper analyzes a process of dealing with variables when data is obtained from a database instead of a survey. Instead of considering the all 135 variables into the model directly, it selects the certain variables from the perspective of not only correlation but also economic sense. In addition to the accuracy of analytic results, the paper designs a misclassification cost measurement by taking the two types error and the economic sense into account, which is more suitable to evaluate the credit card churn prediction model. The algorithms used in this study include logistic regression and decision tree which are proven mature and powerful classification algorithms. The test result shows that regression performs a little better than decision tree. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The efficiency of any additive modeling technique relies significantly on the choice of the weak learners and the form of the loss function. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-resolution approach for choosing the weak learners during additive modeling. Our method applies insights from multi-resolution analysis and chooses the optimal learners at multiple resolutions during different iterations of the boosting algorithms, which are simple yet powerful additive modeling methods. We demonstrate the advantages of this novel framework in both classification and regression problems and show results on both synthetic and real-world datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository. Though demonstrated specifically in the context of boosting algorithms, our framework can be easily accommodated in general additive modeling techniques. Similarities and distinctions of the proposed algorithm with the popularly used methods like radial basis function networks are also discussed.

J	Thurau, C; Kersting, K; Wahabzada, M; Bauckhage, C				Thurau, Christian; Kersting, Kristian; Wahabzada, Mirwaes; Bauckhage, Christian			Convex non-negative matrix factorization for massive datasets	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Matrix factorization; Low-rank approximation; Data mining; Information retrieval; Large-scale data analysis	SCENE; HULL	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as "cluster centroids" of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft (A (R))guilds, respectively.

In this work, we illustrate the striking analytical power of massive collections of trajectory data in unveiling the complexity of human mobility. We present the results of a large-scale experiment, based on the detailed trajectories of tens of thousands private cars with on-board GPS receivers, tracked during weeks of ordinary mobile activity. We illustrate the knowledge discovery process that, based on these data, addresses some fundamental questions of mobility analysts: what are the frequent patterns of people's travels? How big attractors and extraordinary events influence mobility? How to predict areas of dense traffic in the near future? How to characterize traffic jams and congestions? We also describe M-Atlas, the querying and mining language and system that makes this analytical process possible, providing the mechanisms to master the complexity of transforming raw GPS tracks into mobility knowledge. M-Atlas is centered onto the concept of a trajectory, and the mobility knowledge discovery process can be specified by M-Atlas queries that realize data transformations, data-driven estimation of the parameters of the mining methods, the quality assessment of the obtained results, the quantitative and visual exploration of the discovered behavioral patterns and models, the composition of mined patterns, models and data with further analyses and mining, and the incremental mining strategies to address scalability.

Rule mining has gained attention in the knowledge discovery literature. The problem of discovering rules with specific properties is treated as a multi objective optimization problem. The objectives to be optimized being the metrics like accuracy, comprehensibility, surprisingness, novelty to name a few. There are a variety of EMOO algorithms in the literature. The performance of these EMOO algorithms is influenced by various characteristics including evolutionary technique used, chromosome representation, parameters like population size, number of generations, crossover rate, mutation rate, stopping criteria, Reproduction operators used, objectives taken for optimization, the fitness function used, optimization strategy, the type of data, number of class attributes and the area of application. This study reviews EMOO systems taking the above criteria into consideration. There are other hybridization strategies like use of intelligent agents, fuzzification, meta data and meta heuristics, parallelization, interactiveness with the user, visualization, etc., which further enhance the performance and usability of the system. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Genetic Programming (GPs) are two widely used evolutionary strategies for rule knowledge discovery in Data mining. Thus the proposed study aims at studying the various characteristics of the EMOO systems taking into consideration the two evolutionary strategies of Genetic Algorithm and Genetic programming.

J	Skowron, A; Wasilewski, P				Skowron, Andrzej; Wasilewski, Piotr			Information systems in modeling interactive computations on granules	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Interactive computing; Interactive systems; Multi-agent systems; Rough sets; Granular computing; Wisdom technology	ROUGH SETS; APPROXIMATION SPACES; CLASSIFICATION; FOUNDATIONS	In this paper, we discuss the importance of information systems in modeling interactive computations performed on (complex) granules and we propose a formal approach to interactive computations based on generalized information systems and rough sets which can be combined with other soft computing paradigms such as fuzzy sets or evolutionary computing, but also with machine learning and data mining techniques. Information systems are treated as dynamic granules used for representing the results of the interaction of attributes with the environment. Two kinds of attributes are distinguished, namely, the perception attributes, including sensory attributes, and the action attributes. Sensory attributes are the basic perception attributes, other perception attributes are constructed on the basis of the sensory ones. Actions are activated when their guards, being often complex and vague concepts, are satisfied to a satisfactory degree. The guards can be approximated on the basis of measurements performed by sensory attributes rather than defined exactly. Satisfiability degrees for guards are results of reasoning called the adaptive judgment. The approximations are induced using hierarchical modeling. We show that information systems can be used for modeling more advanced forms of interactions in hierarchical modeling. The role of hierarchical interactions is emphasized in the modeling of interactive computations. Some illustrative examples of interactions used in the ACT-R 6.0 system are reported. ACT-R 6.0 is based on a cognitive architecture and can be treated as an example of a highly interactive complex granule which can be involved in hierarchical interactions. For modeling of interactive computations, we propose much more general information systems than the studied dynamic information systems (see, e.g., Ciucci (2010) [8] and Palasinski and Pancerz (2010)[32]). For example, the dynamic information systems are making it possible to consider incremental changes in information systems.

Recently, many computational methods have been used to discover maker genes, make class prediction and class discovery based on gene expression data of cancer tissue. However, those techniques fall short on some critical areas. These included (a) interpretation of the solution and extracted knowledge. (b) Integrating various sources data and incorporating the prior knowledge into the system. (c) Giving a global understanding of biological complex systems by a complete knowledge discovery framework. This paper proposes a multiple-kernel SVM based data mining system. Multiple tasks, including feature selection, data fusion, class prediction, decision rule extraction, associated rule extraction and subclass discovery, are incorporated in an integrated framework. ALL-AML Leukemia dataset is used to demonstrate the performance of this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recommender Systems: An Overview	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case-based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many online e-commerce applications such as Amazon.com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and introduces the various articles in the special issue.

J	Li, HF; Huang, HY; Lee, SY				Li, Hua-Fu; Huang, Hsin-Yun; Lee, Suh-Yin			Fast and memory efficient mining of high-utility itemsets from data streams: with and without negative item profits	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Data streams; Utility mining; High-utility itemsets; Utility itemset with positive item profits; Utility itemset with negative item profits	FREQUENT ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM	Mining utility itemsets from data steams is one of the most interesting research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery. In this paper, two efficient sliding window-based algorithms, MHUI-BIT (Mining High-Utility Itemsets based on BITvector) and MHUI-TID (Mining High-Utility Itemsets based on TIDlist), are proposed for mining high-utility itemsets from data streams. Based on the sliding window-based framework of the proposed approaches, two effective representations of item information, Bitvector and TIDlist, and a lexicographical tree-based summary data structure, LexTree-2HTU, are developed to improve the efficiency of discovering high-utility itemsets with positive profits from data streams. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform than the existing approaches for discovering high-utility itemsets from data streams over sliding windows. Beside, we also propose the adapted approaches of algorithms MHUI-BIT and MHUI-TID in order to handle the case when we are interested in mining utility itemsets with negative item profits.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Prediction; causal explanation; theory building; theory testing; statistical model; data mining; modeling process	ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS; CLASSIFIER TECHNOLOGY; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; USER ACCEPTANCE; MODELS; AUCTIONS; REGRESSION; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; VARIANCE	This research essay highlights the need to integrate predictive analytics into information systems research and shows several concrete ways in which this goal can be accomplished. Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analvtics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power. We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.

J	Guns, T; Nijssen, S; De Raedt, L				Guns, Tias; Nijssen, Siegfried; De Raedt, Luc			Itemset mining: A constraint programming perspective	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Itemset mining; Constraint programming	SUBGROUP DISCOVERY; ALGORITHMS; FUTURE; SEARCH; ART	The field of data mining has become accustomed to specifying constraints on patterns of interest. A large number of systems and techniques has been developed for solving such constraint-based mining problems, especially for mining itemsets. The approach taken in the field of data mining contrasts with the constraint programming principles developed within the artificial intelligence community. While most data mining research focuses on algorithmic issues and aims at developing highly optimized and scalable implementations that are tailored towards specific tasks, constraint programming employs a more declarative approach. The emphasis lies on developing high-level modeling languages and general solvers that specify what the problem is, rather than outlining how a solution should be computed, yet are powerful enough to be used across a wide variety of applications and application domains. This paper contributes a declarative constraint programming approach to data mining. More specifically, we show that it is possible to employ off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques for modeling and solving a wide variety of constraint-based itemset mining tasks, such as frequent, closed, discriminative, and cost-based itemset mining. In particular, we develop a basic constraint programming model for specifying frequent itemsets and show that this model can easily be extended to realize the other settings. This contrasts with typical procedural data mining systems where the underlying procedures need to be modified in order to accommodate new types of constraint, or novel combinations thereof. Even though the performance of state-of-the-art data mining systems outperforms that of the constraint programming approach on some standard tasks, we also show that there exist problems where the constraint programming approach leads to significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in data mining and as well as to new insights into the underlying data mining problems. Many such insights can be obtained by relating the underlying search algorithms of data mining and constraint programming systems to one another. We discuss a number of interesting new research questions and challenges raised by the declarative constraint programming approach to data mining. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Song, Z; Geng, XL; Kusiak, A; Xu, C				Song, Zhe; Geng, Xiulin; Kusiak, Andrew; Xu, Chang			Mining Markov chain transition matrix from wind speed time series data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Wind speed time series; Wind power; Evolutionary algorithms; Markov chain; Optimization	MODEL	Extracting important statistical patterns from wind speed time series at different time scales is of interest to wind energy industry in terms of wind turbine optimal control, wind energy dispatch/scheduling, wind energy project design and assessment, and so on. In this paper, a systematic way is presented to estimate the first order (one step) Markov chain transition matrix from wind speed time series by two steps. Wind speed time series data is used first to generate basic estimators of transition matrices (i.e. first order, second order, third order, etc.) based on counting techniques. Then an evolutionary algorithm (EA), specifically double-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm (ES), is proposed to search for the first order Markov chain transition matrix which can best match these basic estimators after transforming the first order transition matrix into its higher order counterparts. The evolutionary search for the first order transition matrix is guided by a predefined cost function which measures the difference between the basic estimators and the first order transition matrix, and its high order transformations. To deal with the potential high dimensional optimization problem (i.e. large transition matrices), an enhanced offspring generation procedure is proposed to help the ES algorithm converge efficiently and find better Pareto frontiers through generations.

J	Wang, YF; Wang, DH; Chai, TY				Wang, Yongfu; Wang, Dianhui; Chai, Tianyou			Extraction and Adaptation of Fuzzy Rules for Friction Modeling and Control Compensation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptation; control compensation; data mining; extraction; friction modeling; fuzzy rules	OUTPUT-FEEDBACK CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION; APPROXIMATION; SELECTION	Modeling of friction forces has been a challenging task in mechanical engineering. Parameterized approaches for modeling friction find it difficult to achieve satisfactory performance due to the presence of nonlinearity and uncertainties in dynamical systems. This paper aims to develop adaptive fuzzy friction models by the use of data-mining techniques and system theory. Our main technical contributions are twofold: extraction of fuzzy rules and formulation of a static fuzzy friction model and adaptation of the fuzzy friction model by the use of the Lyapunov stability theory, which is associated with a control compensation of a typical motion dynamics. The proposed framework in this paper shows a successful application of adaptive data-mining techniques in engineering. A single-degree-of-freedom mechanical system is employed as an experimental model in simulation studies. Results demonstrate that our proposed fuzzy friction model has promise in the design of uncertain mechanical control systems.

J	Liu, Y; Yu, XH; Huang, JX; An, AJ				Liu, Yang; Yu, Xiaohui; Huang, Jimmy Xiangji; An, Aijun			Combining integrated sampling with SVM ensembles for learning from imbalanced datasets	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data sampling; Classification; Imbalanced data mining	OIL-SPILLS; IMAGES	Learning from imbalanced datasets is difficult. The insufficient information that is associated with the minority class impedes making a clear understanding of the inherent structure of the dataset. Most existing classification methods tend not to perform well on minority class examples when the dataset is extremely imbalanced, because they aim to optimize the overall accuracy without considering the relative distribution of each class. In this paper, we study the performance of SVMs, which have gained great success in many real applications, in the imbalanced data context. Through empirical analysis, we show that SVMs may suffer from biased decision boundaries, and that their prediction performance drops dramatically when the data is highly skewed. We propose to combine an integrated sampling technique, which incorporates both over-sampling and under-sampling, with an ensemble of SVMs to improve the prediction performance. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms individual SVMs as well as several other state-of-the-art classifiers. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lomax, S; Vadera, S				Lomax, Susan; Vadera, Sunil			An empirical comparison of cost-sensitive decision tree induction algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						cost-sensitive learning; decision trees; data mining	KNOWLEDGE	Decision tree induction is a widely used technique for learning from data, which first emerged in the 1980s. In recent years, several authors have noted that in practice, accuracy alone is not adequate, and it has become increasingly important to take into consideration the cost of misclassifying the data. Several authors have developed techniques to induce cost-sensitive decision trees. There are many studies that include pair-wise comparisons of algorithms, but the comparison including many methods has not been conducted in earlier work. This paper aims to remedy this situation by investigating different cost-sensitive decision tree induction algorithms. A survey has identified 30 cost-sensitive decision tree algorithms, which can be organized into 10 categories. A representative sample of these algorithms has been implemented and an empirical evaluation has been carried. In addition, an accuracy-based look-ahead algorithm has been extended to a new cost-sensitive look-ahead algorithm and also evaluated. The main outcome of the evaluation is that an algorithm based on genetic algorithms, known as Inexpensive Classification with Expensive Tests, performed better over all the range of experiments thus showing that to make a decision tree cost-sensitive, it is better to include all the different types of costs, that is, cost of obtaining the data and misclassification costs, in the induction of the decision tree.

Nonapproximability of the normalized information distance	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						Normalized information distance; Kolmogorov complexity; Semicomputability	COMPRESSION; STRINGS	Normalized information distance (NID) uses the theoretical notion of Kolmogorov complexity, which for practical purposes is approximated by the length of the compressed version of the file involved, using a real-world compression program. This practical application is called 'normalized compression distance' and it is trivially computable. It is a parameter-free similarity measure based on compression, and is used in pattern recognition, data mining, phylogeny, clustering, and classification.

GENERATING BALANCED LEARNING AND TEST SETS FOR FUNCTION APPROXIMATION PROBLEMS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; data distribution; nearest-neighbor; function approximation; least-squares support vector machines	TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CROSS-VALIDATION; ACCURACY ESTIMATION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; VARIABLE SELECTION; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; INFERENCE; MODEL	In function approximation problems, one of the most common ways to evaluate a learning algorithm consists in partitioning the original data set (input/output data) into two sets: learning, used for building models, and test, applied for genuine out-of-sample evaluation. When the partition into learning and test sets does not take into account the variability and geometry of the original data, it might lead to non-balanced and unrepresentative learning and test sets and, thus, to wrong conclusions in the accuracy of the learning algorithm. How the partitioning is made is therefore a key issue and becomes more important when the data set is small due to the need of reducing the pessimistic effects caused by the removal of instances from the original data set. Thus, in this work, we propose a deterministic data mining approach for a distribution of a data set (input/output data) into two representative and balanced sets of roughly equal size taking the variability of the data set into consideration with the purpose of allowing both a fair evaluation of learning's accuracy and to make reproducible machine learning experiments usually based on random distributions. The sets are generated using a combination of a clustering procedure, especially suited for function approximation problems, and a distribution algorithm which distributes the data set into two sets within each cluster based on a nearest-neighbor approach. In the experiments section, the performance of the proposed methodology is reported in a variety of situations through an ANOVA-based statistical study of the results.(a)	[Florido, J.

A personalized digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) digital TV program recommendation system is ideal for providing TV program suggestions based on statistics results obtained from analyzing large-scale data. The frequency and duration of the programs that users have watched are collected and weighted by data mining techniques. A large dataset produces results that best represent a viewer's preferences of TV programs in a specific area. To process such a massive amount of viewer preference data, the bottleneck of scalability and computing power must be removed. In this paper, an architecture for a TV program recommendation system based on cloud computing and a map-reduce framework, the map-reduce version of k-means and the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, is introduced and applied. The proposed architecture provides a scalable and powerful backend to support the demand of large-scale data processing for a program recommendation system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores the learning performance of various students using a data mining technique, an artificial neural network (ANN), as the core of AL-TESL-e-learning system. Three different levels of teaching content for vocabulary, grammar, and reading were set for adaptive learning in the AL-TESL-e-learning system. Finally, this study explores the feasibility of the proposed AL-TESL-e-learning system by comparing the results of the regular online course control group with the AL-TESL-e-learning system adaptive learning experiment group. Statistical results show that the experiment group had better learning performance than the control group; that is, the AL-TESL-e-learning system was better than a regular online course in improving student learning performance.

Solving flexible flow-shop problem with a hybrid genetic algorithm and data mining: A fuzzy approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Flexible flow-shop scheduling; Genetic algorithm; Data mining; Attribute-driven deduction; Fuzzy sets	SCHEDULING PROBLEM; SHOP; 2-STAGE; TIME; HEURISTICS; MECHANISM; MACHINES	In this paper, an efficient algorithm is presented to solve flexible flow-shop problems using fuzzy approach. The goal is to minimize the total job tardiness. We assume parallel machines with different operation times. In this algorithm, parameters like "due date" and "operation time" follow a triangular fuzzy number. We used data mining technique as a facilitator to help in finding a better solution in such combined optimization problems. Therefore, using a combination of genetic algorithm and an attribute-deductive tool such as data mining, a near optimal solution can be achieved. According to the structure of the presented algorithm, all of the feasible solutions for the flexible flow-shop problem are considered as a database. Via data mining and attribute-driven deduction algorithm, hidden relationships among reserved solutions in the database are extracted. Then, genetic algorithm can use them to seek an optimum solution. Since there are inherited properties in the solutions provided by genetic algorithm, future generation should have the same behavioral models more than preliminary ones.

As such, they cannot be applied to streaming data which are continuous, transient, and usually unbounded. Moreover, in streaming applications, there is a need to offer strong guarantees on the maximum allowed delay between incoming data and the corresponding anonymized output. To cope with these requirements, in this paper, we present Continuously Anonymizing STreaming data via adaptive cLustEring (CASTLE), a cluster-based scheme that anonymizes data streams on-the-fly and, at the same time, ensures the freshness of the anonymized data by satisfying specified delay constraints. We further show how CASTLE can be easily extended to handle l-diversity. Our extensive performance study shows that CASTLE is efficient and effective w.r.t. the quality of the output data.

Semantic preprocessing for mining sensor streams from heterogeneous environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ontology; Semantic sensor networks; Data streams; Preprocessing; Stream mining	WEB; NETWORK; FRAMEWORK	Many studies have tried to employ data mining methods to discover useful patterns and knowledge from data streams on sensor networks. However, it is difficult to apply such data mining methods to the sensor streams intermixed from heterogeneous sensor networks. In this paper, to improve the performance of conventional data mining methods, we propose an ontology-based data preprocessing scheme, which is composed of two main phases: (i) session identification and (ii) error detection. The ontology can provide and describe semantics of data measured by each sensor. Thus, by comparing the semantics, we can find out not only relationships between sensor streams but also temporal dynamics of a data stream. To evaluate the proposed method, we have collected sensor streams from in our building during 30 days. By using two well-known data mining methods (i.e., co-occurrence pattern and sequential pattern), the results from raw sensor streams and ones from sensor streams with preprocessing were compared with respect to two measurements recall and precision.

Discovery of high utility itemsets from on-shelf time periods of products	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Utility mining; High utility itemsets; On-shelf data	DATABASES	Utility mining has recently been an emerging topic in the field of data mining. It finds out high utility itemsets by considering both the profits and quantities of items in transactions. It may have a bias if items are not always on shelf. In this paper, we thus design a new kind of patterns, named high on-shelf utility itemsets, which considers not only individual profit and quantity of each item in a transaction but also common on-shelf time periods of a product combination. We also propose a two-phased mining algorithm to effectively and efficiently discover high on-shelf utility itemsets. In the first phase, the possible candidate on-shelf utility itemsets within each time period are found level by level. In the second phase, the candidate on-shelf utility itemsets are further checked for their actual utility values by an additional database scan. At last, the experimental results on synthetic datasets also show the proposed approach has a good performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its reduction is of strategic importance as it contributes to cost decreasing, time-to-market shortening, faster fault detection, achieving throughput targets, and improving production-resource scheduling. To reduce CT, we suggest and investigate a data-driven approach that identifies key factors and predicts their impact on CT. In our novel approach, we first identify the most influential factors using conditional mutual information maximization, and then apply the selective naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC) for further selection of a minimal, most discriminative key-factor set for CT prediction. Applied to a data set representing a simulated fab, our SNBC-based approach improves the accuracy of CT prediction in nearly 40% while narrowing the list of factors from 182 to 20. It shows comparable accuracy to those of other machine learning and statistical models, such as a decision tree, a neural network, and multinomial logistic regression. Compared to them, our approach also demonstrates simplicity and interpretability, as well as speedy and efficient model training. This approach could be implemented relatively easily in the fab promoting new insights to the process of wafer fabrication.

This paper studies attribute reduction in fuzzy decision systems based on generalized fuzzy evidence theory. The definitions of several kinds of attribute reducts are introduced. The relationships among these reducts are then investigated. In a fuzzy decision system, it is proved that the concepts of fuzzy positive region reduct, lower approximation reduct and generalized fuzzy belief reduct are all equivalent, the concepts of fuzzy upper approximation reduct and generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct are equivalent, and a generalized fuzzy plausibility consistent set must be a generalized fuzzy belief consistent set. In a consistent fuzzy decision system, an attribute set is a generalized fuzzy belief reduct if and only if it is a generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct. But in an inconsistent fuzzy decision system, a generalized fuzzy belief reduct is not a generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High utility pattern mining becomes a very important research issue in data mining by considering the non-binary frequency values of items in transactions and different profit values for each item. However, most of the existing high utility pattern mining algorithms suffer in the level-wise candidate generation-and-test problem and generate too many candidate patterns. Moreover, they need several database scans which are directly dependent on the maximum candidate length. In this paper, we present a novel tree-based candidate pruning technique, called HUC-Prune (High Utility Candidates Prune), to solve these problems. Our technique uses a novel tree structure, called HUC-tree (High Utility Candidates tree), to capture important utility information of the candidate patterns. HUC-Prune avoids the level-wise candidate generation process by adopting a pattern growth approach. In contrast to the existing algorithms, its number of database scans is completely independent of the maximum candidate length. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm is very efficient for high utility pattern mining and it outperforms the existing algorithms.

Route patterns are extracted from personal trajectory data using a novel mining algorithm, Continuous Route Pattern Mining (CRPM), which can tolerate different kinds of disturbance in trajectory data. Furthermore, a client-server architecture is employed which has the dual purpose of guaranteeing the privacy of personal data and greatly reducing the computational load on mobile devices. An evaluation using a corpus of trajectory data from 17 people demonstrates that CRPM can extract longer route patterns than current methods. Moreover, the average correct rate of one step prediction of our system is greater than 71%, and the average Levenshtein distance of continuous route prediction of our system is about 30% shorter than that of the Markov model based method.

Among the operational issues in reentrant hybrid flow shops, we focus on the scheduling problem that determines the allocation of jobs to the machines at each stage as well as the sequence of the jobs assigned to each machine. Unlike the theoretical approach on reentrant hybrid flow shop scheduling, we suggest a real-time scheduling mechanism with a decision tree when selecting appropriate dispatching rules. The decision tree, one of the commonly used data mining techniques, is adopted to eliminate the computational burden required to carry out simulation runs to select dispatching rules. To illustrate the mechanism suggested in this study, a case study was performed on a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufacturing line and the results are reported for various system performance measures.

J	Lv, XL; Bi, GA; Wan, CR				Lv, Xiaolei; Bi, Guoan; Wan, Chunru			The Group Lasso for Stable Recovery of Block-Sparse Signal Representations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Block-coherence; group Lasso; orthogonal greedy algorithm; sparse representation	ORTHOGONAL MATCHING PURSUIT; MODEL SELECTION; OVERCOMPLETE REPRESENTATIONS; ALTERNATING PROJECTION; NOISE; DECOMPOSITION; DICTIONARIES; CONSISTENCY; REGRESSION; BASES	Group Lasso is a mixed l(1)/l(2)-regularization method for a block-wise sparse model that has attracted a lot of interests in statistics, machine learning, and data mining. This paper establishes the possibility of stably recovering original signals from the noisy data using the adaptive group Lasso with a combination of sufficient block-sparsity and favorable block structure of the over-complete dictionary. The corresponding theoretical results about the solution uniqueness, support recovery and representation error bound are derived based on the properties of block-coherence and subcoherence. Compared with the theoretical results on the parametrized quadratic program of conventional sparse representation, our stability results are more general. A comparison with block-based orthogonal greedy algorithm is also presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and correctness of theoretical derivation and also show that in case of noisy situation, the adaptive group Lasso has a better reconstruction performance than the quadratic program approach if the observed sparse signals have a natural block structure.

J	El-Sebakhy, EA				El-Sebakhy, Emad A.			Functional networks as a novel data mining paradigm in forecasting software development efforts	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Support vector machines; Neural networks; Type I fuzzy logic inference system; Data mining; Regression; Functional networks; Software development effort	DEVELOPMENT EFFORT PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELS; VALIDATION; CLASSIFIER	This paper proposes a new intelligence paradigm scheme to forecast that emphasizes on numerous software development elements based on functional networks forecasting framework. The most common methods for estimating software development efforts that have been proposed in literature are: line of code (LOC)-based constructive cost model (COCOMO), function point (FP) based on neural networks, regression, and case-based reasoning (CBR). Unfortunately, such forecasting models have numerous of drawbacks, namely, their inability to deal with uncertainties and imprecision present in software projects early in the development life-cycle. The main benefit of this study is to utilize both function points and development environments of recent software development cases prominent, which have high impact on the success of software development projects. Both implementation and learning process are briefly proposed. We investigate the efficiency of the new framework for predicting the software development efforts using both simulation and COCOMO real-life databases. Prediction accuracy of the functional networks framework is evaluated and compared with the commonly used regression and neural networks-based models. The results show that the new intelligence paradigm predicts the required efforts of the initial stage of software development with reliable performance and outperforms both regression and neural networks-based models.

Then, the blood flow is enormously affected, as well as the blood hemodynamic interaction forces acting on the arterial wall. These forces are the cause of the wall rupture. A mechanical quantity characteristic for the blood-wall interaction is the wall shear stress, which also has direct physiological effects on the endothelial cell behavior. Therefore, it is very important to have an insight into the blood flow and shear stress distribution when an aneurysm is developed in order to help correlating the mechanical conditions with the pathogenesis of pathological changes on the blood vessels. This insight can further help in improving the prevention of cardiovascular diseases evolution. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used in general as a tool to generate results for the mechanical conditions within blood vessels with and without aneurysms. However, aneurysms are very patient specific and reliable results from CFD analyses can be obtained by a cumbersome and time-consuming process of the computational model generation followed by huge computations. In order to make the CFD analyses efficient and suitable for future everyday clinical practice, we have here employed data mining (DM) techniques. The focus was to combine the CFD and DM methods for the estimation of the wall shear stresses in an abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) underprescribed geometrical changes. Additionally, computing on the grid infrastructure was performed to improve efficiency, since thousands of CFD runs were needed for creating machine learning data. We used several DM techniques and found that our DM models provide good prediction of the shear stress at the AAA in comparison with full CFD model results on real patient data.

J	Bouguila, N				Bouguila, Nizar			Count Data Modeling and Classification Using Finite Mixtures of Distributions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Count data; deterministic annealing expectation-maximization; Dirichlet; finite mixture models; Fisher kernel; generalized Dirichlet; Liouville; model selection; multinomial; shape modeling; support vector machine; text categorization; texture classification	INFORMATION CRITERION; BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION; TEXTURE; SELECTION; FEATURES	In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing accurate and flexible statistical representations for count data, which we often confront in many areas such as data mining, computer vision, and information retrieval. In particular, we analyze and compare several generative approaches widely used for count data clustering, namely multinomial, multinomial Dirichlet, and multinomial generalized Dirichlet mixture models. Moreover, we propose a clustering approach via a mixture model based on a composition of the Liouville family of distributions, from which we select the Beta-Liouville distribution, and the multinomial. The novel proposed model, which we call multinomial Beta-Liouville mixture, is optimized by deterministic annealing expectation-maximization and minimum description length, and strives to achieve a high accuracy of count data clustering and model selection. An important feature of the multinomial Beta-Liouville mixture is that it has fewer parameters than the recently proposed multinomial generalized Dirichlet mixture. The performance evaluation is conducted through a set of extensive empirical experiments, which concern text and image texture modeling and classification and shape modeling, and highlights the merits of the proposed models and approaches.

J	Dunlavy, DM; Kolda, TG; Acar, E				Dunlavy, Daniel M.; Kolda, Tamara G.; Acar, Evrim			Temporal Link Prediction Using Matrix and Tensor Factorizations	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Link mining; link prediction; evolution; tensor factorization; CANDECOMP; PARAFAC		The data in many disciplines such as social networks, Web analysis, etc. is link-based, and the link structure can be exploited for many different data mining tasks. In this article, we consider the problem of temporal link prediction: Given link data for times 1 through T, can we predict the links at time T + 1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out even further in time, i.e., links at time T + 2, T + 3, etc.? In this article, we consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix-and tensor-based methods for predicting future links. We present a weight-based method for collapsing multiyear data into a single matrix. We show how the well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value decomposition. Using a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition of the data, we illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure of temporal link data. Through several numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both matrix-and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data with varying periodic patterns.

This research attempts to construct a classification approach based on the hybrid use of case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GAs) for hypertension detection using anthropometric body surface scanning data. The obtained result reveals the relationship between a subject's 3D scanning data and hypertension disease. The GA is adopted to determine the appropriate feature weights for CBR. The proposed approaches were experimented and compared with a regular CBR and other widely used approaches including neural nets and decision trees. The experiment showed that applying GA to determine the suitable weights in CBR is a feasible approach to improving the effectiveness of case matching of hypertension disease. It also demonstrated that different weighted CBR approach presents better classification accuracy over the results obtained from other approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Boy. All rights reserved.

However, before WSNs become a commodity, several challenging issues remain to be resolved. Object-tracking sensor network (OTSN)-based applications are widely viewed as being among the most interesting applications of WSNs. OTSN is mainly used to track certain objects in a monitored area and to report their location to the application's users. However, OTSNs are well known for their energy consumption when compared with other WSN applications. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based tracking technique using sequential patterns (PTSPs) designed to achieve significant reductions in the energy dissipated by the OTSNs while maintaining acceptable missing rate levels. PTSP is tested against basic tracking techniques to determine the appropriateness of PTSP under various circumstances. Our experimental results have shown that PTSP outperforms all the other basic tracking techniques and exhibits significant amounts of savings in terms of the entire network's energy consumption.

While several commercial toolkits exist to encode molecules as so-called fingerprints, only a few open source implementations are available. The aim of this work is to introduce a library for exactly defined molecular decompositions, with a strong focus on the application of these features in machine learning and data mining. It provides several options such as search depth, distance cut-offs, atom-and pharmacophore typing. Furthermore, it provides the functionality to combine, to compare, or to export the fingerprints into several formats. Results: We provide a Java 1.6 library for the decomposition of chemical graphs based on the open source Chemistry Development Kit toolkit. We reimplemented popular fingerprinting algorithms such as depth-first search fingerprints, extended connectivity fingerprints, autocorrelation fingerprints (e. g. CATS2D), radial fingerprints (e. g. Molprint2D), geometrical Molprint, atom pairs, and pharmacophore fingerprints. We also implemented custom fingerprints such as the all-shortest path fingerprint that only includes the subset of shortest paths from the full set of paths of the depth-first search fingerprint. As an application of jCompoundMapper, we provide a command-line executable binary. We measured the conversion speed and number of features for each encoding and described the composition of the features in detail. The quality of the encodings was tested using the default parametrizations in combination with a support vector machine on the Sutherland QSAR data sets. Additionally, we benchmarked the fingerprint encodings on the large-scale Ames toxicity benchmark using a large-scale linear support vector machine. The results were promising and could often compete with literature results. On the large Ames benchmark, for example, we obtained an AUC ROC performance of 0.87 with a reimplementation of the extended connectivity fingerprint. This result is comparable to the performance achieved by a non-linear support vector machine using state-of-the-art descriptors. On the Sutherland QSAR data set, the best fingerprint encodings showed a comparable or better performance on 5 of the 8 benchmarks when compared against the results of the best descriptors published in the paper of Sutherland et al. Conclusions: jCompoundMapper is a library for chemical graph fingerprints with several tweaking possibilities and exporting options for open source data mining toolkits. The quality of the data mining results, the conversion speed, the LPGL software license, the command-line interface, and the exporters should be useful for many applications in cheminformatics like benchmarks against literature methods, comparison of data mining algorithms, similarity searching, and similarity-based data mining.

J	Chen, MY				Chen, Mu-Yen			A HYBRID MODEL FOR BUSINESS FAILURE PREDICTION - UTILIZATION OF PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						Particle swarm optimization; support vector machine; business failure prediction	FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; REGRESSION; BANKS	Bankruptcy has long been an important topic in finance and accounting research. Recent headline bankruptcies have included Enron, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. These bankruptcies and their financial fallout have become a serious public concern due to huge influence these companies play in the real economy. Many researchers began investigating bankruptcy predictions back in the early 1970s. However, until recently, most research used prediction models based on traditional statistics. In recent years, however, newly-developed data mining techniques have been applied to various fields, including performance prediction systems. This research applies particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain suitable parameter settings for a support vector machine (SVM) model and to select a subset of beneficial features without reducing the classification accuracy rate. Experiments were conducted on an initial sample of 80 electronic companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC). This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) The results indicate the business cycle factor mainly affects financial prediction performance and has a greater influence than financial ratios. (2) The closer we get to the actual occurrence of financial distress, the higher the accuracy obtained both with and without feature selection under the business cycle approach. For example, PSO-SVM without feature selection provides 89.37% average correct cross-validation for two quarters prior to the occurrence of financial distress. (3) Our empirical results show that PSO integrated with SVM provides better classification accuracy than the Grid search, and genetic algorithm (GA) with SVM approaches for companies as normal or under threat. (4) The PSO-SVM model also provides better prediction accuracy than do the Grid-SVM, GA-SVM, SVM, SOM, and SVR-SOM approaches for seven well-known UCI datasets. Therefore, this paper proposes that the PSO-SVM approach could be a more suitable method for predicting potential financial distress.

The researchers in this field have been facing two key challenges, namely reduction in runtime and memory usage. In this study, a novel method for efficient mining of frequent patterns over data streams is proposed. The method is based on sliding window model which divides the window into a number of panes. This method provides a new sliding window mechanism by utilizing a set of simple short lists. Each list stores related information about an item in the sliding window. The proposed mechanism dynamically adopts itself with the concept change. This method is empirically evaluated against recently proposed pane based sliding window algorithms. Experimental results on synthetically generated and real life data streams show the superiority of the proposed method with multiple orders of magnitude in terms of runtime and memory usage with respect to other pane based sliding window algorithms.

This paper presents an application of genetic programming to the evolution of fuzzy classifiers based on extended Boolean queries. Extended Boolean queries are well known concept in the area of fuzzy information retrieval. An extended Boolean query represents a complex soft search expression that defines a fuzzy set on the collection of searched documents. We interpret the data mining task as a fuzzy information retrieval problem and we apply a proven method for query induction from data to find useful fuzzy classifiers. The ability of the genetic programming to evolve useful fuzzy classifiers is demonstrated on two use cases in which we detect faulty products in a product processing plant and discover intrusions in a computer network.

Recently, several techniques have been introduced into the life-cycle of CBR for business failure prediction (BFP). The drawback of former researches on CBR-based BFP is that they only use total predictive accuracy when assessing CBR. In this research, we provide evidence on performance of CBR in Chinese BFP from various views of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative values. Data are collected from Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China. And we present how data are preprocessed from the view of data mining. The classical CBR model on the base of Euclidean metric, the grey CBR model on the base of grey coefficient metric, and the pseudo CBR model on the base of pseudo outranking relations are employed to make a comparative study on CBR's predictive performance in BFP. Meanwhile, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to be a baseline model for comparison. The results indicate that pseudo CBR produces better performance in Chinese BFP than classical CBR and grey CBR significantly on the whole, and it outperforms SVM marginally by total predictive accuracy and sensitivity, while it is not significantly worse than SVM by specificity.

Automatic image semantic interpretation using social action and tagging data	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Web 2.0; Social media; Collaborative annotation; Image semantics; Folksonomic features; Survey	ANNOTATION; RETRIEVAL; FOLKSONOMIES; PICTURES; SYSTEMS; RECOGNITION; STREAMS; TOOL	The plethora of social actions and annotations (tags, comments, ratings) from online media sharing Websites and collaborative games have induced a paradigm shift in the research on image semantic interpretation. Social inputs with their added context represent a strong substitute for expert annotations. Novel algorithms have been designed to fuse visual features with noisy social labels and behavioral signals. In this survey, we review nearly 200 representative papers to identify the current trends, challenges as well as opportunities presented by social inputs for research on image semantics. Our study builds on an interdisciplinary confluence of insights from image processing, data mining, human computer interaction, and sociology to describe the folksonomic features of users, annotations and images. Applications are categorized into four types: concept semantics, person identification, location semantics and event semantics. The survey concludes with a summary of principle research directions for the present and the future.

J	Sufi, F; Khalil, I				Sufi, Fahim; Khalil, Ibrahim			Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Abnormalities From Compressed ECG: A Data Mining-Based Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Cardiac abnormality detection; faster cardiovascular diagnosis; m-health; medical data mining; mobile telecardiology	SYSTEM; TELECARDIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; MECHANISM	Usage of compressed ECG for fast and efficient telecardiology application is crucial, as ECG signals are enormously large in size. However, conventional ECG diagnosis algorithms require the compressed ECG packets to be decompressed before diagnosis can be performed. This added step of decompression before performing diagnosis for every ECG packet introduces unnecessary delay, which is undesirable for cardiovascular diseased (CVD) patients. In this paper, we are demonstrating an innovative technique that performs real-time classification of CVD. With the help of this real-time classification of CVD, the emergency personnel or the hospital can automatically be notified via SMS/MMS/e-mail when a life-threatening cardiac abnormality of the CVD affected patient is detected. Our proposed system initially uses data mining techniques, such as attribute selection (i.e., selects only a few features from the compressed ECG) and expectation maximization (EM)-based clustering. These data mining techniques running on a hospital server generate a set of constraints for representing each of the abnormalities. Then, the patient's mobile phone receives these set of constraints and employs a rule-based system that can identify each of abnormal beats in real time. Our experimentation results on 50 MIT-BIH ECG entries reveal that the proposed approach can successfully detect cardiac abnormalities (e.g., ventricular flutter/fibrillation, premature ventricular contraction, atrial fibrillation, etc.) with 97% accuracy on average. This innovative data mining technique on compressed ECG packets enables faster identification of cardiac abnormality directly from the compressed ECG, helping to build an efficient telecardiology diagnosis system.

Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (L(Q)DA), Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) and Classification Tree (CT) are applied on two datasets for description of tyrosinase inhibitory activity from molecular structures. The first set included 701 tyrosinase inhibitors (TI) that are used for performance of inhibitory and non-inhibitory activity and the second one is for potency estimation of active compounds. 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are computed as molecular descriptors. CA is used to "rational" design of training (TS) and prediction set (PS) but it shows of not being adequate as classification technique. On the first data, the overall accuracies (Q) are 91.42%, 92.35% 91.88%, 91.79% for TS, and 91.04%, 92.43%, 88.24%, 89.36% for PS in LDA, QDA BLR and CT-based model, respectively, while the corresponding values obtained on the second one are 89.95%, 90.70%, 90.20%, 89.20% for TS and 83.71%, 84.44%, 82.96%, 82.22% for PS. A comparative analysis of used statistical techniques is held out taking into consideration generated posterior probability, accuracy, required assumptions and the form of predictor variables used. On the two datasets, results depicted by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves together with Multiple Comparison Procedures (MCP) show that QDA has in general the best behavior as classification algorithm. The results suggest that it will be possible to produce a better description of tyrosinase activity applying the statistical techniques presented in this report, which could increase the practicality of the in silico data mining for the discovery of novel Tls.

Because of the subjective considerations and the ambiguities involved in the detection, fuzzy data mining techniques can be an effective tool in assessing and identifying phishing websites for e-banking since it offers a more natural way of dealing with quality factors rather than exact values. In this paper, we present novel approach to overcome the 'fuzziness' in the e-banking phishing website assessment and propose an intelligent resilient and effective model for detecting e-banking phishing websites. The proposed model is based on fuzzy logic combined with data mining algorithms to characterize the e-banking phishing website factors and to investigate its techniques by classifying the phishing types and defining six e-banking phishing website attack criteria's with a layer structure. Our experimental results showed the significance and importance of the e-banking phishing website criteria (URL & Domain Identity) represented by layer one and the various influence of the phishing characteristic on the final e-banking phishing website rate.

Concept discovery on relational databases: New techniques for search space pruning and rule quality improvement	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						ILP; Data mining; MRDM; Concept discovery; Transitive rules; Support; Confidence	NATIONAL-TOXICOLOGY-PROGRAM; RODENT BIOASSAYS; 44 CHEMICALS; LOGIC; SYSTEM; PREDICTION; CARCINOGENICITY; ABDUCTION; SET; ILP	Multi-relational data mining has become popular due to the limitations of propositional problem definition in structured domains and the tendency of storing data in relational databases. Several relational knowledge discovery systems have been developed employing various search strategies, heuristics, language pattern limitations and hypothesis evaluation criteria, in order to cope with intractably large search space and to be able to generate high-quality patterns. In this work, we introduce an ILP-based concept discovery framework named Concept Rule Induction System (CRIS) which includes new approaches for search space pruning and new features, such as defining aggregate predicates and handling numeric attributes, for rule quality improvement. In CRIS, all target instances are considered together, which leads to construction of more descriptive rules for the concept. This property also makes it possible to use aggregate predicates more accurately in concept rule construction. Moreover, it facilitates construction of transitive rules. A set of experiments is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of proposed method in terms of accuracy and coverage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complement the costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. An important problem is how to construct RBAC systems with low complexity. In this article, we define the notion of weighted structural complexity measure and propose a role mining algorithm that mines RBAC systems with low structural complexity. Another key problem that has not been adequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roles with semantic meanings. In this article, we study the problem in two primary settings with different information availability. When the only information is user-permission relation, we propose to discover roles whose semantic meaning is based on formal concept lattices. We argue that the theory of formal concept analysis provides a solid theoretical foundation formining roles from a user-permission relation. When user-attribute information is also available, we propose to create roles that can be explained by expressions of user-attributes. Since an expression of attributes describes a real-world concept, the corresponding role represents a real-world concept as well. Furthermore, the algorithms we propose balance the semantic guarantee of roles with system complexity. Finally, we indicate how to create a hybrid approach combining top-down candidate roles. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

J	Park, H; Shim, K				Park, Hyoungmin; Shim, Kyuseok			Approximate algorithms with generalizing attribute values for k-anonymity	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy preservation; Anonymity; Data publishing; Data mining; Local recoding		When a table containing individual data is published, disclosure of sensitive information should be prohibitive. Since simply removing identifiers such as name and social security number may reveal the sensitive information by linking attacks which joins the published table with other tables on some attributes, the notion of k-anonymity which makes each record in the table be indistinguishable with k-1 other records by suppression or generalization has been proposed previously. It is shown to be NP-hard to k-anonymize a table minimizing information loss. The approximation algorithms with up to O(k) approximation ratio were proposed when generalization is used for anonymization. In this paper, we propose several approximation algorithms for k-anonymity with generalizing the attribute values by hierarchies that guarantee O(logk) approximation ratio and perform significantly better than the traditional algorithms. Since suppression of attributes is a special case of generalization of attributes with the hierarchies of two-level trees where the root nodes are '*' character, our approximation result works also for suppression methods. We next provide O(beta logk) approximate algorithms which gracefully adjust their running time according to the tolerance beta(>= 1) of the approximation ratios. We also present the approximate algorithms for both k-anonymity and C diversity with generalizing the attribute values by hierarchies. Experimental results confirm that our approximation algorithms perform significantly etter than traditional approximation algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An important issue in this process is to provide designers with sufficient design knowledge to find out what customers really want. This paper proposes a data mining method to facilitate this task. The method focuses on mining association rules that reflect the mapping relationship between customer needs and product specifications. Four objectives, support, confidence, interestingness and comprehensibility, are used for evaluating the extracted rules. To solve such a multi-objective problem, a Pareto-based GA is utilized to perform the rule extraction. Through computational experiments on an electrical bicycle case, it is shown that our approach is capable of extracting useful and interesting knowledge from a design database.

J	Bae, E; Bailey, J; Dong, GZ				Bae, Eric; Bailey, James; Dong, Guozhu			A clustering comparison measure using density profiles and its application to the discovery of alternate clusterings	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Clustering; Cluster analysis; Clustering comparison; Clustering similarity; Alternate clusterings; Alternate clustering algorithms	DISSIMILARITY; PARTITIONS	Data clustering is a fundamental and very popular method of data analysis. Its subjective nature, however, means that different clustering algorithms or different parameter settings can produce widely varying and sometimes conflicting results. This has led to the use of clustering comparison measures to quantify the degree of similarity between alternative clusterings. Existing measures, though, can be limited in their ability to assess similarity and sometimes generate unintuitive results. They also cannot be applied to compare clusterings which contain different data points, an activity which is important for scenarios such as data stream analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering similarity measure, known as ADCO, which aims to address some limitations of existing measures, by allowing greater flexibility of comparison via the use of density profiles to characterize a clustering. In particular, it adopts a 'data mining style' philosophy to clustering comparison, whereby two clusterings are considered to be more similar, if they are likely to give rise to similar types of prediction models. Furthermore, we show that this new measure can be applied as a highly effective objective function within a new algorithm, known as MAXIMUS, for generating alternate clusterings.

It allows users to quantify the usefulness or preferences of items using different values. Thus, it reflects the impact of different items. High utility itemsets mining is useful in decision-making process of many applications, such as retail marketing and Web service, since items are actually different in many aspects in real applications. However, due to the lack of "downward closure property", the cost of candidate generation of high utility itemsets mining is intolerable in terms of time and memory space. This paper presents a Two-Phase algorithm which can efficiently prune down the number of candidates and precisely obtain the complete set of high utility itemsets. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated by applying it to synthetic databases and two real-world applications. It performs very efficiently in terms of speed and memory cost on large databases composed of short transactions, which are difficult for existing high utility itemsets mining algorithms to handle. Experiments on real-world applications demonstrate the significance of high utility itemsets in business decision-making, as well as the difference between frequent itemsets and high utility itemsets.

In this framework, users can conduct data mining using their private information by storing them in their local storage. After the computation, they obtain only the mining result without disclosing private information to others. In most cases, the number of parties that can join conventional privacy-preserving data mining has been assumed to be only two. In our framework, we assume large numbers of parties join the protocol; therefore, not only scalability but also asynchronism and fault-tolerance is important. Considering this, we propose a k-mean algorithm combined with a decentralized cryptographic protocol and a gossip-based protocol. The computational complexity is O(log n) with respect to the number of parties n, and experimental results show that our protocol is scalable even with one million parties.

Extreme Data Mining: Inference from Small Datasets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY ARTMAP; SCHEDULING KNOWLEDGE; TRAINING SETS; ALGORITHM; DIFFUSION; SAMPLES	Neural networks have been applied successfully in many fields. However, satisfactory results can only be found under large sample conditions. When it comes to small training sets, the performance may not be so good, or the learning task can even not be accomplished. This deficiency limits the applications of neural network severely. The main reason why small datasets cannot provide enough information is that there exist gaps between samples, even the domain of samples cannot be ensured. Several computational intelligence techniques have been proposed to overcome the limits of learning from small datasets. We have the following goals: i. To discuss the meaning of "small" in the context of inferring from small datasets ii. To overview computational intelligence solutions for this problem. iii. To illustrate the introduced concepts with a real-life application.

Inspired by the concept of manifold learning, many discriminant embedding techniques have been introduced to seek low-dimensional discriminative manifold structure in the high-dimensional space for feature reduction and classification. However, such graph-embedding framework-based subspace methods usually confront two limitations: 1) since there is no available updating rule for local discriminant analysis with the additive data, it is difficult to design incremental learning algorithm and 2) the small sample size (SSS) problem usually occurs if the original data exist in very high-dimensional space. To overcome these problems, this paper devises a supervised learning method, called local discriminant subspace embedding (LDSE), to extract discriminative features. Then, the incremental-mode algorithm, incremental LDSE (ILDSE), is proposed to learn the local discriminant subspace with the newly inserted data, which applies incremental learning extension to the batch LDSE algorithm by employing the idea of singular value-decomposition (SVD) updating algorithm. Furthermore, the SSS problem is avoided in our method for the high-dimensional data and the benchmark incremental learning experiments on face recognition show that ILDSE bears much less computational cost compared with the batch algorithm.

J	Lin, SF; Cheng, YC				Lin, Sheng-Fuu; Cheng, Yi-Chang			TWO-STRATEGY REINFORCEMENT EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM USING DATA-MINING BASED CROSSOVER STRATEGY WITH TSK-TYPE FUZZY CONTROLLERS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Fuzzy system; Control; Symbiotic evolution; Reinforcement learning; FP-growth	SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DESIGN; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; RULES; MODEL; GA	This paper proposes a two-strategy reinforcement evolutionary algorithm using data-mining crossover strategy (TSR-EADCS) with a TSK-type fuzzy controller (TFC) for solving various control problems. The purpose of the R-EA DCS is not only to improve the design of traditional reinforcement signal but also to determine the suitable rules in a TEC and the suitable groups that are selected to perform crossover operation. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-strategy reinforcement signal to improve the performance of the traditional reinforcement signal design and uses the data mining technique to find suitable fuzzy rules and groups for evolution. The proposed TSR-EADCS consists of both structure and parameter learning. Ins fracture learning, the TSR-EADCS uses the self adaptive method to determine the suitability of TEC models between different numbers of fuzzy rules. In parameter learning, the TSR-EADCS uses the data-mining crossover strategy which is based on frequent pattern growth to select the suitable groups that are used to perform crossover operation. Illustrative examples are conducted to show the performance and applicability of the TSR-EADCS.

J	Zhang, ZH; Zhou, J				Zhang, Zhihao; Zhou, Jie			Transfer estimation of evolving class priors in data stream classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Concept drift; Transfer learning; Prior estimation	PRIOR PROBABILITIES	Data stream classification is a hot topic in data mining research. The great challenge is that the class priors may evolve along the data sequence. Algorithms have been proposed to estimate the dynamic class priors and adjust the classifier accordingly. However, the existing algorithms do not perform well on prior estimation due to the lack of samples from the target distribution. Sample size has great effects in parameter estimation and small-sample effects greatly contaminate the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter estimation method called transfer estimation. Transfer estimation makes use of samples not only from the target distribution but also from similar distributions. We apply this new estimation method to the existing algorithms and obtain an improved algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the improved algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms on both class prior estimation and classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

H.; Liu, Wei; Chang, Shih-Fu			Semi-Supervised Distance Metric Learning for Collaborative Image Retrieval and Clustering	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Distance metric learning; content-based image retrieval; multimedia data clustering	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; CONSTRAINTS; FRAMEWORK	Learning a good distance metric plays a vital role in many multimedia retrieval and data mining tasks. For example, a typical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system often relies on an effective distance metric to measure similarity between any two images. Conventional CBIR systems simply adopting Euclidean distance metric often fail to return satisfactory results mainly due to the well-known semantic gap challenge. In this article, we present a novel framework of Semi-Supervised Distance Metric Learning for learning effective distance metrics by exploring the historical relevance feedback log data of a CBIR system and utilizing unlabeled data when log data are limited and noisy. We formally formulate the learning problem into a convex optimization task and then present a new technique, named as "Laplacian Regularized Metric Learning" (LRML). Two efficient algorithms are then proposed to solve the LRML task. Further, we apply the proposed technique to two applications. One direct application is for Collaborative Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to explore the CBIR log data for improving the retrieval performance of CBIR systems. The other application is for Collaborative Image Clustering (CIC), which aims to explore the CBIR log data for enhancing the clustering performance of image pattern clustering tasks. We conduct extensive evaluation to compare the proposed LRML method with a number of competing methods, including 2 standard metrics, 3 unsupervised metrics, and 4 supervised metrics with side information.

However, the family of co-training paradigms, such as Tri-training and Co-Forest, is likely to mislabel an unlabeled example, thus downgrading the final performance In practical applications, the labeling process is not always free of error due to subjective reasons Even some mislabeled examples exist in the few labeled examples given Supervised clustering provides many benefits in data mining research, but it is generally ineffective with only a few labeled examples In this paper, a Classification algorithm based on Local Cluster Centers (CLCC) for data sets with a few labeled training data, is proposed This can reduce the interference of mislabeled data. including those provided by both domain experts and co-training paradigm algorithms The experimental results on UCI data sets show that CLCC achieves competitive classification accuracy as compared to other traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms, such as SMO, AdaBoost.

This process can assist with real-world prioritization problems that involve raw data in the form of noisy documents requiring significant amounts of pre-processing. The documents are linked to a set of instances to be ranked according to prediction criteria. In the case of manhole event prediction, which is a new application for machine learning, the goal is to rank the electrical grid structures in Manhattan (manholes and service boxes) according to their vulnerability to serious manhole events such as fires, explosions and smoking manholes. Our ranking results are currently being used to help prioritize repair work on the Manhattan electrical grid.

J	Dehuri, S; Cho, SB				Dehuri, Satchidananda; Cho, Sung-Bae			Evolutionarily optimized features in functional link neural network for classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Data mining; Functional link neural network; Genetic algorithms; Radial basis function network	SYSTEMS; NET	In this paper, an adequate set of input features is selected for functional expansion genetically for the purpose of solving the problem of classification in data mining using functional link neural network. The proposed method named as HFLNN aims to choose an optimal subset of input features by eliminating features with little or no predictive information and designs a more compact classifier. With an adequate set of basis functions, HFLNN overcomes the non-linearity of problems, which is a common phenomenon in single layer neural networks. The properties like simplicity of the architecture (i.e., no hidden layer) and the low computational complexity of the network (i.e., less number of weights to be learned) encourage us to use it in classification task of data mining. We present a mathematical analysis of the stability and convergence of the proposed method. Further the issue of statistical tests for comparison of algorithms on multiple datasets, which is even more essential in data mining studies, has been all but ignored. In this paper, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe, robust and non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of the HFLNN with functional link neural network (FLNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) classifiers over multiple datasets by an extensive set of simulation studies.

Privacy-Preserving Gradient-Descent Methods	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; gradient-descent method; secure multiparty computation; stochastic approach; least square approach		Gradient descent is a widely used paradigm for solving many optimization problems. Gradient descent aims to minimize a target function in order to reach a local minimum. In machine learning or data mining, this function corresponds to a decision model that is to be discovered. In this paper, we propose a preliminary formulation of gradient descent with data privacy preservation. We present two approaches-stochastic approach and least square approach-under different assumptions. Four protocols are proposed for the two approaches incorporating various secure building blocks for both horizontally and vertically partitioned data. We conduct experiments to evaluate the scalability of the proposed secure building blocks and the accuracy and efficiency of the protocols for four different scenarios. The excremental results show that the proposed secure building blocks are reasonably scalable and the proposed protocols allow us to determine a better secure protocol for the applications for each scenario.

J	Hsieh, TC; Wang, TI				Hsieh, Tung-Cheng; Wang, Tzone-I			A mining-based approach on discovering courses pattern for constructing suitable learning path	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Self-directed learner; Data mining; Formal Concept Analysis (FCA); Concept Lattice; Learning path	ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; SYSTEM; INFORMATION; PERSONALIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; ALGORITHM	In recent years, browser has become one of the most popular tools for searching information on the Internet. Although a person can conveniently find and download specific learning materials to gain fragmented knowledge, most of the materials are imperfect and have no particular order in the content. Therefore, most of the self-directed learners spend most of time in surveying and choosing the right learning materials collected from the Internet. This paper develops a web-based learning support system that harnesses two approaches, the learning path constructing approach and the learning object recommending approach. With collected documents and a learning subject from a learner, the system first discovers some candidate courses by using a data mining approach based on the Apriori algorithm. Next, the leaning path constructing approach, based on the Formal Concept Analysis, builds a Concept Lattice, using keywords extracted from some selected documents, to form a relationship hierarchy of all the concepts represented by the keywords. It then uses FCA to further compute mutual relationships among documents to decide a suitable learning path. For a chosen learning path, the support system uses both the preference-based and the correlation-based algorithms for recommending the most suitable learning objects or documents for each unit of the courses in order to facilitate more efficient learning for the learner. This e-learning support system can be embedded in any information retrieval system for surfers to do more efficient learning on the Internet. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, CW; Hong, TP; Lu, WH				Lin, Chun-Wei; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Lu, Wen-Hsiang			An Efficient Tree-based Fuzzy Data Mining Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy data mining; fuzzy set; quantitative value; CFFP trees; CFFP-growth; fuzzy frequent patterns	ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHM	In the past, many algorithms were proposed for mining association rules, most of which were based on items with binary values. In this paper, a novel tree structure called the compressed fuzzy frequent pattern tree (CFFP tree) is designed to store the related information in the fuzzy mining process. A mining algorithm called the CFFP-growth mining algorithm is then proposed based on the tree structure to mine the fuzzy frequent itemsets. Each node in the tree has to keep the membership value of the contained item as well as the membership values of its super-itemsets in the path. The database scans can thus be greatly reduced with the help of the additional information. Experimental results also compare the performance of the proposed approach both in the execution time and the number of tree nodes at two different numbers of regions, respectively.

The importance of being able to identify users can be significant given a wide variety of applications in electronic commerce, such as product recommendation, personalized advertising, etc. We create user profiles capturing the strength of users' behavioral patterns, which can be used to identify users. Our experiments indicate that these profiles can be more accurate at identifying users than decision trees when sufficient web activities are observed, and can achieve higher efficiency than Support Vector Machines. The comparisons demonstrate that profile-based methods for user identification provide a viable and simple alternative to this problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The multiple facets of the canonical direct unit implicational basis	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Implicational system; Closure operator; Closure system; Canonical direct unit basis; Lattice; Horn Boolean function	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; CLOSURE SYSTEMS	The notion of dependencies between "attributes" arises in many areas such as relational databases, data analysis, data-mining, formal concept analysis, knowledge structures .... Formalization of dependencies leads to the notion of so-called full implicational systems (or full family of functional dependencies) which is in one-to-one correspondence with the other significant notions of closure operator and of closure system. An efficient generation of a full implicational system (or a closure system) can be performed from equivalent implicational systems and in particular from the bases for such systems, for example, the so-called canonical basis. This paper shows the equality between five other bases originating from different works and satisfying various properties (in particular they are unit implicational systems). The three main properties of this unique basis are the directness, canonical and minimal properties, whence the name canonical direct unit implicational basis given to this unit implicational system. The paper also gives a nice characterization of this canonical basis and makes precise its link with the prime implicants of the Horn function associated to a closure operator. It concludes that it is necessary to compare more closely related works made independently, and with a different terminology, in order to take advantage of the really new results in these works.

J	Chapotot, F; Becq, G				Chapotot, Florian; Becq, Guillaume			Automated sleep-wake staging combining robust feature extraction, artificial neural network classification, and flexible decision rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						data mining; decision rule; machine learning; polysomnography; signal processing; sleep	EEG; SEGMENTATION; VALIDATION; MODEL	The classification of sleep wake stages suffers from poor standardization in scoring criteria and heterogeneous conditioning of polysomnographic signals. To improve applicability of fully automated sleep staging, we have designed a formal classification framework to rigorously (1) select robust candidate features, (2) emulate artificial neural network classifiers, and (3) assign sleep wake stages using flexible decision rules. An extensive database of 48 PSG records scored in 20 s epochs by two independent clinicians was used. A small subset of 2 s elementary epochs representative of each stages with unequivocal expert scores was selected to form a limited set of learning exemplars. From 16 statistical, spectral and non-linear candidate features extracted in 2 s epochs from EEG and EMG signals, a sequential forward search selected an optimal set of five features with a 22% error rate. Multiple layer perceptrons were trained from this optimal feature set while classification accuracy was assessed using the unequivocal instance subset. A simple majority vote among 10 consecutive classifier outputs ensured a final scoring resolution comparable to that of the experts. Poor classification performance was obtained for movement time, wakefulness, and intermediate sleep stages with a 36 +/- 15% error rate (Cohen's kappa 0.48 +/- 0.18). In contrast, deep and paradoxical sleep was classified with an 82% accuracy not far from inter-expert expert agreement (83 +/- 3%). Significant improvements should be expected using a larger learning set compensating for a high inter-individual variability, and decision rules incorporating more domain-knowledge.

Co-Training is a semi-supervised learning method that can reduce the amount of required labeled data through exploiting the available unlabeled data to improve the classification accuracy. It is assumed that the patterns are represented by two or more redundantly sufficient feature sets (views) and these views are independent given the class. On the other hand, most of the real-world pattern recognition tasks involve a large number of categories which may make the task difficult. The tree-structured approach is an output space decomposition method where a complex multi-class problem is decomposed into a set of binary sub-problems. In this paper, we propose two learning architectures to combine the merits of the tree-structured approach and Co-Training. We show that our architectures are especially useful for classification tasks that involve a large number of classes and a small amount of labeled data where the single-view tree-structured approach does not perform well alone but when combined with Co-Training, it can exploit effectively the independent views and the unlabeled data to improve the recognition accuracy.

J	Jozefowska, J; Lawrynowicz, A; Lukaszewski, T				Jozefowska, Joanna; Lawrynowicz, Agnieszka; Lukaszewski, Tomasz			The role of semantics in mining frequent patterns from knowledge bases in description logics with rules	THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article						frequent pattern discovery; ontologies; Semantic Web; DL-safe rules	DISJUNCTIVE DATALOG; ASSOCIATION RULES; FUNCTIONAL CLASS; DISCOVERY; WEB; OWL; SEQUENCE; DL	We propose a new method for mining frequent patterns in a language that combines both Semantic Web ontologies and rules. In particular, we consider the setting of using a language that combines description logics (DLs) with DL-safe rules. This setting is important for the practical application of data mining to the Semantic Web. We focus on the relation of the semantics of the representation formalism to the task of frequent pattern discovery, and for the core of our method, we propose an algorithm that exploits the semantics of the combined knowledge base. We have developed a proof-of-concept data mining implementation of this. Using this we have empirically shown that using the combined knowledge base to perform semantic tests can make data mining faster by pruning useless candidate patterns before their evaluation. We have also shown that the quality of the set of patterns produced may be improved: the patterns are more compact, and there are fewer patterns. We conclude that exploiting the semantics of a chosen representation formalism is key to the design and application of (onto-)relational frequent pattern discovery methods.

J	Aljaber, B; Stokes, N; Bailey, J; Pei, J				Aljaber, Bader; Stokes, Nicola; Bailey, James; Pei, Jian			Document clustering of scientific texts using citation contexts	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						Citation contexts; Document clustering; Text categorization	INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS; RETRIEVAL; ARTICLES	Document clustering has many important applications in the area of data mining and information retrieval. Many existing document clustering techniques use the "bag-of-words" model to represent the content of a document. However, this representation is only effective for grouping related documents when these documents share a large proportion of lexically equivalent terms. In other words, instances of synonymy between related documents are ignored, which can reduce the effectiveness of applications using a standard full-text document representation. To address this problem, we present a new approach for clustering scientific documents, based on the utilization of citation contexts. A citation context is essentially the text surrounding the reference markers used to refer to other scientific works. We hypothesize that citation contexts will provide relevant synonymous and related vocabulary which will help increase the effectiveness of the bag-of-words representation. In this paper, we investigate the power of these citation-specific word features, and compare them with the original document's textual representation in a document clustering task on two collections of labeled scientific journal papers from two distinct domains: High Energy Physics and Genomics. We also compare these text-based clustering techniques with a link-based clustering algorithm which determines the similarity between documents based on the number of co-citations, that is in-links represented by citing documents and out-links represented by cited documents. Our experimental results indicate that the use of citation contexts, when combined with the vocabulary in the full-text of the document, is a promising alternative means of capturing critical topics covered by journal articles. More specifically, this document representation strategy when used by the clustering algorithm investigated in this paper, outperforms both the full-text clustering approach and the link-based clustering technique on both scientific journal datasets.

J	Lin, KW; Hsieh, MH; Tseng, VS				Lin, Kawuu W.; Hsieh, Ming-Hua; Tseng, Vincent S.			A novel prediction-based strategy for object tracking in sensor networks by mining seamless temporal movement patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Location prediction; Seamless temporal movement patterns; Object tracking; Sensor networks; Data mining		Energy saving in sensor networks has received a great deal of research attention in recent years due to its wide applications. One important research issue is energy efficient object tracking in sensor networks (OTSNs). Past studies on energy saving in OTSNs can be divided into two main directions: (1) improvement in hardware design: and (2) improvement in software approaches. Many research papers save energy in hardware design, but few discuss software approaches. The intuitive way to conserve the energy of sensor nodes is to reduce the operation time of high-powered components. Utilizing the movement patterns of objects to save energy is one software approach. However, it did not take temporal information into consideration nor did it define a suitable segmenting time unit of time interval in advance. Due to the time interval between movements is a real number, an improper segmenting time unit may not discover the useful patterns, directly resulting in the inefficient object tracking. In this paper, we propose a seamless data mining algorithm named STMP-Mine to efficiently discover the temporal movement patterns of objects in sensor networks without predefining the segmenting time unit. Moreover, we propose novel location prediction strategies that employ the discovered temporal movement patterns to reduce prediction errors to save energy. With empirical evaluation on simulated data, STMP-Mine and the proposed prediction strategies are shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of scalability and energy efficiency.

J	Nettleton, DF; Orriols-Puig, A; Fornells, A				Nettleton, David F.; Orriols-Puig, Albert; Fornells, Albert			A study of the effect of different types of noise on the precision of supervised learning techniques	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Attribute noise; Class noise; Machine learning techniques; Noise impacts	ATTRIBUTE NOISE; ALGORITHMS	Machine learning techniques often have to deal with noisy data, which may affect the accuracy of the resulting data models. Therefore, effectively dealing with noise is a key aspect in supervised learning to obtain reliable models from data. Although several authors have studied the effect of noise for some particular learners, comparisons of its effect among different learners are lacking. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically comparing how different degrees of noise affect four supervised learners that belong to different paradigms. Specifically, we consider the Na < ve Bayes probabilistic classifier, the C4.5 decision tree, the IBk instance-based learner and the SMO support vector machine. We have selected four methods which enable us to contrast different learning paradigms, and which are considered to be four of the top ten algorithms in data mining (Yu et al. 2007). We test them on a collection of data sets that are perturbed with noise in the input attributes and noise in the output class. As an initial hypothesis, we assign the techniques to two groups, NB with C4.5 and IBk with SMO, based on their proposed sensitivity to noise, the first group being the least sensitive. The analysis enables us to extract key observations about the effect of different types and degrees of noise on these learning techniques. In general, we find that Na < ve Bayes appears as the most robust algorithm, and SMO the least, relative to the other two techniques. However, we find that the underlying empirical behavior of the techniques is more complex, and varies depending on the noise type and the specific data set being processed. In general, noise in the training data set is found to give the most difficulty to the learners.

J	Radosavljevic, V; Vucetic, S; Obradovic, Z				Radosavljevic, Vladan; Vucetic, Slobodan; Obradovic, Zoran			A Data-Mining Technique for Aerosol Retrieval Across Multiple Accuracy Measures	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Aerosol retrieval; metalearning; neural networks		A typical approach in supervised learning is to select an accuracy measure and train a predictor that maximizes it. This can be insufficient in remote-sensing applications where predictor performance is often evaluated over multiple domain-specific accuracy measures. Here, we test the hypothesis that predictors can be trained to maximize performance over multiple accuracy measures. To do this, we evaluate several metalearning algorithms on the problem of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. The multiple accuracy measures included mean squared error, correlation, relative squared error, and fraction of satisfactory predictions. The proposed metalearning algorithms have a two-layer architecture, where the first layer consists of multiple neural networks, each trained using a different accuracy measure, and the second layer aggregates decisions of the first layer predictors. To evaluate AOD predictors, we used nearly 70 000 collocated data points whose attributes were radiances, solar and view angles, and terrain elevation from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument satellite observations and whose target AOD variable was obtained from the ground-based AEROsol robotic NETwork (AERONET) instruments. The data were collected at 221 AERONET locations over the globe in the period between 2005 and 2007. AOD prediction accuracies of neural networks were compared to the recently developed operational MODIS C005 retrieval algorithm and to several other data-mining methods. Results showed that neural networks are better at reproducing the test data than the operational retrieval algorithm and that predictors obtained by metalearning are robust over multiple accuracy measures.

Conditional Probability-Based Significance Tests for Sequential Patterns in Multineuronal Spike Trains	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL FIRING PATTERNS; RELATIVE-TIME ORDER; GROUPING ALGORITHM; NEURONS; CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPUS; SEQUENCES; NETWORKS	We consider the problem of detecting statistically significant sequential patterns in multineuronal spike trains. These patterns are characterized by ordered sequences of spikes from different neurons with specific delays between spikes. We have previously proposed a data-mining scheme to efficiently discover such patterns, which occur often enough in the data. Here we propose a method to determine the statistical significance of such repeating patterns. The novelty of our approach is that we use a compound null hypothesis that not only includes models of independent neurons but also models where neurons have weak dependencies. The strength of interaction among the neurons is represented in terms of certain pair-wise conditional probabilities. We specify our null hypothesis by putting an upper bound on all such conditional probabilities. We construct a probabilistic model that captures the counting process and use this to derive a test of significance for rejecting such a compound null hypothesis. The structure of our null hypothesis also allows us to rank-order different significant patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach using spike trains generated with a simulator.

Extending classical association rule mining approaches in consideration of time in order to obtain temporal information/knowledge is deemed important for decision support. which is nowadays one of the key Issues in business intelligence. This paper presents the notion of multi-temporal patterns with four different temporal predicates, namely before. during, equal and overlap, and discusses a number of related properties, based on which a mining algorithm is designed This enables Lis to effectively discover multi-temporal patterns in large-scale temporal databases by reducing the database scan in the generation of candidate patterns The proposed approach is then applied to stock markets, aimed at exploring possible associative movements between the stock markets of Chinese mainland and Hong Kong so as to provide helpful knowledge for investment decisions (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Yu, KM; Zhou, JY				Yu, Kun-Ming; Zhou, Jiayi			Parallel TID-based frequent pattern mining algorithm on a PC Cluster and grid computing system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; Association rules; Data mining; Grid computing; Cluster computing	TREES	The mining of frequent patterns from transaction-oriented databases is an important subject. Frequent patterns are fundamental in generating association rules, time series, etc. Most frequent pattern mining algorithms can be classified into two categories: generate-and-test approach (Apriori-like) and pattern growth approach (FP-tree). In recent years, many techniques have been proposed for frequent pattern mining based on the FP-tree approach since it only needs two database scans. However, for pattern growth methods, the execution time increases rapidly when the database size increases or when the given support is small. Therefore, parallel-distributed computing is a good strategy for solving this problem. Some parallel algorithms have been proposed, but the execution time is still costly when the database size is large. In this paper, two parallel mining algorithms are proposed: Tidset-based Parallel FP-tree (TPFP-tree) and Balanced Tidset-based Parallel FP-tree (BTP-tree) for frequent pattern mining on PC Clusters and multi-cluster grids. in order to exchange transactions efficiently, a transaction identification set (Tidset) was used to directly select transactions instead of scanning the database. Since a Grid system is a heterogeneous computing environment, the proposed BTP-tree can balance the loading according to the computing ability of the processors. BTP-tree, TPFP-tree and PFP-tree were implemented, and datasets generated with an IBM Quest Synthetic Data Generator were used to verify the performance of TPFP-tree and BTP-tree. The experimental results showed that the TPFP-tree needed less execution time on a PC Cluster than the PFP-tree when the database increased. Moreover, the BTP-tree shortened the execution time significantly and had a better load balance capability than both the TPFP-tree and PFP-tree on a multi-cluster grid. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use epidemics in human populations as an example of this phenomenon. The methods consist of developing synthetic yet realistic national-scale networks using a first-principles approach. Unlike simple random graph techniques, these methods combine real-world data sources with behavioral and social theories to synthesize detailed social contact (proximity) networks. Individual-based models of within-host disease progression and interhost transmission are then used to model the contagion process. Finally, models of individual behaviors are composed with disease progression models to develop a realistic representation of the complex system in which individual behaviors and the social network adapt to the contagion. These methods are embodied within Simdemics, a general-purpose modeling environment to support pandemic planning and response. Simdemics is designed specifically to be scalable to networks with 300 million agents; the underlying algorithms and methods in Simdemics are all high-performance computing-oriented methods. New advances in network science, machine learning, high-performance computing, data mining, and behavioral modeling were necessary to develop Simdemics. Simdemics is combined with two other environments, Simfrastructure and Didactic, to form an integrated cyber environment. The integrated cyber environment provides the end user with flexible and seamless Internet-based access to Simdemics. Service-oriented architectures play a critical role in delivering the desired services to the end user. Simdemics, in conjunction with the integrated cyber environment, has been used in more than a dozen user-defined case studies. These case studies were done to support specific policy questions that arose in the context of planning the response to pandemics (for example, H1N1, H5N1) and human-initiated bioterrorism events. These studies played a crucial role in the continual development and improvement of the cyber environment.

We introduce two new mixed integer programming formulations that make use of multiple separating hyperplanes. They represent a generalization of previous piecewise-linear models that embed rules having the form of hyperplanes, which are used to successively separate the two groups. In fact, the classifiers obtained are particular types of decision trees which are allowed to grow in depth and not in width. Computational results show that our models achieve better classification accuracy in less time than previous approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM				Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			Towards supporting expert evaluation of clustering results using a data mining process model	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Cluster quality; Clustering goals; Expert evaluation; Decision support; Similarity measures; Data mining process model; CRISP-DM	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; MULTIPLE CRITERIA; ALGORITHM; HIERARCHY; SELECTION; PATTERNS; RULES; INDEX	Clustering is a popular non-directed learning data mining technique for partitioning a dataset into a set of clusters (i.e. a segmentation). Although there are many clustering algorithms, none is superior on all datasets, and so it is never clear which algorithm and which parameter settings are the most appropriate for a given dataset. This suggests that an appropriate approach to clustering should involve the application of multiple clustering algorithms with different parameter settings and a non-taxing approach for comparing the various segmentations that would be generated by these algorithms. In this paper we are concerned with the situation where a domain expert has to evaluate several segmentations in order to determine the most appropriate segmentation (set of clusters) based on his/her specified objective(s). We illustrate how a data mining process model could be applied to address this problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this setting, human inspection and annotation is subjective and, more importantly, impractical. In this letter, we propose a knowledge-discovery algorithm that uses content-based methods to link low-level image features with high-level visual semantics in an effort to automate the process of retrieving semantically similar images. Our algorithm represents geospatial images by using a high-dimensional feature vector and generates a set of association rules that correlate semantic terms with visual patterns represented by discrete feature intervals. We also provide a mathematical model to customize the relevance of feature measurements to semantic assignments as well as methods of querying by semantics and by example.

Anticipating the needed energy for a service is based on the available prediction (like user requests) which contains the uncertainties. When the future users requests are not available in a home automation system thanks to programmatic, it is interesting to predict it to anticipate the energy needed in order to avoid some problems like peak consumption. A general method to predict users requests for services in energy consumption is proposed. The method relies on Bayesian networks to predict and diagnose user's behavior in housing.

Trees, in particular, have drawn the attention of researchers as the simplest of non-linear data structures. Many tree mining algorithms have been proposed in the literature and this paper surveys some of the recent work that has been performed in this area. We examine some of the most relevant tree mining algorithms and compare them in order to highlight their similarities and differences.

A key feature of transaction data is the extreme sparsity, which renders any single technique ineffective in anonymizing such data. Among recent works, some incur high information loss, some result in data hard to interpret, and some suffer from performance drawbacks. This paper proposes to integrate generalization and suppression to reduce information loss. However, the integration is non-trivial. We propose novel techniques to address the efficiency and scalability challenges. Extensive experiments on real world databases show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including global generalization, local generalization, and total suppression. In addition, transaction data anonymized by this approach can be analyzed by standard data mining tools, a property that local generalization fails to provide.

Perception is characterized by sensory measurements and ability to apply them to reason about satisfiability of complex vague concepts used, e.g., as guards for actions or invariants to be preserved by agents. Such reasoning is often referred as adaptive judgment. Vague concepts can be approximated on the basis of sensory attributes rather than defined exactly. Approximations usually need to be induced by using hierarchical modeling. Computations require interactions between granules of different complexity, such as elementary sensory granules, granules representing components of agent states, or complex granules representing classifiers that approximate concepts. We base our approach to interactive computations on generalized information systems and rough sets. We show that such systems can be used for modeling advanced forms of interactions in hierarchical modeling. Unfortunately, discovery of structures for hierarchical modeling is still a challenge. On the other hand, it is often possible to acquire or approximate them from domain knowledge. Given appropriate hierarchical structures, it becomes feasible to perform adaptive judgment, starting from sensory measurements and ending with conclusions about satisfiability degrees of vague target guards. Thus, our main claim is that PBC should enable users (experts, researchers, students) to submit domain knowledge, by means of a dialog. It should be also possible to submit hypotheses about domain knowledge to be checked semi-automatically. PBC should be designed more like laboratories helping users in their research rather than fully automatic data mining or knowledge discovery toolkit. In particular, further progress in understanding visual perception - as a special area of PBC - will be possible, if it becomes more open for cooperation with experts from neuroscience, psychology or cognitive science. In general, we believe that PBC will soon become necessity in many research areas.

It enables Support not only for nominal classification tasks, but also when ordinal properties on attribute values can be observed [1], making DRSA methodology well suited for stylometric processing of texts. Stylometry involves handling quantitative features of texts leading to characterisation of authors to the point of recognition of their individual writing styles. As always, selection of attributes is crucial to classification accuracy, as is the construction of a decision algorithm. When minimal cover gives unsatisfactory results, and all rules on examples algorithm returns very high number of rules, usually constraints are imposed by selection of some reduct and limiting the decision algorithm by including within it only rules with certain support. However, reducts are typically numerous and within them some of conditional attributes are used more often than others, which is also true for conditions specified by decision rules. The paper presents observations how the frequency of usage for features reflects on the performance of decision algorithms resulting from selection of rules with conditional attributes exploited most and least often.

While most of the earlier clustering algorithms focused on numerical data, real-world problems and data mining applications frequently involve categorical data. Here, we propose a new clustering algorithm for categorical data that is based on the frequency of attribute value combinations. Our algorithm; finds all the combinations of attribute values in an object, which represent a subset of all the attribute values, and then groups the object using the frequency of these combinations in each cluster. As our algorithm considers all the subsets of attribute values in an object, objects in a cluster have not only similar attribute value sets but also strongly associated attribute values. Also, the proposed algorithm. is not the clustering method using the similarity between only two objects, but rather uses the similarity between an object and clusters. Therefore, it provides global information in clustering results. We conducted experiments with real and synthetic data sets to evaluate FA VC. We show that FA VC is more scalable and provides higher quality results than the previous method.

This paper explains the data mining application on the incident reports of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Accident/Incident Data System database, contains incident data records for all categories of civil aviation between the years of 2000 and 2006. In this study, we applied data mining methods on the incident reports. Moreover rough sets concept is used to reduce the attributes of data set. The purpose of this application is to find out the effective attributes in order to reduce the number of the fatality in the incidents. The categorization tools and decision trees are used to find the relations and rules about the incidents resulted in fatality. For this purpose data-mining analysis is conducted. As a result some rules about the fatality are obtained and also the parameters that affect the fatality in the incident have determined. The rules found are tested in terms of their accuracy and reliability, and these results are seen to be meaningful. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data mining approach for supply unbalance detection in induction motor	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault detection; Induction motor; Voltage unbalance; Current zero crossing; Data mining	VOLTAGE; OPERATION	This paper describes an approach for detection of the supply unbalance condition in induction motors by using data mining process. Simulation results have shown that a good indicator of the fault is the amplitude of the second harmonic of the supply frequency component (2f) in the signal obtained by the differences in supply current zero crossing instants. In the study, linear regression (LR), pace regression(PR), sequential minimal optimization (SMO), M5 model tree, M5' Rules, KStar, additive regression and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models are applied within the data mining process for determining the condition of the motor supply voltage. All data mining algorithms were applied using WEKA software. The best result for the determination of the fault related dominant parameter was obtained by using the M5P algorithm model.

J	Dufrenois, F; Colliez, J; Hamad, D				Dufrenois, Franck; Colliez, Johan; Hamad, Denis			Bounded Influence Support Vector Regression for Robust Single-Model Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Robustness; Support vector machines; Estimation; Vectors; Data mining; Kernel; Weight measurement; support vector regression (SVR); Adaptive weight function; kernel hat matrix; outlier detection	STATISTICS	Support vector regression (SVR) is now a well-established method for estimating real-valued functions. However, the standard SVR is not effective to deal with severe outlier contamination of both response and predictor variables commonly encountered in numerous real applications. In this paper, we present a bounded influence SVR, which downweights the influence of outliers in all the regression variables. The proposed approach adopts an adaptive weighting strategy, which is based on both a robust adaptive scale estimator for large regression residuals and the statistic of a "kernelized" hat matrix for leverage point removal. Thus, our algorithm has the ability to accurately extract the dominant subset in corrupted data sets. Simulated linear and nonlinear data sets show the robustness of our algorithm against outliers. Last, chemical and astronomical data sets that exhibit severe outlier contamination are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in real situations.

Our image retrieval system provides relevant data to astrophysicists who need such data to study the coronal heating problem. As part of building this system, we investigated various image preprocessing techniques, image based features, and classifiers to automatically detect coronal loops and to indicate their locations on the images.

A lot of researches have been proposed about data mining and most of them focused on mining from binary-valued data. Fuzzy data mining was thus proposed to discover fuzzy knowledge from linguistic or quantitative data. Recently, ant colony systems (ACS) have been successfully applied to optimization problems. However, few works have been done on applying ACS to fuzzy data mining. This thesis thus attempts to propose an ACS-based framework for fuzzy data mining. In the framework. the membership functions are first encoded into binary-bits and then fed into the ACS to search for the optimal set of membership functions. The problem is then transformed into a multi-stage graph, with each route representing a possible set of membership functions. When the termination condition is reached, the best membership function set (with the highest fitness value) can then be used to mine fuzzy association rules from a database. At last, experiments are made to make a comparison with other approaches and show the performance of the proposed framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They treat the clustering problem as an optimization process of grouping documents into k clusters so that a particular criterion function is minimized or maximized. Usually, the cosine function is used to measure the similarity between two documents in the criterion function, but it may not work well when the clusters are not well separated. To solve this problem, we applied the concepts of neighbors and link, introduced in [S. Guha, R. Rastogi, K. Shim, ROCK: a robust clustering algorithm for categorical attributes, Information Systems 25 (5) (2000) 345-366], to document clustering. If two documents are similar enough, they are considered as neighbors of each other. And the link between two documents represents the number of their common neighbors. Instead of just considering the pairwise similarity, the neighbors and link involve the global information into the measurement of the closeness of two documents. In this paper, we propose to use the neighbors and link for the family of k-means algorithms in three aspects: a new method to select initial cluster centroids based on the ranks of candidate documents; a new similarity measure which uses a combination of the cosine and link functions; and a new heuristic function for selecting a cluster to split based on the neighbors of the cluster centroids. Our experimental results on real-life data Sets demonstrated that our proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of document clustering in terms of accuracy without increasing the execution time much.

J	Peng, WC; Liao, ZX				Peng, Wen-Chih; Liao, Zhung-Xun			Mining sequential patterns across multiple sequence databases	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; Sequential pattern mining; Multi-domain sequential patterns	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FREQUENT SEQUENCES; PREFIXSPAN; GROWTH	In this paper, given a set of sequence databases across multiple domains, we aim at mining multi-domain sequential patterns, where a multi-domain sequential pattern is a sequence of events whose occurrence time is within a pre-defined time window. We first: propose algorithm Naive in which multiple sequence databases are joined as one sequence database for utilizing traditional sequential pattern mining algorithms (e.g., PrefixSpan). Due to the nature of join operations, algorithm Naive is costly and is developed for comparison purposes. Thus, we propose two algorithms without any join operations for mining multidomain sequential patterns. Explicitly, algorithm IndividualMine derives sequential patterns in each domain and then iteratively combines sequential patterns among sequence databases of multiple domains to derive candidate multi-domain sequential patterns. However, not all sequential patterns mined in the sequence database of each domain are able to form multi-domain sequential patterns. To avoid the mining cost incurred in algorithm IndividualMine, algorithm PropagatedMine is developed. Algorithm PropagatedMine first performs one sequential pattern mining from one sequence database. In light of sequential patterns mined, algorithm PropagatedMine propagates sequential patterns mined to other sequence databases. Furthermore, sequential patterns mined are represented as a lattice structure for further reducing the number of sequential patterns to be propagated. In addition. we develop some mechanisms to allow some empty sets in multi-domain sequential patterns. Performance of the proposed algorithms is comparatively analyzed and sensitivity analysis is conducted. Experimental results show that by exploring propagation and lattice structures, algorithm PropagatedMine outperforms algorithm IndividualMine in terms of efficiency (i.e., the execution time).

J	Woo, HJ; Lee, WS				Woo, Ho Jin; Lee, Won Suk			estMax: Tracing Maximal Frequent Item Sets Instantly over Online Transactional Data Streams	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; maximal frequent item sets; transactional data streams	ALGORITHM	Frequent item set mining is one of the most challenging issues for descriptive data mining. In general, its resulting set tends to produce a large number of frequent item sets. To represent them in a more compact notation, closed or maximal frequent item sets are often used but finding such item sets over online transactional data streams is not easy due to the requirements of a data stream. For this purpose, this paper proposes a method of tracing the set of MFIs instantly over an online data stream. The method, namely estMax, maintains the set of frequent item sets by a prefix tree and extracts all MFIs without any additional superset/subset checking mechanism. Upon processing a new transaction, those frequent item sets that are matched maximally by the transaction are newly marked in their corresponding nodes of the prefix tree as candidates for MFIs. At the same time, if any subset of a newly marked item set has been already marked as a candidate MFI by a previous transaction, it is cleared as well. By employing this additional step, it is possible to extract the set of MFIs at any moment. The performance of the estMax method is comparatively analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			Interactive mining of top-K frequent closed itemsets from data streams	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Data streams; Frequent closed itemsets; Top-K pattern mining; Interactive mining		Mining closed frequent itemsets from data streams is of interest recently. However, it is not easy for users to determine a proper minimum support threshold. Hence, it is more reasonable to ask users to set a bound on the result size. Therefore, an interactive single-pass algorithm, called TKC-DS (top-K frequent closed itemsets of data streams), is proposed for mining top-K closed itemsets from data streams efficiently. A novel data structure, called CIL (closed itemset lattice), is developed for maintaining the essential information of closed itemsets generated so far. Experimental results show that the proposed TKC-DS algorithm is an efficient method for mining top-K frequent itemsets from data streams. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, Y; Ma, LZ; Liu, P				Wang, Yan; Ma, Lizhuang; Liu, Ping			Feature selection and syndrome prediction for liver cirrhosis in traditional Chinese medicine	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Traditional Chinese medicine; Syndrome prediction; Feature selection; TCMSP	DIAGNOSIS	Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment is one of the safe and effective methods for liver cirrhosis. in the process of its treatment, a very important step, syndrome prediction is generally performed by physicians at present, which actually hinders the application prospects of TCM. Based on the data mining algorithm, a novel method called TCMSP (traditional Chinese medicine syndrome prediction) is proposed, which consists of two phases. In the first phase, based on an improved information gain method in multi-view, the critical features are filtered from the original features. In the second phase, the class label of a new case is predicted automatically based on accuracy-weighted majority voting. The proposed method is evaluated by the liver cirrhosis dataset, 20 critical features are selected from original 105 features and the corresponding syndromes of 138 new cases are identified respectively. The critical features are in sound agreement with those used by the physicians in making their clinical decisions. Finally, this new method is also demonstrated on three standard datasets (SPECT Heart, Lung Cancer and Iris) and the results are compared with some other methods. The experimental results show that TCMSP method performs well in the field of TCM diagnosis. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wyner-Ziv to H.264 Video Transcoder for Low Cost Video Encoding	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Wyner-Ziv; Low Cost Video Encoding; H.264; Transcoding; Disposable video camera	INFORMATION	This paper proposes a Wyner-Ziv / H.264 transcoder that enables low cost video applications. The proposed solution supports video encoding on resource constrained devices such as disposable video cameras, network camcorders and low cost video encoders. This approach is based on reducing encoding resource requirements on a device by using Wyner-Ziv video encoding. The system shifts the burden of complexity away from the encoder, for example to a network node, where a transcoder efficiently converts WZ encoded video to H.264 by reusing the information from the WZ decoding stage. The transcoded H.264 video is require fewer resources than WZ decoding and therefore reduces the complexity of decoding. The complexity of encoding and playback ends of video applications is thus reduced enabling new class of. consumer application. The paper is focused on reducing the complexity of the macro-block mode coding decision process carried out in H.264 encoding stage of the transcoder. Based on a data mining process, the approach replaces the high complexity H.264 mode decision algorithm by a faster decision tree. The proposed architecture reduces the battery consumption of the end-user devices and the transcoding time is reduced by 86% with negligible rate-distortion loss.	[Martinez, J.

Olex supports a hypothesis language of the form "if T(1) or ... or T(n) occurs in document d, and none of T(n+1), ... T(n+m) occurs in d, then classify d under category c," where each T(i) is a conjunction of terms. The proposed method is simple and elegant. Despite this, the results of a systematic experimentation performed on the REUTERS-21578, the OHSUMED, and the ODP data collections show that Olex provides classifiers that are accurate, compact, and comprehensible. A comparative analysis conducted against some of the most well-known learning algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Ripper, C4.5, SVM, and Linear Logistic Regression) demonstrates that it is more than competitive in terms of both predictive accuracy and efficiency.

A novel hash-based approach for mining frequent itemsets over data streams requiring less memory space	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Data stream; Data mining; Frequent itemset; Hash-based approach; False positive		In recent times, data are generated as a form of continuous data streams in many applications. Since handling data streams is necessary and discovering knowledge behind data streams can often yield substantial benefits, mining over data streams has become one of the most important issues. Many approaches for mining frequent itemsets over data streams have been proposed. These approaches often consist of two procedures including continuously maintaining synopses for data streams and finding frequent itemsets from the synopses. However, most of the approaches assume that the synopses of data streams can be saved in memory and ignore the fact that the information of the non-frequent itemsets kept in the synopses may cause memory utilization to be significantly degraded. In this paper, we consider compressing the information of all the itemsets into a structure with a fixed size using a hash-based technique. This hash-based approach skillfully summarizes the information of the whole data stream by using a hash table, provides a novel technique to estimate the support counts of the non-frequent itemsets, and keeps only the frequent itemsets for speeding up the mining process. Therefore, the goal of optimizing memory space utilization can be achieved. The correctness guarantee, error analysis, and parameter setting of this approach are presented and a series of experiments is performed to show the effectiveness and the efficiency of this approach.

The validity of solutions produced by data-driven algorithms can be diminished if the data being analyzed are of low quality. The quality of data is often realized in terms of data noise present in the given dataset and can include noisy attributes or labeling errors. Hence, tools for improving the quality of data are important to the data mining analyst. We present a comprehensive empirical investigation of our new and innovative technique for ranking attributes in a given dataset from most to least noisy. Upon identifying the noisy attributes, specific treatments can be applied depending on how the data are to be used. In a classification setting, for example, if the class label is determined to contain the most noise, processes to cleanse this important attribute may be undertaken. Independent variables or predictors that have a low correlation to the class attribute and appear noisy may be eliminated from the analysis. Several case studies using both real-world and synthetic datasets are presented in this study. The noise detection performance is evaluated by injecting noise into multiple attributes at different noise levels. The empirical results demonstrate conclusively that our technique provides a very accurate and useful ranking of noisy attributes in a given dataset.

J	Li, L; Zhang, YJ				Li, Le; Zhang, Yu-Jin			FastNMF: highly efficient monotonic fixed-point nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm with good applicability	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							RECOGNITION; OBJECTS; PARTS	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a recently developed method for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data mining, etc. Currently, no NMF algorithm holds both satisfactory efficiency for applications and enough ease of use. To improve the applicability of NMF, we propose a new monotonic, fixed-point algorithm called FastNMF by implementing least-squares error-based nonnegative factorization essentially according to the basic properties of parabola functions. The minimization problem corresponding to an operation in FastNMF can be analytically solved just by this operation, which is far beyond all existing algorithms' power, and therefore FastNMF holds much higher efficiency, which is validated by a set of experimental results. For the simplicity of design philosophy, FastNMF is still one of the NMF algorithms that are the easiest to use and the most comprehensible. In addition, theoretical analysis and experimental results also show that FastNMF tends to converge to better solutions than the popular multiplicative update-based algorithms as far as approximation accuracy is concerned.

J	Pham, HNA; Triantaphyllou, E				Pham, Huy Nguyen Anh; Triantaphyllou, Evanaelos			An application of a new meta-heuristic for optimizing the classification accuracy when analyzing some medical datasets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Optimization; Medical data mining; HBA; Genetic algorithms; Classification errors	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BREAST-CANCER DIAGNOSIS; FUZZY; RULES; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEM	Medical data mining has recently become one of the most popular topics in the data mining community. This is due to the societal importance of the field and also the particular computational challenges posed in this domain of data mining. However, current medical data mining approaches oftentimes use identical costs or just ignore them for the different cases of classification errors. Thus, their outcome may be unexpected. This paper applies a new meta-heuristic approach, called the Homogeneity-Based Algorithm (or HBA), for optimizing the classification accuracy when analyzing some medical datasets. The HBA first expresses the objective as an optimization problem in terms of the error rates and the associated penalty costs. These costs may be dramatically different in medical applications as the implications of having a false-positive and a false-negative case may be tremendously different. When the HBA is combined with traditional classification algorithms, it enhances their prediction accuracy. It does so by using the concept of homogenous sets. Five medical datasets, obtained from the machine learning data repository at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), USA, were tested. Some Computational results indicate that the HBA, when it is combined with traditional methods, can significantly outperform current Stand-alone data mining approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing stream data clustering algorithms are generally based on an online-offline approach: The online component captures synopsis information from the data stream (thus, overcoming real-time and memory constraints) and the offline component generates clusters using the stored synopsis. The online-offline approach affects the overall performance of stream data clustering in various ways: the ease of deriving synopsis from streaming data; the complexity of data structure for storing and managing synopsis; and the frequency at which the offline component is used to generate clusters. In this article, we propose an algorithm that (1) computes and updates synopsis information in constant time; (2) allows users to discover clusters at multiple resolutions; (3) determines the right time for users to generate clusters from the synopsis information; (4) generates clusters of higher purity than existing algorithms; and (5) determines the right threshold function for density-based clustering based on the fading model of stream data. To the best of our knowledge, no existing data stream algorithms has all of these features. Experimental results show that our algorithm is able to detect arbitrarily shaped, evolving clusters with high quality.

J	Jiang, TY; Tuzhilin, A				Jiang, Tianyi; Tuzhilin, Alexander			Dynamic micro-targeting: fitness-based approach to predicting individual preferences	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Customer segmentation; Marketing application; Personalization; Micro-targeting; Customer profiles	ALGORITHMS	It is crucial to segment customers intelligently in order to offer more targeted and personalized products and services. Traditionally, customer segmentation is achieved using statistics-based methods that compute a set of statistics from the customer data and group customers into segments by applying clustering algorithms. Recent research proposed a direct grouping-based approach that combines customers into segments by optimally combining transactional data of several customers and building a data mining model of customer behavior for each group. This paper proposes a new micro-targeting method that builds predictive models of customer behavior not on the segments of customers but rather on the customer-product groups. This micro-targeting method is more general than the previously considered direct grouping method. We empirically show that it outperforms the direct grouping and statistics-based segmentation methods across multiple experimental conditions and that it generates predominately small-sized segments, thus providing additional support for the micro-targeting approach to personalization.

J	Zubcoff, J; Pardillo, J; Trujillo, J				Zubcoff, Jose; Pardillo, Jesus; Trujillo, Juan			A UML profile for the conceptual modelling of data-mining with time-series in data warehouses	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Conceptual modelling; Multidimensional modelling; Data-mining; Time-series; Data warehouses; UML profiles		Time-series analysis is a powerful technique to discover patterns and trends in temporal data. However, the lack of a conceptual model for this data-mining technique forces analysts to deal with unstructured data. These data are represented at a low-level of abstraction and their management is expensive, Most analysts face up to two main problems: (i) the cleansing of the huge amount of potentially-analysable data and (ii) the correct definition of the data-mining algorithms to be employed. Owing to the fact that analysts' interests are also hidden in this scenario, it is not only difficult to prepare data, but also to discover which data is the most promising. Since their appearance, data warehouses have, therefore, proved to be a powerful repository of historical data for data-mining purposes. Moreover, their foundational modelling paradigm, such as, multidimensional modelling, is very similar to the problem domain. In this article, we propose a unified modelling language (UML) extension through UML profiles for data-mining. Specifically, the UML profile presented allows us to specify time-series analysis on top of the multidimensional models of data warehouses. Our extension provides analysts with an intuitive notation for time-series analysis which is independent of any specific data-mining tool or algorithm. In order to show its feasibility and ease of use, we apply it to the analysis of fish-captures in Alicante. We believe that a coherent conceptual modelling framework for data-mining assures a better and easier knowledge-discovery process on top of data warehouses. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchically Distributed Peer-to-Peer Document Clustering and Cluster Summarization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Distributed data mining; distributed document clustering; hierarchical peer-to-peer networks	CATEGORIZATION	In distributed data mining, adopting a flat node distribution model can affect scalability. To address the problem of modularity, flexibility, and scalability, we propose a Hierarchically distributed Peer-to-Peer (HP2PC) architecture and clustering algorithm. The architecture is based on a multilayer overlay network of peer neighborhoods. Supernodes, which act as representatives of neighborhoods, are recursively grouped to form higher level neighborhoods. Within a certain level of the hierarchy, peers cooperate within their respective neighborhoods to perform P2P clustering. Using this model, we can partition the clustering problem in a modular way across neighborhoods, solve each part individually using a distributed K-means variant, then successively combine clusterings up the hierarchy where increasingly more global solutions are computed. In addition, for document clustering applications, we summarize the distributed document clusters using a distributed keyphrase extraction algorithm, thus providing interpretation of the clusters. Results show decent speedup, reaching 165 times faster than centralized clustering for a 250-node simulated network, with comparable clustering quality to the centralized approach. We also provide comparison to the P2P K-means algorithm and show that HP2PC accuracy is better for typical hierarchy heights. Results for distributed cluster summarization match those of their centralized counterparts with up to 88 percent accuracy.

Profiling and identification of P2P traffic	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Application Identification; Behavioral profile; Data mining		Accurate identification of network applications is important for many network activities. The traditional port-based technique has become much less effective since many new applications no longer use well-known fixed port numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel profile-based approach to identifying traffic flows belonging to the target application. In contrast to the method used in previous studies, of classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows. we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns in the application. Based on the behavior profiles. a two-level matching method is used to identify new traffic. We first determine whether a host participates in the target application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, we compare each flow of the host with those patterns in the application profiles to determine which flows belong to this application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on-campus traffic traces. Our results show that one can identify popular P2P applications with very high accuracy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Since no constraint is enforced during the index creation phase, IMine provides a complete representation of the original database. To reduce the I/O cost, data accessed together during the same extraction phase are clustered on the same disk block. The IMine index structure can be efficiently exploited by different item set extraction algorithms. In particular, IMine data access methods currently support the FP-growth and LCM v. 2 algorithms, but they can straightforwardly support the enforcement of various constraint categories. The IMine index has been integrated into the PostgreSQL DBMS and exploits its physical level access methods. Experiments, run for both sparse and dense data distributions, show the efficiency of the proposed index and its linear scalability also for large data sets. Item set mining supported by the IMine index shows performance always comparable with, and often (especially for low supports) better than, state-of-the-art algorithms accessing data on flat file.

In pursuit of high performance, many classifiers do not take into consideration their sizes and contain numerous both essential and insignificant rules. This, however, may bring adverse situation to classifier, for its efficiency will been put down greatly by redundant rules. Hence, it is necessary to eliminate those unwanted rules. In this paper, we propose a fast post-processing approach to remove insignificant rules. The basis of this method is the dependent relation between rules regarding to data objects, from which closed sets can be derived. The experimental evaluation on LICI benchmark datasets using two typical classifiers shows that the proposed method is competent for discarding lots of superfluous rules without degrading classification capability greatly. In particular, the Computational cost of our approach is extremely lower than the Apriori-like method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

David			Mining whole-sample mass spectrometry proteomics data for biomarkers - An overview	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Data mining; Biomarkers	CLASSIFICATION; PROFILES	Biomarkers are proteins or other components of a clinical sample whose measured intensity alters in response to a biological change such as an infection or disease, and which may therefore be useful for prediction and diagnosis. Proteomics is the science of discovering, identifying and understanding such components using tools such as mass spectrometry, In this paper we aim to provide a concise overview of designing and conducting an MS proteomics study in such a way as to allow statistical analysis that may lead to the discovery of novel markers. We provide a summary of the various stages that make up such an experiment, highlighting the need for experimental goals to be decided upon in advance. We discuss issues in experimental design at the sample collection stage, and good practice for standardising protocols within the proteomics laboratory. We then describe approaches to the data mining stage of the experiment, including the processing steps that transform a raw mass spectrum into a useable form. We propose a permutation-based procedure for determining the significance of reported error rates. Finally, because of its advantage in speed and low cost, we suggest that MS proteomics may be a good candidate for an early primary screening approach to disease diagnosis, identifying areas of risk and making referrals for more specific tests without necessarily making a diagnosis in its own right. Our discussion is illustrated with examples drawn from experiments on bovine blood serum designed to pinpoint novel biomarkers for bovine tuberculosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, VS				Chen, Chun-Hao; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Tseng, Vincent S.			Mining fuzzy frequent trends from time series	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE		Time series; Data mining; Fuzzy set; Frequent trends; Fuzzy frequent trends	RULES	Time-series analysis has always been an important and interesting research field due to its frequent appearance in different applications. In the past, many mining approaches were proposed to find useful patterns from time-series data. Time-series data, however, are usually quantitative values and need domain knowledge to predefine crisp intervals of categories for a mining process to proceed. In this paper, we thus propose an algorithm based on Udechukwu et al. approach to mine fuzzy frequent trends from time series. it uses fuzzy concepts to deal with the value-boundary problem and is less domain-dependent as Udechukwu's approach was. The proposed approach first transform data values into angles, and then uses a sliding window to generate continues subsequences from angular series. The apriori-like fuzzy mining algorithm is then used to generate fuzzy frequent trends. Appropriate post-processing is also performed to remove redundant patterns. Finally, experiments are also made for different parameter settings, with experimental results showing that the proposed algorithm can actually work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chung, SH; Suh, Y				Chung, Suk-Hoon; Suh, YongMoo			Estimating the utility value of individual credit card delinquents	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Utility data mining; Credit classification model; Neural networks; Decision tree; Credit card transaction data	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SCORING MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MINING APPROACH; ROUGH SET; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Excessive issue of credit cards has contributed to increased credit card delinquencies, which have become a burden for credit card companies. In such a negative situation, companies should build and use models to estimate maximum profits from credit card delinquents. However, traditional classification models used to classify customers into good or bad groups are not useful in estimating profits from credit card delinquents. Therefore, this paper suggests two models to estimate the utility value of individual credit card delinquents. After showing that the best classification model does not necessarily result in the best utility model, we explain a model that could be used to estimate utility value of individual credit card delinquents. Such models are expected to give much more value to the credit card companies than the traditional classification models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, many in the US do not have healthcare coverage and much research is needed to identify the factors leading to this phenomenon, Hence, this study aims to examine the healthcare coverage of individuals by applying popular machine learning techniques oil a wide-variety of predictive factors. Twenty-three variables and 193.373 records were utilized from the 2004 behavioral risk factor surveillance system survey data for this Study. The artificial neural networks and the decision tree models were developed and compared to each other for predictive ability. The sensitivity analysis and variable importance measures are calculated to analyze the importance of the predictive factors. The experimental results indicated that the most accurate classifier for this phenomenon was the multi-layer perceptron type artificial neural network model that had,in overall classification accuracy of 78.45%, on the holdout sample. The most important predictive factors came out as income, employment status. education, and marital status. Using two popular machine learning techniques, this study identified the factors that can be used to accurately classify those with and without healthcare coverage. The ability to identify and explain the reasoning of those likely to be without healthcare coverage through the application of accurate classification models call potentially be used in reducing the disparity in healthcare coverage.

Software reliability identification using functional networks: A comparative study	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Software reliability; Functional networks; Minimum description length; Predictive models; Support vector machines; Neural networks	TIME; PREDICTION; ALGORITHMS; FAILURES; MODELS	Software engineering development has gradually become essential element in different aspects of the daily life and an important factor in numerous critical real-industry applications, such as, nuclear plants, medical monitoring control, real-time military, bioinformatics, oil and gas industry, and air traffic control. This paper proposes a functional network as a novel computational intelligence scheme for tracking and predicting the software reliability. Several applications are presented to illustrate this new intelligent system framework models. To demonstrate the usefulness of functional networks and the existing data mining schemes, we briefly describe the learning algorithm of functional networks associativity model in predicting the software reliability. Comparative studies will be carried out to compare the performance of functional networks with the most popular existing data mining techniques, such as, statistical regression multilayer feed forward neural networks, and support vector machines. The results show that the performance of functional networks is more reliable, stable, accurate, and outperforms other techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There is emerging evidence of recent emphasis oil organizational factors and it greater shift towards "IT complementarities" in which value addition is linked to combining complementary organizational practices with IT investments. Our findings indicate that the set of interrelated organizational practices that complement positively to IT use is different from the set of practices hindering IT use. The presence of clustering among organizational practices clearly implies that some combinations of practices make it difficult to precisely empirical examine.

However, these algorithms lack in generating cluster description in the form of pattern. From data mining perspective, pattern learning from clusters is as important as cluster finding. In the proposed approach, reduct derived from rough set theory is employed for pattern formulation. Further, reduct are the set of attributes which distinguishes the entities in a homogenous cluster, hence these can be clear cut removed from the same. Remaining attributes are then ranked for their contribution in the cluster. Pattern is formulated with the conjunction of most contributing attributes such that pattern distinctively describes the cluster with minimum error.

Improving scheduling of emergency physicians using data mining analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Emergency department; Classification; 6-Sigma; Performance evaluation matrix		Emergency departments are the first line in hospitals to face emergency patients. As a major function of emergency medicine, when a patient comes to the emergency department, the emergency medical personnel will first perform a triage procedure and then transfer the patient to associated departments for treatment. Due to the utilization pattern of the Taiwanese people in medicine, the emergency departments in most major hospitals are always overcrowded. The arrangement of manpower or the distribution of resources to handle patients' demands can affect disease outcomes and quality of medical treatment. Therefore. the prediction of demands of physician manpower certainly will affect the quality and cost in medical treatment. and has significant impact on patients' life and satisfaction. This study used data mining, classification and a decision tree to analyze the prediction model of patients' demand in the Emergency department from real treatment situations. The result was the accuracy of shift anticipation improved from 22% to 50%. This study also used anticipant performance evaluation matrix integrated with loss function to evaluate the performance between the anticipation of demand established by mining and the original arrangement. It helped to save the cost of the medical personnel by 37%. In the end it combined the DMAIC action procedure from 6-Sigma and developed an anticipation model that can be suitable in different departments to dispatch medical personnel. It provided a reference of the decision maker of the hospital. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chen, H.

H.; Wulsin, Lawson R.; Li, Hua; Guo, Jeff			Dimensionality reduction for knowledge discovery in medical claims database: Application to antidepressant medication utilization study	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Feature selection; Medical claims database; Antidepressant medication	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; INFORMATION CRITERION; VARIABLE SELECTION; BIPOLAR DISORDER	Data mining, through its capacity to discover knowledge embedded in large databases to improve organizational decision-making, has the potential to contribute to efficiencies and cost savings in the increasingly costly healthcare industry. One important aspect of the methods of mining medical databases includes reducing dimensionality through feature selection. Traditionally feature selection is accomplished through stepwise regression, which tends to produce an unnecessarily high number of "significant" variables. This paper applies a filter-based feature selection method using inconsistency rate measure and discretization, to a medical claims database to predict the adequacy of duration of antidepressant medication utilization. Compared to traditional stepwise logistic regression, which selected seven variables from a total of nine potential explanatory variables to characterize patients with inadequate antidepressant medication utilization, the filter-based method selected two variables (age and number of claims) to achieve a similar prediction accuracy. This comparison suggests it may be feasible and efficient to apply the filter-based feature selection method to reduce the dimensionality of healthcare databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Whereas most existing work on web information fusion has focused on text-based multidocument summarization, this paper concerns the topic of image and text association, a cornerstone of cross-media web information fusion. Specifically, we present two learning methods for discovering the underlying associations between images and texts based on small training data sets. The first method based on vague transformation measures the information similarity between the visual features and the textual features through a set of predefined domain-specific information categories. Another method uses a neural network to learn direct mapping between the visual and textual features by automatically and incrementally summarizing the associated features into a set of information templates. Despite their distinct approaches, our experimental results on a terrorist domain document set show that both methods are capable of learning associations between images and texts from a small training data set.

Structured Correspondence Topic Models for Mining Captioned Figures in Biological Literature	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD				A major source of information (often the most crucial and informative part) in scholarly articles from scientific journals, proceedings and books are the figures that directly provide images and other graphical illustrations of key experimental results and other scientific contents. In biological articles, a typical figure often comprises multiple panels, accompanied by either scoped or global captioned text. Moreover, the text in the caption contains important semantic entities such as protein names, gene ontology, tissues labels, etc., relevant to the images in the figure. Due to the avalanche of biological literature in recent years, and increasing popularity of various bio-imaging techniques, automatic retrieval and summarization of biological information from literature figures has emerged as a major unsolved challenge in computational knowledge extraction and management in the life science. We present a new structured probabilistic topic model built on a realistic figure generation scheme to model the structurally annotated biological figures, and we derive an efficient inference algorithm based on collapsed Gibbs sampling for information retrieval and visualization.

Clustering Learners according to their Collaboration	2009 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK IN DESIGN	International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	APR 22-24, 2009	Santiago, CHILE	Univ Chile, Comp Sci Dept, FCFM, IEEE, LACCIR Federat		Collaboration Analysis; Data Mining; E-Learning		When students are responsible for their own collaborative learning process, they need information on collaboration to manage the process. We note that collaborative environments fail to provide users with information on the collaboration process. This research proposes an open collaborative learning experience design that provides learners with an environment where they can manage the collaboration. The design provides information on collaboration to improve management. An inferring method, which uses statistical indicators of student interaction in forums and data mining technology, works to obtain information on student collaboration and groups students according to their level of collaboration. This information will be shown to students and tutors to improve the learning process and its management.

J	Aydin, T; Guvenir, HA				Aydin, Tolga; Guevenir, Halil Altay			Modeling interestingness of streaming association rules as a benefit-maximizing classification problem	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Interestingness learning; Incremental learning; Classification learning; Data mining	ERYTHEMATO-SQUAMOUS DISEASES; VOTING FEATURE INTERVALS; REAL HUMAN INTEREST; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; DATABASES	In a typical application of association rule learning from market basket data, a set of transactions for a fixed period of time is used as input to rule learning algorithms. For example, the well-known Apriori algorithm can be applied to learn a set of association rules from such a transaction set. However, learning association rules from a set of transactions is not a one time only process. For example, a market manager may perform the association rule learning process once every month over the set of transactions collected through the last month. For this reason, we will consider the problem where transaction sets are input to the system as a stream of packages. The sets of transactions may come in varying sizes and in varying periods. Once a set of transactions arrive, the association rule learning algorithm is executed on the last set of transactions, resulting in new association rules. Therefore, the set of association rules learned will accumulate and increase in number over time, making the mining of interesting ones out of this enlarging set of association rules impractical for human experts. We refer to this sequence of rules as "association rule set stream" or "streaming association rules" and the main motivation behind this research is to develop a technique to overcome the interesting rule selection problem. A successful association rule mining system should select and present only the interesting rules to the domain experts. However, definition of interestingness of association rules on a given domain usually differs from one expert to another and also over time for a given expert. This paper proposes a post-processing method to learn a subjective model for the interestingness concept description of the streaming association rules. The uniqueness of the proposed method is its ability to formulate the interestingness issue of association rules as a benefit-maximizing classification problem and obtain a different interestingness model for each user. In this new classification scheme, the determining features are the selective objective interestingness factors related to the interestingness of the association rules, and the target feature is the interestingness label of those rules. The proposed method works incrementally and employs user interactivity at a certain level. It is evaluated on a real market dataset. The results show that the model can successfully select the interesting ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet most of the FCA-based miners, closed pattern miners, would only extract the patterns themselves out of a dataset, whereas the generality order among patterns would be required for many bases. As a contribution to the topic of the (precedence) order computation on top of the set of closed patterns, we present a novel method that borrows its overall incremental approach from two algorithms in the literature. The claimed innovation consists of splitting the update of the precedence links into a large number of lower-cover list computations (as opposed to a single upper-cover list computation) that unfold simultaneously. The resulting method shows a good improvement with respect to its counterpart both on its theoretical complexity and on its practical performance. It is therefore a good starting point for the design of efficient and scalable precedence miners.

Its distinguishing qualities are an exceptionally simple algorithm and data structure, which not only render it easy to implement, but also convenient to execute on external storage. Furthermore, it can easily be extended to allow for "fuzzy" frequent item set mining in the sense that missing items can be inserted into transactions with a user-specified penalty. In order to demonstrate its performance, we report experiments comparing it with the "fuzzy" frequent item set mining version of RElim (an algorithm we suggested in an earlier paper [15] and improved in the meantime).

Currently, wine quality is mostly assessed by physicochemical (e.g alcohol levels) and sensory (e.g. human expert evaluation) tests. In this paper, we propose a data mining approach to predict wine preferences that is based oil easily available analytical tests at the certification step. A large dataset is considered with white vinho verde samples from the Minho region of Portugal. Wine quality is modeled under a regression approach, which preserves the order of the grades. Explanatory knowledge is given in terms of a sensitivity analysis, which measures the response changes when a given input variable is varied through its domain. Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection and that is guided by the sensitivity analysis. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming the multiple regression and neural network methods. Such model is useful for understanding how physicochemical tests affect the sensory preferences. Moreover, it can support the wine expert evaluations and ultimately improve the production.

We make a quantitative estimate by projecting from data from the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (Image-CLEF) campaigns, and qualitatively validate it through experiments using the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) project. Results: Based on 2077 articles with 11,753 pages, 4493 figures, and 11,238 individual images, the predicted accuracy for article retrieval may reach 97.08%. Conclusions: Therefore, CBIR potentially has a high impact in medical literature search and retrieval.	[Deserno, T.

There are now large datasets with both spatial and ontological annotation of the spatio-temporal patterns of gene-expression that provide a powerful resource to discover potential mechanisms of embryo organisation. Ontological annotation of gene expression consists of labeling images with terms from the anatomy ontology for mouse development. Current annotation is made manually by domain experts. It is both time consuming and costly. In this paper, we present; a new data mining framework to automatically annotate gene expression patterns in images with anatomic terms. This framework integrates the images stored in file systems with ontology terms stored ill databases, and combines pattern recognition with image processing techniques to identify the anatomical component's that; exhibit gene expression patterns in images. The experimental result shows the framework works well.

This, however, leads to the problem of whether the results found by one method are a reflection of the phenomenon shown by the results of another method, or whether the results depict in some sense unrelated properties of the data. For example, using clustering can give indication of a clear cluster structure, and computing correlations between variables can show that there are many significant correlations in the data. However, it can be the case that the correlations are actually determined by the cluster structure. In this paper, we consider the problem of randomizing data so that previously discovered patterns or models are taken into account. The randomization methods can be used in iterative data mining. At each step in the data mining process, the randomization produces random samples from the set of data matrices satisfying the already discovered patterns or models. That is, given a data set and some statistics (e.g., cluster centers or co-occurrence counts) of the data, the randomization methods sample data sets having similar values of the given statistics as the original data set. We use Metropolis sampling based on local swaps to achieve this. We describe experiments on real data that demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Our results indicate that in many cases, the results of, e.g., clustering actually imply the results of, say, frequent pattern discovery.

In this work, we address significance in the context of frequent itemset mining. Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to identify a meaningful support threshold s* for a dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support at least s* represents a substantial deviation from what would be expected in a random dataset with the same number of transactions and the same individual item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as statistically significant with a small false discovery rate. Our methodology hinges on a Poisson approximation to the distribution of the number of itemsets in a random dataset with Support at least s, for any s greater than or equal to a minimum threshold s(min). We obtain this result through a novel application of the Chen-Stein approximation method, which is of independent interest. Based on this approximation, we develop an efficient parametric multi-hypothesis test for identifying the desired threshold s*. A crucial feature of our approach is that, unlike most previous work, it takes into account the entire dataset rather than individual discoveries. It is therefore better able to distinguish between significant observations and random fluctuations. We present extensive experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of our methodology.

A major difficulty concerning frequent patterns is huge amount of discovered patterns. The problem can be significantly alleviated by applying concise representations of frequent patterns. In this paper, we offer new lossless representations of frequent patterns that are derivable from downward closed representations by replacing the original elements and eventually some border ones with their closures. We show for which type of downward closed representations the additional closures are superfluous and for which they need to be stored. If the additional closures are not stored, the new representations are guaranteed to be not less concise than the original ones.

However, in many applications, the use of some background knowledge, as ontologies, call enhance the discovery process and generate semantically richer rules. In this way, this paper Proposes the NARFO algorithm, a new algorithm for mining non-redundant and generalized association rules based on Fuzzy ontologies. Fuzzy ontology is used as background knowledge, to support the discovery process and the generation Of rules. One contribution of this work is the generalization of non-frequent itemsets that helps to extract important and meaningful knowledge. NARFO algorithm also contributes at post-processing stage with its generalization and redundancy treatment. Our experiments showed that the number of rules had been reduced considerably, without redundancy, obtaining 63.63% average reduction in comparison with XSSDM algorithm.

In this paper we present a design of such a system which deals with usage data of materials and extracts knowledge and tips that are useful, for example, for better arrangements of bookshelves and for providing patrons with information which will attract the patrons. Two methods are proposed for collecting usage data from bookshelves; one is with RFID and the other is with two-dimensional code, such as the QR code that is very Popularly used in mobile phones. By combining several analysis methods, we can construct a library marketing system, which will give benefits to library management and patron services.

This has traditionally been one of the central areas of research in the field, and most of the solutions proposed so far have relied in one way or another upon sonic form of data mining-with the exception, of course, of human-constructed patterns. In this paper, we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Our approach is not new in some aspects, as CP has already been partially explored in the past. Here we show that GP can offer at least two advantages over other classical mechanisms: it can produce very lightweight detection rules (something of extreme importance for highspeed networks or resource-constrained applications) and the simplicity of the patterns generated allows to easily Understand the semantics of the underlying attack.

We are interested in analytical reports presenting results of data mining. Each analytical report gives answer to one analytical question. Lot of interesting analytical questions can be answered by GUHA procedures implemented in the LISp-Miner system. The SEWEBAR project deals with these analytical questions. However the process of formulating and answering such analytical questions requires various background knowledge. The paper presents first steps in storing and application of several forms of background knowledge in the SEWEBAR project. Examples concerning dealing with medical knowledge are presented.

From a data mining perspective, this sensor network problem is characterized by a large number of variables ( sensors), producing a continuous flow of data, in a dynamic non-stationary environment. Companies make decisions to buy or sell energy based on load profiles and forecast. In this work we analyze the most relevant data mining problems and issues: continuously learning clusters and predictive models, model adaptation in large domains, and change detection and adaptation. The goal is to continuously maintain a clustering model, defining profiles, and a predictive model able to incorporate new information at the speed data arrives, detecting changes and adapting the decision models to the most recent information. We present experimental results in a large real-world scenario, illustrating the advantages of the continuous learning and its competitiveness against Wavelets based prediction. We also propose a light electrical load visualization system which enhances the ability to inspect forecast results in mobile devices.

The amount of malware is increasing faster every year and poses a serious security threat. Thus, malware detection is a critical topic in computer security. Currently, signature-based detection is the most extended method for detecting malware. Although this method is still used on most popular commercial computer antivirus software, it can only achieve detection once the virus has already caused damage and it is registered. Therefore, it fails to detect new malware. Applying a methodology proven successful in similar problem-domains, we propose the use of n-grams (every substring of a larger string, of a fixed lenght n) as file signatures in order to detect unknown malware whilst keeping low false positive ratio. We show that n-grams signatures provide an effective way to detect unknown malware.

The distinguishing features are extracted using the structural information standardized by the Microsoft Windows operating system for executables, DLLs and object files. We follow a threefold research methodology: (1) identify a set of structural features for PE files which is computable in realtime, (2) use an efficient preprocessor for removing redundancy in the features' set, and (3) select an efficient data mining algorithm for final classification between benign and malicious executables. We have evaluated PE-Miner on two malware collections, VX Heavens and Malfease datasets which contain about 11 and 5 thousand malicious PE files respectively. The results of our experiments show that PE-Miner achieves more than 99% detection rate with less than 0.5% false alarm rate for distinguishing between benign and malicious executables. PE-Miner has low processing overheads and takes only 0.244 seconds on the average to scan a given PE file. Finally, we evaluate the robustness and reliability of PE-Miner under several regression tests. Our results show that the extracted features are robust to different packing techniques and PE-Miner is also resilient to majority of crafty evasion strategies.	[Shafiq, M. Zubair; Tabish, S.

However, all MAMs developed so far are index-based; they need to build an index on a given database. The indexing itself is either static (the whole database is indexed at once) or dynamic (insertions/deletions are supported), but there is always a preprocessing step needed. In this paper, we propose D-file, the first MAM that requires no indexing at all. This feature is especially beneficial in domains like data mining, streaming databases, etc., where the production of data is much more intensive than querying. Thus, in such environments the indexing is the bottleneck of the entire production/querying scheme. The idea, of D-file is an extension of the trivial sequential file (an abstraction over the original database, actually) by so-called D-cache. The D-cache is a main-memory structure that keeps track of distance computations spent by processing all similarity queries so far (within a runtime session). Based on the distances stored in D-cache, the D-file can cheaply determine lower bounds of some distances while the distances alone have not to be explicitly computed, which results in faster queries. Our experimental evaluation shows that query efficiency of D-file is comparable to the index-based state-of-the-art MAMs, however, for zero indexing costs.

Depending on the objectives and applications, geodata will have to meet certain requirements in order to be utilised; e.g. concerning geometry and/or semantics. A frequent problem of geo information processing is to identify suitable datasets. The geometric requirements are often met, while this is not the case with semantic requirements. Sometimes geo datasets have similar geometric properties but different semantics. Generally; the acquisition of fresh geodata, meeting the requirements defined is not an option. Instead; data, mining concepts, as such as data fusion, provide ail effective solution to this problem. The fundamental concept of data fusion is the extraction of the best-fit geometry data as well as the most suitable semantic data from existing datasets. The extracted data features are subsequently amalgamated into a newly created dataset. Data fusion can be applied to linear and polygonal data. This work introduces algorithms allowing for the joining of linear structures. The method discussed is based on the comparison of coordinates. The fusion process has been automated and implemented in the DataMerge software tool using the PERL scripting language and thus is not bound to any specific GIS software.

For the robust optimization, probabilistic representation of design parameters is incorporated into a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The means and standard deviations of responses of evaluation functions to uncertainties in design variables are evaluated by descriptive Latin hypercube sampling using Kriging surrogate models. To extract trade-off control rules further, a new approach, which combines the association rule with an "aspiration vector," is proposed. MORDE is then applied to an industrial design problem concerning a centrifugal fan. Taking dimensional uncertainty into account, MORDE then optimized the means and standard deviations of the resulting distributions of fan efficiency and turbulent noise level. The advantages of MORDE over traditional approaches are shown to be the diversity of the solutions and the quantitative controllability of the trade-off balance among multiple objective functions.

Categorizing the patterns of the human cortex has been a challenging issue for neuroscience. In this paper, we propose a data mining approach leading to the construction of the first computerized dictionary of cortical folding patterns, from a database of 62 brains. The cortical folds are extracted using BrainVisa open software. The standard sulci are manually identified among the Folds. 32 sets of sulci covering the cortex are selected. Clustering techniques axe further applied to identify in each set; the different patterns observed in the population. After affine global normalization, the geometric distance between sulci of two subjects is calculated using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The dimension of the resulting distance matrix is reduced using Isomap algorithm. Finally, a dedicated hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to extract out the main patterns. This algorithm provides a score which evaluates the strengths of the patterns found. The score is used to rank the patterns for setting up a dictionary to characterize the variability of cortical anatomy.

A significant number of parallel and distributed FP mining algorithms have been proposed, when the database is large and/or distributed. Among them, parallelization of the FP-growth algorithm using the FP-tree has been proved to be more efficient, when compared to the Apriori-based approaches. However, the FP-tree- based techniques suffer from two major limitations - multiple database scans requirement (i.e., high I/O cost) and huge communication overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel tree structure, called PP-tree (Parallel Pattern tree) that significantly reduces the I/O cost by capturing the database contents with a single scan and facilitates efficient FP-growth mining on it. Our parallel algorithm works independently at each local site and merges the locally generated global frequent patterns at the final stage, thereby reducing inter-processor communication overhead and getting a high degree of parallelism. Extensive experimental study on datasets of different types reflects that parallel and distributed FP mining with our PP-tree is highly efficient on large databases.

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes on a number of biomedical datasets. To this end, we follow a four step evaluation methodology: (1) pre-proccssing the datasets to remove any redundancy, (2) classification of the datasets using six different machine learning algorithms; Naive Bayes (probabilistic), multi-layer perceptron (neural network), SMO (support vector machine), lBk (instance based learner), J48 (decision tree) and RIPPER (rule-based induction), (3) bagging and boosting each algorithm, and (4) combining the best version of each of the base classifiers to make a team of classifiers with stacking and voting techniques. Using this methodology, we have performed experiments on 31 different biomedical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which such a diverse set of machine learning algorithms are evaluated on so many biomedical datasets. The important outcome of our extensive study is a set of promising guidelines which will help researchers in choosing the best classification scheme for a particular nature of biomedical dataset.

It is believed that there are millions of petroglyphs in North America alone, and the study of this valued cultural resource has implications even beyond anthropology and history. Surprisingly, although image processing.. information retrieval and data mining have had large impacts on many human endeavors, they have had essentially zero impact on the study of rock art. In this work we identify the reasons for this, and introduce a novel distance measure and algorithms which allow efficient and effective data mining of large collections of rock art.

However, due to privacy concerns, data cannot be published in their original forms. Two types of data publishing can address the privacy issue: one is to publish the sanitized version of the original data, and the other is to publish the aggregate information from the original data, such as data mining results. There have been extensive studies to understand the privacy consequence in the first approach, but there is not much investigation on the privacy consequence of publishing data mining results, although, it is well believed that publishing data mining results can lead to the disclosure of private information. We propose a systematic method to study the privacy consequence of data mining results. Based on a well-established theory, the principle of maximum entropy, we have developed a method to precisely quantify the privacy risk when data mining results are published. We take the association rule mining as an example in this paper, and demonstrate how we quantify the privacy risk based on the published association rules.

While cost-sensitive learning methods for classification problems have been extensively studied recently, cost-sensitive regression has not been adequately addressed in the data mining literature yet. In this paper, we first advocate the use of average misprediction cost as a measure for assessing the performance of a cost-sensitive regression model. We then propose an efficient algorithm for tuning a regression model to further reduce its average misprediction cost. In contrast with previous statistical methods, which are tailored to particular cost functions. this algorithm can deal with any convex cost functions without modifying the underlying regression methods. We have evaluated the algorithm in bank loan charge-off forecasting, where underforecasting is considered much more costly than overforecasting. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average misprediction costs of models learned with various base regression methods,such as linear regression, model tree, and neural network. The amount of cost reduction increases as the difference between the unit costs of the two types of errors (overprediction and underprediction) increases.

An integrated, generic approach to pattern mining: data mining template library	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; Itemset mining; Sequence mining; Tree mining; Graph mining; Generic programming	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FREQUENT; TREES	Frequent pattern mining (FPM) is an important data mining paradigm to extract informative patterns like itemsets, sequences, trees, and graphs. However, no practical framework for integrating the FPM tasks has been attempted. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Data Mining Template Library (DMTL) for FPM. DMTL utilizes a generic data mining approach, where all aspects of mining are controlled via a set of properties. It uses a novel pattern property hierarchy to define and mine different pattern types. This property hierarchy can be thought of as a systematic characterization of the pattern space, i.e., a meta-pattern specification that allows the analyst to specify new pattern types, by extending this hierarchy. Furthermore, in DMTL all aspects of mining are controlled by a set of different mining properties. For example, the kind of mining approach to use, the kind of data types and formats to mine over, the kind of back-end storage manager to use, are all specified as a list of properties. This provides tremendous flexibility to customize the toolkit for various applications. Flexibility of the toolkit is exemplified by the ease with which support for a new pattern can be added. Experiments on synthetic and public dataset are conducted to demonstrate the scalability provided by the persistent back-end in the library. DMTL been publicly released as open-source software (http://dmtl.sourceforge.net/), and has been downloaded by numerous researchers from all over the world.

As a technique for context mining, we have developed an algorithm called CANSY. It adopts trained neural networks for feature weighting and a value difference metric in order to measure distances between all possible values of symbolic features. CANSY plays a core role in classifying and presenting most similar cases from a case base. Experimental results show that CANSY along with a rule base can provide personalized information with a relatively high level of accuracy, and it is capable of recommending appropriate products or services.

The design of granular classifiers: A study in the synergy of interval calculus and fuzzy sets in pattern recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						granular classifier; core and secondary structure of patterns; hyperboxes; DBSCAN; membership functions; separability index	MAX NEURAL-NETWORK; INFORMATION GRANULATION; NUMERICAL DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	In this study, we are concerned with a development of a certain category of granular classifiers referred here to as hyperbox-driven classifiers (HDC). The approach fully capitalizes on the two key technologies of granular computing. namely set (interval) calculus and fuzzy sets in dealing with a description of geometry of patterns (data) belonging to a certain category. We take advantage of the capabilities of sets (intervals and their Cartesian products) when describing a core structure of classes of patterns in the form of some hyperboxes. Their combinations are referred to as a core structure of the feature space. Next, we refine the geometry of the classifier by bringing forward the concepts of regions of the feature space characterized by fuzzy sets. They are sought as a secondary structure. The construction of the core structure is realized by means of the supervised version of DBSCAN-one of the popular clustering algorithms of data mining. The secondary Structure is described by fuzzy sets whose membership functions are a solution to some optimization problem of allocation of degrees of belongingness. In the formation of the secondary structure we exploit a concept of the Hausdorff distance that determines a distance between some information granule (of a well defined geometry) and a numeric pattern (a point in the highly dimensional feature space). The two-stage description of the granular classifier is also beneficial in the characterization of the classification error. By virtue of the design of the core structure, the classification error occurring there assumes very small, almost zero values. On the other hand, the secondary structure coming with a substantial level of overlap between classes is characterized by relatively higher values of the classification error. Being cognizant of that, we suggest a way of forming a synthetic measure built on the membership values and named a separability index that helps quantify the classification error in this setting. A series of numeric examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed granular classifiers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ramkumar, T; Srinivasan, R				Ramkumar, Thirunavukkarasu; Srinivasan, Rengaramanujam			Modified algorithms for synthesizing high-frequency rules from different data sources	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-databases; Data mining; Transaction population; Rule selection; Rule synthesis	ASSOCIATION RULES	Because of the rapid growth in information and communication technologies, a company's data may be spread over several continents. For an effective decision-making process, knowledge workers need data, which may be geographically spread in different locations. In such circumstances, multi-database mining plays a major role in the process of extracting knowledge from different data sources. In this paper, we have proposed a new methodology for synthesizing high-frequency rules from different data sources, where data source weight has been calculated on the basis of their transaction population. We have also proposed a new method for calculating global confidence. Our goal in synthesizing local patterns to obtain global patterns is that, the support and confidence of synthesized patterns must be very nearly same if all the databases are integrated and mono-mining has been done. Experiments conducted clearly establish that the proposed method of synthesizing high-frequency rules fairly meets the stipulation.

Our development is motivated by sensor placement applications in engineering, which requires optimizing certain complicated "black-box" objective function. The proposed method is able to enhance the optimization efficiency and effectiveness as compared to a few alternative strategies. AEMC falls into the category of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and is the first adaptive MCMC algorithm that simulates multiple Markov chains in parallel. A theorem about the ergodicity property of the AEMC algorithm is stated and proven. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by applying it to a sensor placement problem in a manufacturing process, as well as to a standard Griewank test function.

But in real world scenarios, the weight (price or significance) of an item can vary with time. Reflecting these changes in item weight is necessary in several mining applications, such as retail market data analysis and web click stream analysis. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a dynamic weight for each item, and propose an algorithm, DWFPM (dynamic weighted frequent pattern mining), that makes use of this concept. Our algorithm can address situations where the weight (price or significance) of an item varies dynamically. It exploits a pattern growth mining technique to avoid the level-wise candidate set generation-and-test methodology. Furthermore, it requires only one database scan, so it is eligible for use in stream data mining. An extensive performance, analysis shows that our algorithm is efficient and scalable for WFP mining using dynamic weights.

In this paper we suggest, conversely, that the framework of default logics can be exploited for detecting outliers. Outliers are observations expressed by sets of literals that feature unexpected semantical characteristics. These sets of literals are selected among those explicitly embodied in the given knowledge base. Hence, essentially we perceive outlier detection as a knowledge discovery technique. This paper defines the notion of outlier in two related formalisms for specifying defaults: Reiter's default logic and extended disjunctive logic programs. For each of the two formalisms, we show that finding outliers is quite complex. Indeed, we prove that several versions of the outlier detection problem lie over the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. We believe that a thorough complexity analysis, as done here, is a useful preliminary step towards developing effective heuristics and exploring tractable subsets of outlier detection problems.

J	Guo, ST; Wu, XT; Li, YJ				Guo, Songtao; Wu, Xintao; Li, Yingjiu			Determining error bounds for spectral filtering based reconstruction methods in privacy preserving data mining	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy preserving; Spectral filtering; Disclosure analysis; Error bound analysis	DATA PERTURBATION	Additive randomization has been a primary tool for hiding sensitive private information. Previous work empirically showed that individual data values can be approximately reconstructed from the perturbed values, using spectral filtering techniques. This poses a serious threat of privacy breaches. In this paper we conduct a theoretical study on how the reconstruction error varies, for different types of additive noise. In particular, we first derive an upper bound for the reconstruction error using matrix perturbation theory. Attackers who use spectral filtering techniques to estimate the true data values may leverage this bound to determine how close their estimates are to the original data. We then derive a lower bound for the reconstruction error, which can help data owners decide how much noise should be added to satisfy a given threshold of the tolerated privacy breach.

J	Hong, TP; Lin, CW; Wu, YL				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Lin, Chun-Wei; Wu, Yu-Lung			AN EFFICIENT FUFP-TREE MAINTENANCE ALGORITHM FOR RECORD MODIFICATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Data mining; FP-tree; FUFP-tree; Record modification; Maintenance		The Frequent-Pattern-tree (FP-tree) is an efficient data structure for association-rule mining without the generation of candidate itemsets. It is used to compress a database into a tree structure, which stores only large items. When the underlying data is updated, the FP-tree, however, needs to process all the transactions in a batch way. In this paper, we thus attempt to extend the FP-tree construction algorithm for the efficient handling of record modification. An expeditious FP-tree (FUFP-tree) structure is used to ease the tree update process. An FUFP-tree maintenance algorithm is also proposed for reducing the execution time in reconstructing the tree when records are modified. Experimental results show that the proposed FUFP-tree maintenance algorithm for record modification runs faster than the batch FP-tree construction algorithm for handling updated records and generates nearly the same tree structure as the FP-tree algorithm. The proposed approach can thus achieve a good trade-off between execution time and tree complexity.

J	Shih, DH; Chiang, HS; Lin, BS				Shih, Dong-Her; Chiang, Hsiu-Sen; Lin, Binshan			Collaborative spam filtering with heterogeneous agents	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						spam; spam filtering; anti-spam; collaborative learning; heterogeneous; multi-agent	DESIGN; SYSTEM; CATEGORIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Spam continues to generate great interest both among academicians and practitioners. Many spam filtering techniques have made considerable progress in recent years. The predominant approaches include data mining methods and machine learning methods. Researchers have largely focused on either one of the approaches since a unified framework is still lacking. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper inherits the credit-assignment problem by proposing a collaborative learning framework that could credit or blame each selected heterogeneous technique. The results of this study indicate that the collaborative learning framework is simple and comprehensible. In addition, we found that the framework offers a principle solution to combine heterogeneous individual technique to collaborative filtering for anti-spam problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

On the Size and Recovery of Submatrices of Ones in a Random Binary Matrix	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						frequent itemset mining; bipartite graph; biclique; submatrix of 1s; statistical significance	CLIQUE	Binary matrices, and their associated submatrices of 1s, play a central role in the study of random bipartite graphs and in core data mining problems such as frequent itemset mining (FIM). Motivated by these connections, this paper addresses several statistical questions regarding submatrices of 1s in a random binary matrix with independent Bernoulli entries. We establish a three-point concentration result, and a related probability bound, for the size of the largest square submatrix of 1s in a square Bernoulli matrix, and extend these results to non-square matrices and submatrices with fixed aspect ratios. We then consider the noise sensitivity of frequent itemset mining under a simple binary additive noise model, and show that, even at small noise levels, large blocks of 1s leave behind fragments of only logarithmic size. As a result, standard FIM algorithms, which search only for submatrices of 1s, cannot directly recover such blocks when noise is present. On the positive side, we show that an error-tolerant frequent itemset criterion can recover a submatrix of 1s against a background of 0s plus noise, even when the size of the submatrix of 1s is very small.

J	Liao, SH; Chang, WJ; Lee, CC				Liao, Shu-Hsien; Chang, Wen-Jung; Lee, Chai-Chen			Mining marketing maps for business alliances	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						business alliance; marketing maps; database marketing; data mining; association rules; knowledge extraction	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PRODUCT QUALITY; BRAND ALLIANCES; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; MANAGEMENT; PARTNERS	A business can strengthen its competitive advantage and increase its market share by forming a strategic alliance. With the help of alliances, businesses can bring to bear significant resources beyond the capabilities of the individual co-operating firms. Thus how to effectively evaluate and select alliance partners is an important task for businesses because a successful corporation partner selection can therefore reduce the possible risk and avoid failure results on business alliance. This paper proposes the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining, which is implemented for mining marketing map knowledge from customers. Knowledge extraction from marketing maps is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules in order to propose suggestions for business alliances and possible co-operation solutions. Finally, this study suggests that integration of different research factors, variables, theories, and methods for investigating this research topic of business alliance could improve research results and scope.

In this article, we draw an analogy between image retrieval and text retrieval and propose a visual phrase-based approach to retrieve images containing desired objects (object-based image retrieval). The visual phrase is defined as a pair of frequently co-occurred adjacent local image patches and is constructed using data mining. We design methods on how to construct visual phrase and how to index/search images based on visual phrase. We demonstrate experiments to show our visual phrase-based approach can be very efficient and more effective than current visual word-based approach.

Applications of such sensors range from ensuring environmental monitoring, to providing human health diagnostic measures, and to early warning systems for bioterrorism. Certain viruses and bacteria pathogens are of special concern for their ability to spread rapidly in human populations during a pandemic, and emerging variants of these pathogens are challenging to detect. This paper provides a reliable detection strategy to classify viruses from innocuous proteins. Our novel instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS), and couples a genetic algorithm based machine learning method for pattern recognition with a microfabricated solid state biosensor. Together, this hardware and software combination allowed for an extremely high classification accuracy (94%) between the T4 bacteriophage from bovine serum albumin (BSA), an unrelated protein. This study suggests that this portable sensor can be used along with the sophisticated data mining method as a fast, reliable, and accurate tool for the recognition of viruses.

J	Aygun, RS				Aygun, Ramazan S.			S2S: structural-to-syntactic matching similar documents	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						string matching; information retrieval	COMMON SUBSEQUENCE PROBLEM; WEB	Management of large collection of replicated data in centralized or distributed environments is important for many systems that provide data mining, mirroring, storage, and content distribution. In its simplest form, the documents are generated, duplicated and updated by emails and web pages. Although redundancy may increase the reliability at a level, uncontrolled redundancy aggravates the retrieval performance and might be useless if the returned documents are obsolete. Document similarity matching algorithms do not provide the information on the differences of documents, and file synchronization algorithms are usually inefficient and ignore the structural and syntactic organization of documents. In this paper, we propose the S2S matching approach. The S2S matching is composed of structural and syntactic phases to compare documents. Firstly, in the structural phase, documents are decomposed into components by its syntax and compared at the coarse level. The structural mapping processes the decomposed documents based on its syntax without actually mapping at the word level. The structural mapping can be applied in a hierarchical way based on the structural organization of a document. Secondly, the syntactic matching algorithm uses a heuristic look-ahead algorithm for matching consecutive tokens with a verification patch. Our two-phase S2S matching approach provides faster results than currently available string matching algorithms.

J	Chung, SM; Luo, CN				Chung, Soon M.; Luo, Congnan			Efficient mining of maximal frequent itemsets from databases on a cluster of workstations	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						parallel data mining; maximal frequent itemsets; association rules; scalability	ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHM	In this paper, we propose two parallel algorithms for mining maximal frequent itemsets from databases. A frequent itemset is maximal if none of its supersets is frequent. One parallel algorithm is named distributed max-miner (DMM), and it requires very low communication and synchronization overhead in distributed computing systems. DMM has the local mining phase and the global mining phase. During the local mining phase, each node mines the local database to discover the local maximal frequent itemsets, then they form a set of maximal candidate itemsets for the top-down search in the subsequent global mining phase. A new prefix tree data structure is developed to facilitate the storage and counting of the global candidate itemsets of different sizes. This global mining phase using the prefix tree can work with any local mining algorithm. Another parallel algorithm, named parallel max-miner (PMM), is a parallel version of the sequential max-miner algorithm (Proc of ACM SIGMOD Int Conf on Management of Data, 1998, pp 85-93). Most of existing mining algorithms discover the frequent k-itemsets on the kth pass over the databases, and then generate the candidate (k + 1)-itemsets for the next pass. Compared to those level-wise algorithms, PMM looks ahead at each pass and prunes more candidate itemsets by checking the frequencies of their supersets. Both DMM and PMM were implemented on a cluster of workstations, and their performance was evaluated for various cases. They demonstrate very good performance and scalability even when there are large maximal frequent itemsets (i.e., long patterns) in databases.

Related work can be broadly divided into two approaches: eager learning and lazy learning.(1) Different from eager learning, the key idea for extending naive Bayes using lazy learning is to learn an improved naive Bayes for each test instance. In recent years, several lazy extensions of naive Bayes have been proposed. For example, LBR,(30) SNNB,(27) and LWNB.(8) All these algorithms aim to improve naive Bayes' classification performance. Indeed, they achieve significant improvement in terms of classification, measured by accuracy. In many real-world data mining applications, however, an accurate ranking is more desirable than an accurate classification. Thus a natural question is whether they also achieve significant improvement in terms of ranking, measured by AUC (the area under the ROC curve).(2,11,17) Responding to this question, we conduct experiments on the 36 UCI data sets(18) selected by Weka(12) to investigate their ranking performance and find that they do not significantly improve the ranking performance of naive Bayes. Aiming at scaling up naive Bayes' ranking performance, we present a novel lazy method ICNB (instance cloned naive Bayes) and develop three ICNB algorithms using different instance cloning strategies. We empirically compare them with naive Bayes. The experimental results show that our algorithms achieve significant improvement in terms of AUC. Our research provides a simple but effective method for the applications where an accurate ranking is desirable.

However, the huge amount of raw data can rapidly overwhelm people in charge of analyzing such data sets. Systematic analysis procedures are thus needed to extract useful information from large traffic data sets in order to assist the analyst's investigations. This work describes an analysis framework specifically developed to gain insights into honeynet data. Our forensics procedure aims at finding, within an attack data set, groups of network traces sharing various kinds of similar patterns. In our exploratory data analysis, we seek to design a flexible clustering tool that can be applied in a systematic way on different feature vectors characterizing the attacks. In this paper, we illustrate the application of our method by analyzing one specific aspect of the honeynet data, i.e. the time series of the attacks. We show that clustering attack patterns with an appropriate similarity measure provides very good candidates for further in-depth investigation, which can help us to discover the plausible root causes of the underlying phenomena. The results of our clustering on time series analysis enable us to identify the activities of several worms and botnets in the collected traffic. (c) 2008 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.

Anonymization algorithms typically aim to satisfy certain privacy definitions with minimal impact on the quality of the resulting data. While much of the previous literature has measured quality through simple one-size-fits-all measures, we argue that quality is best judged with respect to the workload for which the data will ultimately be used. This article provides a suite of anonymization algorithms that incorporate a target class of workloads, consisting of one or more data mining tasks as well as selection predicates. An extensive empirical evaluation indicates that this approach is often more effective than previous techniques. In addition, we consider the problem of scalability. The article describes two extensions that allow us to scale the anonymization algorithms to datasets much larger than main memory. The first extension is based on ideas from scalable decision trees, and the second is based on sampling. A thorough performance evaluation indicates that these techniques are viable in practice.

One of these purposes is to find a concise but interpretable representation of a given data matrix. Different decomposition formulations have been proposed for this task, many of which assume a certain property of the input data ( e. g., nonnegativity) and aim at preserving that property in the decomposition. In this paper we propose new decomposition formulations for binary matrices, namely the Boolean CX and CUR decompositions. They are natural combinations of two previously presented decomposition formulations. We consider also two subproblems of these decompositions and present a rigorous theoretical study of the subproblems. We give algorithms for the decompositions and for the subproblems, and study their performance via extensive experimental evaluation. We show that even simple algorithms can give accurate and intuitive decompositions of real data, thus demonstrating the power and usefulness of the proposed decompositions.

J	Heinz, C; Seeger, B				Heinz, Christoph; Seeger, Bernhard			Cluster Kernels: Resource-aware kernel density estimators over streaming data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data streams; stream mining; statistical modeling; kernel density estimation		A variety of real-world applications heavily rely on an adequate analysis of transient data streams. Due to the rigid processing requirements of data streams, common analysis techniques as known from data mining are not directly applicable. A fundamental building block of many data mining and analysis approaches is density estimation. It provides a well-defined estimation of a continuous data distribution, a fact which makes its adaptation to data streams desirable. A convenient method for density estimation utilizes kernels. The computational complexity of kernel density estimation, however, renders its application to data streams impossible. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose our Cluster Kernel approach, which provides continuously computed kernel density estimators over streaming data. Not only do Cluster Kernels meet the rigid processing requirements of data streams, but they also allocate only a constant amount of memory, even with the opportunity to adapt it dynamically to changing system resources. For this purpose, we develop an intelligent merge scheme for Cluster Kernels and utilize continuously collected local statistics to resample already processed data. We validate the efficacy of Cluster Kernels for a variety of real-world data streams in an extensive experimental study.

J	Wong, YK; Woon, WL				Wong, Y. K.; Woon, W. L.			An iterative approach to enhanced traffic signal optimization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; data mining; clustering; traffic signal control		Recent advances in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) provide large quantities of data that can be exploited for the development of improved traffic management systems. However, mining this data to extract useful patterns and information also presents significant challenges. In an earlier presentation we presented a novel method for optimising traffic timing plans via the use of clustering algorithms to automatically generate Time-Of-Day (TOD) intervals. By detecting time intervals which share common traffic conditions, it was possible to obtain TOD intervals which better reflect the underlying generators of traffic patterns. However, the above-mentioned procedure suffers from a problem: the data that is used to find the clusters was generated using the original traffic patterns, which means that the estimates of the true underlying TOD intervals could be inaccurate. In this paper, we present a refinement of the method which is based on iteratively re-estimating the TOD intervals. Experiments have been conducted to test the usefulness of this additional step and the results are presented and discussed in detail. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wong, Y.

J	Jea, KF; Chang, MY				Jea, Kuen-Fang; Chang, Ming-Yuan			Discovering frequent itemsets by support approximation and itemset clustering	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						support approximation; clustering; data mining; combinatorial approximation; frequent itemset	ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	To speed up the task of association rule mining, a novel concept based on support approximation has been previously proposed for generating frequent itemsets. However, the mining technique utilized by this concept may incur unstable accuracy due to approximation error. To overcome this drawback, in this paper we combine a new clustering method with support approximation, and propose a mining method, namely CAC, to discover frequent itemsets based on the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion. The clustering technique groups highly similar members to improve the accuracy of support approximation. The hit ratio analysis and experimental results presented in this paper verify that CAC improves accuracy. Without repeatedly scanning a database and storing vast information in memory, the CAC method is able mine frequent itemsets with relative stability. The advantages that the CAC method enjoys in both accuracy and performance make it an effective and useful technique for discovering frequent itemsets in a database. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Dangerous feedback loops of attributes' dependent relationships can make the system collapse due to amplification or oscillation of attribute values. Motivated by efficient analysis of causalities in time-series data, we propose a temporal qualitative probabilistic graphical model in this paper. From given time-series sample data, we construct the structure of the temporal qualitative probabilistic network (TQPN) and derive the corresponding qualitative influences on directed edges. We then present the approach for TQPN reasoning with time-series features. Consequently, positive time-series feedback loops are defined, and the approach to identify them is proposed. Preliminary experiments show that our proposed method is not only feasible but also efficient. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, K; Chen, YL; Hu, HW				Tang, Kwei; Chen, Yen-Liang; Hu, Hsiao-Wei			Context-based market basket analysis in a multiple-store environment	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						association rule; data mining; store chain; algorithm	DATA MINING APPROACH; DECISION-MAKING; WEB SITES; KNOWLEDGE; MODEL; PERSPECTIVE; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; SYSTEM	We propose a new approach to performing market basket analysis in a multiple-store and multiple-period environment. In using the method, the user first defines a time concept hierarchy and a place (location) hierarchy, according to his or her application and needs. A set of contexts is systematically derived from the two hierarchies by combining the concept levels of the two hierarchies. We developed an efficient algorithm for extracting the association rules, which meet the support and confidence requirements for all the contexts. Using the approach, a decision maker can analyze purchasing patterns at very detailed concept levels of time and place, such as a combination of days and stores, at more general levels, such as a combination of quarters and states, and combinations of detailed levels of one with general level of the other, such as a combination of days and regions. In addition to this flexibility, the association rules are well organized, because they are generated according to the contexts derived from the time and place hierarchies. A numerical evaluation shows that the algorithm is efficient in running time and may generate more specific and richer information than the store-chain rules and the traditional rules.

J	Tseng, MC; Lin, WY; Jeng, R				Tseng, Ming-Cheng; Lin, Wen-Yang; Jeng, Rong			Incremental maintenance of generalized association rules under taxonomy evolution	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; frequent itemsets; generalized association rules; incremental maintenance; taxonomy evolution	ALGORITHMS	Mining association rules from large databases of business data is an important topic in data mining. In many applications, there are explicit or implicit taxonomies (hierarchies) for items, so it may be useful to find associations at levels of the taxonomy other than the primitive concept level. Previous work on the mining of generalized association rules, however, assumed that the taxonomy of items remained unchanged, disregarding the fact that the taxonomy might be updated as new transactions are added to the database over time. If this happens, effectively updating the generalized association rules to reflect the database change and related taxonomy evolution is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose two novel algorithms, called IDTE and IDTE2, which can incrementally update the generalized association rules when the taxonomy of items evolves as a result of new transactions. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithms can maintain their performance even for large numbers of incremental transactions and high degrees of taxonomy evolution, and are faster than applying contemporary generalized association mining algorithms to the whole updated database.

Many of these applications cannot easily locate the exact position of objects, but they can determine the region in which each object is contained. Furthermore, the regions are fixed and may vary greatly in size. Examples include mobile/cell phone networks, RFID tag readers and satellite tracking. This demands techniques to mine such data. These techniques must also correct for the bias produced by different sized regions. We provide a comprehensive definition of Spatio-Temporal Association Rules (STARs) that describe how objects move between regions over time. We also present other patterns that are useful for mobility data; stationary regions and high traffic regions. The latter consists of sources, sinks and thoroughfares. These patterns describe important temporal characteristics of regions and we show that they can be considered as special STARs. We define spatial support to effectively deal with the problem of different sized regions. We provide an efficient algorithm-STAR-Miner-to find these patterns by exploiting several pruning properties.

Features such as color, texture, positioning etc., are insufficient to convey the information that could be obtained through shape analysis. A fundamental requirement in this analysis is that shape similarities are computed invariantly to basic geometric transformations, e.g., scaling, shifting, and most importantly, rotations. And while scale and shift invariance are easily achievable through a suitable shape representation, rotation invariance is much harder to deal with. In this work, we explore the metric properties of the rotation-invariant distance measures and propose an algorithm for fast similarity search in the shape space. The algorithm can be utilized in a number of important data mining tasks such as shape clustering and classification, or for discovering of motifs and discords in large image collections. The technique is demonstrated to introduce a dramatic speed-up over the current approaches, and is guaranteed to introduce no false dismissals.

S	Aggarwal, CC			IEEE	Aggarwal, Charu C.			On unifying privacy and uncertain data models	2008 IEEE 24TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	24th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering	APR 07-12, 2008	Cancun, MEXICO	IEEE, invent, Microsoft, ORACLE, IBM, SAP, Google, YAHOO				The problem of privacy-preserving data mining has been studied extensively in recent years because of the increased amount of personal information which is available to corporations and individuals. Most privacy transformations use some form of data perturbation or representational ambiguity in order to reduce the risk of identification. The final results from privacy transformation methods often require the underlying applications to be modified in order to work with the new representation of the data. Since the end results of privacy-transformation methods have not been standardized, the required modifications may vary with the method used for the privacy transformation. In some cases, it can be an enormous effort to re-design applications to work with the anonymized data. While the results of privacy-transformation methods are a natural form of uncertain data, the two problems have generally been studied independently. In this paper, we make a first attempt to unify the two fields, and propose a privacy transformation for which existing uncertain data management tools can be directly used. This is a great advantage, since it means that the wide spectrum of research available for uncertain data management can also be used for privacy-preserving data mining. We propose an uncertain version of the kappa-anonymity model which is related to the well known deterministic model of kappa-anonymity. The uncertain version of the kappa-anonymity model has the additional feature of introducing greater uncertainty for the adversary over an equivalent deterministic model. As specific instantiations of this approach, we test the effectiveness of the privacy transformation on the problems of query estimation and classification, and show that the technique retains greater accuracy than other kappa-anonymity models.

This paper presents an approach called learning decomposition, which determines the relative efficacy of different types of learning opportunities. This approach is a generalization of learning curve analysis, and uses non-linear regression to determine how to weight different types of practice opportunities relative to each other. We analyze 346 students reading 6.9 million words and show that different types of practice differ reliably in how efficiently students acquire the skill of reading words quickly and accurately. Specifically, massed practice is generally not effective for helping students learn words, and rereading the same stories is not as effective as reading a variety of stories. However, we were able to analyze data for individual student's learning and use bottom-up processing to detect small subgroups of students who did benefit from rereading (I I students) and from massed practice (5 students). The existence of these has two implications: 1) one size fits all instruction is adequate for perhaps 95% of the student population using computer tutors, but a, a community we can do better and 2) the ITS community is well poised to study what type of instruction is optimal for the individual.

Presumably, such assistance is included by the ITS designers since they feel it benefits the students. However, whether-and how-help helps students has not been a well studied problem in the ITS community. In this paper we present three approaches for evaluating the efficacy of the Reading Tutor's help: creating experimental trials from data, learning decomposition, and Bayesian Evaluation and Assessment, an approach that uses dynamic Bayesian networks. We have found that experimental trials and learning decomposition both find a negative benefit for help--that is, help hurts! However, the Bayesian Evaluation and Assessment framework finds that help both promotes student long-term learning and provides additional scaffolding on the current problem. We discuss why these approaches give divergent results, and suggest that the Bayesian Evaluation and Assessment framework is the strongest of the three. In addition to introducing Bayesian Evaluation and Assessment, a method for simultaneously assessing students and evaluating tutorial interventions, this paper describes how help can both scaffold the current problem attempt as well as teach the student knowledge that will transfer to later problems.

In this paper, we study the use of similarities in data mining, basing our discourse on cognitive approaches of similarity stemming for instance from Tversky's and Rosch's seminal works, among others. We point out a general framework for measures of comparison compatible with these cognitive foundations, and we show that measures of similarity can be involved in all steps of the data mining process. We then focus on fuzzy logic that provides interesting tools for data mining mainly because of its ability to represent imperfect information, which is of crucial importance when databases are complex, large, and contain heterogeneous, imprecise, vague, uncertain or incomplete data. We eventually illustrate our discourse by examples of similarities used in real-world data mining problems.

It includes the computation of formal concepts to support various knowledge discovery processes. For instance, when considering post-genomics, we can exploit Boolean data sets that encode a relation between some genes and the proteins that may regulate them. In such a context, it appears interesting to exploit the analogy between a putative transcriptional module (i.e., a typically important hypothesis for gene regulation understanding) and a formal concept that holds within such data. In this paper, we assume that knowledge nuggets can be captured by collections of formal concepts and we discuss the challenging issue of mining/selecting actionable patterns from these collections, i.e., looking for relevant patterns that really support knowledge discovery. Therefore, a major issue concerns the computation of complete collections of formal concepts that satisfy user-defined constraints. This is useful not only to avoid the computation of too small patterns that might be due to noise (e.g., using size constraints on both their intents and extents) but also to introduce some fault-tolerance. We discuss the pros and the cons of some recent proposals in that direction.

However the successful application of DM technology requires that one possess specific DM decision-making skills. For instance, the effective application of a data mining process is littered with many difficult and technical decisions (i.e. data cleansing, feature transformations, algorithms, parameters, evaluation, etc.) In essence, this contentious problem and burden for decision makers clearly stems from a poor DM-DS integration. As a result, we have strived to improve on this problem by proposing an intelligent DM assistant that can potentially empower decision makers to better leverage DM technology and achieve their intended business objectives. Nonetheless, as this paper will strive to demonstrate, the realization of an intelligent data mining assistant for the decision maker or non-specialist data miner is a challenging and complex endeavour. Hence, in what follows we present the key design considerations (i.e. knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge elicitation and reuse efforts, etc.) that were addressed during the implementation of a hybrid data mining assistant, based on the case-based reasoning (CBR) paradigm and the use of a formal OWL-DL ontology.

But little is known about the ways to assess its efficiency. This study aimed at developing a diagnosis tool for examining whether MSW incineration plant is under a reliable monitoring. Performances on status monitor, state assessment, data complement, and risk detection were step by step examined during diagnosis. Several data mining technologies composed of cluster analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and Monte-Carlo simulation were adopted to fulfill this job. In a case study of MSW incineration plant located at South Taiwan, results showed no monitoring item within its monitoring system could be verified as relative to the emissions of Dust, CO, and SOx. In addition, data deficiencies severely affected its reliability. Except Dust, data deficiencies on monitoring NOx, CO, and SOx were more than 30%. So this monitoring system can do a good status monitor on Dust emission and provide a precise state assessment on steam generation and NOx control, but it really faced a problem on handling other air pollutants like CO and SOx.

We view region discovery as a clustering problem in which an externally given fitness function has to be maximized. The framework adapts four representative clustering algorithms, exemplifying prototype-based, grid-based, density-based, and agglomerative clustering algorithms, and then we systematically evaluated the four algorithms in a real-world case study. The task is to find feature-based hotspots where extreme densities of deep ice and shallow ice co-locate on Mars. The results reveal that the density-based algorithm outperforms other algorithms inasmuch as it discovers more regions with higher interestingness, the grid-based algorithm can provide acceptable solutions quickly, while the agglomerative clustering algorithm performs best to identify larger regions of arbitrary shape. Moreover, the results indicate that there are only a few regions on Mars where shallow and deep ground ice co-locate, suggesting that they have been deposited at different geological times.

However, only a small number of rules are likely to be of any interest to the domain expert analyzing the data, i.e., many of the rules are either irrelevant or obvious. Therefore, techniques for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered patterns are required. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered association rules by reducing the number of rules extracted using an evolutionary method named Genetic Relation Programming (GRP). The algorithm evaluates the relationships between the rules at each generation using a specific measure of distance and gives the best set of rules at the final generation. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods and it is clarified that the proposed method shows comparable accuracy with others.

J	Hancu, L				Hancu, Lucian			Data-mining techniques for supporting merging decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						financial-statement analysis; Web usage mining; merge decisions		The Mergers and Acquisitions transactions have increased during the last years, as business entities face multiple threats caused by globalization and are unable to exploit the opportunities offered by the global market. These transactions come as a solution for consolidating the position of one entity on the local, national or global market, but usually surprise the competition, which does not have any prepared strategy for surviving the rise of a stronger competitor. In order to help the entities decide to which company should merge, or to be aware of the fact that a competitor could merge in the near future, we have built a technique for supporting merging decisions, based on the financial statements analysis and the. Web usage logs extracted from our multi-server search application. The model suggests the merge with an entity which share the same activity code with the initial entity, or has a related activity code, according to the Business Dependency Map (derived from the Web search logs).

A wide range of different feature selection and classification methods were applied in order to find the best performing algorithms on a given dataset. A special Model Selection Tool, MST, was developed to facilitate the search for the most efficient classifier model. The MST includes programs for choosing different classification algorithms, selecting subsets of features, dealing with imbalance in the data and evaluating the predictive performance by various measures. These steps are important in most data mining tasks and it would be time consuming to conduct them manually. The dataset, Rose, was assembled retroactively for this study and contains data records from 257 women diagnosed with primary breast cancer in Iceland during the years 1996-1998. An extra feature, containing the risk assessment of a doctor was added to the dataset which initially contained 400 features, both to see how much that could enhance the performance of the model and to investigate to what extent such a subjective assessment can be predicted from the remaining features. The main result is that similar performance is achieved regardless of which algorithm is used. Furthermore, the inclusion of the doctor's assessment does not appear to significantly enhance the performance. That is also reflected in the fact that the models are in general more successful in predicting the doctors risk assessment than the actual outcome if resulting Kappa values are compared.

By indexing representative examples by the mined rules we can efficiently detect a variety of different lettering or design marks associated with a brand. Features in an image are marked by matching rules to representative examples selected via a weighted cosine similarity measure.

We define of a new type of patterns, namely the jumping emerging patterns with occurrence count (occJEPs), which allow reasoning in transaction databases with recurrent items. Such data is a frequently used representation of images, for which classification is one of the most important data mining problems that needs to be solved accurately and efficiently. We provide a formal definition of the new type of patterns, an outline of an algorithm for finding occJEPs and a comparison with other rule- and pattern-based classifiers for a selection of sample images.

Many researchers have proposed highly effective techniques to address this problem. Nevertheless, ad-hoc solutions are still frequent in real-world web automation applications. Arguably, one of the reasons for this situation is that most proposals have focused on query wrappers, which transform a web source into a special kind of database in which some queries can be executed using a query form and return resultsets that are composed of structured data records. Although the query wrapper model is often useful, it is not appropriate for applications that make decisions according to the data retrieved or processes that use forms that can be modelled as insert/update/delete operations. This article proposes a new language for defining web automation processes that is based on a wide range of real-world web automation tasks that are being used by corporations from different business areas.

Anatomical correspondence between faces is first established using a generic 3D face model which is deformed elastically to match the facial surfaces. Surface points are then used as a basis for classification according to a set of classification rules, which are discovered by an ACO/PSO-based rule discovery algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on the BU-3DFEDB facial expression database where a total recognition rate of 92.3% was achieved.

Marrying application motivations, structures, and methods from epidemiology and the mathematical formalisms of FCA, we define Generalized Contingency Structures and Tagged Contingency Structures, two new objects that generalize the contingency table, an ad hoc data summarization device in epidemiology, to a mathematical object with well-understood structure. We have extended the FCA repertoire by adding to the Formal Context an associated structure that we call a Tag Context, which formally incorporates important kinds of background knowledge. We illustrate the motivation and use of these new ideas, formats, and objects with some brief examples.

We captured Internet traffic at a main gateway router, performed pre-processing on the captured data, selected the most significant attributes, and prepared a training data stream to which the CVFDT model was applied. We tested our approach on a data stream with 3.5 million P2P and NonP2P traffic records. The results show that our approach can effectively deal with dynamic nature of streaming data and detect the changes in communities of peers. The classification accuracy is higher than 95%, and the method is well-scalable in both time and space complexities, making it competent for large-scale dynamic data. We extracted attributes only from the IP layer, eliminating the privacy concern associated with the techniques that use deep packet inspection.
