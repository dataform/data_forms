J	Gwadera, R; Atallah, MJ; Szpankowski, W				Gwadera, R; Atallah, MJ; Szpankowski, W			Reliable detection of episodes in event sequences	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; episode pattern matching; hidden pattern matching; overrepresented and underrepresented patterns; probabilistic analysis		Suppose one wants to detect bad or suspicious subsequences in event sequences. Whether an observed pattern of activity (in the form of a particular subsequence) is significant and should be a cause for alarm depends on how likely it is to occur fortuitously. A long-enough sequence of observed events will almost certainly contain any subsequence, and setting thresholds for alarm is an important issue in a monitoring system that seeks to avoid false alarms. Suppose a long sequence, T, of observed events contains a suspicious subsequence pattern, S, within it, where the suspicious subsequence S consists of m events and spans a window of size w within T. We address the fundamental problem: Is a certain number of occurrences of a particular subsequence unlikely to be generated by randomness itself (i.e. indicative of suspicious activity)? If the probability of an occurrence generated by randomness is high and an automated monitoring system flags it as suspicious anyway, then such a system will suffer from generating too many false alarms. This paper quantifies the probability of such an S occurring in T within a window of size w, the number of distinct windows containing S as a subsequence, the expected number of such occurrences, its variance, and establishes its limiting distribution that allows setting up an alarm threshold so that the probability of false alarms is very small. We report on experiments confirming the theory and showing that we can detect bad subsequences with low false alarm rate.

J	Zyrianov, Y				Zyrianov, Y			Distribution-based descriptors of the molecular shape	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							CONTINUOUS SYMMETRY MEASURES; ELECTRON-DENSITY; PACKING DENSITY; VOLUME; SURFACES; RADII; HYDROCARBONS; COMPUTATION; COMPLEXITY; DIVERSITY	A rational design of economically cost-effective chemical libraries as well as successful data mining during a process of drug discovery employs a vast array of the molecular descriptors. Despite the huge importance of this area of the research there is still a need for the further development of the simple, intuitive, easily calculable, specific and size-invariant parameters of the molecular shape. Here we present ab initio calculation of the molecular volumes and expectations for the molecular areas of projection. These molecular size parameters were used as a basis to define a group of novel descriptors of the molecular shape. A set of molecular descriptors was developed: ovality, roughness, size-corrected parameters, and the parameters derived from the higher central momenta of the distributions of the size descriptors-skewness and kurtosis. The rationale for the construction of the descriptors was first to calculate the descriptors of the molecular size along many directions in the space and second to use the statistical parameters of the distribution of those descriptors as the shape descriptors. The size descriptors well suited for the above purpose and discussed in this paper are generalized molecular radii and the molecular areas of projection. Molecular volume and projection area-derived descriptors were calculated and their applicability as shape descriptors was illustrated using exploratory methods (factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). The shape descriptors appear to be promising in their ability to discriminate and classify the molecular shapes e.g. spheroids, disklike, rodlike, starlike, crosslike, anglelike, etc.	Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA	Zyrianov, Y (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, 560 Oval Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.	zyrianov@purdue.edu					Arteca G.

J	Soualmia, LF; Darmoni, SJ				Soualmia, LF; Darmoni, SJ			Combining different standards and different approaches for health information retrieval in a quality-controlled gateway	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						controlled vocabulary; data mining; terminology; metadata; information retrieval; Internet	RESOURCES	Internet as source of information is increasing in preeminence in numerous fields, including health. We describe in this paper the CISMeF project (acronym of Catalogue and Index of French-speaking Medical Sites) which has been designed to help the health information consumers and health professionals to find what they are looking for among the numerous health documents available online. The catalogue is founded on two standards: a set of metadata and a terminology based on the MeSH thesaurus which has the same structure and use as an ontology of the medical domain. The structure of the catalogue allows us to place the project at an overlap between the present Web, which is informal, and the forthcoming Semantic Web. Many features of information retrieval and navigation through the catalogue were developed. These features take into account the kind of the end-user (health professional, medical student, patient). The CISMeF-patients catalogue is a sub-catalogue of CISMeF and is dedicated to the patients and the general public. It shares the same model as CISMeF whereas MEDLINE and MedlinePlus do not. We also propose to couple two approaches (morphological processing and data mining) to help the users by correcting and refining their queries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sometimes these instruments are built in a phased approach, with additional measurement capabilities added in later phases. In other cases, technology may mature to the point that the instrument offers new measurement capabilities that were not planned in the original design of the instrument. In still other cases, high-resolution spectral measurements may be too costly to perform on a large sample, and therefore, lower resolution spectral instruments are used to take the majority of measurements. Many applied science questions that are relevant to the earth science remote sensing community require analysis of enormous amounts of data that were generated by instruments with disparate measurement capabilities. This paper addresses this problem using virtual sensors: a method that uses models trained on spectrally rich (high spectral resolution) data to "fill in" unmeasured spectral channels in spectrally poor (low spectral resolution) data. The models we use in this paper are multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines (SVMs) with radial basis function kernels, and SVMs with mixture density Mercer kernels. We demonstrate this method by using models trained on the high spectral resolution Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument to estimate what the equivalent of the MODIS 1.6-mum channel would be for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2) instrument. The scientific motivation for the simulation of the 1.6-mum channel is to improve the ability of the AVHRR/2 sensor to detect clouds over snow and ice.

Responding to this problem, many researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve Naive Bayes via selecting relevant attributes subsets in which attributes are conditionally independent. Interested in this approach, we present a novel algorithm called Evolutional Naive Bayes (simply ENB). Our algorithm, selects relevant attributes subsets by carrying an evolutional search through the whole space of attributes. Our motivation is to improve Naive Bayes ' accuracy in domains that include redundant attributes without degrading Naive Bayes ' accuracy in domains that don ' t. We experimentally tested our algorithm measured by accuracy, using the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka([1]), and compared it to Naive Bayes, SBC[2] and WRAP([3]). The experimental results shows that our algorithm outperforms Naive Bayes measured by classification accuracy significantly and retains the conceptual simplicity and direct theoretical foundation of Naive Bayes.

Thus this article is intended to present some philosophical observations rather than to consider technical details or applications of rough set theory. Therefore we also refrain from presentation of many interesting applications and some generalizations of the theory.

The algorithm is a multilevel representation formula involving no wavelet decomposition in standard sense. Using the radial symmetry property, that comes inherently in the new representation formula, we generate the feature vectors that are shown to be rotation invariant. We show that, using a hybrid data mining technique, the algorithm can be used for rotation invariant content based image retrieval (CBIR). The proposed rotation invariant retrieval algorithm, suitable for both texture and nontexture images, avoids missing any relevant images but may retrieve some other images which are not very relevant. We show that the higher precision can however be achieved by pruning out irrelevant images. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hsu, CC				Hsu, CC			Extending attribute-oriented induction algorithm for major values and numeric values	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						attribute-oriented induction; data mining; pattern extraction; class description; concept hierarchy	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES	Attribute-oriented induction (AOI) uses concept hierarchies to discover hidden patterns from a huge amount of data and presents the concise patterns as a general description of the original data. It is an effective data analysis and data reduction technique. Researchers have recently proposed some extensions of the original method. However, there are still problems. When an attribute has major values, the traditional approach cannot preserve and present these major patterns. In addition, the construction of concept hierarchies for numeric attributes is sometimes subjective, and the generalization of border values near the cutting points of discretization can easily result in misconception. This paper proposes an extended AOI, which generalizes the traditional approach by introducing an additional major values threshold and thereby preserves as well as presents major values. Moreover, we suggest an alternative for processing numeric attributes: computing and presenting the average and deviation of aggregated tuples, which avoids constructing subjectively a numeric concept hierarchy and the generalization of border values. A synthetic data set and a real data set are used for experiments and the results show that the proposed methods are feasible and can induce more precise rules out of the raw data.

J	Intan, R; Mukaidono, M				Intan, R; Mukaidono, M			Fuzzy conditional probability relations and their applications in fuzzy information systems	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data querying; fuzzy conditional probability relation; fuzzy functional; fuzzy information system dependency; fuzzy proposition; fuzzy sets; knowledge discovery and data mining	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES	In our real-world applications, data may be imprecise in which levels or degrees of preciseness of data are intuitively different. In this case, fuzzy set expressions are considered as an alternative to represent the imprecise data. In general, the degree of similarity relationship between two fuzzy (imprecise) data in real-world applications may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive. In order to provide such a degree of similarity between two fuzzy data, we introduced the fuzzy conditional probability relation. The concept of a fuzzy conditional probability relation may be considered as a concrete example of weak similarity relation which in turn is a special type of fuzzy binary relation generalizing similarity relation. Two important applications concerning the application of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) in the presence of a fuzzy data table (usually called fuzzy information system), namely removing redundant objects and recognizing partial or total dependency of (domain) attributes, are considered induced by the fuzzy conditional probability relation. Here, the fuzzy information system contains precise as well as imprecise data (fuzzy values) about objects of interest characterized by some attributes. Related to the dependency of attributes, we introduce the fuzzy functional dependency that satisfies Armstrong's Axioms. In addition, we also discuss some interesting applications such as approximate data reduction and projection, approximate data querying and approximate joining in order to extend the query system.

J	Aggarwal, CC				Aggarwal, CC			A human-computer interactive method for projected clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						high-dimensional data mining; clustering; human-computer interaction	ALGORITHM	Clustering is a central task in data mining applications such as customer segmentation. High-dimensional data has always been a challenge for clustering algorithms because of,the inherent sparsity of the points. Therefore, techniques have recently been proposed to find clusters in hidden subspaces of the data. However, since the behavior of the data can vary considerably in different subspaces, it is often difficult to define the notion of a cluster with the use of simple mathematical formalizations. The widely used practice of treating clustering as the exact problem of optimizing an arbitrarily chosen objective function can often lead to misleading results. In fact, the proper clustering definition may vary not only with the application and data set but also with the perceptions of the end user. This makes it difficult to separate the definition of the clustering problem from the perception of an end-user. In this paper, we propose a system which performs high-dimensional clustering by cooperation between the human and the computer. The complex task of cluster creation is accomplished through a combination of human intuition and the computational support provided by the computer. The result is a system which leverages the best abilities of both the human and the computer for solving the clustering problem.

J	Guralnik, V; Karypis, G				Guralnik, V; Karypis, G			Parallel tree-projection-based sequence mining algorithms	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						frequent sequential patterns; database projection algorithms; data mining	ASSOCIATION RULES	Discovery of sequential patterns is becoming increasingly useful and essential in many scientific and commercial domains. Enormous sizes of available datasets and possibly large number of mined patterns demand efficient, scalable, and parallel algorithms. Even though a number of algorithms have been developed to efficiently parallelize frequent pattern discovery algorithms that are based on the candidate-generation-and-counting framework, the problem of parallelizing the more efficient projection-based algorithms has received relatively little attention and existing parallel formulations have been targeted only toward shared-memory architectures. The irregular and unstructured nature of the task-graph generated by these algorithms and the fact that these tasks operate on overlapping sub-databases makes it challenging to efficiently parallelize these algorithms for scalable distributed-memory parallel computing architectures. In this paper we present and study a variety of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for a tree-projection-based frequent sequence discovery algorithm that are able to minimize the various overheads associated with load imbalance, database overlap, and interprocessor communication. Our experimental evaluation on a 32 processor IBM SP show that these algorithms are capable of achieving good speedups, Substantially reducing the amount of the required work to find sequential patterns in large databases.

To encourage users to provide correct inputs, We recently proposed a data distortion scheme for association rule mining that simultaneously provides both privacy to the user and accuracy in the mining results. However, mining the distorted database can be orders of magnitude more time-consuming as compared to raining the original database. In this paper, we address this issue and demonstrate that by (a) generalizing the distortion process to perform symbol-specific distortion, (b) appropriately chooosing the distortion parameters, and (c) applying a variety of optimizations in the reconstruction process, runtime efficiencies that are well within an order of magnitude of undistorted mining can be achieved.

It offers the motivation behind this application, explains the system architecture, discusses many challenges that the project faced, and shares some of the adopted solutions. The main contribution of the paper is our experience in building one of the very early distributed data stream mining systems for wireless applications that performs most of the data analysis related tasks using light-weight on-board computing devices. This paper points out that the distributed data mining technology can play a key role in solving real-life problems in a mobile application environment where computing, storage, power, and communication resources re limited. The paper also illustrates how privacy-preserving distributed data mining can play an important role in this type of applications.

There are various approaches available for intrusion detection; however, every method has its strengths and weaknesses. As a novel and promising data mining approach, multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) has been successfully applied to credit card portfolio management for classifying two or multiple groups. The goal of this research is to determine the applicability of the MCLP algorithm to the intrusion detection problem. The demonstration of successful MCLP application in intrusion detection can add another option to network security toolbox. There are two objectives of this paper: first, apply MCLP to network intrusion detection system to identifying attacks; second, employ ensemble method to improve detection results. An overview of the two-group MCLP model formulation, the network intrusion, and the dataset used (KDD-99) in this paper are introduced first. Then MCLP is employed to KDD-99 and results are cross-validated. After that, the ensemble method is tested. As the results indicate, the ensemble method is better than cross-validated MCLP though the magnitude of the increase seems slight due the nature of the dataset.

The method recursively mines a string of symbols by finding frequent patterns, encoding them with unique symbols and rewriting the string using this new coding. We apply this technique to two related but important problems in computer security: (i) masquerade defection to prevent a security attack in which an intruder impersonates a legitimate user to gain access to the resources, and (U) author identification, in which anonymous or disputed computer session needs to be attributed to one of a set of potential authors. Many methods based on automata theory, Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian models or even matching algorithms from bioinformatics have been proposed to solve the masquerading detection problem but less work has been done on the author identification. We used recursive data mining to characterize the structure and high-level symbols in user signatures and the monitored sessions. We used one-class SVM to measure the similarity of these two characterizations. We applied weighting prediction scheme to author identification. On the SEA dataset that we used in our experiments, the results were very promising.

Feature selection algorithm focuses mainly on the design of a criterion function and the selection of a search strategy. In this paper, a novel feature selection approach (NFSA) based on quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) and a good evaluation criterion is proposed to select the optimal feature subset from a large number of features extracted from radar emitter signals (RESs). The criterion function is given firstly. Then, detailed algorithm of QGA is described and its performances are analyzed. Finally, the best feature subset is selected from the original feature set (OFS) composed of 16 features of RESs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces greatly the dimensions of OFS and heightens accurate recognition rate of RESs, which indicates that NFSA is feasible and effective.

Its aims is to look for novel and interesting explanatory knowledge across text documents. The approach uses natural language technology and genetic algorithms to produce explanatory novel hypotheses. The proposed approach is interdisciplinary, involving concepts not only from evolutionary algorithms but also from many kinds of text mining methods. Accordingly, new kinds of genetic operations suitable for text mining are proposed. The principles behind the representation and a new proposal for using multiobjective evaluation at the semantic level are described. Some promising results and their assessment by human experts are also discussed which indicate the plausibility of the model for effective KDT.

We present three new techniques for performing visual analysis of SOMs. The first is a computationally light contraction method, closely related to the SOM's training algorithm, designed to facilitate cluster and trajectory analysis. The second is an enhanced geometric interpolation method, related to multidimensional scaling, which forms a mapping from the input space onto the map. Finally, we propose the explicit representation of graphs like the SOM's induced Delaunay triangulation for topology preservation and cluster analysis. The new methods provide an enhanced interpretation of the information contained in an SOM, leading to a better understanding of the data distributions with which they are trained, as well as providing insight into the map's formation.

Even more, around 51% of the rice genome is occupied by repetitive elements. The analysis presented here indicates that repetitive elements in complete genomes may have been very important in the evolutionary genomics. In this study, a database, called the Repeat Sequence Database, is first designed and implemented to store complete and comprehensive repetitive sequences. See http://rsdb.csie.neu.edu.tw for more information. The database contains direct, inverted and palindromic repetitive sequences, and each repetitive sequence has a variable length ranging from seven to many hundred nucleotides. The repetitive sequences in the database are explored using a mathematical algorithm to mine rules on how combinations of individual binding sites are distributed among repetitive sequences in the database. Combinations of transcription factor binding sites in the repetitive sequences are obtained and then data mining techniques are applied to mine association rules from these combinations. The discovered associations are further pruned to remove insignificant associations and obtain a set of associations. The mined association rules facilitate efforts to identify gene classes regulated by similar mechanisms and accurately predict regulatory elements. Experiments are performed on several genomes including C. elegans, human chromosome 22, and yeast.

J	Chang, RF; Lu, CN				Chang, RF; Lu, CN			Load profile assignment of low voltage customers for power retail market applications	IEE PROCEEDINGS-GENERATION TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								To facilitate retail choice in a competitive power market, the knowledge of hourly load shape by customer class is necessary. Requiring a meter as a prerequisite for lower voltage customers to choose a power supplier is not considered practical at the present time. A technique which uses load research and customers' monthly energy usage data for a preliminary screening of customer load profiles is presented. Two data mining techniques, namely, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) method and an artificial neural network (ANN) based pattern recognition technique, are utilised in this work. The proposed method can be used by the Energy Service Provider (ESP) to assign customers to specific load profiles with certainty factors. Customers with less certainty in the assignment will need meter installation or further investigation in order to determine which classes they belong to. Test data are from actual measurement and the customer information system (CIS) of Taiwan Power Company (TPC). Promising results on assigning existing under 220 V customers to their proper load profiles are illustrated.

We show how these weight generating functions can provide a vehicle with which a data analyst can express desired summarizing statistics. Our goal here, is to develop an understanding of the relationship between weight generating functions and resulting summarizing statistics.

We have developed a project called DBA Companion devoted to the understanding of logical database constraints from which logical database tuning can be achieved. In this setting, two main data mining issues need to be addressed: the first one is the design of efficient algorithms for functional dependencies and inclusion dependencies inference and the second one is about the interestingness of the discovered knowledge. In this paper, we point out some relationships between database analysis and data mining. In this setting, we sketch the underlying themes of our approach. Some database applications that could benefit from our project are also described, including logical database tuning.

In this work, we develop a novel idea of top-K objective-directed data mining, which focuses on mining the top-K high utility closed patterns that directly support a given business objective. To association mining, we add the concept of utility to capture highly desirable statistical patterns and present a level-wise itemset mining algorithm. With both positive and negative utilities, the anti-monotone pruning strategy in Apriori algorithm no longer holds. In response, we develop a new pruning strategy based on utilities that allow pruning of low utility itemsets to be done by means of a weaker but anti-monotonic condition. Our experimental results show that our algorithm does not require a user specified minimum utility and hence is effective in practice.

S	Elias, B		Kuhn, W; Worboys, M; Timpf, S		Elias, B			Extracting landmarks with data mining methods	SPATIAL INFORMATION THEORY, PROCEEDINGS: FOUNDATIONS OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT)	SEP 24-28, 2003	KARTAUSE ITTINGEN, SWITZERLAND					The navigation task is a very demanding application for mobile users. The algorithms of present software solutions are based on the established methods of car navigation systems and thus exhibit some inherent disadvantages: findings in spatial cognition research have shown that human users need landmarks for an easy and successful wayfinding. Typically, however, an object is not a landmark per se, but can be one relative to its environment. Unfortunately, these objects are not part of route guidance information systems at the moment. Therefore, it is an aim of research to make landmarks for routing instructions available. In this paper we focus on a method to automatically derive landmarks from existing spatial databases. Here a new approach is presented to investigate existing spatial databases and try to extract landmarks automatically by use of a knowledge discovery process and data mining methods. In this paper two different algorithms, the classification method ID3 and the clustering procedure Cobweb, are investigated, whether they are suitable for discovering landmarks.

J	Hwang, SY; Hsiung, WC; Yang, WS				Hwang, SY; Hsiung, WC; Yang, WS			A prototype WWW literature recommendation system for digital libraries	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						digital libraries; recommendations; web sites; cluster analysis; data mining	FRAMEWORK	This article describes a service for providing literature recommendations, which is part of a networked digital library project whose principal goal is to develop technologies for supporting digital services. The proposed literature recommendation system makes use of the Web usage logs of a literature digital library. The recommendation framework consists of three sequential steps: data preparation of the Web usage log, discovery of article associations, and article recommendations. We discuss several design alternatives for conducting these steps. These alternatives are evaluated using the Web logs of our university's electronic thesis and dissertation (ETD) system. The proposed literature recommendation system has been incorporated into our university's ETD system, and is currently operational.

This paper shows how this advantage can be utilized in genetic rule selection for the design of fuzzy rule-based classification systems. Our genetic rule selection is a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a pre-specified number of candidate rules are extracted from numerical data using a data mining technique. In the second stage, an EMO algorithm is used for finding non-dominated rule sets with respect to three objectives: to maximize the number of correctly classified training patterns, to minimize the number of rules, and to minimize the total rule length. Since the first objective is measured on training patterns, the evolution of rule sets tends to overfit to training patterns. The question is whether the other two objectives work as a safeguard against the overfitting. In this paper, we examine the effect of the three-objective formulation on the generalization ability (i.e., classification rates on test patterns) of obtained rule sets through computer simulations where many non-dominated rule sets are generated using an EMO algorithm for a number of high-dimensional pattern classification problems.

Starting with our previous work [7,8,9,13,14-16] we propose some extensions to the form of a linguistic summary. The new form still fits the scheme of an association rule [1,24,25]. However, in comparison to the previous approaches, the use of a range of linguistic values as items and their linguistically quantified aggregation is allowed. An algorithm for mining such association rules within this framework, via the authors' FQUERY for Access package, is presented. Moreover, we show that Zadeh's [31] idea of protoforms, and their hierarchies, can be employed to represent various types of linguistic summaries.

J	Kao, SC; Chang, HC; Lin, CH				Kao, SC; Chang, HC; Lin, CH			Decision support for the academic library acquisition budget allocation via circulation database mining	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision support; acquisition budget allocation; data mining	KNOWLEDGE	Many approaches to decision support for the academic library acquisition budget allocation have been proposed to diversely reflect the management requirements. Different from these methods that focus mainly on either statistical analysis or goal programming, this paper introduces a model (ABAMDM, acquisition budget allocation model via data mining) that addresses the use of descriptive knowledge discovered in the historical circulation data explicitly to support allocating library acquisition budget. The major concern in this study is that the budget allocation should be able to reflect a requirement that the more a department makes use of its acquired materials in the present academic year, the more it can get budget for the coming year. The primary output of the ABAMDM used to derive weights of acquisition budget allocation contains two parts. One is the descriptive knowledge via utilization concentration and the other is the suitability via utilization connection for departments concerned. An application to the library of Kun Shan University of Technology was described to demonstrate the introduced ABAMDM in practice. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially, the discovery of what we call chances, significant novel events, is realized in this process. The example shown here is an application to questionnaire analysis for understanding new behaviors of Internet users. Internet users are born and bred with face-to-face human relations in the real world, but their interactions with WWW are distilling new value-criteria, keeping personal real-world senses of rationality, empathy, ethics, etc. In our method for aiding the discovery based on the double-helix model, the in-depth interaction of the Internet, the fundamental (i.e., common both in the Internet and in the real world) characters and the behaviors of people are discussed with revealing unnoticed value-criteria.

The Genetic Programming is used to construct new features from those available in the data, a potentially significant process for data mining since it gives consideration to hidden relationships between features. The Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which such features are the most predictive. Using ten well-known datasets we show that our approach, in comparison to C4.5 alone, provides marked improvement in a number of cases.

Such conflicts are often reflected by discrepancies in attribute values of the same data object. In this paper, we describe a recently developed prototype system, Discovering and REconciling ConflicTs (DIRECT). The system mines data value conversion rules in the process of integrating business data from multiple sources. The system architecture and functional modules are described. The process of discovering conversion rules from sales data of a trading company is presented as an illustrative example. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Elliot, MJ; Manning, AM; Ford, RW				Elliot, MJ; Manning, AM; Ford, RW			A computational algorithm for handling the special uniques problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						statistical disclosure; data mining; algorithms; classification		Many organizations require detailed individual-level information, much of which has been collected under guarantees of confidentiality. However, simple anonymization procedures, i.e. removing names and addresses, are insufficient for this to be ensured. The records belonging to certain individuals have a high probability of being identified (as their contents, or attributes, are unusual) and therefore have the potential to be recognized spontaneously - such records are referred to as special uniques. Consider, for example, a sixteen-year-old widow in a population survey. Confidentiality of a given dataset cannot be enabled until all special unique records are identified and either disguised or removed. However, to the knowledge of the authors, no exhaustive automated analysis of this nature has been conducted due to the demanding levels of computation and data storage that are required. This paper introduces a new algorithm that locates 'risky' records in discrete data by first identifying all unique attribute sets (up to a user-specified maximum size) and secondly by grading the 'risk' of each record by considering the number and distribution of unique attribute sets within each record. Empirical tests indicate that the algorithm is highly effective at picking out 'risky' records from large samples of data.

The main objective of our research was to decrease the error rates for diagnosis of two fatal forms of melanoma based on these rule sets. The improvement was accomplished using two different techniques for postprocessing of rule sets: changing of rule strengths and rule truncation cutoffs. A rule strength is defined as the number of training cases correctly, classified by the rule. Rule truncation means an elimination of weaker rides. Using these two techniques simultaneously is introduced in this paper for the first time. The criterion for the choice of the optimal form of the rule sets was the minimum of the sum of error rates for diagnosis of two fatal forms of melanoma. Our research shows that at the cost of a minimal increase of the total error rate for patients that do not need immediate help, the sum of error rates for dangerous forms of melanoma may be highly decreased. Also, for the optimal rule set, the sum of error rates for all forms of melanoma is minimal as well.

Through WUM, we are able to gain a better understanding of both the web and web user access patterns; a knowledge that is crucial for realization of full economic potential of the web. In this chapter, we describe a framework for WUM that particularly satisfies the challenging requirements of the web personalization applications. For on-line and anonymous web personalization to be effective, WUM must be accomplished in real-time as accurately as possible. On the other hand, the analysis tier of the WUM system should allow compromise between scalability and accuracy to be applicable to real-life web-sites with numerous visitors. Within our WUM framework, we introduce a distributed user tracking approach for accurate, efficient, and scalable collection of the usage data. We also propose a new model, the Feature Matrices (FM) model, to capture and analyze users access patterns. With FM, various features of the usage data can be captured with flexible precision so that we can trade off accuracy for scalability based on the specific application requirements. Moreover, due to low update complexity of the model, FM can adapt to user behavior changes in real-time. Finally, we define a novel similarity measure based on FM that is specifically designed for accurate classification of partial navigation patterns in real-time. Our extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data verify correctness and efficacy of our WUM framework for efficient web personalization.

Some important classes of new applications that will be enabled by this revolutionary development include location-based services, tourist services, mobile electronic commerce, and digital battlefield. Some existing application classes that will benefit from the development include transportation and air traffic control, weather forecasting, emergency response, mobile resource management, and mobile workforce. Location management, i.e. the management of transient location information, is an enabling technology for all these applications. Location management is also a fundamental component of other technologies such as fly-through visualization, context awareness, augmented reality, cellular communication, and dynamic resource discovery.

J	Hu, XH; Cercone, N				Hu, XH; Cercone, N			Discovering maximal generalized decision rules through horizontal and vertical data reduction	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge acquisition and machine learning; knowledge base technology; intelligent database; Al algorithms; data mining		We present a method to learn maximal generalized decision rules from databases by integrating discretization, generalization and rough set feature selection. Our method reduces the data horizontally and vertically, In the first phase, discretization and generalization are integrated and the numeric attributes are discretized into a few intervals. The primitive values of symbolic attributes are replaced by high level concepts and some obvious superfluous or irrelevant symbolic attributes are also eliminated. Horizontal reduction is accomplished by merging identical tuples after the substitution of an attribute value by its higher level value in a pre-defined concept hierarchy for symbolic attributes, or the discretization of continuous (or numeric) attributes. This phase greatly decreases the number of tuples in the database. In the second phase, a novel context-sensitive feature merit measure is used to rank the features, a subset of relevant attributes is chosen based on rough set theory and the merit values of the features. A reduced table is obtained by removing those attributes which are not in the relevant attributes subset and the data set is further reduced vertically without destroying the interdependence relationships between classes and the attributes. Then rough set-based value reduction is further performed on the reduced table and all redundant condition values are dropped. Finally, tuples in the reduced table are transformed into a set of maximal generalized decision rules. The experimental results on UCI data sets and a real market database demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the feature space and improve learning accuracy.

Computing an iceberg cube, which contains only aggregates above certain thresholds, is an effective way to derive nontrivial multidimensional aggregations for OLAP and data mining. In this paper, we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes with some popularly used complex measures, such as average, and develop a methodology that adopts a weaker but anti-monotonic condition for testing and pruning search space. In particular, for efficient computation of iceberg cubes with the average measure, we propose a top-k average pruning method and extend two previously studied methods, Apriori and BUC, to Top-k Apriori and Top-k BUC. To further improve the performance, an interesting hypertree structure, called H-tree, is designed and a new iceberg cubing method, called Top-k H-Cubing, is developed. Our performance study shows that Top-k BUC and Top-k H-Cubing are two promising candidates for scalable computation, and Top-k H-Cubing has better performance in most cases.

J	Racine, K; Yang, Q				Racine, K; Yang, Q			Redundancy detection in semistructured case bases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; knowledge and case base maintenance; knowledge acquisition in expert systems		With the dramatic proliferation of case-based reasoning systems in commercial applications, many case bases are now becoming legacy systems. They represent a significant portion of an organization's assets, but they are large and difficult to maintain. One of the contributing factors is that these case bases are often large and yet unstructured or semistructured; they are represented in natural language text. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the case bases are often authored and updated by different people from a variety of knowledge sources, making it highly likely for a case base to contain redundant and inconsistent knowledge. In this paper, we present methods and a system for maintaining large and semistructured case bases. We focus on a difficult problem in case base maintenance: redundancy detection. This problem is particularly pervasive when one deals with a semistructured case base. We will discuss an information-retrieval-based algorithm and an implemented system for solving this problem. As the ability to contain the knowledge acquisition problem is of paramount importance. our method allows one to express relevant domain expertise for detecting redundancy naturally and effortlessly. Empirical evaluations of the system demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods in several large domains.

Services can range from bit transport all the way up to distributed value-added services like video teleconferencing virtual private networking, data mining, and distributed interactive simulations. Before such services can be supported in a general and dynamic manner, we have to develop appropriate resource management mechanisms. These resource management mechanisms must make it possible to identify and allocate resources that meet service or application requirements, support both isolation and controlled dynamic shoring of resources across services and applications sharing physical resources, and be customizable so services and applications can toiler resource usage to optimize their performance. The Darwin project has developed a set of customizable resource management mechanisms that support valve-added services. In this article we present and motivate these mechanisms, describe their implementation in a prototype system, and describe the results of a series of proof-of-concept experiments.

There is an ongoing exponential growth in the volume, quality, and complexity of astronomical data sets, mainly through large digital sky surveys and archives. The Virtual Observatory (VO) concept represents a scientific and technological framework needed to cope with this data flood. Systematic exploration of the observable parameter spaces, covered by large digital sky surveys spanning a range of wavelengths, will be one of the primary modes of research with a VO. This is where the truly new discoveries will be made, and new insights be gained about the already known astronomical objects and phenomena. We review some of the methodological challenges posed by the analysis of large and complex data sets expected in the VO-based research. The challenges are driven both by the size and the complexity of the data sets (billions of data vectors in parameter spaces of tens or hundreds of dimensions), by the heterogeneity of the data and measurement errors, including differences in basic survey parameters for the federated data sets (e.g., in the positional accuracy and resolution, wavelength coverage, time baseline, etc.), various selection effects, as well as the intrinsic clustering properties (functional form, topology) of the data distributions in the parameter spaces of observed attributes. Answering these challenges will require substantial collaborative efforts and partnerships between astronomers, computer scientists, and statisticians.

Unfortunately, development of appropriate data management and visualization techniques has not kept pace with the growth in size and complexity of such datasets. To address these issues, we are developing a prototype, integrated system (EVITA) to facilitate exploration of tera-scale datasets. The cornerstone of the EVITA system is a representational scheme that allows ranked access to macroscopic features in the dataset. The data and grid are transformed using wavelet techniques while a feature-detection algorithm is used to identify and rank contextually significant features directly in the wavelet domain. The most significant parts of the dataset are thus available for detailed examination in a progressive fashion. The work presented here is similar in essence to much of the work in the traditional data-mining community. We first describe the basic system and follow with a discussion of ongoing work, focusing on efforts in multiscale feature detection and progressive access. Finally, we demonstrate the system for a two-dimensional vector field derived from an oceanographic dataset.

We introduce an innovative hyperspace method whereby data are separated into subspaces, features selected according to data patterns, and control rendered in the original feature space. This technique has three major advantages: no equipment is added, no experiment is needed, and no interruption occurs to production. A number of proprietary algorithms have been built into a software product, MasterMiner(TM), for use in materials design and manufacturing. Examples are given to show the efficacy of the proposed method and MasterMiner tool. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Cheung, DW; Hwang, HY; Fu, AW; Han, JW				Cheung, DW; Hwang, HY; Fu, AW; Han, JW			Efficient rule-based attribute-oriented induction for data mining	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery in databases; rule-based concept generalization; rule-based concept hierarchy; attribute-oriented induction; inductive learning; learning and adaptive systems	DATABASES	Data mining has become an important technique which has tremendous potential in many commercial and industrial applications. Attribute-oriented induction is a powerful mining technique and has been successfully implemented in the data mining system DBMiner (Han et al. Proc. 1996 Int'l Conf. on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (KDD'96), Portland, Oregon, 1996). However, its induction capability is limited by the unconditional concept generalization. In this paper, we extend the concept generalization to rule-based concept hierarchy, which enhances greatly its induction power. When previously proposed induction algorithm is applied to the more general rule-based case, a problem of induction anomaly occurs which impacts its efficiency. We have developed an efficient algorithm to facilitate induction on the rule-based case which can avoid the anomaly. Performance studies have shown that the algorithm is superior than a previously proposed algorithm based on backtracking.

MDDs are an exceptionally good representation for generalized decomposition because they are canonical and they can represent very large functions. Algorithms developed in this paper are for Boolean/multivalued input and output, completely/incompletely specified functions with application to logic synthesis, machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. We compare the run-times and decision diagram sizes of our algorithms to existing decomposition partitioning algorithms based on decision diagrams. The comparisons show that our algorithms are faster and do not result in exponential diagram sizes when decomposing functions with small bound sets.

As with many data mining application domains, the identification of patterns that are considered interesting is a problem that must be solved in addition to simply generating them. A necessary step in identifying interesting results is quantifying what is considered uninteresting in order to form a basis for comparison. Several research efforts have relied on manually generated sets of uninteresting rules. However, manual generation of a comprehensive set of evidence about beliefs for a particular domain is impractical in many cases. Generally, domain knowledge can be used to automatically create evidence for or against a set of beliefs. This paper develops a quantitative model based on support logic for determining the interestingness of discovered patterns. For Web Usage Mining, there are three types of domain information available, usage, content, and structure. This paper also describes algorithms for using these three types of information to automatically identify interesting knowledge. These algorithms have been incorporated into the Web Site Information Filter (WebSIFT) system and examples of interesting frequent itemsets automatically discovered from real Web data are presented.

Dementia staging in clinical settings is at present complex and highly subjective because of the ambiguities and the complicated nature of existing guidelines. Our model abstracts the two-stage process used by physicians to arrive at the global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) score. The model incorporates learning intermediate concepts (CDRS category scores) in the first stage that then become the feature space for the second stage (global CDRS score). The sample consisted of 678 patients evaluated in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Irvine. The demographic variables, functional and cognitive test results used by physicians for the task of dementia severity staging were used as input to the machine learning algorithms. Decision tree learners and rule inducers (C4.5, Cart, C4.5 rules) were selected for our study as they give expressive models, and Naive Bayes was used as a baseline algorithm for comparison purposes. We first learned the six CDRS category scores (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, personal care, home and hobbies, and community affairs). These learned CDRS category scores were then used to learn the global CDRS scores. The Two-Stage ML model classified as well as or better than the published inter-rater agreements for both the category and global CDRS scoring by dementia experts. Furthermore, for the most critical distinction, normal versus very mildly impaired, the Two-Stage ML model was 28.1 and 6.6% more accurate than published performances by domain experts. Our study of the CDRS examined one of the largest, most diverse samples in the literature, suggesting that our findings are robust. The Two-Stage ML model also identified a CDRS category, Judgment and Problem Solving, which has low classification accuracy similar to published reports. Since this CDRS category appears to be mainly responsible for misclassification of the global CDRS score when it occurs, further attribute and algorithm research on the Judgment and Problem Solving CDRS score could improve its accuracy as well as that of the global CDRS score.

Graphs from four studies of ACTH and cortisol plasma levels collected throughout the 24 h day in humans were scanned into digital form and the data points extracted. To investigate the magnitude of ACTH stimulation of cortisol secretion across the 24 h, Monte Carlo methods were used to fit the parameters of a computer model of the ACTH-adrenal axis to the extracted data. ACTH was found to have a greater effect on cortisol secretion during the peaks of the cycle than at the nadir. This finding could not be explained by previously published dose response curves of ACTH effect. This implies that other modulators influence the effect of ACTH on the adrenal. This study also demonstrates how available computer programs can be used to examine models of physiologic regulation using data already available in the literature.

Natural language processing techniques axe used to identify key entities in individual articles, allowing us to represent an article as a set of items. This allows us to view the problem in a database/data mining context: Identifying related groups of items. This paper presents a novel method for identifying related items based on "traditional" data mining techniques. Frequent itemsets axe generated from the groups of items, followed by clusters formed with a hypergraph partitioning scheme. We present an evaluation against a manually-categorized "ground truth" news corpus showing this technique is effective in identifying topics in collections of news articles.

PRINCIPLES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (PKDD 99)	SEP 15-18, 1999	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Komercni Banka	UNIV ECON, LAB INTELLIGENT SYST		MULTIPLE IMPUTATION	In many applications of data mining a - sometimes considerable - part of the data values is missing. Despite the frequent occurrence of missing data, most data mining algorithms handle missing data in a rather ad-hoc way, or simply ignore the problem, We investigate simulation-based data augmentation to handle missing data, which is based on filling-in (imputing) one or more plausible values for the missing data. One advantage of this approach is that the imputation phase is separated from the analysis phase, allowing for different data mining algorithms to be applied to the completed data sets. We compare the use of imputation to surrogate splits, such as used in CART, to handle missing data in tree-based mining algorithms. Experiments show that imputation tends to outperform surrogate splits in terms of predictive accuracy of the resulting models. Averaging over M > 1 models resulting from M imputations yields even better results as it profits from variance reduction in much the same way as procedures such as bagging.

In this paper we introduce an extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that learns mixture hierarchies in a computationally efficient manner. Efficiency is achieved by progressing in a bottom-up fashion, i.e. by clustering the mixture components of a given level in the hierarchy to obtain those of the level above. This clustering requires only knowledge of the mixture parameters, there being no need to resort to intermediate samples. In addition to practical applications, the algorithm allows a new interpretation of EM that makes clear the relationship with non-parametric kernel-based estimation methods, provides explicit control over the trade-off between the bias and variance of EM estimates, and offers new insights about the behavior of deterministic annealing methods commonly used with EM to escape local minima of the likelihood.

However, in order to make KDD useful, many problems remain to be solved. One such problem is the query formulation problem: "What to do if one does not know how to specify the desired query to begin with?" In this paper we explore an approach to deal with this problem. We describe a conceptual model for user-guided knowledge discovery, and a methodology for query construction based on this model. The methodology allows the user to express what kind of knowledge is to be discovered, thus incorporating user intention to alleviate the overabundance problem which has hampered the development of data mining. A user starts from the goal at the top-most level, and refines queries under the guide of an incrementally constructed causal network. The process of query construction is illustrated by examples.

It is argued that "top-down" binary decision trees can force orthogonal partitions on to data whose shape due to correlated variables might indicate that a nonorthogonal partition is more appropriate, whereas "bottom-up" hierarchical cluster analysis is better at recovering the true shape. A fast algorithm is described for Ward's method, capable of constructing clustering trees for thousands of observations and therefore suitable for KDD applications. A hybrid clustering method is proposed which combines the best features of Ward's method and single linkage (nearest neighbor) to resolve the shape of clusters having non-zero covariance. The use of an agglomerative tree for identification is discussed, and the methods are illustrated by reference to the H-R diagram of visual stars. Finally, implementation for Windows is described.

However, before this potential can be realized, one needs to be able to relate the strategic objectives of a business to the use of the data mining technology. In this paper we focus on one aspect of that requirement, the translation of managerial goals into parameters of the algorithm being used to analyze the data. The first step in the process is to define a mapping from managerial goals to the performance measures of the algorithm. We then propose and apply an experimental approach using a classification algorithm, Probabilistic Inductive Learning, to develop a mapping between the performance measures and the parameters of the algorithm The experimental results are analyzed and guidelines are given for setting the bias of the algorithm to meet managerial goals. We conclude by recommending that an experimental analysis similar to what we proposed be conducted for all data mining algorithms and provided along with documentation as an aid to the user.

Specifically, an episode (claims) database for pathology services and a general practitioners database were used. Association rules were applied to the episode database; neural segmentation was applied to the overlaying of both databases. The results obtained from this study demonstrate the potential value of data mining in health insurance information systems, by detecting patterns in the ordering of pathology services and by classifying the general practitioners into groups reflecting the nature and style of their practices. The approach used led to results which could not have been obtained using conventional techniques.

J	MOTT, S				MOTT, S			CASE-BASED REASONING - MARKET, APPLICATIONS, AND FIT WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Case-based reasoning (CBR), the hit of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence annual conference in 1991 and 1992 is now enjoying a surge of interest in its first year of commercial availability. Knowledge-based system designers, developers, integrators, and tool vendors are now seriously considering the role and utility of CBR in leveraging the vast experience within organizations for more effective decision making. The potential market for CBR appears enormous, particularly in more complex problem-solving domains, but the areas of most immediate interest are in applications where efficient information processing needs are urgent, such as automated help desks. Early experiments pairing CBR with rule-based systems will soon lead to hybrid combinations with other ''close approximation'' technologies, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, genetic algorithms, and so forth. CBR appears headed for a sustaining role not only as a useful complement in knowledge-based information processing technology but also as an engine for ''mainstream '' information tasks of the future (e.g., intelligent text processing and retrieval, data mining, and projective reasoning). This article will discuss this emerging role for CBR and its implications from a marketing perspective.		MOTT, S (reprint author), COGNIT SYST INC,234 CHURCH ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06903, USA.

J	Martinez, S; Sanchez, D; Valls, A; Batet, M				Martinez, Sergio; Sanchez, David; Valls, Aida; Batet, Montserrat			Privacy protection of textual attributes through a semantic-based masking method	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Privacy protection; Anonymity; Ontologies; Semantic similarity; Fusion of textual data		Using microdata provided by statistical agencies has many benefits from the data mining point of view. However, such data often involve sensitive information that can be directly or indirectly related to individuals. An appropriate anonymisation process is needed to minimise the risk of disclosure. Several masking methods have been developed to deal with continuous-scale numerical data or bounded textual values but approaches to tackling the anonymisation of textual values are scarce and shallow. Because of the importance of textual data in the Information Society, in this paper we present a new masking method for anonymising unbounded textual values based on the fusion of records with similar values to form groups of indistinguishable individuals. Since, from the data exploitation point of view, the utility of textual information is closely related to the preservation of its meaning, our method relies on the structured knowledge representation given by ontologies. This domain knowledge is used to guide the masking process towards the merging that best preserves the semantics of the original data. Because textual data typically consist of large and heterogeneous value sets, our method provides a computationally efficient algorithm by relying on several heuristics rather than exhaustive searches. The method is evaluated with real data in a concrete data mining application that involves solving a clustering problem. We also compare the method with more classical approaches that focus on optimising the value distribution of the dataset. Results show that a semantically grounded anonymisation best preserves the utility of data in both the theoretical and the practical setting, and reduces the probability of record linkage. At the same time, it achieves good scalability with regard to the size of input data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In microarray analysis, classification techniques are applied in order to discriminate diseases or to predict outcomes based on gene expression patterns, and perhaps even to identify the best treatment for given genetic signature. The most important challenge in gene expression data analysis lies in how to deal with its unique "high dimension small sample" characteristic, which makes many traditional classification techniques non-applicable or inefficient; and hence, more dedicated techniques are nowadays needed in order to approach this problem. Fuzzy logic is recently shown that is a powerful and suitable soft computing tool for handling the complex problems under incomplete data conditions. In this paper, a new hybrid model is proposed that combines artificial intelligence with fuzzy in order to benefit from unique advantages of both fuzzy logic and the classification power of the artificial neural networks (ANNs), to construct an efficient and accurate hybrid classifier in less available data situations. The proposed model, because of using the fuzzy parameters instead of the crisp parameters, will need less data set in comparing with traditional nonfuzzy neural networks in its training process or with same training sample can better learn and hence can yield more accurate results than traditional neural networks. In addition of theoretical evidence of using fuzzy logic, empirical results of gene expression classification indicate that the proposed model exhibits effectively improved classification accuracy in comparison with traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) and also some other well-known statistical and intelligent classification models such as the linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and the support vector machines (SVMs). Therefore, the proposed model can be applied as an appropriate alternate approach for solving problems with scant data such as gene expression data classification, specifically when higher classification accuracy is needed.

Energy distribution over wavelet subbands is applied to find these important texture features. In this paper, we investigate the discriminatory potential of wavelet features obtained from the daubechies (db3), symlets (sym3), and biorthogonal (bio3.3, bio3.5, and bio3.7) wavelet filters. We propose a novel technique to extract energy signatures obtained using 2-D discrete wavelet transform, and subject these signatures to different feature ranking and feature selection strategies. We have gauged the effectiveness of the resultant ranked and selected subsets of features using a support vector machine, sequential minimal optimization, random forest, and naive Bayes classification strategies. We observed an accuracy of around 93% using tenfold cross validations to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.

The US Food and Drug Administration maintains an adverse event reporting system (AERS) to facilitate the detection of ADE in drugs. Various data mining approaches have been developed that use AERS to detect signals identifying associations between drugs and ADE. The signals must then be monitored further by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Objective To develop a new methodology that combines existing data mining algorithms with chemical information by analysis of molecular fingerprints to enhance initial ADE signals generated from AERS, and to provide a decision support mechanism to facilitate the identification of novel adverse events. Results The method achieved a significant improvement in precision in identifying known ADE, and a more than twofold signal enhancement when applied to the ADE rhabdomyolysis. The simplicity of the method assists in highlighting the etiology of the ADE by identifying structurally similar drugs. A set of drugs with strong evidence from both AERS and molecular fingerprint-based modeling is constructed for further analysis.

Weighted dynamic time warping for time series classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Dynamic time warping; Adaptive weights; Weighted dynamic time warping; Modified logistic weight function; Time series classification; Time series clustering	IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and clustering problems. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The face completion algorithm proposed in this paper includes three main procedures: 1) sparse representation for partially occluded face classification; 2) image-based data mining; and 3) graph Laplace (GL) for face image completion. The novel part of the proposed framework is GL, as named from graphical models and the Laplace equation, and can achieve a high-quality repairing of damaged or occluded faces. The relationship between the GL and the traditional Poisson equation is proven. We apply our face repairing algorithm to produce completed faces, and use face recognition to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the GL method for occluded face completion.

J	Huang, KZ; Ying, YM; Campbell, C				Huang, Kaizhu; Ying, Yiming; Campbell, Colin			Generalized sparse metric learning with relative comparisons	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Generalized framework; Metric learning; Sparse	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; MACHINE	The objective of sparse metric learning is to learn a distance measure from a set of data in addition to finding a low-dimensional representation. Despite demonstrated success, the performance of existing sparse metric learning approaches is usually limited because the methods assumes certain problem relaxations or they target the SML objective indirectly. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Sparse Metric Learning method. This novel framework offers a unified view for understanding many existing sparse metric learning algorithms including the Sparse Metric Learning framework proposed in (Rosales and Fung ACM International conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), pp 367-373, 2006), the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (Weinberger et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems (NIPS), 2006; Weinberger and Saul in Proceedings of the twenty-fifth international conference on machine learning (ICML-2008), 2008), and the D-ranking Vector Machine (D-ranking VM) (Ouyang and Gray in Proceedings of the twenty-fifth international conference on machine learning (ICML-2008), 2008). Moreover, GSML also establishes a close relationship with the Pairwise Support Vector Machine (Vert et al. in BMC Bioinform, 8, 2007). Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of extending many current non-sparse metric learning models to their sparse versions including Relevant Component Analysis (Bar-Hillel et al. in J Mach Learn Res, 6:937-965, 2005) and a state-of-the-art method proposed in (Xing et al. Advances in neural information processing systems (NIPS), 2002). We present the detailed framework, provide theoretical justifications, build various connections with other models, and propose an iterative optimization method, making the framework both theoretically important and practically scalable for medium or large datasets. Experimental results show that this generalized framework outperforms six state-of-the-art methods with higher accuracy and significantly smaller dimensionality for seven publicly available datasets.

J	Koknar-Tezel, S; Latecki, LJ				Koeknar-Tezel, Suzan; Latecki, Longin Jan			Improving SVM classification on imbalanced time series data sets with ghost points	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Imbalanced data sets; Support Vector Machines; Time series	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; RETRIEVAL; SMOTE	Imbalanced data sets present a particular challenge to the data mining community. Often, it is the rare event that is of interest and the cost of misclassifying the rare event is higher than misclassifying the usual event. When the data is highly skewed toward the usual, it can be very difficult for a learning system to accurately detect the rare event. There have been many approaches in recent years for handling imbalanced data sets, from under-sampling the majority class to adding synthetic points to the minority class in feature space. However, distances between time series are known to be non-Euclidean and non-metric, since comparing time series requires warping in time. This fact makes it impossible to apply standard methods like SMOTE to insert synthetic data points in feature spaces. We present an innovative approach that augments the minority class by adding synthetic points in distance spaces. We then use Support Vector Machines for classification. Our experimental results on standard time series show that our synthetic points significantly improve the classification rate of the rare events, and in most cases also improves the overall accuracy of SVMs. We also show how adding our synthetic points can aid in the visualization of time series data sets.

This tendency limits the application of these algorithms to modern high-dimensional problems in data mining, genomics, and imaging. Unfortunately, most existing acceleration techniques are ill-suited to complicated models involving large numbers of parameters. The squared iterative methods (SQUAREM) recently proposed by Varadhan and Roland constitute one notable exception. This paper presents a new quasi-Newton acceleration scheme that requires only modest increments in computation per iteration and overall storage and rivals or surpasses the performance of SQUAREM on several representative test problems.

J	Chen, CY; Chang, KD; Chao, HC				Chen, Chi-Yuan; Chang, Kai-Di; Chao, Han-Chieh			Transaction-Pattern-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm for IP Multimedia Subsystem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Anomaly detection; high-order Markov chain; IP multimedia subsystem (IMS); next-generation networks; support vector machine (SVM)	INTRUSION-DETECTION; SYSTEMS	The Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) plays an important role when migrating to next-generation networks. Based on the all-IP network architecture, at least an IP address is assigned to user equipment for communication. It thus brings not only value-added services, but also security issues such as attacks and threats from traditional IP networks. This paper proposes a novel scheme to detect the anomaly attempts or attacks in an IMS core network. Our proposed scheme adopts the support vector machines (SVMs) technique as our data-mining module. We also utilize the high-order Markov kernel to enhance the detection and prediction rate in sequence calls. Furthermore, the detection algorithm and feature selection for SVM kernel are designed by utilizing IMS transaction patterns. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can efficiently filter out the anomaly attempts in an IMS core network.

Usually, discerning knowledge from vast amounts of data is a challenge. Similarly, discovering business process models from information system event logs is definitely non-trivial. Within the analysis of event logs, process discovery, which can be defined as the automated construction of structured process models from such event logs, is an important learning task. However, the discovery of these processes poses many challenges. First of all, human-centric processes are likely to contain a lot of noise as people deviate from standard procedures. Other challenges are the discovery of so-called non-local, non-free choice constructs, duplicate activities, incomplete event logs and the inclusion of prior knowledge. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of three state-of-the-art process discovery techniques: Genetic Miner, AGNEs and HeuristicsMiner. Although the detailed empirical evaluation is the main contribution of this paper to the literature, an in-depth discussion of a number of different evaluation metrics for process discovery techniques and a thorough discussion of the validity issue are key contributions as well.

Automated knowledge acquisition of that kind has been an essential aspect of artificial intelligence since a long time and has more recently also attracted considerable attention in the fuzzy sets community.

J	Kaneiwa, K				Kaneiwa, Ken			A rough set approach to multiple dataset analysis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Rough set theory; Fuzzy theory; Multiple datasets; Causality	CAUSAL	In the area of data mining, the discovery of valuable changes and connections (e.g., causality) from multiple data sets has been recognized as an important issue. This issue essentially differs from finding statistical associations in a single data set because it is complicated by the different data behaviors and relationships across multiple data sets. Using rough set theory, this paper proposes a change and connection mining algorithm for discovering a time delay between the quantitative changes in the data of two temporal information systems and for generating the association rules of changes from their connected decision table. We establish evaluation criteria for the connectedness of two temporal information systems with varying time delays by calculating weight-based accuracy and coverage of the association rules of changes, adjusted by a fuzzy membership function.

However, for ill-defined domains this knowledge is hard to define explicitly. Our hypothesis is that knowledge discovery (KD) techniques can be used to extract problem-solving task models from the recorded usage of expert, intermediate and novice learners. This paper proposes a procedural-knowledge acquisition framework based on a combination of sequential pattern mining and association rules discovery techniques. The framework has been implemented and is used to discover new meta-knowledge and rules in a given domain which then extend domain knowledge and serve as problem space, allowing the Intelligent Tutoring System to guide learners in problem-solving situations. Preliminary experiments have been conducted using the framework as an alternative to a path-planning problem solver in CanadarmTutor.(C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.

J	Tsai, CF; Hsiao, YC				Tsai, Chih-Fong; Hsiao, Yu-Chieh			Combining multiple feature selection methods for stock prediction: Union, intersection, and multi-intersection approaches	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Stock prediction; Feature selection; Data mining; Principal Component Analysis; Genetic algorithm; Decision trees	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; PRICE PREDICTION; TIME-SERIES; TECHNICAL ANALYSIS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; RETURNS; OPTIMIZATION	To effectively predict stock price for investors is a very important research problem. In literature, data mining techniques have been applied to stock (market) prediction. Feature selection, a pre-processing step of data mining, aims at filtering out unrepresentative variables from a given dataset for effective prediction. As using different feature selection methods will lead to different features selected and thus affect the prediction performance, the purpose of this paper is to combine multiple feature selection methods to identify more representative variables for better prediction. In particular, three well-known feature selection methods, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and decision trees (CART), are used. The combination methods to filter out unrepresentative variables are based on union, intersection, and multi-intersection strategies. For the prediction model, the back-propagation neural network is developed. Experimental results show that the intersection between PCA and GA and the multi-intersection of PCA, GA, and CART perform the best, which are of 79% and 78.98% accuracy respectively. In addition, these two combined feature selection methods filter out near 80% unrepresentative features from 85 original variables, resulting in 14 and 17 important features respectively. These variables are the important factors for stock prediction and can be used for future investment decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A high-throughput metabolic fingerprinting approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed for the detection of wound biomarkers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. High-dimensional data were generated and analysed with chemometric methods. Besides, machine learning classification algorithms constitute promising tools to decipher complex metabolic phenotypes but their application remains however scarcely reported in that research field. The present work proposes a comparative evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes in the context of metabolomic data with respect to their ability to provide a deeper insight into the metabolite network involved in the wound response. Standalone classifiers, i.e. J48 (decision tree), kNN (instance-based learner), SMO (support vector machine), multilayer perceptron and RBF network (neural networks) and Naive Bayes (probabilistic method), or combinations of classification and feature selection algorithms, such as Information Gain, RELIEF-F. Correlation Feature-based Selection and SVM-based methods, are concurrently assessed and cross-validation resampling procedures are used to avoid overfitting. This study demonstrates that machine learning methods represent valuable tools for the analysis of UPLC-TOF/MS metabolomic data. In addition, remarkable performance was achieved, while the models' stability showed the robustness and the interpretability potential. The results allowed drawing attention to both temporal and spatial metabolic patterns in the context of stress signalling and highlighting relevant biomarkers not evidenced with standard data treatment.

J	Domingo-Ferrer, J; Gonzalez-Nicolas, U				Domingo-Ferrer, Josep; Gonzalez-Nicolas, Ursula			Hybrid microdata using microaggregation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Statistical disclosure control; Microdata protection; Privacy-preserving data mining; Synthetic data; Hybrid data; Microaggregation	PRIVACY	Statistical disclosure control (also known as privacy-preserving data mining) of microdata is about releasing data sets containing the answers of individual respondents protected in such a way that: (i) the respondents corresponding to the released records cannot be re-identified; (ii) the released data stay analytically useful. Usually, the protected data set is generated by either masking (i.e. perturbing) the original data or by generating synthetic (i.e. simulated) data preserving some pre-selected statistics of the original data. Masked data may approximately preserve a broad range of distributional characteristics, although very few of them (if any) are exactly preserved; on the other hand, synthetic data exactly preserve the pre-selected statistics and may seem less disclosive than masked data, but they do not preserve at all any statistics other than those pre-selected. Hybrid data obtained by mixing the original data and synthetic data have been proposed in the literature to combine the strengths of masked and synthetic data. We show how to easily obtain hybrid data by combining microaggregation with any synthetic data generator. We show that numerical hybrid data exactly preserving means and covariances of original data and approximately preserving other statistics as well as some subdomain analyses can be obtained as a particular case with a very simple parameterization. The new method is competitive versus both the literature on hybrid data and plain multivariate microaggregation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Maroosi, A; Amiri, B				Maroosi, Ali; Amiri, Babak			A new clustering algorithm based on hybrid global optimization based on a dynamical systems approach algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Clustering; K-means; Dynamical systems; Tabu search	K-MEANS	Many methods for local optimization are based on the notion of a direction of a local descent at a given point. A local improvement of a point in hand can be made using this direction. As a rule, modern methods for global optimization do not use directions of global descent for global improvement of the point in hand. From this point of view, global optimization algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach (GOP) is an unusual method. Its structure is similar to that used in local optimization: a new iteration can be obtained as an improvement of the previous one along a certain direction. In contrast with local methods, is a direction of a global descent and for more diversification combined with Tabu search. This algorithm is called hybrid GOP (HGOP). Cluster analysis is one of the attractive data mining techniques that are used in many fields. One popular class of data clustering algorithms is the center based clustering algorithm. K-means is used as a popular clustering method due to its simplicity and high speed in clustering large datasets. However, K-means has two shortcomings: dependency on the initial state and convergence to local optima and global solutions of large problems cannot found with reasonable amount of computation effort. In order to overcome local optima problem lots of studies have been done in clustering. In this paper, we proposed application of hybrid global optimization algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach. We compared HGOP with other algorithms in clustering, such as GAK, SA, TS, and ACO, by implementing them on several simulation and real datasets.

J	Park, NH; Oh, SH; Lee, WS				Park, Nam Hun; Oh, Sang Hyun; Lee, Won Suk			Anomaly intrusion detection by clustering transactional audit streams in a host computer	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Anomaly detection; Intrusion detection; Clustering data streams		In anomaly intrusion detection, modeling the normal behavior of activities performed by a user is an important issue. To extract normal behavior from the activities of a user, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches model only the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing a user's continuous activities as an audit data stream. This paper proposes an anomaly intrusion detection method that continuously models the normal behavior of a user over the audit data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed thus far in an audit data stream are identified by a statistical grid-based clustering algorithm for a data stream. Each cluster represents the frequency range of the activities with respect to the feature. As a result, without the physical maintenance of any historical activity of the user, the user's new activities can be continuously reflected in the ongoing results. At the same time, various statistics of activities related to the identified clusters are also modeled to improve the performance of anomaly detection. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by a series of experiments to identify various characteristics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Power quality time series data mining using S-transform and fuzzy expert system	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Power quality; Time-series data; Fuzzy expert system; S-transform; Particle swarm optimization	NEURAL-NETWORK; DISTURBANCE RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a new approach for power quality time series data mining using S-transform based fuzzy expert system (FES). Initially the power signal time series disturbance data are pre-processed through an advanced signal processing tool such as S-transform and various statistical features are extracted, which are used as inputs to the fuzzy expert system for power quality event detection. The proposed expert system uses a data mining approach for assigning a certainty factor for each classification rule, thereby providing robustness to the rule in the presence of noise. Further to provide a very high degree of accuracy in pattern classification, both the Gaussian and trapezoidal membership functions of the concerned fuzzy sets are optimized using a fuzzy logic based adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed hybrid PSO-fuzzy expert system (PSOFES) provides accurate classification rates even under noisy conditions compared to the existing techniques, which show the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm for power quality time series data mining.

J	Chen, SM; Bai, SM				Chen, Shyi-Ming; Bai, Shih-Ming			Using data mining techniques to automatically construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Adaptive learning systems; Apriori algorithm; Concept maps; Concepts-relationship analysis; Data mining	FUZZY RULES; DIAGNOSIS	It is obvious that to construct concept maps for providing the learning guidance to learners is an important research topic of adaptive learning systems. Because the existing method to construct concept maps only considers the association rules that questions are not correctly answered, it will miss some information about questions that are correctly answered by the learners. Moreover, the existing method also has the drawback that it will build unnecessary relationships or lose some relationships between concepts in the constructed concept maps. In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps based on data mining techniques for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing method. It provides us a useful way to automatically construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, there are many approaches to extract association rules from information systems or large databases, in which, confidence degrees are widely used to evaluate association rules. Based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, we propose a new approach to extract association rules. The approach consists of the intuitionistic fuzzy set representations of association rules, new confidence degrees of association rules and a discrete bi-level parametric programming. The intuitionistic fuzzy set representations of association rules are based on three kinds of knowledge bases: pattern knowledge, antecedent knowledge and succedent knowledge. Base on the three knowledge bases, we can obtain type-1, type-2 and type-3 A-IFS representations of association rules. Based on similarity measure between two A-IFSs and OWA operator, a new confidence degree is proposed to evaluate every association rule. Numerical examples show that OUT confidence degrees provide more information about. association rules than the existed confidence degrees. To generate association rules from an information system automatically, a discrete bi-level parametric programming is discussed in this paper. By using the discrete bi-level parametric programming, generating association rules become easier, an numerical example shows that our method is useful.

The accuracy in setting up this threshold directly influences the number and the quality of association rules discovered. Often, the number of association rules, even though large in number, misses some interesting rules and the rules' quality necessitates further analysis. As a result, decision making using these rules could lead to risky actions. We propose a framework to discover domain knowledge report as coherent rules. Coherent rules are discovered based on the properties of propositional logic, and therefore, requires no background knowledge to generate them. From the coherent rules discovered, association rules can be derived objectively and directly without knowing the level of minimum support threshold required. We provide analysis of the rules compare to those discovered via the a priori.

J	Tsai, CF; Chen, MY				Tsai, Chih-Fong; Chen, Mao-Yuan			Variable selection by association rules for customer churn prediction of multimedia on demand	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customer churn prediction; Multimedia on demand; Data mining; Association rules; Neural networks; Decision trees	PARTIAL DEFECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS; BUSINESS; SERVICES	Multimedia on demand (MOD) is an interactive system that provides a number of value-added services in addition to traditional TV services, such as video on demand and interactive online learning. This opens a new marketing and managerial problem for the telecommunication industry to retain valuable MOD customers. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to develop customer churn prediction models, such as neural networks and decision trees in the domain of mobile telecommunication. However much, related work focuses on developing the prediction models per se. Few studies consider the pre-processing step during data mining whose aim is to filter out unrepresentative data or information. This paper presents the important processes of developing MOD customer churn prediction models by data mining techniques. They contain the pre-processing stage for selecting important variables by association rules, which have not been applied before, the model construction stage by neural networks (NN) and decision trees (DT), which are widely adapted in the literature, and four evaluation measures including prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, all of which have not been considered to examine the model performance. The source data are based on one telecommunication company providing the MOD services in Taiwan, and the experimental results show that using association rules allows the DT and NN models to provide better prediction performances over a chosen validation dataset. In particular, the DT model performs better than the NN model. Moreover, some useful and important rules in the DT model, which show the factors affecting a high proportion of customer churn, are also discussed for the marketing and managerial purpose.

J	Chen, YL; Cheng, LC				Chen, Yen-Liang; Cheng, Li-Chen			An approach to group ranking decisions in a dynamic environment	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Group decision making; Group ranking; Maximum consensus sequence	PARTIAL ORDINAL RANKINGS; PREFERENCE STRUCTURES; AGGREGATION; PROPOSALS; DISTANCES; REVIEWERS	The group ranking problem is used to construct coherent aggregate results from preference data provided by decision makers. Although there have been different input formats used to represent user preferences, they share a common weakness, that the input mode is static. In other words, users must provide all the preference data at one time. To overcome this weakness, we propose a framework which allows users to provide partial and/or incomplete preference data at multiple times. Since this is a complicated issue, we specifically focus on a particular aspect as a first attempt at this framework. Accordingly, we reexamine a variant of the group ranking problem, the maximum consensus mining problem, which will give the longest ranking lists of alternatives that agree with the majority and disagree only with the minority, under the dynamic input mode assumption. An algorithm is developed to determine the maximum consensus sequences from the users' partial ranking data. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out using synthetic data sets. The results indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and can effectively identify consensus among all users. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, Average Normalized Mutual Information (ANMI) has been used to define categorical data clustering as an optimization problem. To find globally optimal or near-optimal partition determined by ANMI, a genetic clustering algorithm (G-ANMI) is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that G-ANMI is superior or comparable to existing algorithms for clustering categorical data in terms of clustering accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How to learn a hidden consensus pattern in the low dimensional space is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new method for multiple view semi-supervised dimensionality reduction. The pairwise constraints are used to derive embedding in each view and simultaneously, the linear transformation is introduced to make different embeddings from different pattern spaces comparable. Hence, the consensus pattern can be learned from multiple embeddings of multiple representations. We derive an iterating algorithm to solve the above problem. Some theoretical analyses and out-of-sample extensions are also provided. Promising experiments on various data sets, together with some important discussions, are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Koufakou, A; Georgiopoulos, M				Koufakou, Anna; Georgiopoulos, Michael			A fast outlier detection strategy for distributed high-dimensional data sets with mixed attributes	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Outlier detection; Anomaly detection; Data mining; Distributed data sets; Mixed attribute data sets; High-dimensional data sets	LOCAL OUTLIERS	Outlier detection has attracted substantial attention in many applications and research areas; some of the most prominent applications are network intrusion detection or credit card fraud detection. Many of the existing approaches are based on calculating distances among the points in the dataset. These approaches cannot easily adapt to current datasets that usually contain a mix of categorical and continuous attributes, and may be distributed among different geographical locations. In addition, current datasets usually have a large number of dimensions. These datasets tend to be sparse, and traditional concepts such as Euclidean distance or nearest neighbor become unsuitable. We propose a fast distributed outlier detection strategy intended for datasets containing mixed attributes. The proposed method takes into consideration the sparseness of the dataset, and is experimentally shown to be highly scalable with the number of points and the number of attributes in the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed outlier detection method compares very favorably with other state-of-the art outlier detection strategies proposed in the literature and that the speedup achieved by its distributed version is very close to linear.

Our proposed method consists of two phases, namely, training and detection. In the training phase we first apply, Sobel's edge detection operator, morphological operator, and thresholding to each training image, and transform it into an edge image. Next, we use the MAFIA algorithm to mine the maximal frequent patterns from those edge images and obtain the positive feature pattern. Similarly, we can obtain the negative feature pattern from the complements of edge images. Based on the feature patterns mined, we construct a face detector to prune non-face candidates. In the detection phase, we apply a sliding window to the testing image in different scales. For each sliding window, if the slide window passes the face detector, it is considered as a human face. The proposed method can automatically find the feature patterns that capture most of facial features. By using the feature patterns to construct a face detector, the proposed method is robust to races, illumination, and facial expressions. The experimental results show that the Proposed method has outstanding performance in the MIT-CMU dataset and comparable performance in the BioID dataset in terms of false positive and detection rate.

J	Shi, JN; Yin, WT; Osher, S; Sajda, P				Shi, Jianing; Yin, Wotao; Osher, Stanley; Sajda, Paul			A Fast Hybrid Algorithm for Large-Scale l(1)-Regularized Logistic Regression	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						logistic regression; l(1) regularization; fixed point continuation; supervised learning; large scale	UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES; SIGNAL RECOVERY; ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; MODEL SELECTION; LASSO; RECONSTRUCTION; SHRINKAGE	l(1)-regularized logistic regression, also known as sparse logistic regression, is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, data mining, bioinformatics and neural signal processing. The use of l(1) regularization attributes attractive properties to the classifier, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classifier generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable l(1)-norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a fixed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The first phase is based completely on memory efficient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton's method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can significantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efficient without loss of accuracy.

Measuring every wafer's quality after each process can save resources. but it is unrealistic and impractical because additional measuring processes put in between each pair of contiguous processes significantly increase the total production time. Metrology, as is employed for product quality monitoring tool today, covers only a small fraction of sampled wafers. Virtual metrology (VM), on the other hand, enables to predict every wafer's metrology measurements based on production equipment data and preceding metrology results. A well established VM system, therefore, can help improve product quality and reduce production cost and cycle time. In this paper, we develop a VM system for an etching process in semiconductor manufacturing based on various data mining techniques. The experimental results show that our VM system can not only predict the metrology measurement accurately, but also detect possible faulty wafers with a reasonable confidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ozyer, T; Alhajj, R				Ozyer, Tansel; Alhajj, Reda			Parallel clustering of high dimensional data by integrating multi-objective genetic algorithm with divide and conquer	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Clustering; Data mining; Multi-objective optimization; Validity analysis; Divide and conquer; Parallelism; Incremental clustering		This paper applies divide and conquer approach in an iterative way to handle the clustering process. The target is a parallelized effective and efficient approach that produces the intended clustering result. We achieve scalability by first partitioning a large dataset into subsets of manageable sizes based on the specifications of the machine to be used in the clustering process; then cluster the partitions separately in parallel. The centroid of each obtained cluster is treated like the root of a tree with instances in its cluster as leaves. The partitioning and clustering process is iteratively applied on the centroids with the trees growing up until we get the final clustering; the outcome is a forest with one tree per cluster. Finally, a conquer process is performed to get the actual intended clustering, where each instance (leaf node) belongs to the final cluster represented by the root of its tree. We use multi-objective genetic algorithm combined with validity indices to decide on the number of classes. This approach fits well for interactive online clustering. It facilitates for incremental clustering because chunks of instances are clustered as stand alone sets, and then the results are merged with existing clusters. This is attractive and feasible because we consider the clustering of only centroids after the first clustering stage. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

With this technique, frequently occurring temporal patterns or anomalies can be discovered, for instance. The motif detection is based on a fusion of methods from two worlds: probabilistic modeling and similarity measurement techniques are combined with extremely fast polynomial least-squares approximation techniques. A time series is segmented with a data stream segmentation method, the segments are modeled by means of normal distributions with time-dependent means and constant variances, and these models are compared using a divergence measure for probability densities. Then, using suitable clustering algorithms based on these similarity measures, motifs may be defined. The fast time series segmentation and modeling techniques then allow for an on-line detection of previously defined motifs in new time series with very low run-times. SwiftMotif is suitable for real-time applications, accounts for the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of certain motifs, e.g., due to noise, and considers local variability (i.e., uniform scaling) in the time domain. This article focuses on the mathematical foundations and the demonstration of properties of SwiftMotif-in particular accuracy and run-time-using some artificial and real benchmark time series.

It is assumed that the database consists of sequences of events, where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine temporal arrangements of event intervals that appear frequently in the database. The motivation of this work is the observation that in practice most events are not instantaneous but occur over a period of time and different events may occur concurrently. Thus, there are many practical applications that require mining such temporal correlations between intervals including the linguistic analysis of annotated data from American Sign Language as well as network and biological data. Three efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals are described; the first two are tree-based and use breadth and depth first search to mine the set of frequent arrangements, whereas the third one is prefix-based. The above methods apply efficient pruning techniques that include a set of constraints that add user-controlled focus into the mining process. Moreover, based on the extracted patterns a standard method for mining association rules is employed that applies different interestingness measures to evaluate the significance of the discovered patterns and rules. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with other approaches on real (American Sign Language annotations and network data) and large synthetic datasets.

J	Seiffert, C; Khoshgoftaar, TM; Van Hulse, J				Seiffert, Chris; Khoshgoftaar, Taghi M.; Van Hulse, Jason			Improving Software-Quality Predictions With Data Sampling and Boosting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Binary classification; boosting; classification; class imbalance; sampling; software quality	LEARN DEFECT PREDICTORS; STATIC CODE ATTRIBUTES; PROGRAM MODULES; IMBALANCED DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SMOTE; COST	Software-quality data sets tend to fall victim to the class-imbalance problem that plagues so many other application domains. The majority of faults in a software system, particularly high-assurance systems, usually lie in a very small percentage of the software modules. This imbalance between the number of fault-prone (fp) and non-fp (nfp) modules can have a severely negative impact on a data-mining technique's ability to differentiate between the two. This paper addresses the class-imbalance problem as it pertains to the domain of software-quality prediction. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining two different methodologies, data sampling and boosting, for improving the performance of decision-tree models designed to identify fp software modules. This paper applies five data-sampling techniques and boosting to 15 software-quality data sets of different sizes and levels of imbalance. Nearly 50 000 models were built for the experiments contained in this paper. Our results show that while data-sampling techniques are very effective in improving the performance of such models, boosting almost always outperforms even the best data-sampling techniques. This significant result, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported, has important consequences for practitioners developing software-quality classification models.

The design of an effective diagnosis model is therefore an important issue in liver disease treatment. This study accordingly employs classification and regression tree (CART) and case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques to structure an intelligent diagnosis model aiming to provide a comprehensive analytic framework to raise the accuracy of liver disease diagnosis. Methods: Based on the advice and assistance of doctors and medical specialists of liver conditions, 510 outpatient visitors using ICD-9 (international Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision) codes at a medical center in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 were selected as the cases in the data set for liver disease diagnosis. Data on 340 patients was utilized for the development of the model and on 170 patients utilized to perform comparative analysis of the models. This paper accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the diagnosis of liver diseases which integrates CART and CBR. The major steps in applying the model include: (1) adopting CART to diagnose whether a patient suffers from liver disease; (2) for patients diagnosed with liver disease in the first step, employing CBR to diagnose the types of liver diseases. Results: In the first phase, CART is used to extract rules from health examination data to show whether the patient suffers from liver disease. The results indicate that the CART rate of accuracy is 92.94%. In the second phase, CBR is developed to diagnose the type of liver disease, and the new case triggers the CBR system to retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to support the treatment of liver disease. The new case is supported by a similarity ratio, and the CBR diagnostic accuracy rate is 90.00%. Actual implementation shows that the intelligent diagnosis model is capable of integrating CART and CBR techniques to examine liver diseases with considerable accuracy. The model can be used as a supporting system in making decisions regarding liver disease diagnosis and treatment. The rules extracted from CART are helpful to physicians in diagnosing liver diseases. CBR can retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to solve a new liver disease problem and can be of great assistance to physicians in identifying the type of liver disease, reducing diagnostic errors and improving the quality and effectiveness of medical treatment.

They can use such information in prioritizing software testing and allocating resources accordingly. However, our experience shows that it is difficult to collect and analyze fine-grained test defects in a large and complex software system. On the other hand, previous research has shown that companies can safely use cross-company data with nearest neighbor sampling to predict their defects in case they are unable to collect local data, In this Study we analyzed 25 projects of a large telecommunication system. To predict defect proneness of modules we trained models on publicly available Nasa MDP data. In Our experiments we used static call graph based ranking (CGBR) as well as nearest neighbor sampling for constructing method level defect predictors. Our results suggest that, for the analyzed projects. at least 70% of the defects can be detected by inspecting only (i) 6% of the code using a Naive Bayes model, (ii) 3% of the code using CGBR framework.

Data mining based intelligent analysis of threatening e-mail	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Threatening e-mail detection		This paper proposed a decision tree based classification method to detect e-mails that contain terrorism information. The proposed classification method is an incremental and user-feedback based extension of a decision tree induction algorithm named Ad Infinitum. We show that Ad Infinitum algorithm is a good choice for threatening e-mail detection as it runs fast on large and high dimensional databases, is easy to tune and is highly accurate, outperforming popular algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes. In particular, we are interested in detecting fraudulent and possibly criminal activities from such e-mails. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, ZW; Shi, Y; Gao, GX				Zhang, Zhiwang; Shi, Yong; Gao, Guangxia			A rough set-based multiple criteria linear programming approach for the medical diagnosis and prognosis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Rough set; Multiple criteria linear programming; Classification	FEATURE-SELECTION	It is well known that data mining is a process of discovering unknown, hidden information from a large amount of data, extracting valuable information, and using the information to make important business decisions. And data mining has been developed into a new information technology, including regression, decision tree, neural network, fuzzy set, rough set, and support vector machine. This paper puts forward a rough set-based multiple criteria linear programming (RS-MCLP) approach for solving classification problems in data mining. Firstly, we describe the basic theory and models of rough set and multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and analyse their characteristics and advantages in practical applications. Secondly, detailed analysis about their deficiencies are provided, respectively. However, because of the existing mutual complementarities between them, we put forward and build the RS-MCLP methods and models which sufficiently integrate their virtues and overcome the adverse factors simultaneously. In addition. we also develop and implement these algorithm and models in SAS and Windows system platforms. Finally, many experiments show that the RS-MCLP approach is prior to single MCLP model and other traditional classification methods in data mining, and remarkably improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis and prognosis simultaneously.

J	Pei, T; Jasra, A; Hand, DJ; Zhu, AX; Zhou, CH				Pei, Tao; Jasra, Ajay; Hand, David J.; Zhu, A-Xing; Zhou, Chenghu			DECODE: a new method for discovering clusters of different densities in spatial data	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Data mining; MCMC; Point process; Reversible jump; Nearest neighbor; Earthquake	CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; POINT-PROCESSES; NEIGHBOR; FEATURES; EARTHQUAKES; FORESHOCK; ALGORITHM; SEQUENCE	When clusters with different densities and noise lie in a spatial point set, the major obstacle to classifying these data is the determination of the thresholds for classification, which may form a series of bins for allocating each point to different clusters. Much of the previous work has adopted a model-based approach, but is either incapable of estimating the thresholds in an automatic way, or limited to only two point processes, i.e. noise and clusters with the same density. In this paper, we present a new density-based cluster method (DECODE), in which a spatial data set is presumed to consist of different point processes and clusters with different densities belong to different point processes. DECODE is based upon a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy and divided into three steps. The first step is to map each point in the data to its mth nearest distance, which is referred to as the distance between a point and its mth nearest neighbor. In the second step, classification thresholds are determined via a reversible jump MCMC strategy. In the third step, clusters are formed by spatially connecting the points whose mth nearest distances fall into a particular bin defined by the thresholds. Four experiments, including two simulated data sets and two seismic data sets, are used to evaluate the algorithm. Results on simulated data show that our approach is capable of discovering the clusters automatically. Results on seismic data suggest that the clustered earthquakes, identified by DECODE, either imply the epicenters of forthcoming strong earthquakes or indicate the areas with the most intensive seismicity, this is consistent with the tectonic states and estimated stress distribution in the associated areas. The comparison between DECODE and other state-of-the-art methods, such as DBSCAN, OPTICS and Wavelet Cluster, illustrates the contribution of our approach: although DECODE can be computationally expensive, it is capable of identifying the number of point processes and simultaneously estimating the classification thresholds with little prior knowledge.

J	Wang, XZ; Smith-Miles, K; Hyndman, R				Wang, Xiaozhe; Smith-Miles, Kate; Hyndman, Rob			Rule induction for forecasting method selection: Meta-learning the characteristics of univariate time series	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Meta-learning; Rule induction; Univariate time series; Data characteristics; Clustering	MODELS; VALIDATION; STATE	For univariate forecasting, there are various statistical models and computational algorithms available. In real-world exercises, too many choices can create difficulties in selecting the most appropriate technique, especially for users lacking sufficient knowledge of forecasting. This study focuses on rule induction for forecasting method selection by understanding the nature of historical forecasting data. A novel approach for selecting a forecasting method for univariate time series based on measurable data characteristics is presented that combines elements of data mining, meta-learning, clustering, classification and statistical measurement. We conducted a large-scale empirical study of over 300 time series using four of the most popular forecasting methods. To provide a rich portrait of the global characteristics of univariate time series, we extracted measures from a comprehensive set of features such as trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, nonlinearity, self-similarity, and chaos. Both supervised and unsupervised learning methods are used to learn the relationship between the characteristics of the time series and the forecasting method suitability, providing both recommendation rules, as well as visualizations in the feature space. A derived weighting schema based on the rule induction is also used to improve forecasting accuracy based on combined forecasting models. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, CF				Hong, Chao-Fu			Qualitative Chance Discovery - Extracting competitive advantages	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Chance Discovery; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative analysis; Grounded theory; Text mining	DECISION-MAKING; OPTIMIZATION; KEYGRAPH; MAPS	There are two directions in data mining research, qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Chance Discovery is a useful qualitative analysis method to visualize the data structure and to discover the potential future scenario. But in reality, due to tremendous amount of information, data structure may be too complex for the user to comprehend. In this paper, using Chance Discovery as a basic driving force, we proposed an innovative interactive human-computing process model to extract the data structure of a specific topic that the user is most interested in. Our model combined the strength of both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis where Grounded theory and text mining technology were applied to sift out meaningful but small data. Experiment results showed that the visualized results generated by our model were more accurate than those obtained by Chance Discovery method. Furthermore, users can evaluate the relevant data structure generated by our model to decide on potential chances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The method, which is referred to as SSRANK, aims to use the advantages of both the traditional Information Retrieval (IR) methods and the supervised learning methods for IR proposed recently, The advantages include the use of limited amount of labeled data and rich model representation. To do so, the method adopts a semi-supervised learning framework in ranking model construction. Specifically, given a small number of labeled documents with respect to some queries, the method effectively labels the unlabeled documents for the queries. It then uses all the labeled data to train a machine learning model (in our case, Neural Network). In the data labeling, the method also makes use of a traditional IR model (in our case, BM25). A stopping criterion based on machine learning theory is given for the data labeling process. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets and one web search dataset indicate that SSRANK consistently and almost always significantly outperforms the baseline methods (unsupervised and supervised learning methods), given the same amount of labeled data. This is because SSRANK can effectively leverage the use of unlabeled data in learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Particularly, seasonal patterns are not clear in tropical areas. therefore, requiring environmental classification. The knowledge of long-term biogenic element dynamics, the biological response, and the selection of indicators connecting lower and higher trophic levels have became a real need for the sustainable management of marine resources. Under this scenario, this paper uses a machine-learning approach to determine the ecological status of coastal waters based on patterns of occurrence of meroplankton larvae of epibenthic fauna and its relationship with other environmental variables. The case studied is the upwelling influenced bay at Cabo Frio Island (Rio de Janeiro - Brazil) because this location has been suffering with anthropogenic impact. Models of crisp and fuzzy rules have been tested as classifiers. Results show it is possible to access hidden patterns of water masses within a set of association rules. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Active learning for object classification: from exploration to exploitation	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Active learning; Data mining; Subtractive clustering; Exploration; Exploitation; Prototype classification		Classifying large datasets without any a-priori information poses a problem in numerous tasks. Especially in industrial environments, we often encounter diverse measurement devices and sensors that produce huge amounts of data, but we still rely on a human expert to help give the data a meaningful interpretation. As the amount of data that must be manually classified plays a critical role, we need to reduce the number of learning episodes involving human interactions as much as possible. In addition for real world applications it is fundamental to converge in a stable manner to a solution that is close to the optimal solution. We present a new self-controlled exploration/exploitation strategy to select data points to be labeled by a domain expert where the potential of each data point is computed based on a combination of its representativeness and the uncertainty of the classifier. A new Prototype Based Active Learning (PBAC) algorithm for classification is introduced. We compare the results to other active learning approaches on several benchmark datasets.

J	Hsu, CH				Hsu, Chih-Hung			Data mining to improve industrial standards and enhance production and marketing: An empirical study in apparel industry	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Cluster analysis; Industrial standards; Production management and marketing; Apparel industry		Apparel production is a high value-added industry in the global textile manufacturing chain. Standard size charts are crucial industrial standards for high-tech apparel industries to maintain competitive advantages in knowledge economy era. However, these industries suffering from production management and marketing often find it hard to obtain the accurate standard size charts. In addition to conventional experience approaches, there is an urgent need to develop effective mechanism to find the industrial standards that are the most suitable to their own industries. This study aims to fill the gap by developing a data mining framework based on two-stage cluster approach to generate useful patterns and rules for standard size charts. The results can provide high-tech apparel industries with industrial standards. An empirical study was conducted in an apparel industry to support their manufacturing decision for production management and marketing with various customers' needs. The results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. Moreover, since the anthropometric database must be repeatedly updated, standard size charts may also be continuously renewed via application of the proposed data mining framework.

These electronic functionalities converged devices with powerful contents and functions, such as the World Wide Web, videoconferencing, e-mail, internet telephony, online gaming, digital television, and net banking, are easier to use than traditional computers but not less capable of performing daily tasks. These information technology revolutions along with rapid growing of network technology not only increased the amount of internet applications and digital contents, but also led to diversified consumer behaviors, increased competition, and opportunities. On the other hand, one-to-one marketing is different from traditional marketing methods because it focuses on customer satisfaction and is customer-oriented rather than focusing on marketing mass consumers; thus a one-to-one marketer tries to find more different products and services for the same customer. Therefore, how to establish potential cross-selling and one-to-one offers through product mix analysis, enhance relationship with customers by means of personalized offers through product knowledge, and understand users' needs and making useful suggestions for new product developments and one-to-one marketing become critical issues to information appliance firms. This paper proposes association rules, clustering analysis and CART as methodologies of data-mining, which is implemented for mining product and marketing knowledge from information users. Knowledge extraction from information users is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, clusters, and trees in order to propose suggestions on one-to-one marketing for information appliance firms.

J	Sharma, MJ; Yu, SJ				Sharma, Mithun J.; Yu, Song Jin			Performance based stratification and clustering for benchmarking of container terminals	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Self-organizing map; Container terminals	EFFICIENCY	Benchmarking of container terminals is an important issue facing port management. Data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a multi-factor productivity measurement tool is generally used in assessing the relative efficiency of homogenous units and setting benchmark for inefficient units. Evaluation of container terminals by DEA produces limited set of efficient units which are reference to inefficient units irrespective of their differences in efficiency scores. DEA projects the lowest efficient units to highest efficient units but in reality, the reference set may be very different in size, environment and operating practices. Every container terminal is characterized by some physical values that represent relevant properties of the terminal. DEA, if employed alone, to measure the efficiency and set benchmark for inefficient terminals to improve efficiency may give biased result because all container terminals vary in their capacity. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, data mining and DEA are fused to provide a diagnostic tool to effectively measure the efficiency of inefficient terminals and prescribe a step-wise projection to reach the frontier in accordance with their maximum capacity and similar input properties which otherwise is not possible with DEA alone.

J	Wu, JJ; Chen, J; Xiong, H; Xie, M				Wu, Junjie; Chen, Jian; Xiong, Hui; Xie, Ming			External validation measures for K-means clustering: A data distribution perspective	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cluster validation; K-means; External criteria; Normalization		Cluster validation is an important part of any cluster analysis. External measures such as entropy, purity and mutual information are often used to evaluate K-means clustering. However, whether these measures are indeed suitable for K-means clustering remains unknown. Along this line, in this paper, we show that a data distribution view is of great use to selecting the right measures for K-means clustering. Specifically, we first introduce the data distribution view of K-means, and the resultant uniform effect on highly imbalanced data sets. Eight external measures widely used in recent data mining tasks are also collected as candidates for K-means evaluation. Then, we demonstrate that only three measures, namely the variation of information (VI), the van Dongen criterion (VD) and the Mirkin metric (M), can detect the negative uniform effect of K-means in the clustering results. We also provide new normalization schemes for these three measures, i.e., VI'(norm), VD'(norm) and M'(norm), which enables the cross-data comparisons of clustering qualities. Finally, we explore some properties such as the consistency and sensitivity of the three measures, and give some advice on how to use them in K-means practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in such systems little thought is given to the way in which membership functions are combined within fuzzy rules. In this paper, a robust method, improved fuzzy classifier functions (IFCF) design is proposed for two-class pattern recognition problems. A supervised hybrid improved fuzzy Clustering for classification (IFC-C) algorithm is implemented for structure identification. IFC-C algorithm is based oil it dual optimization method, which yields simultaneous estimates of the parameters of (c-classification functions together with fuzzy c partitioning of dataset based oil a distance measure. The merit of novel IFCF is that the information oil natural grouping of data samples i.e., the membership values, are utilized as additional predictors of each fuzzy classifier function to improve accuracy of system model. Improved fuzzy classifier functions are approximated using statistical and soft computing approaches. A new semi-non-parametric inference mechanism is implemented for reasoning. The experimental results Of the new modeling approach indicate that the new IFCF is it promising method for two-class pattern recognition problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unlike traditional computer-based learning programs, WBLPs are used by a population of learners who have diverse background. How different learners access the WBLPs has been investigated by several studies, which indicate that cognitive style is an important factor that influences learners' preferences. However, these studies mainly use statistical methods to analyze learners' preferences. In this paper, we propose to analyze learners' preferences with a data mining technique. Findings in our study show that Field Independent learners frequently use backward/forward buttons and spent less time for navigation. On the other hand, Field Dependent learners often use main menu and have more repeated visiting. Implications for these findings are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigate an important aspect of predicting the folded 3D structure of proteins from their unfolded residue sequence using evolutionary based machine learning techniques. Our approach is to predict specific features of residues in folded protein chains, in particular features derived from the Delaunay tessellations, Gabriel graphs and relative neighborhood graphs as well as minimum spanning trees. Several standard machine learning algorithms were compared to a state-of-the-art learning method, a learning classifier system (LCS), that is capable of generating compact and interpretable rule sets. Predictions were performed for various degrees of precision using a range of experimental parameters. Examples of the rules obtained are presented. The LCS produces results with good predictive performance and generates competent yet simple and interpretable classification rules.

Existing techniques perform welt oil structured processes, but still have problems discovering and visualizing less structured ones. Unfortunately, process mining is most interesting in domains requiring flexibility. A typical example would be the treatment process in a hospital where it is vital that people call deviate to deal with changing circumstances. Here it is useful to provide insights into the actual processes but at the same time there is a lot of diversity leading to complex models that are difficult to interpret. This paper presents an approach using trace clustering, i.e., the event log is split into homogeneous subsets and for each subset a process model is created. We, demonstrate that our approach, based oil log profiles, can improve process mining results in real flexible environments. To illustrate this we present a real-life case study.

We argue that due to the increasing data collection ability but limited resources for labeling, stream data collected at hand may only have a small number of labeled examples, whereas a large portion of data remain unlabeled but can be beneficial for learning. Unleashing the full potential of the unlabeled instances for stream data mining is, however, a significant challenge, consider that even fully labeled data streams may suffer from the concept drifting, and inappropriate uses of the unlabeled samples may only make the problem even worse. To build prediction models, we first categorize the stream data into four different categories, each of which corresponds to the situation where concept drifting may or may not exist in the labeled and unlabeled data. After that, we propose a relational k-means based transfer semi-supervised SVM learning framework (RK-TS(3)VM), which intends to leverage labeled and unlabeled samples to build prediction models. Experimental results and comparisons on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to help build prediction models more accurate than other simple approaches can offer	[Zhang, Peng; Guo, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China	Zhang, P (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.	zhangpeng@ict.ac.cn; xqzhu@it.uts.edu.au; guoli@ict.ac.cn					AGGARWAL C, P VLDB 2003; Chapelle O, 2008, J MACH LEARN RES, V9, P203; Collobert R, 2006, J MACH LEARN RES, V7, P1687; DOMINGOS, 2000, P KDD 00 NEW YORK NY, P71; EVGENIOU T, P ACM KDD 2004, P109; FAN W, P ACM KDD 2004, P128; GAO J, P IEEE ICDM; HULTEN G, P ACM KDD 2001; LAXMAN S, P ACM KDD 2007, P410; MOHAMMAD M, P IEEE ICDM 2008; SCHOLKOPF B, P ICANN 1997; WANG H, P ACM KDD 2003; YUILLE A, 2002, ADV NIPS; ZHANG P, P ACM KDD 2008; ZHU, 2005, 1530 U WISC DEP COMP; ZHU X, P IEEE ICDM 2007; Zhu X., 2009, STREAM DATA MINING R; ZHU X, P IJCAI 2007	18	8	8	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1550-4786	978-1-4244-5242-2	IEEE DATA MINING			2009							627	636		10.1109/ICDM.2009.76		10	Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BTL37	WOS:000287216600065	
J	Yun, U				Yun, Unil			An efficient mining of weighted frequent patterns with length decreasing support constraints	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Length decreasing support constraint; Weighted frequent pattern mining; Weighted Smallest Valid Extension property		Frequent pattern mining has been extensively studied in the data mining field due to its broad applications in mining association rules, correlations, closed frequent patterns, graph patterns, constraint-based frequent patterns, sequential patterns, and many other data mining tasks. Two concerns exist for frequent pattern mining in the real world. First, each item has different importance so researchers have proposed weighted frequent pattern mining algorithms that reflect the importance of items. Second, previous mining algorithms use a constant support constraint irrespective of the length of discovered patterns. However, short patterns having only a fewer items tend to be interesting if they have high support, while long patterns can still be interesting although their supports are relatively low. Weight and length decreasing Support constraints are important constraints, but no mining algorithms consider both constraints. In this paper, we propose weighted frequent pattern mining with length decreasing support constraints. Our main approach is to Push weight constraints and length decreasing support constraints into the pattern growth algorithm. For pruning techniques, we propose the notion of the Weighted Smallest Valid Extension (WSVE) property with/without Minimum Weight (MinW). The WSVE property with/without MinW is applied to transaction pruning, node pruning and path pruning to eliminate weighted infrequent patterns earlier. Our approach generates more concise but important weighted frequent patterns with length decreasing support constraints by applying the WSVE property with/without MinW. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhu, XD; Huang, ZQ				Zhu, Xiao-Dong; Huang, Zhi-Qiu			Conceptual modeling rules extracting for data streams	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Granular computing; Data streams mining; Conceptual modeling; Rules extraction; Knowledge discovery		Data take the form of continuous data streams rather than traditional stored databases in a growing number of applications, including network traffic monitoring, network intrusion detection, sensor networks, fraudulent transaction detection, financial monitoring, etc. People are interested in the potential rules in data streams Such as association rules and decision rules. Compared with much work on developing algorithms of data streams mining, there is little attention paid on the modeling data mining and data streams mining. Considering the problem of conceptual modeling data streams mining, we put forward a data streams oriented decision logic language as a granular Computing formal approach and a rules extracting model based on granular computing. In this model, we propose the notion of granular drifting, which accurately interpret the concept drifting problem in data streams. This model is helpful to understand the nature of data streams mining. Based on this model, new algorithms and techniques of data streams mining Could be developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, ST; Shue, LY; Lee, SF				Li, Sheng-Tun; Shue, Li-Yen; Lee, Shu-Fen			Business intelligence approach to supporting strategy-making of ISP service management	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Internet Service Provider; service management; Business Intelligence; data mining; decision support systems		The recent deregulation of telecommunication industry by the Taiwanese government has brought about the acute competition for Internet Service Providers (ISP). Taiwan's ISP industry is characterized by the heavy pressure for raising revenue after hefty capital investments of last decade and the lack of knowledge to develop competitive strategies. To attract subscribers, all ISP dealers are making an all-out effort to improve their service management. This study proposes a Business Intelligence process for ISP dealers in Taiwan to assist management in developing effective service management strategies. We explore the customers' usage characteristics and preference knowledge through applying the attribute-oriented induction (AOI) method on IP traffic data of users. Using the self-organizing map (SOM) method, we are able to divide customers into clusters with different usage behavior patterns. We then apply RFM modeling to calibrate customers' value of each cluster, which will enable the management to develop direct and effective marketing strategies. For network resource management, this research mines the facility utilization over various administrative districts of the region, which could assist management in planning for effective network facilities investment. With actual data from one major ISP, we develop a BI decision support system with visual presentation, which is well received by its management staff. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, GM; Li, JY; Wong, L				Liu, Guimei; Li, Jinyan; Wong, Limsoon			A new concise representation of frequent itemsets using generators and a positive border	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent itemset mining; Generator; Concise representation; Positive border; Data mining	PATTERNS	A complete set of frequent itemsets can get undesirably large due to redundancy when the minimum support threshold is low or when the database is dense. Several concise representations have been previously proposed to eliminate the redundancy. Generator based representations rely on a negative border to make the representation lossless. However, the number of itemsets on a negative border sometimes even exceeds the total number of frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose to use a positive border together with frequent generators to form a lossless representation. A positive border is usually orders of magnitude smaller than its corresponding negative border. A set of frequent generators plus its positive border is always no larger than the corresponding complete set of frequent itemsets, thus it is a true concise representation. The generalized form of this representation is also proposed. We develop an efficient algorithm, called GrGrowth, to mine generators and positive borders as well as their generalizations. The GrGrowth algorithm uses the depth-first-search strategy to explore the search space, which is much more efficient than the breadth-first-search strategy adopted by most of the existing generator mining algorithms. Our experiment results show that the GrGrowth algorithm is significantly faster than level-wise algorithms for mining generator based representations, and is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets.

J	Kantarcioglu, M; Jiang, W; Liu, Y; Malin, B				Kantarcioglu, Murat; Jiang, Wei; Liu, Ying; Malin, Bradley			A cryptographic approach to securely share and query genomic sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						databases; genomics; homomorphic encryption; privacy; security	PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOSYSTEMS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; GENETIC RESEARCH; PRIVACY; PHARMACOGENOMICS; ENCRYPTION; OPPORTUNITIES; ASSOCIATION; PROTECTION	To support large-scale biomedical research projects, organizations need to share person-specific genomic sequences without violating the privacy of their data subjects. In the past, organizations protected subjects' identities by removing identifiers, such as name and social security number; however, recent investigations illustrate that deidentified genomic data can be "reidentified" to named individuals using simple automated methods. In this paper, we present a novel cryptographic framework that enables organizations to support genomic data mining without disclosing the raw genomic sequences. Organizations contribute encrypted genomic sequence records into a centralized repository, where the administrator can perform queries, such as frequency counts, without decrypting the data. We evaluate the efficiency of our framework with existing databases of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequences and demonstrate that the time needed to complete count queries is feasible for real world applications. For example, our experiments indicate that a count query over 40 SNPs in a database of 5000 records can be completed in approximately 30 min with off-the-shelf technology. We further show that approximation strategies can be applied to significantly speed up query execution times with minimal loss in accuracy.

As a promising data mining approach, multiple criteria programming (MCLP) has been successfully applied to classify credit cardholders' behavior into two groups. In order to better control credit risk for financial institutes, this paper proposes three methods based on MCLP to improve the "Bad" catching accuracy rate. One is called MCLP with unbalanced training set selection, the second is called fuzzy linear programming (FLP) method with moving boundary, and the third is called penalized multi criteria linear programming (PMCLP). The experimental examples demonstrate the promising performance of these methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, CI; Tsai, CJ; Wu, TQ; Yang, WP				Lee, Chien-I; Tsai, Cheng-Jung; Wu, Tong-Qin; Yang, Wei-Pang			An approach to mining the multi-relational imbalanced database	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; classification; imbalance; relational database	INDUCTION	The class imbalance problem is an important issue in classification of Data mining. For example, in the applications of fraudulent telephone calls, telecommunications management, and rare diagnoses, users would be more interested in the minority than the majority. Although there are many proposed algorithms to solve the imbalanced problem, they are unsuitable to be directly applied on a multi-relational database. Nevertheless, many data nowadays such as financial transactions and medical anamneses are stored in a multi-relational database rather than a single data sheet. On the other hand, the widely used multi-relational classification approaches, such as TILDE, FOIL and CrossMine, are insensitive to handle the imbalanced databases. In this paper, we propose a multi-relational g-mean decision tree algorithm to solve the imbalanced problem in a multi-relational database. As shown in our experiments, our approach can more accurately mine a multi-relational imbalanced database. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mendenhall, MJ; Merenyi, E				Mendenhall, Michael J.; Merenyi, Erzsebet			Relevance-based feature extraction for hyperspectral images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						feature extraction; hyperspectral image compression; joint classification and compression; learning vector quantization (LVQ)	LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	Hyperspectral imagery affords researchers all discriminating details needed for fine delineation of many material classes. This delineation is essential for scientific research ranging from geologic to environmental impact studies. In a data mining scenario, one cannot blindly discard information because it can destroy discovery potential. In a supervised classification scenario, however, the preselection of classes presents one with an opportunity to extract a reduced set of meaningful features without degrading classification performance. Given the complex correlations found in hyperspectral data and the potentially large number of classes, meaningful feature extraction is a difficult task. We turn to the recent neural paradigm of generalized relevance learning vector quantization (GRLVQ) [B. Hammer and T. Villmann, Neural Networks, vol. 15, pp. 1059-1068, 20021, which is based on, and substantially extends, learning vector quantization (LVQ) [T. Kohonen, Self-Organizing Maps, Berlin! Germany: Springer-Verlag, 20011 by learning relevant input dimensions while incorporating classification accuracy in the cost function. By addressing deficiencies in GRLVQ, we produce an improved version, GRLVQI, which is an effective analysis tool for high-dimensional data such as remotely sensed hyperspectral data. With an independent classifier, we show that the spectral features deemed relevant by our improved GRLVQI result in a better classification for a predefined set of surface materials than using all available spectral channels.

The new approach (a) relies on the maxmin criterion which is a method in decision theory for maximizing the minimum gain and (b) builds upon the border theory of frequent itemsets. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology both with respect to the hiding results as well as with respect to the time performance compared to similar state of the art approaches.

J	Wang, FH				Wang, Feng-Hsu			On discovery of soft associations with "most" fuzzy quantifier for item promotion applications	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						knowledge discovery; soft computing; association mining; fuzzy set; item promotion	INTER-TRANSACTION; RULES; WEB; PERSONALIZATION; PATTERNS; MODEL	In item promotion applications, there is a strong need for tools that can help to unlock the hidden profit within each individual customer's transaction history. Discovering association patterns based on the data mining technique is helpful for this purpose. However, the conventional association mining approach, while generating "strong" association rules, cannot detect potential profit-building opportunities that can be exposed by "soft" association rules, which recommend items with looser but significant enough associations. This paper proposes a novel mining method that automatically detects hidden profit-building opportunities through discovering soft associations among items from historical transactions. Specifically, this paper proposes a relaxation method of association mining with a new support measurement, called soft support. that can be used for mining soft association patterns expressed with the "most" fuzzy quantifier. In addition, a novel measure for validating the soft-associated rules is proposed based on the estimated possibility of a conditioned quantified fuzzy event. The new measure is shown to be effective by comparison with several existing measures. A new association mining algorithm based on modification of the FT-Tree algorithm is proposed to accommodate this new support measure. Finally, the mining algorithm is applied to several data sets to investigate its effectiveness in finding soft patterns and content recommendation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Software integration in national measurement-standards laboratories	IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The development and integration of measurement-automation applications in a unified software solution is analysed with particular emphasis on national measurement-standards laboratories. Measurement-automation software in a typical measurement laboratory has several applications for data acquisition, data processing, data presentation and data management, which are more or less compatible with each other. The proposed unified solution is based on central database approach. The concept of structurally storing all the data in a single location, where it can be dynamically accessed by all applications, eliminates compatibility issues between applications, introduces inherent data concurrency and through efficient data and program code separation simplifies development and maintenance of the software. The concepts for the implementation of the central database approach, as well as open architecture and efficient modular design of applications are presented. The proposed solutions are determined by the specifics and requirements of national measurement-standards laboratories, such as diversity of measurements and measurement equipment, flexibility, traceability, modularity, reliability and error detection. This is opposed to the calibration software for the commercial laboratories, where the main emphasis is on the calibration throughput in a closed solution calibration system. The implementation of the integrated software solution for measurement-automation has benefits not only in reduced workload, but also in improved insight in the measurement process and data processing, increased reliability of measurement results as a result of reduction of human errors, and the data mining at a higher level.

Most commercial data mining programs accept data pre-formatted in the form of a table, with each example being encoded as a linear feature vector. Is it worth spending time incorporating domain knowledge in feature construction or algorithm design, or can off-the-shelf programs working directly on simple low-level features do better than skilled data analysts? To answer these questions, we formatted five datasets using two data representations. The participants in the "prior knowledge" track used the raw data, with full knowledge of the meaning of the data representation. Conversely, the participants in the "agnostic learning" track used a pre-formatted data table, with no knowledge of the identity of the features. The results indicate that black-box methods using relatively unsophisticated features work quite well and rapidly approach the best attainable performance. The winners on the prior knowledge track used feature extraction strategies yielding a large number of low-level features. Incorporating prior knowledge in the form of generic coding/smoothing methods to exploit regularities in data is beneficial, but incorporating actual domain knowledge in feature construction is very time consuming and seldom leads to significant improvements.

In the experiments, we demonstrate that the branching factor and depth of the frequent patterns to find are key factors of complexity for tree mining algorithms, even if often overlooked in previous work. We show that DRYADEPARENT outperforms the current fastest algorithm, CMTreeMiner, by orders of magnitude on data sets where the frequent tree patterns have a high branching factor.

J	Zhang, K; Fan, W				Zhang, Kun; Fan, Wei			Forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days: analyses, solutions and beyond	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						sample selection bias; probability estimation; skewed distribution; streaming; random decision tree		Much work on skewed, stochastic, high dimensional, and biased datasets usually implicitly solve each problem separately. Recently, we have been approached by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to help them build highly accurate ozone level alarm forecasting models for the Houston area, where these technical difficulties come together in one single problem. Key characteristics of this problem that is challenging and interesting include: (1) the dataset is sparse (72 features, and 2 or 5% positives depending on the criteria of "ozone days"), (2) evolving over time from year to year, (3) limited in collected data size (7 years or around 2,500 data entries), (4) contains a large number of irrelevant features, (5) is biased in terms of "sample selection bias", and (6) the true model is stochastic as a function of measurable factors. Besides solving a difficult application problem, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore new and existing data mining techniques, and to provide experience, guidance and solution for similar problems. Our main technical focus addresses on how to estimate reliable probability given both sample selection bias and a large number of irrelevant features, and how to choose the most reliable decision threshold to predict the unknown future with different distribution. On the application side, the prediction accuracy of our chosen approach (bagging probabilistic decision trees and random decision trees) is 20% higher in recall (correctly detects 1-3 more ozone days, depending on the year) and 10% higher in precision (15-30 fewer false alarm days per year) than state-of-the-art methods used by air quality control scientists, and these results are significant for TCEQ. On the technical side of data mining, extensive empirical results demonstrate that, at least for this problem, and probably other problems with similar characteristics, these two straight-forward non-parametric methods can provide significantly more accurate and reliable solutions than a number of sophisticated and well-known algorithms, such as SVM and AdaBoost among many others.

J	Chen, YL; Weng, CH				Chen, Yen-Liang; Weng, Cheng-Hsiung			Mining association rules from imprecise ordinal data	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; association rules; imprecise ordinal data	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; DATABASES; CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE; SUPPORT; TIME	Categorical data can generally be classified into ordinal data and nominal data. Although there have been numerous studies on finding association rules from nominal data, few have tried to do so from ordinal data. Additionally, previous mining algorithms usually assume that the input data is precise and clean, which is unrealistic in practical situations. Real-world data tends to be imprecise due to human errors, instrument errors, recording errors, and so on. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to discovering association rules from imprecise ordinal data. Experimental results from the survey data show the feasibility of the proposed mining algorithm. Performance analyses of the algorithms also show that the proposed approach can discover interesting and valuable rules that could never be found using the conventional approach, the Apriori algorithm.

Most previous studies focused on binary-valued transaction data. Transactions in real-world applications, however, usually consist of quantitative values. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy-genetic data-mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. It used a combination of large 1-itemsets and membership-function suitability to evaluate the fitness values of chromosomes. The calculation for large 1-itemsets could take a lot of time, especially when the database to be scanned could not totally fed into main memory. In this paper, an enhanced approach, called the cluster-based fuzzy-genetic mining algorithm, is thus proposed to speed up the evaluation process and keep nearly the same quality of solutions as the previous one. It divides the chromosomes in a population into k clusters by the k-means clustering approach and evaluates each individual according to both cluster and their own information. Experimental results also show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

It is expected that H.264/AVC will take over the digital video market, replacing the use of previous standards in most digital video applications. This creates an important need for heterogeneous video transcoding technologies from older standards to H.264. In this paper, we focus our attention on the interframe prediction, the most computationally intensive task involved in the heterogeneous video transcoding process. This paper presents a novel macroblock (MB) mode decision algorithm for interframe prediction based on data mining techniques to be used as part of a very low complexity heterogeneous video transcoder. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis that NIB coding mode decisions in H.264 video have a correlation with the distribution of the motion compensated residual in the decoded video. We use data mining tools to exploit the correlation and derive decision trees to classify the incoming decoded MBs into one of the several coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces the H.264 NIB mode computation process into a decision tree lookup with very low complexity. For general validation purposes, we apply our algorithm to two of the most important heterogeneous video transcoders: MPEG-2 to H.264 and H.263 to H.264. Our results show that the our data-mining based transcoding algorithm is able to maintain a good video quality while considerably reducing the computational complexity by 72% on average when applied in MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoders, and by 62% on average when applied in H.263 to H.264 transcoders. Finally, we conduct a comparative study with some of the most prominent fast interprediction methods for H.264 presented in the literature. Our results show that the proposed data mining-based approach achieves the best results for video transcoding applications.

Our study employed 60 simulated examples, with artificial neural networks and decision trees as the data mining techniques, and linear regression as the statistical method. In the performance study, we use the RMSE value as the metric and come up with some additional findings: (i) for continuous independent variables, a statistical technique (i.e., linear regression) was superior to data mining (i.e., decision tree and artificial neural network) regardless of the number of variables and the sample size; (ii) for continuous and categorical independent variables, linear regression was best when the number of categorical variables was one, while the artificial neural network was superior when the number of categorical variables was two or more; (iii) the artificial neural network performance improved faster than that of the other methods as the number of classes of categorical variable increased.

J	Chen, S; Cheng, CH				Chen, Shian, Jr.; Cheng, Ching-Hsue			Extracting classification rule of software diagnosis using modified MEPA	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						software diagnosis; minimize entropy; C4.5; data discretization		Defective software modules cause software failures, increase development and maintenance costs, and reduce customer satisfaction. Effective defect prediction models can help developers focus quality assurance activities on defect-prone modules and thus improve software quality by using resources more efficiently. In real-world databases are highly susceptible to noisy, missing, and inconsistent data. Noise is a random error or variance in a measured variable [Han, J., & Kamber, M. (2001). Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]. When decision trees are built, many of the branches may reflect noisy or outlier data. Therefore, data preprocessing steps are very important. There are many methods for data preprocessing. Concept hierarchies are a form of data discretization that can use for data preprocessing. Data discretization has many advantages, such as data can be reduced and simplified. Using discrete features are usually more compact, shorter and more accurate than using continuous ones [Liu, H., Hussain, F., Tan, C.L., & Dash, M. (2002). Discretization: An enabling technique. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 6(4), 393-423]. In this paper, we propose a modified minimize entropy principle approach and develop a modified MEPA system to partition the data, and then build the classification tree model. For verification, two NASA software projects KC2 and JM1 are applied to illustrate our proposed method. We establish a prototype system to discrete data from these projects. The error rate and number of rules show that the proposed approach is both better than other methods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nowadays, classical estimation models are being replaced by data mining models due to their application simplicity and the rapid production of profitable results. In this work, a method for mining association rules that relate project attributes is proposed. It deals with the problem of discretizing continuous data in order to generate a manageable number of high confident association rules. The method was validated by applying it to data from a Software Project Simulator. The association model obtained allows us to estimate the influence of certain management policy factors on various software project attributes simultaneously. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Advanced data mining techniques can help remedy this situation. This research has developed a prototype Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System (IHDPS) using data mining techniques, namely, Decision Trees, Nave Bayes and Neural Network. Results show that each technique has its unique strength in realizing the objectives of the defined mining goals. IHDPS can answer complex "what if' queries which traditional decision support systems cannot. Using medical profiles such as age, sex, blood pressure and blood sugar it can predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart disease. It enables significant knowledge, e.g. patterns, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease, to be established. IHDPS is Web-based, user-friendly, scalable, reliable and expandable. It is implemented on the .NET platform.

Our protocol for the single-step k-NN search is provably secure and has linear computation and communication complexity Previous work on this problem had a quadratic complexity, and also leaked information about the parties' inputs. We adapt our techniques to also solve the general multi-step k-NN search, and describe a specific embodiment of it for the case of sequence data.

SOME MEASURES RELATING PARTITIONS USEFUL FOR COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						partitioning; clustering; granular computing data Mining; concept hierarchy; computational		We investigate a number of measures relating partitions. One class of measures we consider are congruence measures. These measures are used to calculate the similarity between two partitionings. We provide a number of examples of this type of measure. Another class of measures we investigate are prognostication measures. This type of measure, closely related to a concept of containment between partitions, is useful in indicating how well knowledge of an objects class in one partitioning indicates its class in a second partitioning. We apply our measures to some data mining applications. One example is in choosing the appropriate level of a concept hierarchy. We also introduce a measure of the non-specificity of a partition. This measures a feature of a partition related to the granularity of the constituent classes of the partition.

Discovering frequent agreement subtrees from phylogenetic data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; evolutionary bioinformatics; computational phylogenetics; algorithmic design; pattern discovery	ROOTED TREES; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS	We study a new data mining problem concerning the discovery of frequent agreement subtrees ( FASTs) from a set of phylogenetic trees. A phylogenetic tree, or phylogeny, is an unordered tree in which the order among siblings is unimportant. Furthermore, each leaf in the tree has a label representing a taxon ( species or organism) name, whereas internal nodes are unlabeled. The tree may have a root, representing the common ancestor of all species in the tree, or may be unrooted. An unrooted phylogeny arises due to the lack of sufficient evidence to infer a common ancestor of the taxa in the tree. The FAST problem addressed here is a natural extension of the maximum agreement subtree ( MAST) problem widely studied in the computational phylogenetics community. The paper establishes a framework for tackling the FAST problem for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees using data mining techniques. We first develop a novel canonical form for rooted trees together with a phylogeny-aware tree expansion scheme for generating candidate subtrees level by level. Then, we present an efficient algorithm to find all FASTs in a given set of rooted trees, through an Apriori-like approach. We show the correctness and completeness of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss the extensions of the techniques to unrooted trees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods work well, and are capable of finding interesting patterns in both synthetic data and real phylogenetic trees.

J	Cagnazzo, M; Poggi, G; Verdoliva, L				Cagnazzo, Marco; Poggi, Giovanni; Verdoliva, Luisa			Region-based transform coding of multispectral images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						lossy coding; multispectral images.	HYPERSPECTRAL DATA-COMPRESSION; VECTOR QUANTIZATION; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; MODEL; VIDEO	We propose a new efficient region-based scheme for the compression of multispectral remote-sensing images. The region-based description of an image comprises a segmentation map, which singles out the relevant regions and provides their main features, followed by the detailed (possibly lossless) description of each region. The map conveys information on the image structure and could even be the only item of interest for the user; moreover, it enables the user to perform a selective download of the regions of interest, or can be used for high-level data mining and retrieval applications. This approach, with the multiple pieces of information required, may seem inherently inefficient. The goal of this research is to show that, by carefully selecting the appropriate segmentation and coding tools, region-based compression of multispectral images can be also effective in a rate-distortion sense, thus providing an image description that is both insightful and efficient. To this end, we define a generic coding scheme, based on Bayesian image segmentation and on transform coding, where several key design choices, however, are left open for optimization, from the type of transform, to the rate allocation procedure, and so on. Then, through an extensive experimental phase on real-world multispectral images, we gain insight on such key choices, and finally single out an efficient and robust coding scheme, with Bayesian segmentation, class-adaptive Karhunen-Lo ve spectral transform, and shape-adaptive wavelet spatial transform, which outperforms state-of-the-art and carefully tuned conventional techniques, such as JPEG-2000 multicomponent or SPIHT-based coders.

J	Moon, YS; Kim, JH				Moon, Yang-Sae; Kim, Jinho			Efficient moving average transform-based subsequence matching algorithms in time-series databases	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; time-series databases; subsequence matching; moving average transform	SIMILARITY SEARCH; RETRIEVAL	Moving average transform is very useful in finding the trend of time-series data by reducing the effect of noise, and has been used in many areas such as econometrics. Previous subsequence matching methods with moving average transform, however, are problematic in that, since they must build multiple indexes in supporting transform of arbitrary order, they incur index overhead both in storage space and in update maintenance. To solve this problem, we propose a single-index approach to subsequence matching that supports moving average transform of arbitrary order in time-series databases. Using the single-index approach, we can reduce both the storage space and the index maintenance overhead. In explaining the single-index approach, we first introduce the notion of poly-order moving average transform by generalizing the original definition of moving average transform. We then formally prove the correctness of poly-order transform-based subsequence matching. We also propose two subsequence matching methods based on poly-order transform that efficiently support moving average transform of arbitrary order. Experimental results for real stock data show that, compared with the sequential scan, our methods improve average performance significantly, by a factor of 22.6-33.6. Also, compared with cases in which an index is built for every moving average order, our methods reduce storage space and maintenance effort significantly while incurring only marginal performance degradation. Our approach entails the additional advantage of being generalized to support many other transforms in addition to moving average transform. Therefore, we believe that our approach will be widely used in many transform-based subsequence matching methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The method uses techniques that look for similarities between queries and identify sequences of "query transformation". It allows sequences of query transformations to be represented as graphical networks, thereby giving a richer view of search behavior than is possible with the usual sequential descriptions. We also perform a basic analysis to study the correlations between observed transformation codes, with results that appear to show evidence of behavior habits. The method was developed using transaction logs from the Excite search engine to provide a tool for an ongoing research project that is endeavoring to develop a greater understanding of Web-based searching by the general public.

J	Yeh, MY; Dai, BR; Chen, MS				Yeh, Mi-Yen; Dai, Bi-Ru; Chen, Ming-Syan			Clustering over multiple evolving streams by events and correlations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; data clustering; data streams		In applications of multiple data streams such as stock market trading and sensor network data analysis, the clusters of streams change at different times because of data evolution. The information about evolving cluster is valuable to support corresponding online decisions. In this paper, we present a framework for Clustering Over Multiple Evolving sTreams by CORrelations and Events, which, abbreviated as COMET-CORE, monitors the distribution of clusters over multiple data streams based on their correlation. Instead of directly clustering the multiple data streams periodically, COMET-CORE applies efficient cluster split and merge processes only when significant cluster evolution happens. Accordingly, we devise an event detection mechanism to signal the cluster adjustments. The coming streams are smoothed as sequences of end points by employing piecewise linear approximation. At the time when end points are generated, weighted correlations between streams are updated. End points are good indicators of significant change in streams, and this is a main cause of a cluster evolution event. When an event occurs, through split and merge operations we can report the latest clustering results.

Towards a framework for mining and analysing spatio-temporal datasets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; spatio-temporal data; exploratory visualization	VISUALIZATION; TIME	High-resolution spatio-temporal datasets are being collected every day to record the behaviour of several natural phenomena. However, data-mining techniques are needed to extract relevant patterns from very large repositories and reveal spatial and temporal patterns in the behaviour of these phenomena. To this aim, we propose a system for mining data with spatial and temporal characteristics, and for visualizing and interpreting the results. Within this system, we have developed two complementary 3D visualization environments, one based on Google Earth and one relying on a Java3D graphical user interface. In this paper, we illustrate the main features of the system we have developed, and report on the main results we have obtained by analysing the Hurricane Isabel dataset.

This algorithm uses the concepts of a flock of agents that move together in a complex manner with simple local rules. Each agent represents one data. The agents move together in a 21) environment with the aim of creating homogeneous groups of data. These groups are visualized in real time, and help the domain expert to understand the underlying structure of the data set, like for example a realistic number of classes, clusters of similar data, isolated data. We also present several extensions of this algorithm, which reduce its computational cost, and make use of a 3D display. This algorithm is then tested on artificial and real-world data, and a heuristic algorithm is used to evaluate the relevance of the obtained partitioning.

J	Diederich, J; Al-Ajmi, A; Yellowlees, P				Diederich, Joachim; Al-Ajmi, Aqeel; Yellowlees, Peter			E-x-ray: Data mining and mental health	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						machine learning; text classification; mental health; psychiatry; diagnosis		Machine learning techniques such as support vector machines are applied to a text classification task to determine mental health problems. Inputs are transcribed speech samples from a "structured-narrative task'' and outputs are psychiatric categories such as schizophrenia. In a preliminary trial, subjects from three groups generated speech samples: those with clinically diagnosed schizophrenia ( 31 patients), clinically diagnosed mania ( 16 patients) and controls ( 9 subjects). Even though the structured narrative task resulted in the use of a limited vocabulary by all subjects ( only a total of 1100 different words were used), a classification performance approaching 80% accuracy was achieved for the schizophrenia versus control task. Classification performance at this level indicates that the method is suitable for diagnostic or screening purposes. It is expected that results improve further in experiments utilising free-speech samples. Diagnostic categories in psychiatry can be broad and heterogeneous, e. g. schizophrenia, which includes a range of very different symptoms. In further experiments, clustering techniques are used to extract task-relevant diagnostic categories from psychiatric reports. In these reports, psychiatrists typically include biographic, background and referral information, a description of symptoms and an opinion on treatment recommendations. At the task level, diagnostic reports are written for a specific audience or decision making body. In preliminary experiments, detailed and specific diagnostic categories have been extracted from psychiatric reports by use of unsupervised learning. These categories genuinely reflect the everyday practise of a mental health professional. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Genetic operators for combinatorial optimization in TSP and microarray gene ordering	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						microarray; gene analysis; data mining; biocomputing; evolutionary algorithm; soft computing	TRAVELING-SALESMAN PROBLEM; SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; ALGORITHM; IMPLEMENTATION; EXPRESSION; PATTERNS	This paper deals with some new operators of genetic algorithms and[-27pc] demonstrates their effectiveness to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and microarray gene ordering. The new operators developed are nearest fragment operator based on the concept of nearest neighbor heuristic, and a modified version of order crossover operator. While these result in faster convergence of Genetic Algorithm (GAs) in finding the optimal order of genes in microarray and cities in TSP, the nearest fragment operator can augment the search space quickly and thus obtain much better results compared to other heuristics. Appropriate number of fragments for the nearest fragment operator and appropriate substring length in terms of the number of cities/genes for the modified order crossover operator are determined systematically. Gene order provided by the proposed method is seen to be superior to other related methods based on GAs, neural networks and clustering in terms of biological scores computed using categorization of the genes.

J	Andoh-Baidoo, FK; Osei-Bryson, KM				Andoh-Baidoo, Francis K.; Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			Exploring the characteristics of Internet security breaches that impact the market value of breached firms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Internet security breaches; event study; market value; firm characteristics; attack characteristics; decision tree induction; data mining; regression; exploratory data analysis	PRELIMINARY CLASSIFICATION SCHEME; ATTACKS; MODEL	The impact of Internet security breaches on firms has been a concern to both researchers and practitioners. One measure of the damage to the breached firm is the observed cumulative abnormal stock market return (CAR) when there is announcement of the attack in the public media. To develop effective Internet security investment strategies for preventing such damage, firms need to understand the factors that lead to the occurrence of CAR. While previous research have involved the use of regression analysis to explore the relationship between firm and attack characteristics and the occurrence of CAR, in this paper we use decision tree (DT) induction to explore this relationship. The results of our DT-based analysis indicate that both attack and firm characteristics determine CAR. While each of our results is consistent with that of at least one previous study, no previous single study has provided evidence that both firm and attack characteristics are determinants of CAR. Further, the DT-based analysis provides an interpretable model in the form of understandable and actionable rules that may be used by decision makers. The DT-based approach thus provides additional insights beyond what may be provided by the regression approach that has been employed in previous research. The paper makes methodological, theoretical and practical contribution to understanding the predictors of damage when a firm is breached. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Association rules mining using heavy itemsets	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						association rules; data mining; knowledge discovery in databases; knowledge compression	ALGORITHM	A well-known problem that limits the practical usage of association rule mining algorithms is the extremely large number of rules generated. Such a large number of rules makes the algorithms inefficient and makes it difficult for the end users to comprehend the discovered rules. We present the concept of a heavy itemset. An itemset A is heavy (for given support and confidence values) if all possible association rules made up of items only in A are present. We prove a simple necessary and sufficient condition for an itemset to be heavy. We present a formula for the number of possible rules for a given heavy itemset, and show that a heavy itemset compactly represents an exponential number of association rules. Along with two simple search algorithms, we present an efficient greedy algorithm to generate a collection of disjoint heavy itemsets in a given transaction database. We then present a modified apriori algorithm that starts with a given collection of disjoint heavy itemsets and discovers more heavy itemsets, not necessarily disjoint with the given ones.

J	Rupnik, R; Kukar, M; Krisper, M				Rupnik, Rok; Kukar, Matjaz; Krisper, Marjan			Integrating data mining and decision support through data mining based decision support system	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; COMMERCE; MODELS	The information overload caused by the massive influx of raw data has caused traditional data analysis to become insufficient. This caused a new interdisciplinary field of data mining to arise, encompassing both classical statistical, and modem machine teaming tools to support the data analysis and knowledge discovery from databases. While data mining methods are powerful in dealing with large quantities of data, they are often difficult to master by business users to facilitate decision support. In this paper we introduce our approach to integration of decision support system with data mining methods. We discuss the role of data mining to facilitate decision support, the role of data mining in decision support systems, discuss underlying ideas and applied approaches and introduce a data mining decision support system called DMDSS (Data Mining Decision Support System). We present some obtained results and their beneficial use as expected by the business users.	Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia	Rupnik, R (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

We discuss the requirements that such a framework should fulfill: It should elegantly handle different types of data, different data mining tasks, and different types of patterns/models. We also discuss data mining languages and what they should support: this includes the design and implementation of data mining algorithms, as well as their composition into nontrivial multi-step knowledge discovery scenarios relevant for practical application. We proceed by laying out some basic concepts, starting with (structured) data and generalizations (e.g., patterns and models) and continuing with data mining tasks and basic components of data mining algorithms (i.e., refinement operators, distances, features and kernels). We next discuss how to use these concepts to formulate constraint-based data mining tasks and design generic data mining algorithms. We finally discuss how these components would fit in the overall framework and in particular into a language for data mining and knowledge discovery.

This market mechanism allows selection between multiple instances of services based on operations required in a data mining task (such as data migration, data pre-processing and subsequently data analysis). Catallaxy is a decentralized approach, based on a "free market" mechanism, and is particularly useful when the number of market participants is large or when conditions within the market often change. It is therefore particularly suitable in Grid and peer-2-peer systems. The approach assumes that the service provider and user are not co-located, and require multiple message exchanges to carry out a data mining task. A market of J48-based decision tree algorithm instances, each implemented as a Web service, is used to demonstrate our approach. We have validated the feasibility of building catallactic data mining grid applications, and implemented a proof-of-concept application (Cat-COVITE) mapped to a catallactic Grid middleware.

We first detected novel sentences using named entity recognition to extract the entity types of person, place, time, and organization. In addition, part-of-speech tagging was performed to tag each word in the documents, allowing syntactic structures of noun, verb, and adjective to be used for comparisons. WordNet, an English lexical database of concepts and relations, was also incorporated to generate synonyms for the entities and parts of speech, as well as to determine the similarity of sentences. The novelty score of each sentence was determined by using two different metrics, UniqueComparison and ImportanceValue. UniqueComparison calculated the number of matched entities, whereas ImportanceValue took into account the total weight of matched words that coexisted in both the test and history sentences. The results look promising when compared to the benchmark scores for the Text Retrieval Conference's (TREC) Novelty Track 2004. This demonstrated that the combination of named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging is capable of detecting novelty with good results.

We used the GUHA method instead of the traditional apriori algorithm and enhanced the former implementations of the method with ability of disjunctions setting between items.

Previous work has shown that some model-based techniques are more robust than k-nn. Model abstraction can inhibit certain aspects of an attack, providing an algorithmic approach to minimizing attack effectiveness. In this paper, we examine the robustness of a recommendation algorithm based on the data mining technique of association rule mining. Our results show that the Apriori algorithm offers large improvement in stability and robustness compared to k-nearest neighbor and other model-based techniques we have studied. Furthermore, our results show that Apriori can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to k-nn.	[Sandvig, J.

Value, cost, and sharing: Open issues in constrained clustering	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN INDUCTIVE DATABASES	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases	SEP 18, 2006	Berlin, GERMANY				ALGORITHMS	Clustering is an important tool for data mining, since it can identify major patterns or trends without any supervision (labeled data). Over the past five years, semi-supervised (constrained) clustering methods have become very popular. These methods began with incorporating pairwise constraints and have developed into more general methods that can learn appropriate distance metrics. However, several important open questions have arisen about which constraints are most useful, how they can be actively acquired, and when and how they should be propagated to neighboring points. This position paper describes these open questions and suggests future directions for constrained clustering research.

Privacy-Preservation for Gradient Descent Methods	KDD-2007 PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	AUG 12-15, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Privacy Preservation; Gradient Descent Method; Secure Multiparty Computation; Regression		Gradient descent is a widely used paradigm for solving many optimization problems. Stochastic gradient descent performs a series of iterations to minimize a target function in order to reach a local minimum. In machine learning or data mining, this function corresponds to a decision model that is to be discovered. The gradient descent paradigm underlies many commonly used techniques in data mining and machine learning, such as neural networks, Bayesian networks, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work that extends the notion of privacy preservation or secure multiparty computation to gradient-descent-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a preliminary approach to enable privacy preservation in gradient descent methods in general and demonstrate its feasibility in specific gradient descent methods.

Computing iceberg cubes by top-down and bottom-up integration: The StarCubing approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data warehouse; data mining; online analytical processing (OLAP)		Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in data warehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down versus bottom-up. The former, represented by the MultiWay Array Cube ( called the MultiWay) algorithm [ 30], aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of a priori pruning [ 2] when computing iceberg cubes ( cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure values satisfy a threshold, called the iceberg condition). The latter, represented by BUC [ 6], computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates a priori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; however, it does not fully explore multidimensional simultaneous aggregation. In this paper, we present a new method, Star-Cubing, that integrates the strengths of the previous two algorithms and performs aggregations on multiple dimensions simultaneously. It utilizes a star-tree structure, extends the simultaneous aggregation methods, and enables the pruning of the group-bys that do not satisfy the iceberg condition. Our performance study shows that Star-Cubing is highly efficient and outperforms the previous methods.

This is because missing values in a dataset can generate bias that affects the quality of the learned patterns or the classification performances. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a Grey-Based K-NN Iteration Imputation method, called GBKII, for imputing missing values. GBKII is an instance-based imputation method, which is referred to a non-parametric regression method in statistics. It is also efficient for handling with categorical attributes. We experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate that GBKII is much more efficient than the k-NN and mean-substitution methods.

However, the existence of huge data sets make the scalability of data-mining algorithms a very important objective, and in recent years parallel computing has been applied to general data-mining algorithms. This paper addresses the problem of mining multiple partial periodic patterns in a parallel computing environment. To reduce the cost of communication between the processors, our approach employs the independence property of prime numbers to classify partial periodic patterns into multiple independent sets. Moreover, a novel method of distributing mining tasks among the processors is proposed. A set of simulations is used to demonstrate the benefits of our approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Frigui, H				Frigui, Hichem			MembershipMap: Data transformation based on granulation and fuzzy membership aggregation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering; fuzzy sets; labeling; preprocessing; transformations	ALGORITHM	We propose a new data-driven transformation that facilitates many data mining, interpretation, and analysis tasks. Our approach, called MembershipMap, strives to granulate and extract the underlying subconcepts of each raw attribute. The orthogonal union of these subconcepts are then used to define a new membership space. The subconcept soft labels of each point in the original space determine the position of that point in the new space. Since subconcept labels are prone to uncertainty inherent in the original data and in the initial extraction process, a combination of labeling schemes that are based on different measures of uncertainty will be presented. In particular, we introduce the CrispMap, the FuzzyMap, and the PossibilisticMap. We outline the advantages and disadvantages of each mapping scheme, and we show that the three transformed spaces are complementary. We also show that in addition to improving the performance of clustering by taking advantage of the richer information content, the MembershipMap can be used as a flexible preprocessing tool to support such tasks as: sampling, data cleaning, and outlier detection.

Although subjective decision making problems occur daily in our life, they have received relatively little attention in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining communities. We claim that for most problems, a simple set of rules derived by a nearest neighbor algorithm is the appropriate approach. A simple version of a nearest neighbor model is tested and compared with two other well-established classification methods: neural networks and classifications and regression trees (CART). The results of the experiments show that the simple nearest neighbor method provides very accurate predictions while using very few prototypes or clusters. Although not always the best in accuracy, the differences are sufficiently slight to not warrant greater complexity in deriving rules. Our research on the effectiveness of parsimonious rule sets suggests that decision trees with more than 7-10 branches are not needed for capturing most human multiattribute decision-making problems, and minimal time or memory resources should be used to generate decision making rules.

Although there are several factors that affect the perception of taste, tenderness is considered the most important characteristic. In this paper, a Feature Selection procedure, based on a Sensitivity Analysis, is combined with a Support Vector Machine, in order to predict lamb meat tenderness. This real-world problem is defined in terms of two difficult regression tasks, by modeling objective (e.g. Warner-Bratzler Shear force) and subjective (e.g. human taste panel) measurements. In both cases, the proposed solution is competitive when compared with other neural (e.g. Multilayer Perceptron) and Multiple Regression approaches.

J	Chen, YL; Huang, TCK				Chen, Yen-Liang; Huang, Tony Cheng-Kui			A new approach for discovering fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns in sequence databases	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy sets; data mining; sequential patterns; sequence data; quantitative data	ASSOCIATION RULES; GENERATION	Given a sequence database and minimum support threshold, the goal of mining quantitative sequential patterns is to discover the complete set of sequential patterns with purchased quantities in databases. Although this type of pattern can provide more information than the traditional sequential pattern, it also causes a sharp boundary problem. This means that when an item's quantity is close to the boundary of two adjacent quantity intervals, it is either ignored or overemphasized. In view of this weakness, a recent paper from Hong, Kuo, and Chi proposed a new kind of extended patterns, called fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns (FQSP), where an item's quantity in the pattern is represented by a fuzzy term rather than a quantity interval. In their work an Apriori-like algorithm was developed to mine all FQSP. In this paper, we propose a new and novel algorithm to mine FQSP based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Since the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the candidate subsequence generation efforts, the performance is improved significantly. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient and scalable than the previous algorithm. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Eick, CF; Rouhana, A; Bagherjeiran, A; Vilalta, R				Eick, CF; Rouhana, A; Bagherjeiran, A; Vilalta, R			Using clustering to learn distance functions for supervised similarity assessment	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						distance function learning; supervised clustering; nearest neighbor	CLASSIFICATION	Assessing the similarity between objects is a prerequisite for many data mining techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach to learn distance functions that maximizes the clustering of objects belonging to the same class. Objects belonging to a data set are clustered with respect to a given distance function and the local class density information of each cluster is then used by a weight adjustment heuristic to modify the distance function so that the class density is increased in the attribute space. This process of interleaving clustering with distance function modification is repeated until a "good" distance function has been found. We implemented our approach using the k-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our approach using seven UCI data sets for a traditional 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) classifier and a compressed 1-NN classifier, called NCC, that uses the learnt distance function and cluster centroids instead of all the points of a training set. The experimental results show that attribute weighting leads to statistically significant improvements in prediction accuracy over a traditional 1-NN classifier for two of the seven data sets tested, whereas using NCC significantly improves the accuracy of the 1-NN classifier for four of the seven data sets.

Efficient similarity searches require robust indexing techniques. Unfortunately, existing indexing methods developed for multidimensional ( ordered) Continuous Data Spaces ( CDS) such as the R-tree cannot be directly applied to an NDDS. This is because some essential geometric concepts/properties such as the minimum bounding region and the area of a region in a CDS are no longer valid in an NDDS. Other indexing methods based on metric spaces such as the M-tree and the Slim-trees are too general to effectively utilize the special characteristics of NDDSs, resulting in nonoptimized performance. In this article, we propose a new dynamic data-partitioning-based indexing technique, called the ND-tree, to support efficient similarity searches in an NDDS. The key idea is to extend the relevant geometric concepts as well as some indexing strategies used in CDSs to NDDSs. Efficient algorithms for ND-tree construction and techniques to solve relevant issues such as handling dimensions with different alphabets in an NDDS are presented. Our experimental results on synthetic data and real genome sequence data demonstrate that the ND-tree outperforms the linear scan, the M-tree and the Slim-trees for similarity searches in multidimensional NDDSs. A theoretical model is also developed to predict the performance of the ND-tree for random data.

J	Fakih, SJ; Das, TK				Fakih, SJ; Das, TK			LEAD: A methodology for learning efficient approaches to medical diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Markov decision processes (MDP); medical diagnosis; reinforcement learning; rough sets	DISEASE	Determining the most efficient use of diagnostic tests is one of the complex issues facing medical practitioners. With the soaring cost of healthcare, particularly in the US, there is a critical need for cutting costs of diagnostic tests, while achieving a higher level of diagnostic accuracy. This paper develops a learning based methodology that, based on patient information, recommends test(s) that optimize a suitable measure of diagnostic performance. A comprehensive performance measure is developed that accounts for the costs of testing, morbidity, and mortality associated with the tests, and time taken to reach diagnosis. The performance measure also accounts for the diagnostic ability of the tests. The methodology combines tools from the fields of data mining (rough set theory, in particular), utility theory, Markov decision processes (MDP), and reinforcement learning (RL). The rough set theory is used in extracting diagnostic information in the form of rules from the medical databases. Utility theory is used in bringing various northomogenous performance measures into one cost based measure. An MDP model together with an RL algorithm facilitates obtaining efficient testing strategies. The methodology is implemented on a sample problem of diagnosing solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN). The results obtained are compared with those from four alternative testing strategies. Our methodology holds significant promise to improve the process of medical diagnosis.

In order to represent structural features common to such semistructured data, we propose a linear ordered term tree, which is a rooted tree pattern consisting of ordered tree structures and internal structured variables with distinct variable labels. For a set of edge labels Lambda, let partial derivative TTLambda be the set of all linear ordered term trees. For a linear ordered term tree t in partial derivative TTLambda, the term tree language of t, denoted by L-Lambda(t), is the set of all ordered trees obtained from t by substituting arbitrary ordered trees for all variables in t. Given a set of ordered trees S, the minimal language problem for partial derivative TLLambda = {L-Lambda(t) vertical bar t is an element of partial derivative TTLambda} is to find a linear ordered term tree t in partial derivative TTLambda such that LA (t) is minimal among all term tree languages which contain all ordered trees in S. We show that the class partial derivative TTLambda is polynomial time inductively inferable from positive data, by giving a polynomial time algorithm for solving the minimal language problem for partial derivative TTLambda (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

However, such experiments are often not as extensive and systematic as they ideally would be, and therefore the experimental results must be interpreted with caution. In this paper we present a new experimental methodology that is based on the concept of "experiment databases". An experiment database can be seen as a special kind of inductive database, and the experimental methodology consists of filling and then querying this database. We show that the novel methodology has numerous advantages over the existing one. As such, this paper presents a novel and interesting application of inductive databases that may have a significant impact on experimental research in machine learning and data mining.

The additional space is linear in the input size. Our framework can be used to mine frequent strings, emerging strings and strings that pass other statistical tests, e.g., the chi(2)-test. In contrast to the presented result for strings, no optimal algorithms are known for other pattern domains such as itemsets. The key to our approach are several recent results on index structures for strings, among them suffix- and lcp-arrays, and a new preprocessing scheme for range minimum queries. The advantages of array-based data structures (compared with dynamic data structures such as trees) are good locality behavior and extensibility to secondary memory. We test our algorithm on real-world data from computational biology and demonstrate that the approach also works well in practice.

Rough set theory has been witnessed great success in attribute reduction. A series of reduction algorithms were constructed for all kinds of applications based on rough set models. There is usually more than one reduct for some real world data sets. It is not very clear which one or which subset of the reducts should be selected for learning. Neither experimental comparison nor theoretic analysis was reported so far. In this paper, we will review the proposed attribute reduction algorithms and reduction selection strategies. Then a series of numeric experiments are presented. The results show that, statistically speaking, the classification systems trained with the reduct with the least features get the best generalization power in terms of single classifiers.

J	Ishino, Y; Jin, Y				Ishino, Y; Jin, Y			An information value based approach to design procedure capture	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						knowledge acquisition; design procedure; design process; data mining; interestingness; sequential pattern	RATIONALE	Capturing engineering knowledge and managing it effectively is important for enterprises to stay competitive in today's global market. In our research, we focus on specific engineering knowledge, called design procedures, and attempt to develop effective ways to capture this operational knowledge from the design events monitored during design process. We proposed a novel method called Information Value based Mining for Sequential Pattern, or VMSP for short. VMSP does not require any predefined design-task-specific rules for classification of design events. The basic idea of VMSP is to treat any list of monitored design events as a sequential pattern and search for most frequent and informative sequential patterns. VMSP automatically generates candidate templates of sequential patterns, and then identify valuable patterns as design operations based on the interestingness we set. The interestingness is a synthesized index of the two evaluation criteria: One is intrinsic value representing how many design events constitute the template; and the other is extrinsic valite indicating how often the sequence appears in the design process. We have evaluated VMSP through two case studies using real CAD operation data recorded through gear design and automotive door design processes, respectively. A case study using synthetic data was also carried out to test the scalability of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promisingfield of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field.

For that purpose, we first review semirings and semimodules over semirings as the appropriate objects to use in abstracting the Boolean algebra and the notion of extents and intents, respectively. We later bring to bear powerful theorems developed in the field of linear algebra over idempotent semimodules to try to build a Fundamental Theorem for K-Formal Concept Analysis, where K is a type of idempotent semiring. Finally, we try to put Formal Concept Analysis in new perspective by considering it as a concrete instance of the theory developed.

It is becoming increasingly evident that in a few years the Internet will host a large number of interacting software agents. Most of them will be economically motivated, and will negotiate a variety of goods and services. It is therefore important to consider the economic incentives and behaviors of economic software agents, and to use all available means to anticipate their collective interactions. This paper addresses this concern by presenting a multiagent market simulator designed for analyzing agent market strategies based on a complete understanding of buyer and seller behaviors, preference models and pricing algorithms, and considering risk preferences. The system includes agents that are capable of improving their performance with their own experience, by adapting to the market conditions. The results of the negotiations between agents are analyzed by data mining algorithms to extract rules that give agents feedback to improve their strategies.

We propose a new method for rule encoding and genetic operators that preserve rule integrity, and implemented a system, named GEPCLASS. Due to its encoding scheme, the system allows the automatic discovery of flexible rules, better fitted to data. The performance of GEPCLASS was compared with two genetic programming systems and with C4.5, over four data sets in a five-fold cross-validation procedure. The predictive accuracy for the methods compared were similar, but the computational effort needed by GEPCLASS was significantly smaller than the other. CEPCLASS was able to find simple and accurate rules as it can handle continuous and categorical attributes.

Here we address the task of predictive clustering, which contains elements of both and generalizes them to some extent. Predictive clustering has been mainly evaluated in the context of trees. In this paper, we extend predictive clustering toward rules. Each cluster is described by a rule and different clusters are allowed to overlap since the sets of examples covered by different rules do not need to be disjoint. We propose a system for learning these predictive clustering rules, which is based on a heuristic sequential covering algorithm. The heuristic takes into account both the precision of the rules (compactness w.r.t. the target space) and the compactness w.r.t. the input space, and the two can be traded-off by means of a parameter. We evaluate our system in the context of several multi-objective classification problems.

J	Zhao, H; Sinha, AP				Zhao, H; Sinha, AP			An efficient algorithm for generating generalized decision forests	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						cascade generalization; classification; data mining; decision forest; decision tree; machine learning	CASCADE GENERALIZATION; TREES	A shortcoming of univariate decision tree learners is that they do not learn intermediate concepts and select only one of the input features in the branching decision at each intermediate tree node. It has been empirically demonstrated that cascading other classification methods, which learn intermediate concepts, with decision tree learners can alleviate such representational bias of decision trees and potentially improve classification performance. However, a more complex model that fits training data better may not necessarily perform better on unseen data, commonly referred to as the overfitting problem. To find the most appropriate degree of such cascade generalization, a decision forest (i.e., a set of decision trees with other classification models cascaded to different degrees) needs to be generated, from which the best decision tree can then be identified. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient algorithm for generating such decision forests. The algorithm uses an extended decision tree data structure and constructs any node that is common to multiple decision trees only once. The authors have empirically evaluated the algorithm using 32 data sets for classification problems from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and report on results demonstrating the efficiency of the algorithm in this paper.

In most KDD/DM application cases, major tasks are required, including data preparation, data preprocessing, data mining, interpretation, application and evaluation. A case study is presented that KDD/DM is utilized to explore decision rules for a leading insurance company. The decision rules can be used to investigate the potential customers for an existing or new insurance product. The research firstly constructed the application framework, then defined and conducted each task required, and finally obtained feedback from the case company. Discussions and implications with respect to this research are presented also. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This gives a push for data mining technologies to move from a niche towards the mainstream. Apart from a few algorithms, the main contribution of SQL Server Data Mining is the implementation of OLE DB for Data Mining. OLE DB for Data mining is an industrial standard led by Microsoft and supported by a number of ISVs. It leverages two existing relational technologies: SQL and OLE DB. It defines a SQL language for data mining based on a relational concept. More recently, Microsoft, Hyperion, SAS and a few other BI vendors formed the XML for Analysis Council. XML for Analysis covers both OLAP and Data Mining. The goal is to allow consumer applications to query various BI packages from different platforms. This paper gives an overview of OLE DB for Data Mining and XML for Analysis. It also shows how to build data mining application using these APIs.

Due to its immense applications in various areas, spatial clustering has been highly active topic in data mining researches, with fruitful, scalable clustering methods developed recently. These spatial clustering methods can be classified into four categories: partitioning method, hierarchical method, density-based method and grid-based method. Clustering large data sets of high dimensionality has always been a serious challenge for clustering algorithms. Many recently developed clustering algorithms have attempted to address either handling data with very large number of records or data sets with very high number of dimensions. This new clustering method GCHL (a Grid-Clustering algorithm for High-dimensional very Large spatial databases) combines a novel density-grid based clustering with axis-parallel partitioning strategy to identify areas of high density in the input data space. The algorithm work as well in the feature space of any data set. The method operates on a limited memory buffer and requires at most a single scan through the data. We demonstrate the high quality of the obtained clustering solutions, capability of discovering concave/deeper and convex/higher regions, their robustness to outlier and noise, and GCHL excellent scalability. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Efficacy and efficiency are two critical aspects for knowledge-based techniques. The incorporation of knowledge into evolutionary algorithms (EAs) should provide either better solutions (efficacy) or the equivalent solutions in shorter time (efficiency), regarding the same evolutionary algorithm without incorporating such knowledge. In this paper, we categorize and summarize some of the incorporation of knowledge techniques for evolutionary algorithms and present a novel data structure, called efficient evaluation structure (EES), which helps the evolutionary algorithm to provide decision rules using less computational resources. The EES-based EA is tested and compared to another EA system and the experimental results show the quality of our approach, reducing the computational cost about 50%, maintaining the global accuracy of the final set of decision rules.

In this paper, we investigate the combined use of self-organizing maps (SOM) and nonsmooth nonconvex optimization techniques in order to produce a working case of a data-driven risk classification system. The optimization approach strengthens the validity of SOM results, and the improved classification system increases both the quality of prediction and the homogeneity within the risk groups. Accurate classification of prostate cancer patients into risk groups is important to assist in the identification of appropriate treatment paths. We start with the existing rules and aim to improve classification accuracy by identifying inconsistencies utilizing self-organizing maps as a data visualization tool. Then, we progress to the study of assigning prostate cancer patients into homogenous groups with the aim to support future clinical treatment decisions. Using the case of prostate cancer patients grouping, we demonstrate strong potential of data-driven risk classification schemes for addressing the risk grouping issues in more general organizational settings.

J	Kao, B; Zhang, MH; Yip, CL; Cheung, DW				Kao, B; Zhang, MH; Yip, CL; Cheung, DW			Efficient algorithms for mining and incremental update of maximal frequent sequences	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; sequence; incremental update	DISCOVERED ASSOCIATION RULES; MAINTENANCE	We study two problems: (1) mining frequent sequences from a transactional database, and (2) incremental update of frequent sequences when the underlying database changes over time. We review existing sequence mining algorithms including GSP, PrefixSpan, SPADE, and ISM. We point out the large memory requirement of PrefixSpan, SPADE, and ISM, and evaluate the performance of GSP. We discuss the high I/O cost of GSP, particularly when the database contains long frequent sequences. To reduce the I/O requirement, we propose an algorithm MFS, which could be considered as a generalization of GSP. The general strategy of MFS is to first find an approximate solution to the set of frequent sequences and then perform successive refinement until the exact set of frequent sequences is obtained. We show that this successive refinement approach results in a significant improvement in I/O cost. We discuss how MFS can be applied to the incremental update problem. In particular, the result of a previous mining exercise can be used (by MFS) as a good initial approximate solution for the mining of an updated database. This results in an I/O efficient algorithm. To improve processing efficiency, we devise pruning techniques that, when coupled with GSP or MFS, result in algorithms that are both CPU and I/O efficient.

J	Salmenkivi, M; Mannila, H				Salmenkivi, M; Mannila, H			Using Markov chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming for event sequence data	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; dynamic programming; event sequence; MCMC		Sequences of events are a common type of data in various scientific and business applications, e.g. telecommunication network management, study of web access logs, biostatistics and epidemiology. A natural approach to modelling event sequences is using time-dependent intensity functions, indicating the expected number of events per time unit. In Bayesian modelling, piecewise constant functions can be utilized to model continuous intensities, if the number of segments is a model parameter. The reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods can be exploited in the data analysis. With very large quantities, these approaches may be too slow. We study dynamic programming algorithms for finding the best fitting piecewise constant intensity function, given a number of pieces. We introduce simple heuristics for pruning the number of the potential change points of the functions. Empirical evidence from trials on real and artificial data sets is provided, showing that the developed methods yield high performance and they can be applied to very large data sets. We also compare the RJMCMC and dynamic programming approaches and show that the results correspond closely. The methods are applied to fault-alarm sequences produced by large telecommunication networks.

This article focuses on the EM clustering algorithm. Two fundamental aspects are studied: achieving faster convergence and finding higher quality clustering solutions. This work introduces several improvements to the EM clustering algorithm, being periodic M steps during initial iterations, reseeding of low-weight clusters and splitting of high-weight clusters the most important. These improvements lead to two important parameters. The first parameter is the number of M steps per iteration and the second one, a weight threshold to reseed low-weight clusters. Experiments show how frequently the M step must be executed and what weight threshold values make EM reach higher quality solutions. In general, the improved EM clustering algorithm finds higher quality solutions than the classical EM algorithm and converges in fewer iterations.

It used conventional statistical and data mining techniques to identify customer voice patterns. To demonstrate results, we gathered actual customer complaints from the service operation of a target company. Using this data, the system pinpointed problematic areas where complaints happened (one-dimensional analysis), the relationship among problems (two-dimensional analysis), and the root cause of problems (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis).

Further challenges result from reduced power requirements, reduced transmission latency, and greater interconnect density. Optical interconnects may solve many of these problems with the added benefit extended reach. In addition, photonic interconnects provide relative EMI immunity which is becoming an increasing issue with a greater dependence on wireless connectivity. However, to be truly functional, the optical interconnect mesh should be able to support arbitration, addressing, etc. completely in the optical domain with a BER that is more stringent than "traditional" communication requirements. Outlined are challenges in the advanced computing environment, some possible optical architectures and relevant platform technologies, as well roughly sizing these opportunities which are quite large relative to the more "traditional" optical markets.

Cleaning and preprocessing of such data likely involves deduplication or linkage with other data, which is often challenged by a lack of unique entity identifiers. In recent years there has been an increased research effort in data linkage and deduplication, mainly in the machine learning and database communities. Publicly available test data with known deduplication or linkage status is needed so that new linkage algorithms and techniques can be tested, evaluated and compared. However, publication of data containing personal information is normally impossible due to privacy and confidentiality issues. An alternative is to use artificially created data, which has the advantages that content and error rates can be controlled, and the deduplication or linkage status is known. Controlled experiments can be performed and replicated easily. In this paper we present a freely available data set generator capable of creating data sets containing names, addresses and other personal information.

We propose a geographic data mining approach to detect generic aggregation patterns such as flocking behaviour and convergence in geospatial lifeline data. Our approach considers the object's motion properties in an analytical space as well as spatial constraints of the object's lifelines in geographic space. We discuss the geometric properties of the formalised patterns with respect to their efficient computation.

As such, they appear in both theoretical and practical problem settings related to closures that stem from fields as diverging as graph theory, database design and data mining. In FCA, though, they have been almost ignored, a fact that has motivated our long-term study of the underlying structures under different perspectives. This paper is a two-fold contribution to the study of mingen families associated to a context or, equivalently, a closure space. On the one hand, it sheds light on the evolution of the family upon increases in the context attribute set (e.g., for purposes of interactive data exploration). On the other hand, it proposes a novel method for computing the mingen family that, although based on incremental lattice construction, is intended to be run in a batch mode. Theoretical and empirical evidence witnessing the potential of our approach is provided.

The identification of such solution is an NP-hard problem. In this work, we propose a hybrid GRASP metaheuristic for the MDP that incorporates a data mining process. Data mining refers to the extraction of new and potentially useful knowledge from datasets in terms of patterns and rules. We believe that data mining techniques can be used to extract patterns that represent characteristics of sub-optimal solutions of a combinatorial optimization problem. Therefore these patterns can be used to guide the search for better solutions in metaheuristics procedures. Performance comparison between related work and the proposed hybrid heuristics is provided. Experimental results show that the new hybrid GRASP is quite robust and, mainly, this strategy is able to find high-quality solutions in less computational time.

We investigate SOMs for sequences and propose the SOM-S architecture for sequential data. Sequences of potentially infinite length are recursively processed by integrating the currently presented item and the recent map activation, as proposed in the SOMSD presented in (IEEE Trans. Neural Networks 14(3) (2003) 491). We combine that approach with the hyperbolic neighborhood of Ritter (Proceedings of PKDD-01, Springer, Berlin, 2001 pp. 338-349), in order to account for the representation of possibly exponentially increasing sequence diversification over time. Discrete and real-valued sequences can be processed efficiently with this method, as we will show in experiments. Temporal dependencies can be reliably extracted from a trained SOM. U-matrix methods, adapted to sequence processing SOMs, allow the detection of clusters also for real-valued sequence elements. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Then we discuss privacy-preserving data mining. In particular we view the privacy problem as a form of inference problem and introduce the notion of privacy constraints. We also describe an approach for privacy constraint processing and discuss its relationship to privacy-preserving data mining. Then we give an overview of the developments on privacy-preserving data mining that attempt to maintain privacy and at the same time extract useful information from data mining. Finally, some directions for future research on privacy as related to data mining are given.

This paper discusses the interaction techniques it uses for smooth visual exploration of thousands of time series. We also describe design decisions behind the application and lessons learned in creating ail application that makes do-it-yourself data mining popular. The prime lesson, it is hypothesized, is that an information visualization tool may be fruitfully viewed not as a tool but as part of an online social environment. In other words, to design a successful exploratory data analysis tool, one good strategy is to create a system that enables "social" data analysis.

However, they may execute for a long time for some difficult problems, because several fitness evaluations must be performed. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to parallelize these algorithms. In this paper, we propose to implement a parallel EA on consumer-level graphics cards. We perform experiments to compare our parallel EA with an ordinary EA and demonstrate that the former is much more effective than the latter. Since consumer-level graphics cards are available in ubiquitous personal computers and these computers are easy to use and manage, more people will be able to use our parallel algorithm to solve their problems encountered in real-world applications.

J	Yang, L				Yang, L			Pruning and visualizing generalized association rules in parallel coordinates	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						association rules; data visualization; data mining; interactive data exploration; mining methods and algorithms		One fundamental problem for visualizing frequent itemsets and association rules is how to present a long border of frequent itemsets in an itemset lattice. Another problem comes from the lack of an effective visual metaphor to represent many-to-many relationships. This paper proposes an approach for visualizing frequent itemsets and many-to-many association rules by a novel use of parallel coordinates. An association rule is visualized by connecting items in the rule, one item on each parallel coordinate, with continuous polynomial curves. In the presence of item taxonomy, each coordinate can be used to visualize an item taxonomy tree which can be expanded or shrunk by user interaction. This user interaction introduces a border, which separates displayable itemsets from nondisplayable ones, in the generalized itemset lattice. Only those itemsets that are both frequent and displayable are considered to be displayed. This approach of visualizing frequent itemsets and association rules has the following features: 1) It is capable of visualizing many-to-many rules and itemsets with many items. 2) It is capable of visualizing a large number of itemsets or rules by displaying only those ones whose items are selected by the user. 3) The closure properties of frequent itemsets and association rules are inherently supported such that the implied ones are not displayed. Usefulness of this approach is demonstrated through examples.

In this paper, a new algorithm for efficient generating large frequent candidate sets is proposed, which is called Matrix Algorithm. The algorithm generates a matrix which entries 1 or 0 by passing over the cruel database only once, and then the frequent candidate sets are obtained from the resulting matrix. Finally association rules are mined from the frequent candidate sets. Numerical experiments and comparison with the Apriori Algorithm are made on 4 randomly generated test problems with small, middle and large sizes. Experiments results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more effective than Apriori Algorithm.

This assumption is no longer tenable. Such methods waste computational and input/output (I/O) resources when data is dynamic, and they impose excessive communication overhead when data is distributed. Efficient implementation of incremental data mining methods is, thus, becoming crucial for ensuring system scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of the important task of frequent itemset mining: We first present an efficient algorithm which dynamically maintains the required information even in the presence of data updates without examining the entire dataset. We then show how to parallelize this incremental algorithm. We also propose a distributed asynchronous algorithm, which imposes minimal communication overhead. for mining distributed dynamic datasets. Our distributed approach is capable of generating local models (in which each site has a summary of its own database) as well as the global model of frequent itemsets (in which all sites have a summary of the entire database).

The primary motivation lies in the fact that approximate FDs represent potentially interesting patterns existent in a table. Their discovery is a valuable data mining problem. However, before algorithms can be developed, a measure must be defined quantifying their approximation degree. First we develop an approximation measure by axiomatizing the following intuition: the degree to which X --> Y is approximate in a table T is the degree to which T determines a function from Pi(X)(T) to Pi(Y)(T). We prove that a unique unnormalized measure satisfies these axioms up to a multiplicative constant. Next we compare the measure developed with two other measures from the literature. In all but one case, we show that the measures can be made to differ as much as possible within normalization. We examine these measure on several real datasets and observe that many of the theoretically possible extreme differences do not bear themselves out. We offer some conclusions as to particular situations where certain measures are more appropriate than others. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, one of their main drawbacks is the inherent replication of isomorphic subtrees, as a result of which the produced classifiers might become too large to be comprehensible by the human experts that have to validate them. Alternatively, decision diagrams, a generalization of decision trees taking on the form of a rooted, acyclic digraph instead of a tree, have occasionally been suggested as a potentially more compact representation. Their application in machine learning has nonetheless been criticized, because the theoretical size advantages of subgraph sharing did not always directly materialize in the relatively scarce reported experiments on real-world data. Therefore, in this paper, starting from a series of rule sets extracted from three real-life credit-scoring data sets, we will empirically assess to what extent decision diagrams are able to provide a compact visual description. Furthermore, we will investigate the practical impact of finding a good attribute ordering on the achieved size savings. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Schuster, A; Wolff, R				Schuster, A; Wolff, R			Communication-efficient distributed mining of association rules	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						association Rules; data mining; distributed algorithms; communication-efficient		Mining for associations between items in large transactional databases is a central problem in the field of knowledge discovery. When the database is partitioned among several share-nothing machines, the problem can be addressed using distributed data mining algorithms. One such algorithm, called CD, was proposed by Agrawal and Shafer and was later enhanced by the FDM algorithm of Cheung, Han et al. The main problem with these algorithms is that they do not scale well with the number of partitions. They are thus impractical for use in modern distributed environments such as peer-to-peer systems, in which hundreds or thousands of computers may interact. In this paper we present a set of new algorithms that solve the Distributed Association Rule Mining problem using far less communication. In addition to being very efficient, the new algorithms are also extremely robust. Unlike existing algorithms, they continue to be efficient even when the data is skewed or the partition sizes are imbalanced. We present both experimental and theoretical results concerning the behavior of these algorithms and explain how they can be implemented in different settings.

J	Angiulli, F; Ianni, G; Palopoli, L				Angiulli, F; Ianni, G; Palopoli, L			On the complexity of inducing categorical and quantitative association rules	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						computational complexity; data mining		Inducing association rules is one of the central tasks in data mining applications. Quantitative association rules induced from databases describe rich and hidden relationships to be found within data that can prove useful for various application purposes (e.g., market basket analysis, customer profiling, and others). Although association rules are quite widely used in practice, a thorough analysis of the related computational complexity is missing. This paper intends to provide a contribution in this setting. To this end, we first formally define quantitative association rule mining problems, which include boolean association rules as a special case; we then analyze computational complexity of such problems. The general problem as well as some interesting special cases are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fourier representation of a decision tree has several interesting properties that are particularly useful for mining data streams from small mobile computing devices connected through limited-bandwidth wireless networks. This paper presents algorithms to compute the Fourier spectrum of a decision tree and outlines a technique to construct a decision tree from its Fourier spectrum. It offers a framework to aggregate decision trees in their Fourier representations. It also describes the MobiMine, a mobile data stream mining system, that uses the developed techniques for mining stock-market data from handheld devices.

The distributed decision tree approach is applied to intrusion detection domain, the interest of which is recently increasing. In the approach, a network profile is built by applying a distributed data analysis method for the collection of data from distributed hosts. The method integrates inductive generalization and agent-based computing, so that classification rules are learned via: tree induction from distributed data to be used as intrusion profiles. Agents, in a collaborative fashion, generate partial trees and communicate the temporary results among them in the form of indices to the data records. Experimental results are presented for military network domain data used for the network intrusion detection in KDD cup 1999. Several experimental results show that the performance of distributed version of decision tree is much better than that of non-distributed version with data collected manually from distributed hosts.

High-throughput technologies are radically boosting the understanding of living systems, thus creating enormous opportunities to elucidate the biological processes of cells in different physiological states. In particular, the application of DNA microarrays to monitor expression profiles from tumor cells is improving cancer analysis to levels that classical methods have been unable to reach. However, molecular diagnostics based on expression profiling requires addressing computational issues as the overwhelming number of variables and the complex, multi-class nature of tumor samples. Thus, the objective of the present research has been the development of a computational procedure for feature extraction and classification of gene expression data. Methods. The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) approach has been implemented in a data mining scheme, which allows the identification of those genes that are most likely to confer robust and accurate classification of samples from multiple tumor types. Results: The proposed method has been tested on two different microarray data sets, namely Golub's analysis of acute human leukemia [1] and the small round blue cell tumors study presented by Khan et al. [2]. The identified features represent a rational and dimensionally reduced base for understanding the biology of diseases, defining targets of therapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for classification of pathological states. Conclusions: The analysis of the SIMCA model residuals allows the identification of specific phenotype markers. At the some time, the class analogy approach provides the assignment to multiple classes, such as different pathological conditions or tissue samples, for previously unseen instances.

This paper proposes a new practical application of data mining in the study of problems related to the Internet performance. Well-predicted performance is a key engineering issue in Internet based processing, e.g. in peer-to-peer systems. The measurements of round-trip-time performed by the traceroute probing technique are used for Internet path performance evaluation. We show how data mining can be used by the end-users to evaluate the performance of the communication path between their location and a specific Internet host in a long-term performance prediction scale. The mining data is mined using the IBM Intelligent Miner for Data system. We discover how the round-trip times of the packets and the number of hops they pass vary with the day of the week and the time of the measurement and use this knowledge to built the decision tree that can be a useful guide to the future characteristics of relevant properties of given Internet path in a long-term scale.

Manual configuration, while expensive and error-prone, is the dominant mode of operation, especially for large enterprise networks. These networks often lack the basic building blocks-an accurate equipment inventory, a debugged initial configuration, and a specification of local configuration policies-to support the holy grail of automation. We argue that migrating an existing network to automated configuration is a rich and challenging research problem rooted in data analysis and in the modeling of network protocols and operational practices. We propose a novel, bottom-up approach that proceeds in three phases: (i) analysis of configuration data to summarize the existing network state and uncover configuration problems; (ii) data mining to identify the network's local configuration policies and violations of these policies; and ultimately (iii) boot-strapping of a database to drive future configuration changes. The first stage reduces the number of errors, the second normalizes the local policies, and the third prevents new errors and reduces the manpower needed to configure the network. We describe the architecture of our EDGE tool for steps (I) and (ii), and present some examples from our experiences applying the tool to several large enterprise networks.

The first approach is based on saving the original rule set, induced by the LEM2 algorithm, and changing the rule strength for all rules for the smaller class (concept) during classification. In the second approach, rule induction was split: the rule set for the larger class was induced by LEM2, while the rule set for the smaller class was induced by EXPLORE, another data mining algorithm. Results of our experiments show that both approaches increase the sensitivity compared to the original LEM2. However, the difference in performance of both approaches is statistically insignificant. Thus the appropriate approach to dealing with imbalanced data sets should be selected individually for a specific data set.

Nowadays, different kinds of maps are used to emphasize the spatial distribution of one or more geo-spatial attributes. The nature of geo-spatial statistical data is the highly non-uniform distribution in the real world data sets. This has several impacts on the resulting map visualizations. Classical area maps tend to highlight patterns in large areas, which may, however, be of low importance. Cartographers and geographers used cartograms or value-by-area maps to address this problem long before computers were available. Although many automatic techniques have been developed, most of the value-by-area cartograms are generated manually via human interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique for geospatial data sets called RecMap. Our technique approximates a rectangular partition of the (rectangular) display area into a number of map regions preserving important geo-spatial constraints. It is a fully automatic technique with explicit user control over all exploration constraints within the exploration process. Experiments show that our technique produces visualizations of geo-spatial data sets, which enhance the discovery of global and local correlations, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of applications.

More specifically, the presence of an item in one transaction strongly implies the presence of every other item that belongs to the same hyperclique pattern. In this paper we present a new algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns, which are desirable for pattern-based clustering methods [11]. This algorithm exploits key advantages of both the Depth First Search (DFS) strategy and the Breadth First Search (BFS) strategy. Indeed, we adapt the equivalence pruning method, one of the most efficient pruning methods of the DFS strategy, into the process of the BFS strategy. As demonstrated by our experimental results, the performance of our algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms, particularly at low levels of support.

Privacy preserving data mining provides a means of addressing this issue, particularly if data mining is done in a way that doesn't disclose information beyond the result.

However, existing security mechanisms do not provide effective defense against these attacks, or the defense capability of some mechanisms is only limited to specific DDoS attacks. It is necessary to analyze the fundamental features of DDoS attacks because these attacks can easily vary the used port/protocol, or operation method. In this paper, we propose a combined data mining approach for modeling the traffic pattern of normal and diverse attacks. This approach uses the automatic feature selection mechanism for selecting the important attributes. And the classifier is built with the theoretically selected attribute through the neural network. And then, our experimental results show that our approach can provide the best performance on the real network, in comparison with that by heuristic feature selection and any other single data mining approaches.

Inspired by the success of supervised bagging algorithms, we propose a resampling scheme for integration of multiple independent clusterings. Individual partitions in the ensemble are sequentially generated by clustering specially selected subsamples of the given data set. In this paper, we compare the efficacy of both subsampling (sampling without replacement) and bootstrap (with replacement) techniques in conjunction with several fusion algorithms. The empirical study shows that a meaningful consensus partition for an entire set of data points emerges from multiple clusterings of subsamples of small size. The purpose of this paper is to show that small subsamples generally suffice to represent the structure of the entire data set in the framework of clustering ensembles. Subsamples of small size can reduce computational cost and measurement complexity for many unsupervised data mining tasks with distributed sources of data.

We compared the evaluation results by a medical expert and that by selected measures for the rules discovered from a dataset on hepatitis. Recall and chi(2) Measure 1 demonstrated the highest performance, and all measures showed different trends under our experimental conditions.

The CA performs feature selection and extraction by searching for feature weights and offsets maximizing cosine classifier performance. GA-selected feature weights determine the relevance of each feature to the classification task. This hybrid GA/classifier provides insight to a notoriously difficult problem in molecular biology, the correct treatment of water molecules mediating ligand binding to proteins. In distinguishing patterns of water conservation and displacement, this method achieves higher accuracy than previous techniques. The data mining capabilities of the hybrid system improve the understanding of the physical and chemical determinants governing favored protein-water binding.

J	Purdom, PW; Van Gucht, D; Groth, DP				Purdom, PW; Van Gucht, D; Groth, DP			Average-case performance of the Apriori Algorithm	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; algorithm analysis; Apriori Algorithm		The failure rate of the Apriori Algorithm is studied analytically for the case of random shoppers. The time needed by the Apriori Algorithm is determined by the number of item sets that are output (successes: item sets that occur in at least k baskets) and the number of item sets that are counted but not output (failures: item sets where all subsets of the item set occur in at least k baskets but the full set occurs in less than k baskets). The number of successes is a property of the data; no algorithm that is required to output each success can avoid doing work associated with the successes. The number of failures is a property of both the algorithm and the data. We find that under a wide range of conditions the performance of the Apriori Algorithm is almost as bad as is permitted under sophisticated worst-case analyses. In particular, there is usually a bad level with two properties: (1) it is the level where nearly all of the work is done, and (2) nearly all item sets counted are failures. Let l be the level with the most successes, and let the number of successes on level l be approximately ((m)(l)) for some m. Then, typically, the Apriori Algorithm has total output proportional to approximately ((m)(l)) and total work proportional to approximately ((m)(l+1)). In addition m is usually much larger than l, so the ratio of work to output is proportional to approximately m/(l+1). The analytical results for random shoppers are compared against measurements for three data sets. These data sets are more like the usual applications of the algorithm. In particular, the buying patterns of the various shoppers are highly correlated. For most thresholds, these data sets also have a bad level. Thus, under most conditions nearly all of the work done by the Apriori Algorithm consists in counting item sets that fail.

As a result techniques for extracting useful information from the data are developed. In particular, microarray technology has been applied to prediction and diagnosis of cancer, so that it expectedly helps us to exactly predict and diagnose cancer. To precisely classify cancer we have to select genes related to cancer because the genes extracted from microarray have many noises. In this paper, we attempt to explore seven feature selection methods and four classifiers and propose ensemble classifiers in three benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate the performances of the feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. Three benchmark datasets axe leukemia cancer dataset, colon cancer dataset and lymphoma cancer data set. The methods to combine the classifiers are majority voting, weighted voting, and Bayesian approach to improve the performance of classification. Experimental results show that the ensemble with several basis classifiers produces the best recognition rate on the benchmark datasets.

To accommodate the above problem, we propose a prefetching scheme that using the association rules from the data mining technique. The data mining technique can provide some priority information such as the support, confidence, and association rules which can be utilized for prefetching continuous media. Thus, using the data mining technique, the proposed prefetching policy can predict user behaviors and evaluate segments that may be accessed in near future. The proposed prefetching scheme was implemented and tested on synthetic data to estimate its effectiveness. Performance experiments show that the proposed prefetching scheme is effective in improving the latency reduction, even for small cache sizes.

Complex interaction effects among manufacturing equipment that lead to increased product variability have been detected. The extracted information has been confirmed by the process engineers, and used to improve the lithographic process. The paper suggests that decision tree induction may be particularly useful when data is multidimensional, and the various process parameters and machinery exhibit highly complex interactions. Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the manufacturing process (e.g., closed-loop critical dimensions control) using data mining may be highly effective.

J	Parthasarathy, S; Aggarwal, CC				Parthasarathy, S; Aggarwal, CC			On the use of conceptual reconstruction for mining massively incomplete data sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						incomplete data; missing values; data mining	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	Incomplete data sets have become almost ubiquitous in a wide variety of application domains. Common examples can be found in climate and image data sets, sensor data sets, and medical data sets. The incompleteness in these data sets may arise from a number of factors: In some cases, it may simply be a reflection of certain measurements not being available at the time, in others, the information may be lost due to partial system failure, or it may simply be a result of users being unwilling to specify attributes due to privacy concerns. When a significant fraction of the entries are missing in all of the attributes, it becomes very difficult to perform any kind of reasonable extrapolation on the original data. For such cases, we introduce the novel idea of conceptual reconstruction in which we create effective conceptual representations on which the data mining algorithms can be directly applied. The attraction behind the idea of conceptual reconstruction is to use the correlation structure of the data in order to express it in terms of concepts rather than the original dimensions. As a result, the reconstruction procedure estimates only those conceptual aspects of the data which can be mined from the incomplete data set, rather than force errors created by extrapolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of real data sets.

J	Nicholson, S				Nicholson, S			Bibliomining for automated collection development in a digital library setting: Using data mining to discover web-based scholarly research works	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This research creates an intelligent agent for automated collection development in a digital library setting. It uses a predictive model based on facets of each Web page to select scholarly works. The criteria came from the academic library selection literature, and a Delphi study was used to refine the list to 41 criteria. A Perl program was designed to analyze a Web page for each criterion and applied to a large collection of scholarly and nonscholarly Web pages. Bibliomining, or data mining for libraries, was then used to create different classification models. Four techniques were used: logistic regression, non-parametric discriminant analysis, classification trees, and neural networks. Accuracy and return were used to judge the effectiveness of each model on test datasets. In addition, a set of problematic pages that were difficult to classify because of their similarity to scholarly research was gathered and classified using the models. The resulting models could be used in the selection process to automatically create a digital library of Web-based scholarly research works. In addition, the technique can be extended to create a digital library of any type of structured electronic information.

Unique to TeraScope is its utilization of the Optiputer paradigm to treat distributed computer clusters as a single giant computer, where the dedicated optical networks that connect the clusters serve as the computer's system bus. TeraScope explores one aspect of the Optiputer architecture by employing a distributed pool of memory, called LambdaRAM, that serves as a massive data cache for supporting parallel data mining and visualization algorithms.

This technique, called Adaptive Fuzzy Partition (AFP), builds relationships between molecular descriptors and biochemical activities by dynamically dividing the descriptor hyperspace into a set of fuzzily partitioned subspaces. These subspaces are described by simple linguistic rules, from which scores ranging between 0 and I can be derived. The latter values define, for each compound, the degrees of membership of the different biological properties analyzed. The prediction ability of AFP was evaluated by analyzing a training set of 377 central nervous system (CNS)-active molecules subdivided into eight receptor classes. After selecting the most relevant descriptors by a procedure combining genetic algorithms and stepwise techniques, the best AFP model was selected and validated by a validation set. Furthermore, its robustness was confirmed by predicting a test set of 102 compounds never used to define the AFP models. Encouraging validation ratios of about 80% were obtained in the prediction of the experimental CNS activities. Finally, a comparison between the results obtained by AFP and by other classic techniques showed that AFP improved sensibly the prediction power of the proposed models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Zhang, ZL; Zhang, CQ; Zhang, SC				Zhang, ZL; Zhang, CQ; Zhang, SC			An agent-based hybrid framework for database mining	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SOFTWARE	While knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is defined as an iterative sequence of the following steps: data pre-processing, data mining, and post data mining, a significant amount of research in data mining has been done, resulting in a variety of algorithms and techniques for each step. However, a single data-mining technique has not been proven appropriate for every domain and data set. Instead, several techniques may need to be integrated into hybrid systems and used cooperatively during a particular data-mining operation. That is, hybrid solutions are crucial for the success of data mining. This paper presents a hybrid framework for identifying patterns from databases or multi-databases. The framework integrates these techniques for mining tasks from an agent point of view. Based on the experiments conducted, putting different KDD techniques together into the agent-based architecture enables them to be used cooperatively when needed. The proposed framework provides a highly flexible and robust data-mining platform and the resulting systems demonstrate emergent behaviors although it does not improve the performance of individual KDD techniques.

The new methodology combines the mixture likelihood approach with a sampling and subsampling strategy in order to cluster large data sets efficiently. This sampling strategy can be applied to a large variety of data mining methods to allow them to be used on very large data sets. The method is applied to the problem of automated star/galaxy classification for digital sky data and is tested using a sample from the Digitized Palomar Sky Survey (DPOSS) data. The method is quick and reliable and produces classifications comparable to previous work on these data using supervised clustering.

We consider here the application of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a mixture modelling problem of multivariate Gaussian distributions. Earlier work in MML mixture modelling includes the multinomial, Gaussian, Poisson, von Mises circular, and Student t distributions and in these applications all variables in a component are assumed to be uncorrelated with each other. In this paper, we propose a more general type of MML mixture modelling which allows the variables within a component to be correlated. Two MML approximations are used. These axe the Wallace and Freeman (1987) approximation and Dowe's MMLD approximation (2002). The former is used for calculating the relative abundances (mixing proportions) of each component and the latter is used for estimating the distribution parameters involved in the components of the mixture model. The proposed method is applied to the analysis of two real-world datasets - the well-known (Fisher) Iris and diabetes datasets. The modelling results are then compared with those obtained using two other modelling criteria, AIC and BIC (which is identical to Rissanen's 1978 MDL), in terms of their probability bit-costings, and show that the proposed MML method performs better than both these criteria. Furthermore, the MML method also infers more closely the three underlying Iris species than both AIC and BIC.

As a consequence of this result, we obtain quasi-polynomial time algorithms for generating all maximal integer feasible solutions for a given monotone system of separable inequalities, for generating all p-inefficient points of a given discrete probability distribution, and for generating all maximal empty hyper-rectangles for a liven set of points in R-n. This provides a substantial improvement over previously known exponential algorithms for these generation problems related to Integer and Stochastic Programming, and Data Mining. Furthermore, we give an incremental polynomial time generation algorithm for monotone systems with fixed number of separable inequalities, which, for the very special case of one inequality, implies that for discrete probability distributions with independent coordinates, both p-efficient and p-inefficient points can be separately generated in incremental polynomial time.

We present an application (PolyFARM) for distributed data mining in relational bioinformatics data, written in the lazy functional language Haskell. We describe the problem we wished to solve, the reasons we chose Haskell and relate our experiences. Laziness did cause many problems in controlling heap space usage, but these were solved by a variety of methods. The many advantages of writing software in Haskell outweighed these problems. These included clear expression of algorithms, good support for data structures, abstraction, modularity and generalisation leading to fast prototyping and code reuse, parsing tools, profiling tools, language features such as strong typing and referential transparency, and the support of an enthusiastic Haskell community.

A recent approach to enhance the computer access rights is the use of biometric properties as the keystroke rhythms of users. Therefore user authentication for computers can be more secure using keystroke rhythms as biometric authentication. Methods like minimum distance, statistical, vector based, neural network type and data mining techniques have been applied in analyzing the keystroke patterns. In this paper, a vector based algorithm for a recent approach has been applied in the identification of keystroke patterns. Keystroke Identification system that is a neuro physical characteristic is studied to realize biometric authentication.

In the substitution process, each instance containing missing values is compared with complete instances, and the closest instance is used to assign the attribute missing value. We evaluate this method in simulations performed in four datasets that are usually employed as benchmarks for data mining methods - Iris Plants, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes and Wine Recognition. First, we consider the substitution process as a prediction task. In this sense, we employ two metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan) to simulate substitutions both in original and normalized datasets. The obtained results were compared to those provided by a usually employed method to perform this task, i.e. substitution by the mean value. Based on these simulations, we propose a substitution procedure for the well-known K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Then, we perform clustering simulations, comparing the results obtained in the original datasets with the substituted ones. These results indicate that the proposed method is a suitable estimator for substituting missing values, i.e. it preserves the relationships between variables in the clustering process. Therefore, the proposed Nearest-Neigh or Method is an appropriate data preparation tool for the K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

Attributed graphs axe a natural model for the structured data in those applications. For the clustering and classification of such structured data, a similarity measure for attributed graphs is necessary. All known similarity measures for attributed graphs axe either limited to a special type of graph or computationally extremely complex, i.e. NP-complete, and are, therefore, unsuitable for data mining in large databases. In this paper, we present a new similarity measure for attributed graphs, called matching distance. We demonstrate, how the matching distance can be used for efficient similarity search in attributed graphs. Furthermore, we propose a filter-refinement architecture and an accompanying set of filter methods to reduce the number of necessary distance calculations during similarity search. Our experiments show that the matching distance is a meaningful similarity measure for attributed graphs and that it enables efficient clustering of structured data.

Decomposition methods are used to improve both criteria. As opposed to most decomposition methods, that partition the dataset via sampling, this paper presents an accuracy-oriented method that partitions the instance space into mutually exclusive subsets using K-means clustering algorithm. After employing the basic divide-and induce method on several datasets with different classifiers, its error rate is compared to that of the basic learning algorithm. An analysis of the results shows that the proposed method is well suited for datasets of numeric input attributes and that its performance is influenced by the dataset size and its homogeneity. Finally, a homogeneity threshold is developed, that can be used for deciding whether to decompose the data set or not.

Mining the datasets in the presence of context factors may improve performance and efficacy of data mining by identifying the unknown factors, which are not easily detectable in the process of generating an expected outcome. This paper proposes a Context-aware data mining framework, by which contexts will be automatically captured to maximize the adaptive capacity of data mining. Context could consist of any Circumstantial factors of the user and domain that may affect the data mining process. The factors that may affect the mining behavior are delineated and how each factor affects the behavior is discussed. It is also observed that a medical application of the model in wireless devices offers the advantages of Context-aware data mining. A Context-aware data mining framework is quantified through a partial implementation that would be used to test the behavior of the mining system under varied context factors. The results obtained from the implementation process are elucidated on how the prediction output or the behavior of the system changes from the similar set of inputs in view of different context factors.

New applications, e.g., Web recommendation systems, present the requirement for processing similarity queries in market basket databases. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for similarity search queries in basket data. We develop a new representation method, which, in contrast to existing approaches, is proven to provide correct results. New algorithms are proposed for the processing of similarity queries.

We show connectionist models can be used to learn software effort when the available data set is small. We use a connectionist model to learn software effort from a small training data set of several software projects and validate the model on a holdout sample. Several design issues associated with developing connectionist models on a small training data set are described. Our research indicates that connectionist models, whenever carefully designed, could help knowledge discovery and software effort estimation.

J	Estivill-Castro, V; Lee, I				Estivill-Castro, V; Lee, I			Multi-level clustering and its visualization for exploratory spatial analysis	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						clustering; data mining; exploratory spatial analysis; Delaunay diagram; cluster visualization		Exploratory spatial analysis is increasingly necessary as larger spatial data is managed in electro-magnetic media. We propose an exploratory method that reveals a robust clustering hierarchy from 2-D point data. Our approach uses the Delaunay diagram to incorporate spatial proximity. It does not require prior knowledge about the data set, nor does it require preconditions. Multi-level clusters are successfully discovered by this new method in only O(nlogn) time, where n is the size of the data set. The efficiency of our method allows us to construct and display a new type of tree graph that facilitates understanding of the complex hierarchy of clusters. We show that clustering methods adopting a raster-like or vector-like representation of proximity are not appropriate for spatial clustering. We conduct an experimental evaluation with synthetic data sets as well as real data sets to illustrate the robustness of our method.

J	Coppola, M; Vanneschi, M				Coppola, M; Vanneschi, M			High-performance data mining with skeleton-based structured parallel programming	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						high performance computing; structured parallel programming; skeletons; data mining; association rules; clustering; classification	ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHMS	We show how to apply a structured parallel programming (SPP) methodology based on skeletons to data mining (DM) problems, reporting several results about three commonly used mining techniques, namely association rules, decision tree induction and spatial clustering. We analyze the structural patterns common to these applications, looking at application performance and software engineering efficiency. Our aim is to clearly state what features a SPP environment should have to be useful for parallel DM. Within the skeleton-based PPE SHE that we have developed, we study the different patterns of data access of parallel implementations of Apriori, C4.5 and DBSCAN. We need to address large partitions reads, frequent and sparse access to small blocks, as well as an irregular mix of small and large transfers, to allow efficient development of applications on huge databases. We examine the addition of an object/component interface to the skeleton structured model, to simplify the development of environment-integrated, parallel DM applications.

In this paper, we introduce GBI for general graph structured data, which can handle directed/undirected, colored/uncolored graphs with/without (self) loop and with colored/uncolored links. We show that its time complexity is almost linear with the size of graph. We, further, show that GBI can effectively be applied to the extraction of typical patterns from DNA sequence data and organochlorine compound data from which are to be generated classification rules, and that GBI also works as a feature construction component for other machine learning tools.

In this paper we present the XMINE operator a tool we developed to extract XML association rules for XML documents;. The operator, that is based on XPath and inspired by the syntax of XQuery, allows us to express complex mining tasks; compactly and intuitively. XMINE can be used to specify indifferently (and simultaneously) mining tasks both on the content and on the structure of the data, since the distinction in XML is slight.

In [1] we proposed a methodology permitting the application of a classification tree on sequential raw data and the extraction of the rules having a temporal dimension. In this article, we propose a formalism based on temporal first logic-order and we review the main steps of the methodology through this theoretical frame. Finally, we present some solutions for a practical implementation.

Since they are not always defined in existing databases, algorithms need to be devised to discover foreign keys. One of the underlying problems is known to be the inclusion dependency (IND) inference problem. In this paper a new data mining algorithm for computing unary INDs is given. From unary INDs, we also propose a levelwise algorithm to discover all remaining INDs, where candidate INDs of size i + 1 are generated from satisfied INDs of size i, (i > 0). An implementation of these algorithms has been achieved and tested against synthetic databases. Up to our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address in a comprehensive manner this data mining problem, from algorithms to experimental results.

Our learning algorithm exploits both properties of the MDL-based score metric and a distributed, asynchronous, adaptive search technique called nagging. Nagging is intrinsically fault-tolerant, has dynamic load balancing features, and scales well. We demonstrate the viability, effectiveness, and scalability of our approach empirically with several experiments using networked machines. More specifically, we show that our distributed algorithm can provide optimal solutions for larger problems as well as good solutions for Bayesian networks of up to 150 variables.

In the following paper, we look at its use in combating some of the traditional issues faced with recommender systems. We discuss our ongoing work which aims to enhance the performance of PTV, an applied recommender system working in the TV listings domain. This system currently combines the results of separate user-based collaborative and case-based components to recommend programs to users. Our extension to this idea operates on the theory of developing a case-based view of the collaborative component itself. By using data mining techniques to extract relationships between programme items, we can address the sparsity/maintenance problem. We also adopt a unique approach to recommendation ranking which combines user similarities and item similarities to provide more effective recommendation orderings. Experimental results corroborate our ideas, demonstrating the effectiveness of data mining in improving recommender systems by providing similarity knowledge to address sparsity, both at user-based recommendation level and recommendation ranking level.

However, there are two major drawbacks of using current techniques for mining Web association patterns, namely, their inability to detect interesting negative associations in data and their failure to account for the impact of site structure on the support of a pattern. To address these issues, a new data mining technique called indirect association is applied to the Web click-stream data. The idea here is to find pairs of pages that are negatively associated with each other, but are positively associated with another set of pages called the mediator. These pairs of pages are said to be indirectly associated via their common mediator. Indirect associations are interesting patterns because they represent the diverse interests of Web users who share a similar traversal path. These patterns are not easily found using existing data mining techniques unless the groups of users are known a priori.

Our research is focused by a challenge problem involving the emergence of a crisis in an urban environment, brought on by a terrorist attack or other man-made or natural disaster. Me aim to develop methods aiding preparation and monitoring of the battlespace, deriving context from multiple sources of imagery (high-resolution visible and low-resolution hyperspectral) and signals (GMTI from moving vehicles, and ELINT from emitters). This context will serve as a foundation, in conjunction with existing knowledge nets, for exploring neural methods in higher-level information fusion supporting situation assessment and creation of a common operating picture (COP).

J	Girolami, M				Girolami, M			The topographic organization and visualization of binary data using multivariate-bernoulli latent variable models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						data clustering; data mining; data visualization; generative modeling; probabilistic modeling; self-organization; text document processing; unsupervised learning	MAPS	A nonlinear latent variable model for the topographic organization and subsequent visualization of multivariate binary data is presented. The generative topographic mapping (GTM) is a nonlinear factor analysis model for continuous data which assumes an isotropic Gaussian noise model and performs uniform sampling from a two-dimensional (2-D) latent space. Despite the success of the GTM when applied to continuous data the development of a similar model for discrete binary data has been hindered due, in part, to the nonlinear link function inherent in the binomial distribution which yields a log-likelihood that is nonlinear in the model parameters. This paper presents an effective method for the parameter estimation of a binary latent variable model-a binary version of the GTM-by adopting a variational approximation to the binomial likelihood. This approximation thus provides a log-likelihood which is quadratic in the model parameters and so obviates the necessity of an iterative M-step in the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The power of this method is demonstrated on two significant application domains, handwritten digit recognition and the topographic organization of semantically similar text-based documents.

J	Nikov, A; Stoeva, S				Nikov, A; Stoeva, S			Quick fuzzy backpropagation algorithm	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						neural networks; fuzzy logic; quasi-unsupervised teaming; adaptable interactive systems		A modification of the fuzzy backpropagation (FBP) algorithm called QuickFBP algorithm is proposed. where the computation of the net function is significantly quicker. It is proved that the FBP algorithm is of exponential time complexity, while the QuickFBP algorithm is of polynomial time complexity. Convergence conditions of the QuickFBP, resp, the FBP algorithm are defined and proved for: (1) single output neural networks in case of training patterns with different targets; and (2) multiple output neural networks in cast: of training patterns with equivalued target vector. They support the automation of the weights training process (quasi-unsupervised learning) establishing the target value(s) depending on the network's input values. In these cases the simulation results confirm the convergence of both algorithms. An example with a large-sized neural network illustrates the significantly greater training speed of the QuickFBP rather than the FBP algorithm. The adaptation of an interactive web system to users on the basis of the QuickFBP algorithm is presented. Since the QuickFBP algorithm ensures quasi-unsupervised learning, this implies its broad applicability in areas of adaptive and adaptable interactive systems, data mining, etc, applications.

Mobile agent programming is a paradigm that enables the programs to move from one host to another, do the processing locally and return results asynchronously. In this paper, we present the design and development of a mobile agent system that will provide a platform for developing mobile applications that are Mobile Agent Facility (MAF) specification compliant. We start by exploring mobile agent technology and establish its merits with respect to the client-server technology. Next, we introduce a concept called dynamic aggregation to improve the performance of mobile agent applications. We, then focus on the design and implementation issues of our system, Scalable, Mobile and Reliable Technology (SMART), which is based on the MAF specification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

In particular, this additional layer simultaneously supports more flexibility in specifying and maintaining temporal constraints on plans within an uncertain and changing execution environment, and the ability to understand and trace the progress of plan execution. It is shown how a representation based on single set of abstractions of temporal information can be used to characterize the reasoning underlying plan generation and execution interpretation. The complexity of such reasoning is discussed.

Many sophisticated web-based learning environments have been developed and are in use around the world. Educators, using these environments and tools, however, have veils little support to evaluate learners' activities and discriminate between different learner's on-line behaviours. In this paper, we exploit the existence of web access logs and advanced data mining techniques to extract useful patterns that can help educators and web masters evaluate and interpret on-line course activities in order to assess the learning process, track students actions and measure web course structure effectiveness.

In order to decide which people will receive the mailing, the potential customers are divided into two groups or classes (buyers and non-buyers) and a response model is created. Since the improvement of response modeling is the purpose of this paper, we suggest a combined approach of rule-induction and case-based reasoning. The initial classification of buyers and non-buyers is done by means of the CS-algorithm. To improve the ranking of the classified cases, we introduce in this research rule-predicted typicality.

The underlying idea is to granulate numeric data using fuzzy sets and afterwards reveal and quantify relationships between these granules. This naturally impacts the dimensionality of any original dataset under discussion and provides with its nonlinear (through the corresponding membership functions). These Information granules give rise to the notion of associations - multidimensional information granules. Being fuzzy relations, these constructs are direction fi ee. The directionality arises when one defines inputs and outputs and in this way confines himself to some sort of rules capturing a directional nature of main relationships within the data. Rules arising from associations may be in conflict. The essence of data is then captured via a granular signature regarded as a mixture of associations and rules.

First, we devise an algorithm to capture the frequent user moving patterns from a set of log data in a mobile environment. Then, in light of mining results of user moving patterns and the properties of data objects, we develop data allocation schemes for proper allocation of personal data. Two personal data allocation schemes, which explore different levels of mining results, are devised: one utilizes the set level of moving patterns and the other utilizes the path level of moving patterns. Performance of these data allocation schemes is comparatively analyzed. It is shown by our simulation results that the user moving patterns is very important in devising effective data allocation schemes,which can lead to significant performance improvement in a mobile computing system.

The user specifies a high level abstraction view of the system using a structured pattern language. A pattern matching engine provides an optimal match between the given pattern and a decomposition of the legacy system entities by satisfying the inter/intramodule constraints defined by the pattern. The data mining technique Apriori is used by the matching engine to reveal meaningful data and control flow properties of the target system and limit the search space. A branch and bound search algorithm using a score function, models the constraints in the pattern as a Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP), and assists in searching far an optimal match between the given pattern and the target system.

While several analog implementations are proposed we suggest a digital implementation in an existing environment, the connected network of adapted processors system (CNAPS), The reason for this is two fold. First, CNAPS is a commericially available chip which has been used for several neural-network implementations. Second, the PCNN is, in almost all applications, a very efficient component of a system requiring subsequent and additional processing. This may include gating, Fourier transforms, neural classifiers, data mining, etc, with or without feedback to the PCNN.

In a world that is rapidly changing, the standard view of a digital library as a data repository specialized to a community of users and provided with some search tools is no longer tenable. To be effective, a digital library should be an active digital library, meaning that users can process available data not just to retrieve a particular piece of information, but to infer new knowledge about the data at hand. Digital Puglia is a new project, conceived to emphasize not only retrieval of data to the client's workstation, but also customized processing of the data. Such processing tasks may include data mining, filtering and knowledge discovery in huge databases, compute-intensive image processing (such as principal component analysis, supervised classification, or pattern matching) and on demand computing sessions.

The SAW-ing mechanism has been originally developed for and successfully used in EAs for constraint satisfaction problems. Here we identify the very basic underlying ideas behind SAW-ing and point out how it can be used for different types of problems. In particular, SAW-ing is well-suited for data mining tasks where the fitness of a candidate solution is composed by 'local scores' on data records. We evaluate the power of the SAW-ing mechanism on a number of benchmark classification data sets. The results indicate that extending the GP with the SAW-ing feature increases its performance when different types of misclassifications are not weighted differently, but leads to worse results when they are.

Correlations between process data and past faults were extracted and then programmed into an on-line predictive software model which is able to analyse current process data in real time, looking for bad patterns which may lead to defects in the paper. Depending on the degree of severity of defect that the model predicts, and the nature of the developing problem, the machine operators can take steps to prevent the defect from becoming so significant as to result in salvage. This article describes the way the application was developed and shows how data mining can be successfully applied to the paper industry. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Competition requires timely and sophisticated analysis on an integrated view, of that data. However, there has been a growing gap between more powerful data warehousing systems and the users' ability to effectively analyze and act on the information they contain. Data mining tools and services are providing the leap necessary to close this gap. Data mining offers automated discovery of previously unknown patterns as well as automated prediction of trends and behaviors; its technologies are complimentary to existing decision support tools and provide the business analyst and marketing professional with a new way of analyzing the business. After a general introduction of the knowledge discovery lifecycle and the data mining lifecycle, this article examines the data mining issues and requirements within an enterprise. A comprehensive architectural overview proposes data mining integration solutions for data warehouses, application servers, thick clients, and thin clients. This article concludes with an analysis of current trends relevant to enterprise usage of data mining tools and methodologies.									0	8	8	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1060-3425	0-8186-8255-8	P ANN HICSS			1998							295	304				10	Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management	Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics	BK43J	WOS:000072158800033

This concept is used in the algorithmic, combinatorial approach to knowledge discovery and data mining. We consider the complexity aspects of frequent sets. An explicit family of subsets is given that requires exponentially many rows to be represented as the family of frequent sets of a matrix, with any threshold. Examples are given of families that can be represented by a small matrix with threshold t, but that require a significantly larger matrix if the threshold is less than t. We also discuss the connections of these problems to circuit complexity and the existence of efficient listing algorithms.

This has led to the birth of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining-a process that has the goal to selectively extract knowledge from data. A range of techniques, including neural networks, rule-based systems, case-based reasoning, machine learning, statistics, etc. can be applied to the problem. We discuss the use of concept lattices, to determine dependences in the data mining process. We first define concept lattices, after which we show how they represent knowledge and how they are formed from raw data. Finally, we show how the lattice-based technique addresses different processes in KDD, especially visualization and navigation of discovered knowledge. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In particular, extracting image content is emerging as one of the most powerful tools to perform data mining. One of the most promising methods to extract image content is image classification, which provides a labeling of each pixel in the image. In this paper, we concentrate on neural network classifiers and show how information obtained through a wavelet transform can be integrated in such a classifier. After a systematic dimensionality reduction by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, we apply a local spatial frequency analysis. This local analysis with a composite edge/texture wavelet transform provides statistical texture information of the Landsat imagery testset. The network is trained with both radiometric Landsat/Thematic Mapper (TM) bands and with the additional texture bands provided by the wavelet analysis. The paper describes the type of wavelets chosen for this application, and several sets of results are presented.

This can lead to companies becoming 'data rich and information poor'. This paper describes how BT has used data mining techniques to convert volume data into high-value information which can be used to aid decision making in a number of key business processes. The benefit of actively using data, as opposed to passively storing it, is demonstrated via a number of case studies which cover areas as diverse as fault diagnosis, fraud detection, market segmentation, credit vetting and litigation assessment.

J	Min, F; Zhu, W				Min, Fan; Zhu, William			Attribute reduction of data with error ranges and test costs	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Cost-sensitive learning; Test cost; Error range; Neighborhood; Covering rough set	GENERALIZED ROUGH SETS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DECISION SYSTEMS; MODEL; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHMS; COVERINGS; TREES; TABLE	In data mining applications, we have a number of measurement methods to obtain a data item with different test costs and different error ranges. Test costs refer to time, money, or other resources spent in obtaining data items related to some object; observational errors correspond to differences in measured and true value of a data item. In supervised learning, we need to decide which data items to obtain and which measurement methods to employ, so as to minimize the total test cost and help in constructing classifiers. This paper studies this problem in four steps. First, data models are built to address error ranges and test costs. Second, error-range-based covering rough set is constructed to define lower and upper approximations, positive regions, and relative reducts. A closely related theory deals with neighborhood rough set, which has been successfully applied to heterogeneous attribute reduction. The major difference between the two theories is the definition of neighborhood. Third, the minimal test cost attribute reduction problem is redefined in the new theory. Fourth, both backtrack and heuristic algorithms are proposed to deal with the new problem. The algorithms are tested on ten UCI (University of California - Irvine) datasets. Experimental results show that the backtrack algorithm is efficient on rational-sized datasets, the weighting mechanism for the heuristic information is effective, and the competition approach can improve the quality of the result significantly. This study suggests new research trends concerning attribute reduction and covering rough set. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data mining technique for automated diagnosis of glaucoma using higher order spectra and wavelet energy features	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Glaucoma; Retina imaging; Computer aided diagnosis; Higher order spectra; Wavelet; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; OPTIC-NERVE HEAD; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DIGITAL FUNDUS IMAGES; VISUAL-FIELD DATA; MEDICAL IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; RETINA; ALGORITHMS	Eye images provide an insight into important parts of the visual system, and also indicate the health of the entire human body. Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness. It is a disease in which fluid pressure in the eye increases gradually, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss. Robust mass screening may help to extend the symptom-free life for the affected patients. The retinal optic nerve fiber layer can be assessed using optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry (SLP), and Heidelberg Retina Tomography (HRT) scanning methods. These methods are expensive and hence a novel low cost automated glaucoma diagnosis system using digital fundus images is proposed. The paper discusses the system for the automated identification of normal and glaucoma classes using Higher Order Spectra (HOS) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features. The extracted features are fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear, polynomial order 1, 2, 3 and Radial Basis Function (RBF) to select the best kernel function for automated decision making. In this work, SVM classifier with kernel function of polynomial order 2 was able to identify the glaucoma and normal images automatically with an accuracy of 95%, sensitivity and specificity of 93.33% and 96.67% respectively. Finally, we have proposed a novel integrated index called Glaucoma Risk Index (GRI) which is made up of HOS and DWT features, to diagnose the unknown class using a single feature. We hope that this GRI will aid clinicians to make a faster glaucoma diagnosis during the mass screening of normal/glaucoma images. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tsai, HH				Tsai, Hsu-Hao			Global data mining: An empirical study of current trends, future forecasts and technology diffusions	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Research trends and forecasts; Technology diffusions; Bibliometric methodology	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOTKA LAW; SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY; BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION	Using a bibliometric approach, this paper analyzes research trends and forecasts of data mining from 1989 to 2009 by locating heading "data mining" in topic in the SSCI database. The bibliometric analytical technique was used to examine the topic in SSCI journals from 1989 to 2009, we found 1181 articles with data mining. This paper implemented and classified data mining articles using the following eight categories publication year, citation, country/territory, document type, institute name, language, source title and subject area for different distribution status in order to explore the differences and how data mining technologies have developed in this period and to analyze technology tendencies and forecasts of data mining under the above results. Also, the paper performs the K-S test to check whether the analysis follows Lotka's law. Besides, the analysis also reviews the historical literatures to come out technology diffusions of data mining. The paper provides a roadmap for future research, abstracts technology trends and forecasts, and facilitates knowledge accumulation so that data mining researchers can save some time since core knowledge will be concentrated in core categories. This implies that the phenomenon "success breeds success" is more common in higher quality publications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many methods have been described in the literature to identify TIS in transcribed sequences such as mRNA, EST and cDNA sequences. However, the recognition of TIS in DNA sequences is a far more challenging task, and the methods described so far for transcripts achieve poor results in DNA sequences. Most methods approach this problem taking into account its biological characteristics. in this work we try a different view, considering this classification problem from a purely machine learning perspective. From the point of view of machine learning, TIS recognition is a class imbalance problem. Thus, in this paper we approach TIS recognition from this angle, and apply the different methods that have been developed to deal with imbalanced datasets. The proposed approach has two advantages. Firstly, it improves the results using standard classification methods. Secondly, it broadens the set of classification algorithms that can be used, as some of the class-imbalance methods, such as undersampling, are also useful as methods for scaling up data mining algorithms as they reduce the size of the dataset. In this way, classifiers that cannot be applied to the whole dataset, due to long training time or large memory requirements, can be used when undersampling method is applied. Results show an advantage of class imbalance methods with respect to the same methods applied without considering the class imbalance nature of the problem. The applied methods are also able to improve the results obtained with the best method in the literature, which is based on looking for the next in-frame stop codon from the putative TIS that must be predicted.

Shannon's entropy and its variants have been applied to measure uncertainty in rough set theory from the viewpoint of information theory. However, few studies have been carried out on information-theoretical measure of attribute importance in incomplete decision system (IDS) considering the relation between decision attribute and condition attributes. In this paper, we introduce the concept of conditional entropy together with entropy and joint entropy in IDSs. By using the new conditional entropy, we propose a measure for attribute importance. Based on the measure, a heuristic attribute reduction algorithm is presented. Some test experiments on real-lift data-sets show the effectiveness of the algorithm. The attribute importance measure and the attribute reduction algorithm can be used in data mining or machine learning for handling incomplete data.

By studying these series of images we can both understand the changes of specific areas and discover global phenomena that spread over larger areas. Changes that can occur throughout the sensing time can spread over very long periods and may have different start time and end time depending on the location, which complicates the mining and the analysis of series of images. This work focuses on frequent sequential pattern mining (FSPM) methods, since this family of methods fits the above-mentioned issues. This family of methods consists of finding the most frequent evolution behaviors, and is actually able to extract long-term changes as well as short term ones, whenever the change may start and end. However, applying FSPM methods to SITS implies confronting two main challenges, related to the characteristics of SITS and the domain's constraints. First, satellite images associate multiple measures with a single pixel (the radiometric levels of different wavelengths corresponding to infra-red, red, etc.), which makes the search space multi-dimensional and thus requires specific mining algorithms. Furthermore, the non evolving regions, which are the vast majority and overwhelm the evolving ones, challenge the discovery of these patterns. We propose a SITS mining framework that enables discovery of these patterns despite these constraints and characteristics. Our proposal is inspired from FSPM and provides a relevant visualization principle. Experiments carried out on 35 images sensed over 20 years show the proposed approach makes it possible to extract relevant evolution behaviors.

The Combinatorial BLAS: design, implementation, and applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Betweenness centrality; combinatorial BLAS; combinatorial scientific computing; graph analysis; Markov clustering; mathematical software; parallel graph library; software framework; sparse matrices	BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; MAPREDUCE; WORLD	This paper presents a scalable high-performance software library to be used for graph analysis and data mining. Large combinatorial graphs appear in many applications of high-performance computing, including computational biology, informatics, analytics, web search, dynamical systems, and sparse matrix methods. Graph computations are difficult to parallelize using traditional approaches due to their irregular nature and low operational intensity. Many graph computations, however, contain sufficient coarse-grained parallelism for thousands of processors, which can be uncovered by using the right primitives. We describe the parallel Combinatorial BLAS, which consists of a small but powerful set of linear algebra primitives specifically targeting graph and data mining applications. We provide an extensible library interface and some guiding principles for future development. The library is evaluated using two important graph algorithms, in terms of both performance and ease-of-use. The scalability and raw performance of the example applications, using the Combinatorial BLAS, are unprecedented on distributed memory clusters.

Multiple instance learning provides a more suitable and optimized representation that is adapted to available information of each student and course eliminating the missing values that make difficult to find efficient solutions when traditional supervised learning is used. To check the efficiency of the new proposed representation, the most popular techniques of traditional supervised learning based on single instances are compared to those based on multiple instance learning. Computational experiments show that when the problem is regarded as a multiple instance one, performance is significantly better and the weaknesses of single-instance representation are overcome.

However, the rapid change in modern knowledge due to exponential growth of information sources is complicating learners' activity. At the same time, new technologies offer, if used in a right way, a range of possibilities for the efficient design of learning scenarios. For that reason, novel approaches are necessary to obtain suitable learning solutions which are able to generate efficient, personalized, and flexible learning experiences. From this point of view, computational intelligence methodologies can be exploited to provide efficient and intelligent tools to be able to analyze learner's needs and preferences and, consequently, personalize its knowledge acquirement. This paper reports an attempt to achieve these results by exploiting an ontological representation of learning environment and an adaptive memetic approach, integrated into a cooperative multi-agent framework. In particular, a collection of agents analyzes learner preferences and generate high-quality learning presentations by executing, in a parallel way, different cooperating optimization strategies. This cooperation is performed by jointly exploiting data mining via fuzzy decision trees, together with a decision-making framework exploiting fuzzy methodologies.

These problems limit the scope of application of the two methods. In this paper, we develop a novel fast two-stage spectral clustering framework with local and global consistency. Under this framework, we propose a Fast density-Weighted low-rank Approximation Spectral Clustering (FWASC) algorithm to address the above issues. The proposed algorithm is a high-quality graph partitioning method, and simultaneously considers both the local and global structure information contained in the data sets. Specifically, we first present a new Fast Two-Stage AP (FTSAP) algorithm to coarsen the input sparse graph and produce a small number of final representative exemplars, which is a simple and efficient sampling scheme. Then we present a density-weighted low-rank approximation spectral clustering algorithm to operate those representative exemplars on the global underlying structure of data manifold. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art spectral clustering and original AP algorithms in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality.	[Shang, Fanhua; Jiao, L.

Combinatorics, Isomers, Product Distributions, and Data Mining	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; SUBSTITUTED PHTHALOCYANINES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CHEMICAL LIBRARIES; CLICK CHEMISTRY; PHASE SYNTHESIS; PORPHYRINS; ENUMERATION; DERIVATIVES; PYRROLES	A software program (PorphyrinViLiGe) has been developed to enumerate the type and relative amounts of substituted tetrapyrrole macrocycles in a virtual library formed by one of four different classes of reactions. The classes include (1) 4-fold reaction of n disubstituted heterocycles (e.g., pyrroles or diiminoisoindolines) to form beta-substituted porphyrins, beta-substituted tetraazaporphyrins, or alpha- or beta-substituted phthalocyanines; (2) combination of m aminoketones and n diones to form m x n pyrroles, which upon 4-fold reaction give beta-substituted porphyrins; (3) derivatization of an 8-point tetrapyrrole scaffold with n reagents, and (4) 4-fold reaction of n aldehydes and pyrrole to form meso-substituted porphyrins. The program accommodates variable ratios of reactants, reversible or irreversible reaction (reaction classes 1 and 2), and degenerate modes of formation. Polya's theorem (for enumeration of cyclic entities) has also been implemented and provides validation for reaction classes 3 and 4. The output includes the number and identity of distinct reaction-accessible substituent combinations, the number and identity of isomers thereof, and the theoretical mass spectrum. Provisions for data mining enable assessment of the number of products having a chosen pattern of substituents. Examples include derivatization of an octa-substituted phthalocyanine with eight reagents to afford a library of 2,099,728 members (yet only 6435 distinct substituent combinations) and reversible reaction of six distinct disubstituted pyrroles to afford 2649 members (yet only 126 distinct substituent combinations). In general, libraries of substituted tetrapyrrole macrocycles occupy a synthetically accessible region of chemical space that is rich in isomers (> 99% or 95% for the two examples, respectively).

J	Wassermann, AM; Bajorath, J				Wassermann, Anne Mai; Bajorath, Juergen			A Data Mining Method To Facilitate SAR Transfer	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY	A challenging practical problem in medicinal chemistry is the transfer of SAR information from one chemical series to another. Currently, there are no computational methods available to rationalize or support this process. Herein, we present a data mining approach that enables the identification of alternative analog series with different core structures, corresponding substitution patterns, and comparable potency progression. Scaffolds can be exchanged between these series and new analogs suggested that incorporate preferred R-groups. The methodology can be applied to search for alternative analog series if one series is known or, alternatively, to systematically assess SAR transfer potential in compound databases.

In such situations, a single method or one-step mining is often limited in discovering informative knowledge. It would also be very time and space consuming, if not impossible, to join relevant large data sources for mining patterns consisting of multiple aspects of information. It is crucial to develop effective approaches for mining patterns combining necessary information from multiple relevant business lines, catering for real business settings and decision-making actions rather than just providing a single line of patterns. The recent years have seen increasing efforts on mining more informative patterns, e. g., integrating frequent pattern mining with classifications to generate frequent pattern-based classifiers. Rather than presenting a specific algorithm, this paper builds on our existing works and proposes combined mining as a general approach to mining for informative patterns combining components from either multiple data sets or multiple features or by multiple methods on demand. We summarize general frameworks, paradigms, and basic processes for multifeature combined mining, multisource combined mining, and multimethod combined mining. Novel types of combined patterns, such as incremental cluster patterns, can result from such frameworks, which cannot be directly produced by the existing methods. A set of real-world case studies has been conducted to test the frameworks, with some of them briefed in this paper. They identify combined patterns for informing government debt prevention and improving government service objectives, which show the flexibility and instantiation capability of combined mining in discovering informative knowledge in complex data.

Unsupervised Spatiotemporal Mining of Satellite Image Time Series Using Grouped Frequent Sequential Patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Data mining; satellite image time series (SITS); spatiotemporal analysis; unsupervised information extraction	SAR IMAGES	An important aspect of satellite image time series is the simultaneous access to spatial and temporal information. Various tools allow end users to interpret these data without having to browse the whole data set. In this paper, we intend to extract, in an unsupervised way, temporal evolutions at the pixel level and select those covering at least a minimum surface and having a high connectivity measure. To manage the huge amount of data and the large number of potential temporal evolutions, a new approach based on data-mining techniques is presented. We have developed a frequent sequential pattern extraction method adapted to that spatiotemporal context. A successful application to crop monitoring involving optical data is described. Another application to crustal deformation monitoring using synthetic aperture radar images gives an indication about the generic nature of the proposed approach.

We develop a compact representation called "tiny videos" that achieves high video compression rates while retaining the overall visual appearance of the video as it varies over time. We show that frame sampling using affinity propagation-an exemplar-based clustering algorithm-achieves the best trade-off between compression and video recall. We use this large collection of user-labeled videos in conjunction with simple data mining techniques to perform related video retrieval, as well as classification of images and video frames. The classification results achieved by tiny videos are compared with the tiny images framework [24] for a variety of recognition tasks. The tiny images data set consists of 80 million images collected from the Internet. These are the largest labeled research data sets of videos and images available to date. We show that tiny videos are better suited for classifying scenery and sports activities, while tiny images perform better at recognizing objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining the tiny images and tiny videos data sets improves classification precision in a wider range of categories.

J	Su, CT; Lin, HC				Su, Chao-Ton; Lin, Hung-Chun			Applying electromagnetism-like mechanism for feature selection	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM); Electromagnetism theory; Optimization; Feature selection; 1-Nearest-neighbor (1NN); Classification	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE; LATINO WOMEN; TABU SEARCH; ROUGH SETS; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; VECTOR; PERFORMANCE	In recent years, methods of feature selection have been increasingly emphasized as venues for reducing cost and shortening the length of time required for computation in data mining. This study utilizes electromagnetism-like mechanism as a wrapper approach to feature selection. Birbil and Fang proposed EM in 2003. EM uses the attraction-repulsion mechanism of the electromagnetism theory to ascertain the optimal solution. Although EM has been applied to the topic of optimization in continuous space and a small number of studies on discrete problems, it has not been applied to the subject of feature selection. In this study, EM combined with 1-nearest-neighbor (1NN) was applied for feature selection and classification. This study utilized the total force exerted on a particle and evaluated this force to determine which features are to be selected. The most crucial features were selected according to the proposed method based on the minimum miss-classification rate, which was attained through 1NN. An unknown datum was classified by 1NN based on the chosen reduced model. To estimate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a numerical experiment was conducted using several data sets with diverse sizes, features, separability, and classes. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method outperformed other well-known algorithms in not only balanced classification accuracy but also efficiency of feature selection. Lastly, this study used an actual case concerning gestational diabetes mellitus to demonstrate the workability of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data Analysis and Data Mining: Current Issues in Biomedical Informatics	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Biomedical informatics; data mining; data analysis; data-driven methods; translational bioinformatics	INTELLIGENT DATA-ANALYSIS; IN-SILICO BIOLOGY; DECISION-SUPPORT; TRANSLATIONAL BIOINFORMATICS; BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MEDICAL INFORMATICS; DATA INTEGRATION; PATIENT RECORDS; MICROARRAY DATA	Background: Medicine and biomedical sciences have become data-intensive fields, which, at the same time, enable the application of data-driven approaches and require sophisticated data analysis and data mining methods. Biomedical informatics provides a proper interdisciplinary context to integrate data and knowledge when processing available information, with the aim of giving effective decision-making support in clinics and translational research. Objectives: To reflect on different perspectives related to the role of data analysis and data mining in biomedical informatics. Methods: On the occasion of the 50th year of Methods of Information in Medicine a symposium was organized, which reflected on opportunities, challenges and priorities of organizing, representing and analysing data, information and knowledge in biomedicine and health care. The contributions of experts with a variety of backgrounds in the area of biomedical data analysis have been collected as one outcome of this symposium, in order to provide a broad, though coherent, overview of some of the most interesting aspects of the field. Results: The paper presents sections on data accumulation and data-driven approaches in medical informatics, data and knowledge integration, statistical issues for the evaluation of data mining models, translational bioinformatics and bioinformatics aspects of : genetic epidemiology. Conclusions: Biomedical informatics represents a natural framework to properly and effectively apply data analysis and data mining methods in a decision-making context. In the future, it will be necessary to preserve the inclusive nature of the field and to foster an increasing sharing of data and methods between researchers.

This is done by spatial partitioning of the population into several semi-isolated nodes, each evolving in parallel and possibly exploring different regions of the search space. The presented algorithm shows some advantages when compared with other distributed algorithms proposed in the specific literature. In this way, some results are presented showing significant learning rate speedup without compromising the accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analyzing the characterizations of repeat-buying is necessary to understand and adapt to dynamics of customer behaviors for company to survive in a continuously changing environment. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology to detect the existence of repeat-buying behavior and discover the potential period of the repeat-buying behavior. We propose a new mathematical model to capture the characteristics of repeat-buying behavior. The algorithms based on our previous works then proposed to provide a scheme to discover periodicity and trends of the purchase. Two fundamental repeat-buying types have been identified and analyzed. Any repeat-buying scenarios can be expressed as the combination of the two fundamental types. The proposed mathematical model coupled with our prior works on cyclic modeling form a systematic process to uncover the characteristics of repeat-buying phenomenon. The experiments against a domestic consumer goods company are provided. The experimental results show that the proposed model can predict likely periodic purchase more precisely than previous studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper is the first work to address skyline queries over distributed data streams, where streams derive from multiple horizontally split data sources. Skyline query returns a set of interesting objects which are not dominated by any other objects within the base dataset. Previous work is concentrated on skyline computations over static data or centralized data streams. We present an efficient and an effective algorithm called BOCS to handle this issue under a more challenging environment of distributed streams. BOCS consists of an efficient centralized algorithm GridSky and an associated communication protocol. Based on the strategy of progressive refinement in BOCS, the skyline is incrementally computed by two phases. In the first phase, local skylines on remote sites are maintained by GridSky. At each time, only skyline increments on remote sites are sent to the coordinator. In the second phase, a global skyline is obtained by integrating remote increments with the latest global skyline. A theoretical analysis shows that BOCS is communication-optimal among all algorithms which use a share-nothing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposals are efficient, scalable, and stable.

J	Delen, D				Delen, Dursun			A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Retention management; Student attrition; Classification; Prediction; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PERSISTENCE; MODEL; INTEGRATION; ATTRITION	Student retention is an essential part of many enrollment management systems. It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, TY; Chen, YG; Han, JW				Wu, Tianyi; Chen, Yuguo; Han, Jiawei			Re-examination of interestingness measures in pattern mining: a unified framework	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Association rules; Frequent pattern; Interestingness measure; Null-invariant measure; Generalized mean	ASSOCIATIONS	Numerous interestingness measures have been proposed in statistics and data mining to assess object relationships. This is especially important in recent studies of association or correlation pattern mining. However, it is still not clear whether there is any intrinsic relationship among many proposed measures, and which one is truly effective at gauging object relationships in large data sets. Recent studies have identified a critical property, null-(transaction) invariance, for measuring associations among events in large data sets, but many measures do not have this property. In this study, we re-examine a set of null-invariant interestingness measures and find that they can be expressed as the generalized mathematical mean, leading to a total ordering of them. Such a unified framework provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps us understand and select the proper measure for different applications. Moreover, we propose a new measure called Imbalance Ratio to gauge the degree of skewness of a data set. We also discuss the efficient computation of interesting patterns of different null-invariant interestingness measures by proposing an algorithm, GAMiner, which complements previous studies. Experimental evaluation verifies the effectiveness of the unified framework and shows that GAMiner speeds up the state-of-the-art algorithm by an order of magnitude.

Healthcare professionals are constantly looking for ways to improve the ease of diagnosis and comfort for this kind of patients as well as reducing both the number of sleep studies they need to undergo and the waiting times. Relating to this scenario, some research proposals and commercial products are appearing, but all of them record the physiological data of patients to portable devices and, in the morning, these data are loaded into hospital computers where physicians analyze them by making use of specialized software. In this paper, we present an alternative proposal that promotes not only a transmission of physiological data but also a real-time analysis of these data locally at a mobile device. For that, we have built a classifier that provides an accuracy of 93% and a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 98.5% on SpO(2) signals available in the annotated Apnea-ECG Database. This local analysis allows the detection of anomalous situations as soon as they are generated. The classifier has been implemented taking into consideration the restricted resources of mobile devices.

Orthogonal NMF which imposes orthogonality constraints; on the factor matrices can improve clustering performance. However, the existing orthogonal NMF algorithms are either computationally expensive or have to incorporate prior information to achieve orthogonality. In our research, we propose an algorithm called Nonnegative Matrix Factorization on Orthogonal Subspace (NMFOS), in which the generation of orthogonal factor matrices is part of objective function minimization. Thus, orthogonality is achieved without resorting to additional constraints, and the computational complexity is decreased. We develop two algorithms based on the Euclidean distance metric and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, respectively. Experiments on 10 document datasets show that NMFOS improves clustering accuracy. On a facial image database, NMFOS achieves a better parts-based representation with a significant reduction in computational complexity. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tourism product design and development have become important activities in many areas/countries as a growing source of foreign and domestic earnings. On the other hand, customer relationship management is a competitive strategy that businesses need in order to stay focused on the needs of their customers and to integrate a customer-oriented approach throughout the organization. Thus, this paper uses the Apriori algorithm as a methodology for association rules and clustering analysis for data mining, which is implemented for mining customer knowledge from the case firm, Phoenix Tours International, in Taiwan. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, and knowledge maps in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the case firm for new product development and customer relationship management.

J	Ruggieri, S; Pedreschi, D; Turini, F				Ruggieri, Salvatore; Pedreschi, Dino; Turini, Franco			Data Mining for Discrimination Discovery	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Discrimination; classification rules		In the context of civil rights law, discrimination refers to unfair or unequal treatment of people based on membership to a category or a minority, without regard to individual merit. Discrimination in credit, mortgage, insurance, labor market, and education has been investigated by researchers in economics and human sciences. With the advent of automatic decision support systems, such as credit scoring systems, the ease of data collection opens several challenges to data analysts for the fight against discrimination. In this article, we introduce the problem of discovering discrimination through data mining in a dataset of historical decision records, taken by humans or by automatic systems. We formalize the processes of direct and indirect discrimination discovery by modelling protected-by-law groups and contexts where discrimination occurs in a classification rule based syntax. Basically, classification rules extracted from the dataset allow for unveiling contexts of unlawful discrimination, where the degree of burden over protected-by-law groups is formalized by an extension of the lift measure of a classification rule. In direct discrimination, the extracted rules can be directly mined in search of discriminatory contexts. In indirect discrimination, the mining process needs some background knowledge as a further input, for example, census data, that combined with the extracted rules might allow for unveiling contexts of discriminatory decisions. A strategy adopted for combining extracted classification rules with background knowledge is called an inference model. In this article, we propose two inference models and provide automatic procedures for their implementation. An empirical assessment of our results is provided on the German credit dataset and on the PKDD Discovery Challenge 1999 financial dataset.

In small isolated power systems, contingency scenarios are outages of generating units. Usually, only N - 1 outages are considered. In this paper, simultaneous outages of several units are also taken into account. Data mining techniques such as K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms are used to group scenarios in terms of system frequency and to identify representative OC scenarios. The approach has been applied to the design of UFLS schemes of two of the Spanish isolated power systems. The results have also been compared to the common practice of scenario selection. Clustering techniques yielded to satisfactory results, i.e., representative OC scenarios can be identified. Furthermore, these representative OC scenarios cover a wider range of possible system responses than the scenarios selected following the common practice.

J	Yang, B; Huang, HK				Yang, Bei; Huang, Houkuan			TOPSIL-Miner: an efficient algorithm for mining top-K significant itemsets over data streams	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data stream; Landmark window; Top-K significant itemset; Pruning; Dynamic approximate algorithm	RECENTLY FREQUENT ITEMSETS; SLIDING WINDOW; PATTERNS	Frequent itemset mining over data streams becomes a hot topic in data mining and knowledge discovery in recent years, and has been applied to different areas. However, the setting of a minimum support threshold needs some domain knowledge. It will bring a lot of difficulties or much burden to users if the support threshold is not set reasonably. It is interesting for users to find top-K frequent itemsets over data streams. In this paper, a dynamical incremental approximate algorithm TOPSIL-Miner is presented to mine top-K significant itemsets in landmark windows. A new data structure, TOPSIL-Tree, is designed to store the potential significant itemsets and other data structures of maximum support list, ordered item list, TOPSET and minimum support list are devised to maintain information about mining results. Moreover, three optimal strategies are exploited to reduce time and space cost of the algorithm: (1) pruning trivial nodes in the current data stream, (2) promoting mining support threshold during mining process adaptively and heuristically, and (3) promoting pruning threshold dynamically. The accuracy of the algorithm is also analyzed. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the good effectiveness and the high efficiency and precision of the algorithm.

The complexity and excessive in computational cost are always become the main obstacles as compared to mining the frequent rules. Indeed, most of the previous studies still adopting the Apriori-like algorithms which are very time consuming. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable trie-based algorithm named SLP-Growth. This algorithm generates the significant patterns using interval support and determines its correlation. Experiments with the real datasets show that the SLP-algorithm can discover highly positive correlated and significant of least association. Indeed, it also outperforms the fast FP-Growth algorithm up to two times, thus verifying its efficiency.

The integration of both important steps of knowledge discovery in databases is recognized as a vital step towards improving effectiveness of the data mining effort. After having the introduced data reduction and integration schemes a solution to the integrated classification problem is proposed. The proposed algorithm allows for integrating data reduction through simultaneous instance and feature selection, with learning process using population-based and A-Team techniques. To validate the proposed approach and to investigate the effect of data reduction combined with different integration schemes, the computation experiment has been carried out. Experiment based on several benchmark datasets has shown that integrated data reduction and classifier learning outperform traditional approaches.

J	Hong, TP; Wang, CY				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Wang, Ching-Yao			An efficient and effective association-rule maintenance algorithm for record modification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rule; Large itemset; Pre-large itemset; Record modification		Modification of records in databases is common in real-world applications. Developing an efficient and effective mining algorithm to maintain discovered information as the records in a database are updated is thus quite important in the field of data mining. Although association rules for modification of records can be maintained by using deletion and insertion procedures, this requires twice the computation time needed for a single procedure. In this paper, we present a new modification algorithm to resolve this issue. The concept of pre-large itemsets is used to reduce the need for rescanning original databases and to save maintenance costs. The proposed algorithm does not require rescanning of original databases until a specified number of records have been modified. If the database is large, then the number of modified records allowed will also be large. This characteristic is especially useful for real-world applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient fingerprint image compression technique based on wave atoms decomposition and multistage vector quantization	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology	JUN 08-10, 2009	Windsor, ICELAND	IEEE Reg 4	Univ Windsor	Image compression; fingerprint images; wave atoms decomposition; multistage vector quantization; arithmetic codings	FREEWAY INCIDENT DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; STRUCTURAL SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; TIME-FREQUENCY LOCALIZATION; BUILDING STRUCTURES; HIGHRISE BUILDINGS; CHAOS METHODOLOGY; SEIZURE DETECTION; HYBRID CONTROL; ALGORITHM	Modern fingerprint image compression and reconstruction standards used by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are based upon the popular biorthogonal 9-7 discrete wavelet transform. Multiresolution analysis tools have been successfully applied to fingerprint image compression for more than a decade; we propose a novel fingerprint image compression technique based on wave atoms decomposition and multistage vector quantization. Wave atoms decomposition has been specifically designed for enhanced representation of oscillatory patterns and to convey precise temporal and spatial information. Our proposed compression scheme is based upon multistage vector quantization of processed wave atoms representation of fingerprint images. Wave atoms expansion is processed using mathematical morphological operators to emphasize and retain significant coefficients for transmission. Quantized information is encoded using arithmetic entropy scheme. The proposed image compression standard outperforms other well established methods and achieves PSNR gain up to 8.07 dB in comparison to FBI's wavelet scalar quantization. Data mining, law enforcement, border security, and forensic applications can potentially benefit from our compression scheme.	[Mohammed, Abdul Adeel; Minhas, Rashid; Wu, Q. M. Jonathan; Sid-Ahmed, M.

For extracting knowledge from such huge volume of microarray gene expression data, computational analysis is required. Clustering is one of the important data mining tools for analyzing such microarray data to group similar genes into clusters. Researchers have proposed a number of clustering algorithms in this purpose. In this article, an attempt has been made in order to improve the performance of fuzzy clustering by combining it with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A recently proposed real-coded variable string length genetic algorithm based clustering technique and an iterated version of fuzzy C-means clustering have been utilized in this purpose. The performance of the proposed clustering scheme has been compared with that of some well-known existing clustering algorithms and their SVM boosted versions for one simulated and six real life gene expression data sets. Statistical significance test based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by posteriori Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test has been conducted to establish the statistical significance of the superior performance of the proposed clustering scheme. Moreover biological significance of the clustering solutions have been established. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method works at the instance level, decomposing the model's prediction for an instance into the contributions of the attributes' values. We use several artificial data sets and several different types of models to show that the generated explanations reflect the decision-making properties of the explained model and approach the concepts behind the data set as the prediction quality of the model increases. The usefulness of the method is justified by a successful application on a real-world breast cancer recurrence prediction problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the advance in cognitive networking as a possible means of exploiting unused spectrum, there is now a growing need to study how to design a cognitive network using an automated methodology. In this article we study the concepts and challenges for automatic design/reconfiguration of cognitive MANETs. We describe the design objectives, imposed constraints, and involved parameters in MANETs. We describe how cognitive techniques can be employed to exploit the unused spectrum in military architectures. We then discuss the challenges facing the design/reconfiguration of a cognitive network and their implications at different network layers. We also describe possible implementation options for designing MANETs that employ cognitive features at all layers.

How to build a lightweight IDS is a hot topic in network security. Moreover, feature selection is a classic research topic in data mining and it has attracted much interest from researchers in many fields such as network security, pattern recognition and data mining. In this paper, we effectively introduced feature selection methods to intrusion detection domain. We propose a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm aiming at building lightweight intrusion detection system by using modified random mutation hill climbing (RMHC) as search strategy to specify a candidate subset for evaluation, as well as using modified linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) iterative procedure as wrapper approach to obtain the optimum feature subset. We verify the effectiveness and the feasibility of our feature selection algorithm by several experiments on KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results strongly show that our approach is not only able to speed up the process of selecting important features but also to yield high detection rates. Furthermore, our experimental results indicate that intrusion detection system with feature selection algorithm has better performance than that without feature selection algorithm both in detection performance and computational cost.

In this paper, we put forward a new reliable method called probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) to impute the missing flow volume data based on historical data mining. First, we review the current missing data-imputation method and why it may fail to yield acceptable results in many traffic flow applications. Second, we examine the statistical properties of traffic flow volume time series. We show that the fluctuations of traffic flow are Gaussian type and that principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to retrieve the features of traffic flow. Third, we discuss how to use a robust PCA to filter out the abnormal traffic flow data that disturb the imputation process. Finally, we recall the theories of PPCA/Bayesian PCA-based imputation algorithms and compare their performance with some conventional methods, including the nearest/mean historical imputation methods and the local interpolation/regression methods. The experiments prove that the PPCA method provides significantly better performance than the conventional methods, reducing the root-mean-square imputation error by at least 25%.

J	Chen, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, VS				Chen, Chun-Hao; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Tseng, Vincent S.			An improved approach to find membership functions and multiple minimum supports in fuzzy data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy set; Genetic algorithm; Genetic-fuzzy mining; Multiple minimum supports; Membership functions	ASSOCIATION RULES; TRADE-OFF; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY; REDUCTION; ALGORITHM; NUMBER	Fuzzy mining approaches have recently been discussed for deriving fuzzy knowledge. Since items may have their own characteristics, different minimum supports and membership functions may be specified for different items. In the past, we proposed a genetic-fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting minimum supports and membership functions for items from quantitative transactions. In that paper. minimum supports and membership functions of all items are encoded in a chromosome Such that it may be not easy to converge. In this paper, an enhanced approach is proposed, which processes the items in a divide-and-conquer strategy. The approach is called divide-and-conquer genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports (DCFMMS), and is designed for finding minimum supports, membership functions, and fuzzy association rules. Possible solutions are evaluated by their requirement satisfaction divided by their suitability of derived membership functions. The proposed GA framework maintains multiple populations, each for one item's minimum support and membership functions. The final best minimum supports and membership functions in all the populations are then gathered together to be used for mining fuzzy association rules. Experimental results also show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several techniques have been proposed to detect similar code fragments in software, so-called simple clones. Identification and subsequent unification of simple clones is beneficial in software maintenance. Even further gains can be obtained by elevating the level of code clone analysis. We observed that recurring patterns of simple clones often indicate the presence of interesting higher-level similarities that we call structural clones. Structural clones show a bigger picture of similarity situation than simple clones alone. Being logical groups of simple clones, structural clones alleviate the problem of huge number of clones typically reported by simple clone detection tools, a problem that is often dealt with postdetection visualization techniques. Detection of structural clones can help in understanding the design of the system for better maintenance and in reengineering for reuse, among other uses. In this paper, we propose a technique to detect some useful types of structural clones. The novelty of our approach includes the formulation of the structural clone concept and the application of data mining techniques to detect these higher-level similarities. We describe a tool called Clone Miner that implements our proposed technique. We assess the usefulness and scalability of the proposed techniques via several case studies. We discuss various usage scenarios to demonstrate in what ways the knowledge of structural clones adds value to the analysis based on simple clones alone.

J	Liao, SH; Chen, YN; Tseng, YY				Liao, Shu-Hsien; Chen, Ya-Ning; Tseng, Yu-Yia			Mining demand chain knowledge of life insurance market for new product development	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Demand chain management; Life insurance marker; New product development; Data mining; Consumer research	MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; INTEGRATION; ALGORITHM	Demand chain management (DCM) can he defined as "extending the view of operations from a single business unit or a company to the whole chain. Essentially, demand chain management focuses not only on generating drawing power from customers to purchase merchandises on the supply chain; but also on exploring satisfaction, participation, and involvement from customers in order for enterprises to understand customer needs and wants. Thus, Customers have changed their position in the demand chain to assume a leading role in bringing more benefit for enterprises. This article investigates what functionalities best fit the consumers' needs and wants for life insurance products by extracting specific knowledge patterns and rules from Consumers and their demand chain. By doing so, this paper uses the a priori algorithm and clustering analysis as methodologies for data mining. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as market segments and demand chain analysis on life insurance market in Taiwan in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the insurance firms for new product development and marketing.

One application of data mining in the field of the botany is numerical taxonomy. In the present work, a particle swarm optimization-aided fuzzy cloud classifier based on attribute similarity (PSOCCAS) is used for plant taxonomy by two datasets. Firstly, the proposed classifier is been tested by employing it for the benchmark classification data sets, Fisher's iris data. The testing accuracy is found very encouraging. The performance of our proposed system is only bettered by some generic algorithm (GA) or evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based fuzzy systems which showed fantastic results. Then for further validation and broadening application, the PSOCCAS has been presented for quantitative features evaluation, 'expected species' selection and successful classification of three sections in genus Camellia (belongs to the family Theaceae). The selected quantitative features are almost those selected ill previous works. The method is able to produce 100% accurate classification results in genus Camellia. It is a very simple and robust method to divergences in plant taxonomy. No extensive preprocessing is required. The classification is performed with comparatively comprehensive features than those used in our previous work. The method utilizes the inherent nature of the data in performing Various tasks.

J	Torvik, VI; Smalheiser, NR				Torvik, Vetle I.; Smalheiser, Neil R.			Author Name Disambiguation in MEDLINE	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Name disambiguation; bibliographic databases		Background: We recently described "Author-ity," a model for estimating the probability that two articles in MEDLINE, sharing the same author name, were written by the same individual. Features include shared title words, journal name, coauthors, medical subject headings, language, affiliations, and author name features (middle initial, suffix, and prevalence in MEDLINE). Here we test the hypothesis that the Author-ity model will suffice to disambiguate author names for the vast majority of articles in MEDLINE. Methods: Enhancements include: (a) incorporating first names and their variants, email addresses, and correlations between specific last names and affiliation words; (b) new methods of generating large unbiased training sets; (c) new methods for estimating the prior probability; (d) a weighted least squares algorithm for correcting transitivity violations; and (e) a maximum likelihood based agglomerative algorithm for computing clusters of articles that represent inferred author-individuals. Results: Pairwise comparisons were computed for all author names on all 15.3 million articles in MEDLINE (2006 baseline), that share last name and first initial, to create Author-ity 2006, a database that has each name on each article assigned to one of 6.7 million inferred author-individual clusters. Recall is estimated at similar to 98.8%. Lumping (putting two different individuals into the same cluster) affects similar to 0.5% of clusters, whereas splitting (assigning articles written by the same individual to >1 cluster) affects similar to 2% of articles. Impact: The Author-ity model can be applied generally to other bibliographic databases. Author name disambiguation allows information retrieval and data integration to become person-centered, not just document-centered, setting the stage for new data mining and social network tools that will facilitate the analysis of scholarly publishing and collaboration behavior. Availability: The Author-ity 2006 database is available for nonprofit academic research, and can be freely queried via http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu.

J	Wu, WW				Wu, Wei-Wen			Exploring core competencies for R&D technical professionals	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Technical professional; Competency; Rough set theory	ROUGH SETS THEORY; MODEL; SELECTION	In order to maintain technical competitiveness, companies have all ongoing need to identify and foster core competencies for technical professionals in the area of research and development (R&D). Exploring core competencies is, however, a qualitative problem. The rough set theory (RST), which has recently become well known as a data-mining technique, is a good tool for data reduction in qualitative analysis. Thus, the rough set approach is suitable for dealing with the problem of exploring competencies. This study extends practical applications of RST in mining the critical competencies for R&D technical professionals employed by semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan. This paper demonstrates a successful reduction of the numerous essential competencies into a more compact set, and arrived at six core competencies which call be regarded as the as indispensable attributes for the design of competency development programs for R&D technical professionals.

J	Yang, SY; Hsu, CL				Yang, Sheng-Yuan; Hsu, Chun-Liang			An ontological Proxy Agent with prediction, CBR, and RBR techniques for fast query processing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Proxy Agent; Data mining; Query prediction; Case-based reasoning; Rule-based reasoning; Ontology	PATTERNS	This paper proposed a three-tics Proxy Agent working as a mediator between the users and the backend process of a FAQ system. The First tier makes use of an improved sequential patterns mining technique to propose effective query prediction and cache services. The second tier employs an ontology-supported case-based reasoning technique to propose adapted query solutions and tune itself by retaining and updating highly-satisfied cases identified by the user. Finally, the third tier utilizes an ontology-supported rule-based reasoning to generate possible solutions for the user. Our experiments show around 79.1% of the user queries can be answered by Proxy Agent, leaving about 20.9% of the queries for the backend Answerer Agent to take care, which can effectively alleviate the overloading problem usually associated with a backend server.

In fact, probability-based classifiers also produce the class probability estimation (the probability that a test instance belongs to the predicted class). This information is often ignored in classification, as long as the class with the highest class probability estimation is identical to the actual class. In many data mining applications, however, classification accuracy and error rate are not enough. For example, in direct marketing, we often need to deploy different promotion strategies to customers with different likelihood (class probability) of buying some products. Thus, accurate class probability estimations are often required to make optimal decisions. In this paper, we firstly review some state-of-the-art probability-based classifiers and empirically investigate their class probability estimation performance. From our experimental results, we can draw a conclusion: C4.4 is an attractive algorithm for class probability estimation. Then, we present a locally weighted version of C4.4 to scale up its class probability estimation performance by combining locally weighted learning with C4.4. We call our improved algorithm locally weighted C4.4, simply LWC4.4. We experimentally test LWC4.4 using the whole 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka. The experimental results show that LWC4.4 significantly outperforms C4.4 in terms of class probability estimation.

Intrinsic dimension of data sets is a key parameter for dimensionality reduction. However, finding the correct intrinsic dimension is a challenging task. In this paper, a new intrinsic dimension estimation method is presented. The estimator is derived by finding the exponential relationship between the radius of an incising ball and the number of samples included in the ball. The method is compared with the previous dimension estimation methods. Experiments have been conducted on synthetic and high dimensional image data sets and on data sets of the Santa Fe time series competition, and the results show that the new method is accurate and robust.

J	Wang, YH; Tseng, MH; Liao, HC				Wang, Ya-huei; Tseng, Ming-Hseng; Liao, Hung-Chang			Data mining for adaptive learning sequence in English language instruction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Adaptive system analysis; Data mining; Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL)	COGNITIVE STYLES	The purpose of this paper is to propose an adaptive system analysis for optimizing learning sequences. The analysis employs a decision tree algorithm, based on students' profiles, to discover the most adaptive learning sequences for a particular teaching content. The profiles were created on the basis of pretesting and posttesting, and from a set of five Student characteristics: gender, personality type, cognitive style, learning style, and the students' grades from the previous semester. This paper address the problem of adhering to a fixed learning sequence in the traditional method of teaching English, and recommend a rule for setting up an optimal learning sequence for facilitating students' learning processes and for maximizing their learning outcome. By using the technique proposed in this paper, teachers will be able both to lower the cost of teaching and to achieve an optimally adaptive learning sequence for students. The results show that the power of the adaptive learning sequence lies in the way it takes into account students' personal characteristics and performance; for this reason, it constitutes an important innovation in the field of Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL).

Perhaps surprisingly, there have been no comprehensive studies in the scientific literature comparing the various ordinal classifiers. This paper compares the accuracy of five ordinal and three non-ordinal classifiers on a benchmark of fifteen real-world datasets. The results show that the ordinal classifiers that were tested had no meaningful statistical advantage over the corresponding non-ordinal classifiers. Furthermore, the ordinal classifiers that guaranteed monotonic classifications showed no meaningful statistical advantage over a majority-based classifier. We suggest that the tested ordinal classifiers did not properly utilize the order information in the presence of non-monotonic noise. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tseng, VS; Lu, EHC				Tseng, Vincent S.; Lu, Eric Hsueh-Chan			Energy-efficient real-time object tracking in multi-level sensor networks by mining and predicting movement patterns	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Sensor networks; Location prediction; Real-time object tracking; Data mining		A number of studies have been written on sensor networks in the past few years due to their wide range of potential applications. Object tracking is an important topic in sensor networks; and the limited power of sensor nodes presents numerous challenges to researchers. Previous studies of energy conservation in sensor networks have considered object movement behavior to be random. However, in some applications, the movement behavior of an object is often based on certain underlying events instead of randomness completely. Moreover, few studies have considered the real-time issue in addition to the energy saving problem for object tracking in sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy named multi-level object tracking strategy (MLOT) for energy-efficient and real-time tracking of the moving objects in sensor networks by mining the movement log. In MLOT, we first conduct hierarchical clustering to form a hierarchical model of the sensor nodes. Second, the movement logs of the moving objects are analyzed by a data mining algorithm to obtain the movement patterns, which are then used to predict the next position of a moving object. We use the multi-level structure to represent the hierarchical relations among sensor nodes so as to achieve the goal of keeping track of moving objects in a real-time manner.

J	Wu, SY; Yen, E				Wu, Su-Yun; Yen, Ester			Data mining-based intrusion detectors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification tree; Support vector machine; Internet attack; Intrusion detection system (IDS)		With popularization of internet, internet attack cases are increasing, and attack methods differs each day. thus information safety problem has became a significant issue all over the world. Nowadays, it is an urgent need to detect, identify and hold up such attacks effectively. The research intends to compare efficiency of machine learning methods in intrusion detection system, including classification tree and support vector machine, with the hope of providing reference for establishing intrusion detection system in future. Compared with other related works in data mining-based intrusion detectors, we proposed to calculate the mean value via sampling different ratios of normal data for each measurement, which lead us to reach a better accuracy rate for observation data in real world. We compared the accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate for four attack types. More over, it shows better performance than KDD Winner, especially for U2R type and R2L type attacks.

J	Reynolds, AP; de la Iglesia, B				Reynolds, Alan P.; de la Iglesia, Beatriz			A multi-objective GRASP for partial classification	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-objective optimization; GRASP; Data mining; Rule induction; Partial classification	GENETIC LOCAL SEARCH; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION	Metaheuristic algorithms have been used successfully in a number of data mining contexts and specifically in the production of classification rules. Classification rules describe a class of interest or a subset of this class, and as such may also be used as an aid in prediction. The production and selection of classification rules for a particular class of the database is often referred to as partial classification. Since partial classification rules are often evaluated according to a number of conflicting objectives, the generation of such rules is a task that is well suited to a multi-objective (MO) metaheuristic approach. In this paper we discuss how to adapt well known MO algorithms for the task of partial classification. Additionally, we introduce a new MO algorithm for this task based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). GRASP has been applied to a number of problems in combinatorial optimization, but it has very seldom been used in a MO setting, and generally only through repeated optimization of single objective problems, using either linear combinations of the objectives or additional constraints. The approach presented takes advantage of some specific characteristics of the data mining problem being solved, allowing for the very effective construction of a set of solutions that form the starting point for the local search phase of the GRASP. The resulting algorithm is guided solely by the concepts of dominance and Pareto-optimality. We present experimental results for our partial classification GRASP and other MO metaheuristics. These show that such algorithms are generally very well suited to this data mining task and furthermore, the GRASP brings additional efficiency to the search for partial classification rules.

J	Bogorny, V; Kuijpers, B; Alvares, LO				Bogorny, Vania; Kuijpers, Bart; Alvares, Luis Otavio			ST-DMQL: A Semantic Trajectory Data Mining Query Language	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Moving objects; Trajectories; Semantics; Trajectory query language; Trajectory knowledge discovery; Trajectory data mining	DISCOVERY; PATTERNS	Mobile devices are becoming very popular in recent years, and large amounts of trajectory data are generated by these devices. Trajectories left behind cars, humans, birds or other objects are a new kind of data which can be very useful in the decision making process in several application domains. These data, however, are normally available as sample points, and therefore have very little or no semantics. The analysis and knowledge extraction from trajectory sample points is very difficult from the user's point of view, and there is an emerging need for new data models, manipulation techniques, and tools to extract meaningful patterns from these data. In this paper we propose a new methodology for knowledge discovery from trajectories. We propose through a semantic trajectory data mining query language several functionalities to select, preprocess, and transform trajectory sample points into semantic trajectories at higher abstraction levels, in order to allow the user to extract meaningful, understandable, and useful patterns from trajectories. We claim that meaningful patterns can only be extracted from trajectories if the background geographical information is considered. Therefore we build the proposed methodology considering both moving object data and geographic information. The proposed language has been implemented in a toolkit in order to provide a first software prototype for trajectory knowledge discovery.

Compact frequent patterns keep exact or approximate supports of a complete set of frequent patterns, and the number of them is often orders of magnitude smaller. Several efficient algorithms have been proposed to mine compact sequential patterns. However, sequence databases are not always static. Sequences (or items) are often added to and deleted from databases. A slight change made on a database may lead to the change of compact patterns. Mining from scratch is very time-consuming and thus infeasible. In this paper, we explore how to efficiently maintain closed sequential patterns in a dynamic sequence database environment. A compact structure CSTree is designed to keep closed sequential patterns, and its nice properties are carefully studied. Two efficient algorithms, IMCS(A) and IMCS(D), are developed to maintain the CSTree upon incremental update. The algorithms make full use of the properties of CSTree to find nodes whose states are obsolete and avoid unnecessary node extension and closure checking operations to accelerate the incremental update process. A thorough experimental study on various real and synthetic datasets shows that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms - PrefixSpan, CloSpan, BIDE and a recently proposed incremental mining algorithm IncSpan by about a factor of 4 to more than an order of magnitude.

Privacy and confidentiality are of great concern when such data is being shared between organisations or made publicly available. Research in (privacy-preserving) data ruining and data linkage is suffering front a lack of publicly available real-world data, sets that contain personal information; And therefore experimental evaluations cart be difficult to conduct. In order to overcome this problem, we have developed a data generator that allows flexible creation of synthetic data, containing personal information with realistic characteristics, such as frequency distributions, attribute dependencies, and error probabilities. Our generator significantly improves earlier approaches, and allows the generation of data for individuals; families and households.

However, what if there are multiple labeling sources (,oracles' or 'experts') with different but unknown reliabilities? With the recent advent of inexpensive and scalable online annotation tools, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, the labeling process has become more vulnerable to noise - and without prior knowledge of the accuracy of each individual labeler. This paper addresses exactly such a challenge: how to jointly learn the accuracy of labeling sources and obtain the most informative labels for the active learning task at hand minimizing total labeling effort. More specifically, we present IEThresh (Interval Estimate Threshold) as a strategy to intelligently select the expert(s) with the highest estimated labeling accuracy. IEThresh estimates a confidence interval for the reliability of each expert and filters out the one(s) whose estimated upper-bound confidence interval is below a threshold - which jointly optimizes expected accuracy (mean) and need to better estimate the expert's accuracy (variance). Our framework is flexible enough to work with a wide range of different noise levels and outperforms baselines such as asking all available experts and random expert selection. In particular, IEThresh achieves a given level of accuracy with less than half the queries issued by all-experts labeling and less than a third the queries required by random expert selection on datasets such as the UCI mushroom one. The results show that our method naturally balances exploration and exploitation as it gains knowledge of which experts to rely upon, and selects them with increasing frequency.

The algorithm satisfies a rigorous property of differential privacy, and is also extremely efficient, running on networks of 100 million nodes in a few seconds. Theoretical analysis shows that the error scales linearly with the number of unique degrees, whereas the error of conventional techniques scales linearly with the number of nodes. We complement the theoretical analysis with a thorough empirical analysis on real and synthetic graphs, showing that the algorithm's variance and bias is low, that the error diminishes as the size of the input graph increases, and that common analyses like fitting a power-law can be carried out very accurately.

As the number of possible subspace projections is exponential in the number of dimensions, the result is often tremendously large. Recent approaches fail to reduce results to relevant subspace clusters. Their results are typically highly redundant, i.e. many clusters are detected multiple times in several projections. In this work, we propose a novel model for relevant subspace clustering (RESCU). We present a global optimization which detects the most interesting non-redundant subspace clusters. We prove that computation of this model is NP-hard. For RESCU, we propose an approximative solution that shows high accuracy with respect to our relevance model. Thorough experiments on synthetic and real world data show that RESCU successfully reduces the result to manageable sizes. It reliably achieves top clustering quality while competing approaches show greatly varying performance.

In this paper we present an updated version of the OntoDM ontology, that is based on a recent proposal of a general framework for data mining and it is aligned with the ontology of biomedical investigations (OBI). The ontology aims at describing and formalizing entities from the domain of data mining and knowledge discovery. It includes definitions of basic data mining entities (e.g., datatype, dataset, data mining task, data mining algorithm etc.) and allows extensions with more complex data mining entities (e.g. constraints, data mining scenarios and data mining experiments). Unlike most existing approaches to constructing ontologies of data mining, OntoDM is compliant to best practices in engineering ontologies that describe scientific investigations (e.g.: OBI) and is a step towards an ontology of data mining investigations. OntoDM is available at:http://kt.ijs.si/panovp/0ntoDM/.

A social network is a prime example of such data, where the nodes represent individuals and edges represent relationships. Nearly all interesting queries over social networks involve joins, and for such queries, existing output perturbation algorithms severely distort query answers. We propose an algorithm that significantly improves utility over competing techniques, typically reducing the error bound from polynomial in the number of nodes to poly-logarithmic. The algorithm is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to answer such queries with acceptable accuracy, even for worst-case inputs. The improved utility is achieved by relaxing the privacy condition. Instead of ensuring strict differential privacy, we guarantee a weaker (but still quite practical) condition based on adversarial privacy. To explain precisely the nature of Our relaxation in privacy, we provide a new result that characterizes the relationship between c-indistinguishability (a variant of the differential privacy definition) and adversarial privacy, which is of independent interest: an algorithm is c-indistinguishable iff it is private for a particular class of adversaries (defined precisely herein). Our perturbation algorithm guarantees privacy against adversaries in this class whose prior distribution is numerically bounded.

While many published works have shown that GPUs can be used to accelerate various general purpose applications with respectable performance gains, Few attempts have been made to tackle very large problems. Our goal here is to investigate if GPUs can be useful accelerators even with very large data sets that cannot fit into GPU's onboard memory. Using a popular clustering algorithm, K-Means, as all example. our results have been very positive. On a data set with a billion data points. Our GPU-accelerated implementation achieved an order of magnitude performance gain over a highly optimized CPU-only version running on 8 cores, and more than two orders of magnitude gain over a popular benchmark, MineBench, running on a single core.

On clustering tree structured data with categorical nature	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; (dis)similarity measures; data mining	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Clustering consists in partitioning a set of objects into disjoint and homogeneous clusters. For many years, clustering methods have been applied in a wide variety of disciplines and they also have been utilized in many scientific areas. Traditionally, clustering methods deal with numerical data, i.e. objects represented by a conjunction of numerical attribute Values. However, nowadays commercial or scientific databases Usually contain categorical data, i.e. objects represented by categorical attributes. In this paper we present a dissimilarity measure which is capable to deal with tree structured categorical data. Thus, it can be used for extending the various versions of the very popular k-means clustering algorithm to deal with Such data. We discuss how such an extension can be achieved. Moreover, we empirically prove that the proposed dissimilarity measure is accurate, compared to other well-known (dis)similarity measures for categorical data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hsu, CC; Huang, YP				Hsu, Chung-Chian; Huang, Yan-Ping			Incremental clustering of mixed data based on distance hierarchy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						adaptive resonance theory networks; conceptual hierarchy; clustering algorithm; unsupervised neural network; data mining	RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; ART	Clustering is an important function in data mining. Its typical application includes the analysis of consumer's materials. Adaptive resonance theory network (ART) is very popular in the unsupervised neural network. Type I adaptive resonance theory network (ART1) deals with the binary numerical data, whereas type II adaptive resonance theory network (ART2) deals with the general numerical data. Several information systems collect the mixing type attitudes, which included numeric attributes and categorical attributes. However, ART1 and ART2 do not deal with mixed data. If the categorical data attributes are transferred to the binary data format, the binary data do not reflect the similar degree. It influences the Clustering quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified adaptive resonance theory network (M-ART) and the conceptual hierarchy tree to solve similar degrees of mixed data. This paper Utilizes artificial simulation materials and collects a piece of actual data about the family income to do experiments. The results show that the M-ART algorithm can process the mixed data and has a great effect on clustering. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Beyond FCM: Graph-theoretic post-processing algorithms for learning and representing the data structure	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						fuzzy clustering; manifold learning; prototyping; spectral-graph theory; visual data mining	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FUZZY C-MEANS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS	We show that when fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is used in an over-partitioning mode, the resulting membership values can be further utilized for building a connectivity graph that represents the relative distribution of the computed centroids. Standard graph-theoretic procedures and recent algorithms from manifold learning theory are subsequently applied to this graph. This facilitates the accomplishment of a great variety of data-analysis tasks. The definition of optimal cluster number C-o, the detection of intrinsic geometrical constraints within the data, and the faithful low-dimensional representation of the original structure are all performed efficiently, by working with just a down-sampled version (comprised of the centroids) of the data. Our approach is extensively demonstrated using synthetic data and actual brain signals. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Savvides, A; Promponas, VJ; Fokianos, K				Savvides, Alexios; Promponas, Vasifis J.; Fokianos, Konstantinos			Clustering of biological time series by cepstral coefficients based distances	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						exponential model; likelihood; distance measures; spectral analysis; periodogram; data mining; protein sequence analysis	CLASSIFICATION; DISCRIMINATION; SEQUENCE; MODEL	Clustering of stationary time series has become an important tool in many scientific applications, like medicine, finance, etc. Time series clustering methods are based on the calculation of suitable similarity measures which identify the distance between two or more time series. These measures are either computed in the time domain or in the spectral domain. Since the computation of time domain measures is rather cumbersome we resort to spectral domain methods. A new measure of distance is proposed and it is based on the so-called cepstral coefficients which carry information about the log spectrum of a stationary time series. These coefficients are estimated by means of a semiparametric model which assumes that the log-likelihood ratio of two or more unknown spectral densities has a linear parametric form. After estimation, the estimated cepstral distance measure is given as an input to a clustering method to produce the disjoint groups of data. Simulated examples show that the method yields good results, even when the processes are not necessarily linear. These cepstral-based clustering algorithms are applied to biological time series. In particular, the proposed methodology effectively identifies distinct and biologically relevant classes of amino acid sequences with the same physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity.

J	Yang, HL; Wang, CS				Yang, Heng-Li; Wang, Cheng-Shu			Two stages of case-based reasoning - Integrating genetic algorithm with data mining mechanism	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						case-base reasoning; case retrieve; genetic algorithm; KDD	DECISION-SUPPORT; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a paradigm, concept and instinctive mechanism for problem solving. Recently, CBR has been widely integrated with some AI algorithms and applied to various kinds of problems. The ill-defined and unstructured problems are suitably solved by CBR. This research proposes a hybrid CBR mechanism including two stages. In stage I, the genetic algorithm is adopted to improve efficiency of case retrieving process. Compared to traditional CBR, the proposed mechanism could reduce about 14% case evaluations, but still achieved 90% satisfactory results. In stage II, the knowledge discovering and data mining (KDD) processes are implemented to produce the refined information from the retrieved cases. Because these retrieved cases and target problem satisfy similar or even same conditions, the outcome of KDD would be more valuable for reference. In addition to retrieved cases of stage I, the proposed mechanism provides direction and relevant knowledge for decision makers in their decision supporting and revising processes in stage II. The proposed CBR mechanism also deals with efficiency and outcome quality issues of traditional CBR. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Amparo			A complexity guided algorithm for association rule extraction on fuzzy DataCubes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						association rules extraction; complexity reduction; fuzzy multidimensional model; on-line analytical processing (OLAP)	SYSTEMS; MODEL; CUBE; BAGS	The use of online analytical processing (OLAP) systems as data sources for data mining techniques has been widely studied and has resulted in what is known as online analytical mining (OLAM). As a result of both the use of OLAP technology in new fields of knowledge and the merging of data from different sources, it has become necessary for models to support imprecision. We, therefore, need OLAM methods which are able to deal with this imprecision. Association rules are one of the most used data mining techniques. There are several proposals that enable the extraction of association rules on DataCubes but few of these deal with imprecision in the process. The main problem observed in these proposals is the complexity of the rule set obtained. In this paper, we present a novel association rule extraction method that works over a fuzzy multidimensional model which is capable, of representing and managing imprecise data. Our method deals with the problem of reducing the complexity of the result obtained by using fuzzy concepts and a hierarchical relation between them.	[Marin, Nicolas; Vila, M.

J	Rege, M; Dong, M; Fotouhi, F				Rege, Manjeet; Dong, Ming; Fotouhi, Farshad			Bipartite isoperimetric graph partitioning for data co-clustering	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; clustering; graph algorithms; linear systems; singular value decomposition; eigenvalues and eigenvectors	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; EIGENVECTORS; EIGENVALUES; RETRIEVAL; NETWORKS; MATRICES	Data co-clustering refers to the problem of simultaneous clustering of two data types. Typically, the data is stored in a contingency or co-occurrence matrix C where rows and columns of the matrix represent the data types to be co-clustered. An entry C (ij) of the matrix signifies the relation between the data type represented by row i and column j. Co-clustering is the problem of deriving sub-matrices from the larger data matrix by simultaneously clustering rows and columns of the data matrix. In this paper, we present a novel graph theoretic approach to data co-clustering. The two data types are modeled as the two sets of vertices of a weighted bipartite graph. We then propose Isoperimetric Co-clustering Algorithm (ICA)-a new method for partitioning the bipartite graph. ICA requires a simple solution to a sparse system of linear equations instead of the eigenvalue or SVD problem in the popular spectral co-clustering approach. Our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments performed on publicly available datasets demonstrate the advantages of ICA over other approaches in terms of the quality, efficiency and stability in partitioning the bipartite graph.

J	Wang, ET; Lee, GL				Wang, En Tzu; Lee, Guanling			An efficient sanitization algorithm for balancing information privacy and knowledge discovery in association patterns mining	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; frequent pattern; sensitive pattern; sanitization process; probability policy	RULES	Discovering frequent patterns in large databases is one of the most studied problems in data mining, since it can yield substantial commercial benefits. However, some sensitive patterns with security considerations may compromise privacy. In this paper, we aim to determine appropriate balance between need for privacy and information discovery in frequent patterns. A novel method to modify databases for hiding sensitive patterns is proposed in this paper. Multiplying the original database by a sanitization matrix yields a sanitized database with private content. In addition, two probabilities are introduced to oppose against the recovery of sensitive patterns and to reduce the degree of hiding non-sensitive patterns in the sanitized database. The complexity analysis and the security discussion of the proposed sanitization process are provided. The results from a series of experiments performed to show the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach are described. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method is based on an offline hierarchical clustering of N generators into coherent groups. The clustering method can be used to produce any number of groups between I and N. One measurement location is selected during the offline phase to represent each cluster in the online phase. Event location is formulated as finding the most likely group from which an event originates. The rotor frequencies of the representative generators are used to identify the cluster with the largest initial swing. The method is demonstrated for locating events caused by faults and generator trips on a 176-bus model. The online location accuracy is around 80% when the offline clustering is good.

J	Chen, L; Lian, X				Chen, Lei; Lian, Xiang			Efficient similarity search in nonmetric spaces with local constant embedding	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						LCE; nonmetric; similarity; pivot		Similarity-based search has been a key factor for many applications such as multimedia retrieval, data mining, Web search and retrieval, and so on. There are two important issues related to the similarity search, namely, the design of a distance function to measure the similarity and improving the search efficiency. Many distance functions have been proposed, which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. Unfortunately, some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are therefore nonmetric. As a consequence, efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functions becomes more challenging, since most existing index structures assume that the indexed distance functions are metric. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by proposing an efficient method, that is, local constant embedding (LCE), which divides the data set into disjoint groups so that the triangle inequality holds within each group by constant shifting. Furthermore, we design a pivot selection approach for the converted metric distance and create an index structure to speed up the retrieval efficiency. Moreover, we also propose a novel method to answer approximate similarity search in the nonmetric space with a guaranteed query accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method works well on various nonmetric distance functions and improves the retrieval efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the linear scan and existing retrieval approaches with no false dismissals.

To find such rules using approaches like the Apriori algorithm, minimum support must be set very low, which results in a large number of redundant rules. We are interested in sporadic rules; i.e. those that fall below a maximum support level but above the level of support expected from random coincidence. There are two types of sporadic rules: perfectly sporadic and imperfectly sporadic. Here we are more concerned about finding imperfectly sporadic rules, where the support of the antecedent as a whole falls below maximum support, but where items may have quite high support individually. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm called Mining Interesting Imperfectly Sporadic Rules (MIISR) to find imperfectly sporadic rules efficiently, e.g. fever, headache, stiff neck -> meningitis. Our proposed method uses item constraints and coincidence pruning to discover these rules in reasonable time. This paper is an expanded version of Koh et al.

The aim is to build a fast and efficient support vector machines classifier. A criterion is defined to evaluate the decision function quality which blends recognition rate and the complexity of a binary decision functions together. The selection of the simplification level by vector quantization, of a feature subset and of support vector machines hyperparameters are performed by tabu search method to optimize the defined decision function quality criterion in order to find a good sub-optimal model on tractable times.

Multimodal news story clustering with pairwise visual near-duplicate constraint	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						multimedia topic detection and tracking; near-duplicate visual constraint; news story clustering; video data mining	SEGMENTATION; IMAGE	Story clustering is a critical step for news retrieval, topic mining, and summarization. Nonetheless, the task remains highly challenging owing to the fact that news topics exhibit clusters of varying densities, shapes, and sizes. Traditional algorithms are found to be ineffective in mining these types of clusters. This paper offers a new perspective by exploring the pairwise visual cues deriving from near-duplicate keyframes (NDK) for constraint-based clustering. We propose a constraint-driven co-clustering algorithm (CCC), which utilizes the near-duplicate constraints built on top of text, to mine topic-related stories and the outliers. With CCC, the duality between stories and their underlying multimodal features is exploited to transform features in low-dimensional space with normalized cut. The visual constraints are added directly to this new space, while the traditional DBSCAN is revisited to capitalize on the availability of constraints and the reduced dimensional space. We modify DBSCAN with two new characteristics for story clustering: 1) constraint-based centroid selection and 2) adaptive radius. Experiments on TRECVID-2004 corpus demonstrate that CCC with visual constraints is more capable of mining news topics of varying densities, shapes and sizes, compared with traditional k-means, DBSCAN, and spectral co-clustering algorithms.

A major constraint in phenotype classification is that the number of genes greatly exceeds the number of samples. We overcame this constraint in two ways; we increased the number of samples by integrating independently generated microarrays that had been designed with the same biological objectives, and reduced the number of genes involved in the classification by selecting a small set of informative genes. We were able to maximally use the abundant microarray data that is being stockpiled by thousands of different research groups while improving classification accuracy. Our goal is to implement a feature (gene) selection method that can be applicable to integrated microarrays as well as to build a highly accurate classifier that permits straightforward biological interpretation. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach. Firstly, we performed a direct integration of individual microarrays by transforming an expression value into a rank value within a sample and identified informative genes by calculating the number of swaps to reach a perfectly split sequence. Secondly, we built a classifier which is a parameter-free ensemble method using only the pre-selected informative genes. By using our classifier that was derived from large, integrated microarray sample datasets, we achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the classification of an independent test dataset.

J	Chan, CCH				Chan, C.-C. Henry			Intelligent spider for information retrieval to support mining-based price prediction for online auctioning	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						spider program; online auction; data mining; neural network; price predication	MOBILE-AGENT; WEB; COMMERCE	Since the emergence of online auctions in 1995, many individuals have joined auction markets. Sometimes, many bidders have made wrong decisions (e.g., "Winner Curse") due to their limited knowledge and resources. Unfortunately, search engines only show a list of search results to users, and fail to provide further analysis that could help improve users' decision-making. To solve this problem, this study proposed an intelligent spider for information retrieval, and applied data mining technology to differentiate between customers. Two software programs, a URL searching agent and an auction data agent, are developed to automatically collect related information whenever users input the searched product. Two neural networks are used to perform data clustering and price prediction after this information is crawled and stored into a database. The first neural network adopts a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster customer data into nine homogenous groups. The second backpropagation network (BPN) is then used to predict the final price. This study develops a prototype of the proposed spider, and conducts an empirical study by crawling over 1000 deals from Taiwan's eBay. Finally, important information, such as predicted price, prediction error and historic records, are presented to the user. The user can thus easily target the right bidding policy for wining a bid based on the mining-based information about price prediction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, vile propose several NMF inspired algorithms to solve different data mining problems. They include (1) multi-way normalized cut spectral clustering, (2) graph matching of both undirected and directed graphs, and (3) maximal clique finding on both graphs and bipartite graphs. Key features of these algorithms are (a) they are extremely simple to implement; and (b) they are provably convergent. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of these new algorithms.

J	Glimcher, L; Jin, RM; Agrawal, G				Glimcher, Leonid; Jin, Ruoming; Agrawal, Gagan			Middleware for data mining applications on clusters and grids	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; clusters; grids; middleware	ASSOCIATION RULES	This paper gives an overview of two middleware systems that have been developed over the last 6 years to address the challenges involved in developing parallel and distributed implementations of data mining algorithms. FREERIDE (FRamework for Rapid Implementation of Data mining Engines) focuses on data mining in a cluster environment. FREERIDE is based on the observation that parallel versions of several well-known data mining techniques share a relatively similar structure, and can be parallelized by dividing the data instances (or records or transactions) among the nodes. The computation on each node involves reading the data instances in an arbitrary order, processing each data instance, and performing a local reduction. The reduction involves only commutative and associative operations, which means the result is independent of the order in which the data instances are processed. After the local reduction on each node, a global reduction is performed. This similarity in the structure can be exploited by the middleware system to execute the data mining tasks efficiently in parallel, starting from a relatively high-level specification of the technique. To enable processing of data sets stored in remote data repositories, we have extended FREERIDE middleware into FREERIDE-G (FRamework for Rapid Implementation of Data mining Engines in Grid). FREERIDE-G supports a high-level interface for developing data mining and scientific data processing applications that involve data stored in remote repositories. The added functionality in FREERIDE-G aims at abstracting the details of remote data retrieval, movements, and caching from application developers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The search through the space of possible solutions is driven by special mechanisms of machine generators based on meta-schemes. The approach facilitates using human experts knowledge to restrict the search space and gaining meta-knowledge in an automated manner. The conclusions help in further search and may also be passed to other metalearners. All the functionality is included in our new general architecture for data mining, especially eligible for meta-learning tasks.

But data in real-world is usually imbalanced. The class imbalance problem is pervasive and ubiquitous, causing trouble to a large segment of the data mining community. The tradition machine learning algorithms have bad performance when they learn from imbalanced data sets. Thus, machine learning on imbalanced data sets becomes an urgent problem. The importance of imbalanced data sets and their broad application domains in data mining are introduced, and then methods to deal with the class imbalance problem are discussed and their effectiveness are compared. Last but not least, the existing evaluation measures of class imbalance problem are systematically analyzed.

We extend this idea to the Semantic Web by introducing our novel SPARQL-ML approach to perform data mining for Semantic Web data. Our approach is based on traditional SPARQL and statistical relational learning methods, such as Relational Probability Trees and Relational Bayesian Classifiers. We analyze our approach thoroughly conducting three sets of experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data sets. Our analytical results show that our approach can be used for any Semantic Web data set to perform instance-based learning and classification. A comparison to kernel methods used in Support Vector Machines shows that our approach is superior in terms of classification accuracy.

J	Lian, X; Chen, L				Lian, Xiang; Chen, Lei			Efficient similarity search over future stream time series	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						similarity search; stream time series; prediction; polynomial; DFT; probabilistic		With the advance of hardware and communication technologies, stream time series is gaining ever- increasing attention due to its importance in many applications such as financial data processing, network monitoring, Web click-stream analysis, sensor data mining, and anomaly detection. For all of these applications, an efficient and effective similarity search over stream data is essential. Because of the unique characteristics of the stream, for example, data are frequently updated and real-time response is required, the previous approaches proposed for searching through archived data may not work in the stream scenarios. Especially, in the cases where data often arrive periodically for various reasons ( for example, the communication congestion or batch processing), queries on such incomplete time series or even future time series may result in inaccuracy using traditional approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we propose three approaches, polynomial, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and probabilistic, to predict the unknown values that have not arrived at the system and answer similarity queries based on the predicted data. We also apply efficient indexes, that is, a multidimensional hash index and a B_- tree, to facilitate the prediction and similarity search on future time series, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods for prediction and answering queries.

J	Maji, P				Maji, Pradipta			Efficient design of neural network tree using a new splitting criterion	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; pattern classification; neural network; decision tree; bioinformatics; deoxyribonucleic acid; gene	PROTEIN-CODING REGIONS; DNA-SEQUENCES; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; DECISION TREES; RULES; EXTRACTION; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; INDUCTION; SYSTEMS	This paper presents the design of a hybrid learning model, termed as neural network tree (NNTree). It incorporates the advantages of both decision tree and neural network. An NNTree is a decision tree, where each non-terminal node contains a neural network. The idea of the proposed method is to use the framework of multilayer perceptron to design tree-structured pattern classifier. At each non-terminal node, the multilayer perceptron partitions the dataset into m subsets, m being the number of classes in the dataset present at that node. The NNTree is designed by splitting the non-terminal nodes of the tree by maximizing classification accuracy of the multilayer perceptron. In effect, it produces a reduced height m-ary tree. The versatility of the proposed scheme is illustrated through its application in diverse fields. The effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm, along with a comparison with other related algorithms, has been demonstrated on a set of benchmark datasets. Simulation results show that the NNTree achieves excellent performance in terms of classification accuracy, size of the tree, and classification time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We focus on re-clustering an object set, previously Clustered, when the feature set characterizing the objects increases. We propose an adaptive. Clustering method based on a hierarchical agglomerative approach, Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering (HAC), that adjusts the partitioning into clusters that was established by applying the hierarchical agglomerative Clustering algorithm (HACA) (Han and Kamber, 2001) before the feature set changed. We aim to reach the result more efficiently than running HACA again from scratch on the feature-extended object set, Experiments testing the method's efficiency and a practical distributed systems problem in which the HAC method can be efficiently used (the problem of adaptive horizontal fragmentation in object oriented databases) are also reported.

However, almost all existing co-clustering techniques are partitional, and allow individual rows and columns of a data matrix to belong to only one cluster Several current applications, such as recommendation systems and market basket analysis, can substantially benefit from a mixed membership of rows and columns. In this paper, we present Bayesian co-clustering (BCC) models, that allow a mixed membership in row and column clusters. BCC maintains separate Dirichlet priors for rows and columns over the mixed membership and assumes each observation to be generated by an exponential family distribution corresponding to its row and column clusters. We propose a fast variational algorithm for inference and parameter estimation. The model is designed to naturally handle sparse matrices as the inference is done only based on the non-missing entries. In. addition to finding a co-cluster structure in observations, the model outputs a low dimensional co-embedding, and accurately predicts missing values in the original matrix. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model through experiments on both simulated and real data.

The problem occurs when the number of instances in one class greatly outnumbers the number of instances in the other class. Such data sets often cause a default classifier to be built due to skewed vector spaces or lack of information. Common approaches for dealing with the class imbalance problem involve modifying the data distribution or modifying the classifier. In this work, we choose to use a combination of both approaches. We use support vector machines with soft margins as the base classifier to solve the skewed vector spaces problem. Then we use a boosting algorithm to get an ensemble classifier that has lower error than a single classifier. We found that this ensemble of SVMs makes an impressive improvement in prediction performance, not only for the majority class, but also for the minority class.

However defining a role infrastructure that accurately reflects the internal functionalities and workings of a large enterprise is a challenging task. Recent research has focused on the theoretical components of automated role identification while practical applications for identifying roles remain unsolved. This research proposes a practical data mining heuristic method that is fast, scalable and capable of identifying comprehensive roles and placing them into a hierarchy. Permission set pattern data mining can be used to identify the roles with partial orderings that cover the largest portion of user permissions within a system. We test the algorithm on real user permission assignments as well as on generated data sets. Roles identified in test sets cover tip to 85% of user permissions and analysis show the roles offer significant administrative benefit. We find interesting correlations between roles and their relationships and analyse the tradeoffs between identifying roles with complete coverage to identifying roles that tire most effective and offer significant administrative benefit.

J	Shah, D; Zhong, S				Shah, Divyesh; Zhong, Sheng			Two methods for privacy preserving data mining with malicious participants	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; privacy; malicious model; attacks; protocols		Privacy preserving data mining addresses the need of multiple parties with private inputs to run a data mining algorithm and learn the results over the combined data without revealing any unnecessary information. Most of the existing cryptographic solutions to privacy-preserving data mining assume semi-honest participants. In theory, these solutions can be extended to the malicious model using standard techniques like commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs. However, these techniques are often expensive, especially when the data sizes are large. In this paper, we investigate alternative ways to convert solutions in the semi-honest model to the malicious model. We take two classical solutions as examples, one of which can be extended to the malicious model with only slight modifications while another requires a careful redesign of the protocol. In both cases, our solutions for the malicious model are much more efficient than the zero-knowledge proofs based solutions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, CM; Chen, YY; Liu, CY				Chen, Chih-Ming; Chen, Yi-Yun; Liu, Chao-Yu			Learning performance assessment approach using Web-based learning portfolios for e-learning systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						data mining; learning performance assessment; Web-based learning; Web-based learning portfolio	FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES; ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; ALGORITHMS	Learning performance assessment using learning portfolios or Web log data is essential in the Web-based learning field, owing to the rapid growth of e-learning systems globally and lack of assisted authoring tools for Web-based learning performance assessment. The traditional summative evaluation by performing examinations or feedback forms can be employed to evaluate the learning performance for both traditional classroom learning and Web-based learning environments. However, summative evaluation only considers final learning outcomes without considering learning processes of learners. This means that the interactively controlled learning based on the immediate feedback of learning performance cannot be performed in a Web-based learning system. Based on the reasons mentioned earlier, this study presents a data-mining-based learning performance assessment scheme by combining four computational intelligence theories, i.e., gray relational analysis (GRA), K-means clustering scheme, fuzzy association rule mining, and fuzzy inference, in order to identify the learning performance assessment rules using the gathered Web-based learning portfolios of an individual learner. Experimental results indicated that the evaluation results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative assessment results. In other words, this scheme can help teachers assess the learning performance of the individual learner precisely utilizing only the learning portfolios in a Web-based learning environment. Therefore, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and designing courseware since they save a lot of time in evaluating learning performance. More significantly, teachers could understand the factors influencing learning performance in a Web-based learning environment according to the obtained interpretable learning performance assessment rules. Besides, teachers can also tune teaching strategies for learners with various learning performances. This result also provides useful information to Web-based learning systems to perform personalized learning mechanisms for individual learners.

J	Sommer, S; Kramer, S				Sommer, Selina; Kramer, Stefan			Three data mining techniques to improve lazy structure-activity relationships for noncongeneric compounds	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							AUTOMATED STRUCTURE EVALUATION; PROGRAM; MUTAGENICITY; ASSAY	We present three simple, yet effective data mining techniques for lazy structure-activity relationships (SARs) of noncongeneric compounds. In lazy SARs, classifications are particularly tailored for each test compound. Therefore, it is possible to make the most of the structure of a test compound. In our case, we derive its substructures and use them to determine similar structures. To obtain a well-balanced and representative set of structural descriptors, we enrich this set by strongly activating or deactivating fragments from the training set and subsequently remove redundant fragments. Finally, we perform k-Nearest Neighbor classification for several values of k and take a vote among the resulting predictions. These techniques (enrichment, removing redundancy, and voting) are integrated into the system iSAR (instance-based structure-activity relationships) and tested individually to show the relative contribution to the system's performance. Experiments on three data sets indicate that this simple and lightweight approach performs at least on the same level as other, more complex approaches.

This paper proposes a new approach for estimating local linear models, in which linear fuzzy clustering is performed by selecting variables that are useful for extracting correlation structure in each cluster. The new clustering model uses two types of memberships. One is the conventional membership that represents the degree of membership of each sample in each cluster. The other is the additional parameter that represents the relative responsibility of each variable for estimation of local linear models. The additional membership takes large values when the variable has close relationship with local principal components, and is calculated by using the graded possibilistic approach. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is useful for identifying local linear model taking typicality of each variable into account.

Nonlinear estimators and tail bounds for dimension reduction in l(1) using Cauchy random projections	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						dimension reduction; l(1) norm; Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma; Cauchy random projections	INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS; SYMMETRIC STABLE DISTRIBUTIONS; MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS; SCALE PARAMETERS; STATISTICAL PROPERTIES; JOHNSON-LINDENSTRAUSS; LOCATION; REGRESSION	For(1) dimension reduction in the l(1) norm, the method of Cauchy random projections multiplies the original data matrix A epsilon R-nxD with a random matrix R epsilon R-Dxk (k<<D) whose entries are i.i.d. samples of the standard Cauchy C (0, 1). Because of the impossibility result, one can not hope to recover the pairwise l(1) distances in A from B = AxR epsilon R-nxk, using linear estimators without incurring large errors. However, nonlinear estimators are still useful for certain applications in data stream computations, information retrieval, learning, and data mining. We study three types of nonlinear estimators: the sample median estimators, the geometric mean estimators, and the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE). We derive tail bounds for the geometric mean estimators and establish that k = O (logn/epsilon(2)) suffices with the constants explicitly given. Asymptotically (as k ->infinity), both the sample median and the geometric mean estimators are about 80% efficient compared to the MLE. We analyze the moments of the MLE and propose approximating its distribution of by an inverse Gaussian.

J	Zubcoff, J; Trujillo, J				Zubcoff, Jose; Trujillo, Juan			A UML 2.0 profile to design Association Rule mining models in the multidimensional conceptual modeling of data warehouses	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2005)	AUG 22-26, 2005	Copenhagen, DENMARK			data warehouse; UML profile; conceptual modeling; multidimensional modeling; data mining; KDD; association rules		By using data mining techniques, the data stored in a Data Warehouse (DW) can be analyzed for the purpose of uncovering and predicting hidden patterns within the data. So far, different approaches have been proposed to accomplish the conceptual design of DWs by following the multidimensional (MD) modeling paradigm. In previous work, we have proposed a UML profile for DWs enabling the specification of main MD properties at conceptual level. This paper presents a novel approach to integrating data mining models into multidimensional models in order to accomplish the conceptual design of DWs with Association Rules (AR). To this goal, we extend our previous work by providing another UML profile that allows us to specify Association Rules mining models for DW at conceptual level in a clear and expressive way. The main advantage of our proposal is that the Association Rules rely on the goals and user requirements of the Data Warehouse, instead of the traditional method of specifying Association Rules by considering only the final database implementation structures such as tables, rows or columns. In this way, ARs are specified in the early stages of a DW project, thus reducing the development time and cost.

First-order temporal pattern mining with regular expression constraints	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Brazilian Symposium on Databases	OCT 03-07, 2005	Uberlandia, BRAZIL	Brazilian Comp Soc		temporal data mining; frequent sequential patterns; regular expression constraints; constraint-based mining	SEQUENCES	Previous studies on mining sequential patterns have focused on temporal patterns specified by some form of propositional temporal logic. However, there. are some interesting sequential patterns, such as the multi-sequential patterns, whose specification needs a more expressive formalism, the first-order temporal logic. Multi-sequential patterns appear in different application contexts, for instance in spatial census data mining, which is the target application of the study developed in this paper. We extend a well-known user-controlled tool, based on regular expressions constraints, to the multi-sequential pattern context. This specification tool enables the incorporation of user focus into the mining process. We present MSP-Miner, an Apriori-based algorithm to discover all frequent multi-sequential patterns satisfying a user-specified regular expression constraint. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Huang, YP; Kao, LJ; Sandnes, FE				Huang, Yo-Ping; Kao, Li-Jen; Sandnes, Frode-Eika			Predicting ocean salinity and temperature variations using data mining and fuzzy inference	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy inter-transaction association rule mining; spatial-temporal data mining; fuzzy inference; climate change	COLOCATION PATTERNS; SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	Global ocean salinity/temperature variations are attracting increasing attention, due to their influence on ocean-atmospheric changes and their potential for improved climate forecasting. The goal is to analyze historic salinity/temperature data to make predictions about future variations. Traditional statistical models that assume data independence are not applicable as ocean data are often inter-related. Association rules mining can be used to find interesting salinity and temperature patterns, however, the traditional method ignores spatial and temporal information in the data. This study proposes a strategy that employs inter-transaction association rules mining to discover salinity/temperature patterns where spatial/temporal relationships are considered. Next, a fuzzy inference is used to predict salinity/temperature variations. The fuzzy inference rules are derived from a set of inter-transaction association rules that are discovered from Argo data. The strategy is highly efficient as a reduced prefix-projected itemset algorithm with a small space and time complexity is employed in the search for large inter-transaction itemsets. This proposed strategy is unsupervised as it does not rely on domain experts for designing the fuzzy rule base. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively predicts abnormal salinity/temperature variations.

J	Sandborn, PA; Mauro, F; Knox, R				Sandborn, Peter A.; Mauro, Frank; Knox, Ron			A data mining based approach to electronic part obsolescence forecasting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						data mining; diminishing manufacturing sources and materials shortages (DMSMS); electronic parts; flash memory; life cycle stages; memory modules; obsolescence		Many technologies have life cycles that are shorter than the life cycle of the product they are in. Life cycle mismatches caused by the obsolescence of technology (and particularly the obsolescence of electronic parts) results in high sustainment costs for long field life systems, e.g., avionics and military systems. This paper demonstrates the use of data mining based algorithms to augment commercial obsolescence risk databases thus improving their predictive capabilities. The method is a combination of life cycle curve forecasting and the determination of electronic part vendor-specific windows of obsolescence using data mining of historical last-order or last-ship dates. The extended methodology not only enables more accurate obsolescence forecasts but can also generate forecasts for user-specified confidence levels. The methodology has been demonstrated on both individual parts and modules.

J	Steinbach, M; Kumar, V				Steinbach, Michael; Kumar, Vipin			Generalizing the notion of confidence	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						confidence; support; association rules; error-tolerant itemsets; data mining		In this paper, we explore extending association analysis to non-traditional types of patterns and non-binary data by generalizing the notion of confidence. We begin by describing a general framework that measures the strength of the connection between two association patterns by the extent to which the strength of one association pattern provides information about the strength of another. Although this framework can serve as the basis for designing or analyzing measures of association, the focus in this paper is to use the framework as the basis for extending the traditional concept of confidence to error-tolerant itemsets (ETIs) and continuous data. To that end, we provide two examples. First, we (1) describe an approach to defining confidence for ETIs that preserves the interpretation of confidence as an estimate of a conditional probability, and (2) show how association rules based on ETIs can have better coverage (at an equivalent confidence level) than rules based on traditional itemsets. Next, we derive a confidence measure for continuous data that agrees with the standard confidence measure when applied to binary transaction data. Further analysis of this result exposes some of the important issues involved in constructing a confidence measure for continuous data.

In this paper, we use a model-tree-based regression technique (namely, N15) and support vector machine (SVM) for regression to develop learning-based systems for predicting the adequacy of a vancomycin regimen. We empirically evaluate each system's accuracy in predicting patients' peak and trough concentrations in different clinical scenarios characterized by renal functions and regimen types. Our data consist of 1099 clinical cases that were collected from a major tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan. We also examine the use of Bagging for enhancing the prediction power of the respective systems and include in our evaluation a salient one-compartment model for performance benchmark purposes. Overall, our evaluation results suggest that both M5 and SVM are significantly more accurate than the benchmark one-compartment model in predicting patients' peak and trough concentrations across all investigated clinical scenarios. M5 appears to benefit considerably from Bagging, which has a positive but seemingly smaller effect on SVM. Taken together, our findings indicate supervised learning techniques that are capable of effectively supporting clinicians' use of vancomycin or similar high-alert drugs in their patient care and management.

These data exist in useful and understandable patterns. Data management of time series data must take into account an integrated approach. However, many researches face numeric data attributes. Therefore, the need for time series data mining tool has become extremely important. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel pattern in mining architecture with mixed attributes that uses a systematic approach in the financial database information mining. Time series pattern mining (TSPM) architecture combines the extended visualization-induced self-organizing map algorithm and the extended Naive Bayesian algorithm. This mining architecture can simulate human intelligence and discover patterns automatically. The TSPM approach also demonstrates good returns in pattern research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

NOCEA: A rule-based evolutionary algorithm for efficient and effective clustering of massive high-dimensional databases	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; clustering; evolutionary algorithms; rule extraction; earthquake analysis	ACTIVE CRUSTAL DEFORMATION	Clustering is a descriptive data mining task aiming to group the data into homogeneous groups. This paper presents a novel evolutionary algorithm ( NOCEA) that efficiently and effectively clusters massive numerical databases. NOCEA evolves individuals of variable-length consisting of disjoint and axis-aligned hyper-rectangular rules with homogeneous data distribution. The antecedent part of the rules includes an interval-like condition for each dimension. A novel quantisation algorithm imposes a regular multi-dimensional grid structure onto the data space to reduce the search combinations. Due to quantisation the boundaries of the intervals are encoded as integer values. The evolutionary search is guided by a simple data coverage maximisation function. The enormous data space is effectively explored by task-specific recombination and mutation operators producing candidate solutions with no overlapping rules. A parsimony generalisation operator shortens the discovered knowledge by replacing adjacent rules with more generic ones. NOCEA employs a special homogeneity operator that enforces quasi-uniform data distribution in the space enclosed by the candidate rules. After convergence the discovered knowledge undergoes simplification to perform subspace clustering, and to assemble the clusters. Results using real-world datasets are included to show that NOCEA has several attractive properties for clustering including: ( a) comprehensible output in the form of disjoint and homogeneous rules, ( b) the ability to discover clusters of arbitrary shape, density, size, and data coverage, ( c) ability to perform effective subspace clustering, ( d) near linear scalability with the database size, data and cluster dimensionality, and ( e) substantial potential for task parallelism ( speedup of 13.8 on 16 processors). A real-world example is a detailed study of the seismicity along the African-Eurasian-Arabian plate boundaries. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Yun, U				Yun, Unil			WIS: Weighted interesting sequential pattern mining with a similar level of support and/or weight	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						data mining; weighted sequential pattern mining; affinity pattern	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FREQUENT SEQUENCES; PREFIXSPAN; GROWTH	Sequential pattern mining has become an essential task with broad applications. Most sequential pattern mining algorithms use a minimum support threshold to prune the combinatorial search space. This strategy provides basic pruning; however, it cannot mine correlated sequential patterns with similar support and/or weight levels. If the minimum support is low, many spurious patterns having items with different support levels are found; if the minimum support is high, meaningful sequential patterns with low support levels may be missed. We present a new algorithm, weighted interesting sequential (WIS) pattern mining based on a pattern growth method in which new measures, sequential s-confidence and w-confidence, are suggested. Using these measures, weighted interesting sequential patterns with similar levels of support and/or weight are mined. The WIS algorithm gives a balance between the measures of support and weight, and considers correlation between items within sequential patterns. A performance analysis shows that WIS is efficient and scalable in weighted sequential pattern mining.

A retraining methodology for enhancing agent intelligence	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; multi-agent systems; agent intelligence; training; retraining		Data mining has proven a successful gateway for discovering useful knowledge and for enhancing business intelligence in a range of application fields. Incorporating this knowledge into already deployed applications, though, is highly impractical, since it requires reconfigurable software architectures, as well as human expert consulting. In an attempt to overcome this deficiency, we have developed Agent Academy, an integrated development framework that supports both design and control of multi-agent systems (MAS), as well as "agent training". We define agent training as the automated incorporation of logic structures generated through data mining into the agents of the system. The increased flexibility and cooperation primitives of MAS, augmented with the training and retraining capabilities of Agent Academy, provide a powerful means for the dynamic exploitation of data mining extracted knowledge. In this paper, we present the methodology and tools for agent retraining. Through experimented results with the Agent Academy platform, we demonstrate how the extracted knowledge can be formulated and how retraining can lead to the improvement - in the long run - of agent intelligence.

By using the association rule paradigm and a statistical measure, this method relies on the following idea: "An entity A will be more specific than or equivalent to an entity B if the vocabulary used to describe A and its instances tends to be included in that of B and its instances". This approach is divided into two parts: (1) The representation of each entity by a set of relevant terms and data; (2) The discovery of binary association rules between entities. The selection of rules uses two criteria for assessing the implication quality and reducing redundancy. The method is evaluated on two benchmarks. The first contains two hierarchies indexing textual documents and the second one is composed of OWL ontologies.

J	Jiao, JXR; Zhang, LFL; Pokharel, S; He, Z				Jiao, Jianxin Roger; Zhang, Lianfeng Linda; Pokharel, Shaligram; He, Zhen			Identifying generic routings for product families based on text mining and tree matching	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						mass customization; data mining; product family; process configuration; operations routing; product variety; text mining; tree matching; generic representation	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; MODULAR PRODUCTS; DESIGN; BILLS; CONFIGURATION; METHODOLOGY; BUSINESS; SUPPORT; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Product customization leads to an exponentially increased number of product and process variants, which exaggerates the difficulties in building up customization capabilities for make-to-order production systems. It is imperative for companies to configure existing operations routings by exploiting similarities among product and process families so as to take advantage of repetitions. Corresponding to a product family, a process family comprises a set of similar production processes that share certain common operations routings (namely, generic routings). In addition to leveraging the costs of delivering variety, exploiting process families around generic routings can reduce development risks by reusing existing facilities and proven process elements. This paper applies data mining techniques to identify generic routings from large amount of production information and process data available in a firm's legacy systems. Generic routing identification encompasses three consecutive stages, including routing similarity measure, routing clustering and routing unification. Text mining and tree matching techniques are applied to cope with the textual and structural types of data underlying generic routings.

Any method of data analysis intended to support the clinical decision-making process should meet several criteria: it should capture clinically relevant features, be computationally feasible, and provide easily interpretable results. In an initial study, we examined the feasibility of using Zernike polynomials to represent biomedical instrument data in conjunction with a decision tree classifier to distinguish between the diseased and non-diseased eyes. Here, we provide a comprehensive follow-up to that work, examining a second representation pseudo-Zernike polynomials, to determine whether they provide any increase in classification accuracy. We compare the fidelity of both methods using residual root-mean-square (rms) error and evaluate accuracy using several classifiers: neural networks, C4.5 decision trees, Voting Feature Intervals, and Naive Bayes. We also examine the effect of several meta-learning strategies: boosting, bagging, and Random Forests (RFs). We present results comparing accuracy as it relates to dataset and transformation resolution over a larger, more challenging, multi-class dataset. They show that classification accuracy is similar for both data transformations, but differs by classifier. We find that the Zernike polynomials provide better feature representation than the pseudo-Zernikes and that the decision trees yield the best balance of classification accuracy and interpretability.

This method is designated to visualize large multidimensional data. The method encompasses application of multidimensional scaling (MDS) to the so-called basic vector set and further mapping of the remaining vectors from the analyzed data set. In the original algorithm of relative MDS, the visualization process is divided into three steps: the set of basis vectors is constructed using the k-means clustering method; this set is projected onto the plane using the MDS algorithm; the set of remaining data is visualized using the relative mapping algorithm. We propose a modification, which differs from the original algorithm in the strategy of selecting the basis vectors. The experimental investigation has shown that the modification exceeds the original algorithm in the visualization quality and computational expenses. The conditions, where the relative MDS efficiency exceeds that of standard MDS, are estimated.

J	Borzemski, L				Borzemski, Leszek			Internet path behavior prediction via data mining: Conceptual framework and case study	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	KES Conference 2005	SEP, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRIA			Grids; network behavior prediction; knowledge management; data mining; Internet performance; end-to-end-performance	PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS	In this paper we propose an application of data mining methods in the prediction of the availability and performance of Internet paths. We deploy a general decision-making method for advising the users in further usage of Internet path at particular time and date. The method is based on the clustering and tree classification data mining techniques. The usefulness of our method for prediction the Internet path behavior has been confirmed in real-life experiment. The active Internet measurements were performed to gather the end-to-end latency and packet routing information. The knowledge gathered has been analyzed using a professional data mining package via neural clustering and decision tree algorithms. The results show that the data mining can be efficiently used for the purpose of the forecasting the network behavior. We propose to build a network performance monitoring and prediction service based on proposed data mining procedure. We address our approach especially to the non-networkers of such networking frameworks as Grid and overlay networks who want to schedule their network activity but who want to be left free from networking issues to concentrate on their work.

It starts from the fact that MAS are a particular type of distributed systems in which the active entities are autonomous in the sense that behavior and knowledge of the whole system is distributed among agents. It situates the problem by firstly studying the classical approaches for conventional code debugging and also the techniques used in distributed systems in general. From this initial perspective, it tries to situate agent and multi-agent systems debugging. It finally proposes the use of conventional data mining tasks like clustering to, by summarising, help in debugging huge MAS.

As a matter of fact, graphs offer a versatile alternative to feature vectors in pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable methods for graph classification. Graph kernels, a novel class of algorithms for pattern analysis, offer an elegant solution to this problem. Graph kernels aim at bridging the gap between statistical and symbolic object representations. In the present paper we propose a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of graph edit distance. As a matter of fact, this approach results in a novel family of graph kernels making a wide range of kernel machines applicable for graphs. With several experimental results we prove the robustness and flexibility of our new method and show that our approach outperforms a standard graph classification method on several graph data sets of diverse nature.

J	Hahsler, M; Hornik, K				Hahsler, Michael; Hornik, Kurt			New probabilistic interest measures for association rules	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; association rules; measures of interestingness; probabilistic data modeling	TRANSACTION DATA; MODELS	Mining association rules is an important technique for discovering meaningful patterns in transaction databases. Many different measures of interestingness have been proposed for association rules. However, these measures fail to take the probabilistic properties of the mined data into account. We start this paper with presenting a simple probabilistic framework for transaction data which can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations are present. We use such data and a real-world database from a grocery outlet to explore the behavior of confidence and lift, two popular interest measures used for rule mining. The results show that confidence is systematically influenced by the frequency of the items in the left hand side of rules and that lift performs poorly to filter random noise in transaction data. Based on the probabilistic framework we develop two new interest measures, hyper-lift and hyper-confidence, which can be used to filter or order mined association rules. The new measures show significantly better performance than lift for applications where spurious rules are problematic.

Parties compute whatever is needed, communicate correctly following the rules, and do not collude with other parties for exposing third party's sensitive data. This paper argues that most of these assumptions fall apart in real-life applications of privacy-preserving distributed data mining (PPDM). This paper offers a more realistic formulation of the PPDM problem as a multi-party game where each party tries to maximize its own objectives. It develops a game-theoretic framework to analyze the behavior of each party in such games and presents detailed analysis of the well known secure sum computation as an example.

Owing to the nature of Internet auctions, e.g. high degree of anonymity, relaxed legal constraints, and low costs for entry and exit, etc..., fraudsters are easily to setup a scam or deception in auction activities. Undeniable fact is that information asymmetry between sellers and buyers and lacking of immediately examining authenticity of the merchandise, the buyer can't verify the seller and the characteristics of the merchandise until after the transaction is completed. This paper proposes a simple method which is detected potential fraudster by social network analysis (SNA) and decision tree to provide a feasible mechanism of playing capable guardians in buyers' auction activities. Through our simple method, buyers can easily avoid defraud in auction activities.

The volume of data gathered from position sensors of mobile phones, PDAs, or vehicles, defies human ability to analyze the stream of input data. On the other hand, vast amounts of gathered data hide interesting and valuable knowledge patterns describing the behavior of moving objects. Thus, new algorithms for mining moving object data are required to unearth this knowledge. An important function of the mobile objects management system is the prediction of the unknown location of an object. In this paper we introduce a data mining approach to the problem of predicting the location of a moving object. We mine the database of moving object locations to discover frequent trajectories and movement rules. Then, we match the trajectory of a moving object with the database of movement rules to build a probabilistic model of object location. Experimental evaluation of the proposal reveals prediction accuracy close to 80%. Our original contribution includes the elaboration on the location prediction model, the design of an efficient mining algorithm, introduction of movement rule matching strategies, and a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed model.

While this provides a useful aid in descriptive data mining, it is difficult to see how the rules produced can be combined usefully to make a predictive classifier. This paper describes how, by using a more complex representation of the rules, it is possible to produce effective classifiers for two class problems. Furthermore, through the use of multi-objective genetic programming, the user can be provided with a selection of classifiers providing different trade-offs between the misclassification costs and the overall model complexity.

A comparative study of unsupervised machine learning and data mining techniques for intrusion detection	Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 18-20, 2007	Leipzig, GERMANY				OUTLIERS	During the past number of years, machine learning and data mining techniques have received considerable attention among the intrusion detection researchers to address the weaknesses of knowledgebase detection techniques. This has led to the application of various supervised and unsupervised techniques for the purpose of intrusion detection. In this paper, we conduct a set of experiments to analyze the performance of unsupervised techniques considering their main design choices. These include the heuristics proposed for distinguishing abnormal data from normal data and the distribution of dataset used for training. We evaluate the performance of the techniques with various distributions of training and test datasets, which are constructed from KDD99 dataset, a widely accepted resource for IDS evaluations. This comparative study is not only a blind comparison between unsupervised techniques, but also gives some guidelines to researchers and practitioners on applying these techniques to the area of intrusion detection.

A fundamental result was missing there, namely the second half of the equivalent of the main theorem of Formal Concept Analysis. In this continuation we introduce the structural lattice of such generalised contexts, providing a limited equivalent to the main theorem of K-Formal Concept Analysis which allows to interpret the standard version as a privileged case in yet another direction. We motivate our results by providing instances of their use to analyse the confusion matrices of multiple-input multiple-output classifiers.

J	Vaughan, L; Kipp, M; Gao, Y				Vaughan, Liwen; Kipp, Margaret; Gao, Yijun			Are co-linked business web sites really related ? A link classification study	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						worldwide web; content management; business environment	INFORMATION; HYPERLINKS; WEBSITES	Purpose - The purpose of this article is to examine the reasons for the creation of co-links between pairs of business web sites. Specifically, to determine whether co-linked business web sites are really related. Design/methodology/approach - Co-links to 32 telecommunications companies were retrieved using Yahoo! and a random sample of 495 co-linking pages (the page that initiated the co-link) were selected for a content analysis. The context of the co-link and the content of the co-linking page were manually examined to record the following data: type of web site and the reason for the creation of the co-link. Findings - The study found that 61.4 per cent of co-links were created to connected pairs of highly related businesses (related companies, related products, and related services). Only 14.7 per cent of co-links were created for non-business reasons. The remaining 23.8 per cent of co-linked sites showed a loose or marginal business relationship. The study also found that co-links targeting home pages (as opposed to non-homepages) were more likely to connect related businesses. Furthermore, co-links coming from commercial sites (as opposed to other sites such as educational sites) are more likely to link related businesses. Originality/value - The findings from this content analysis study confirm results from previous quantitative studies that showed that web co-links measure relatedness of co-linked sites and that co-links can be objects of web data mining. The study contributes to our understanding of link motivations and the web linking phenomenon in general. The difference between links to homepages and that to non-homepages found in the study can guide us in co-link data collection.

In the past this has been done by statistical or purely visual methods but automated sequential pattern analysis through sophisticated data mining and visualization tools for pattern location. and evaluation can open up new possibilities for interactive exploration of the data. This paper describes the addition of a sequential pattern identification method to the visual activity-analysis tool, VISUAL-TimePAcTS, and its effectiveness in the process of pattern. analysis in social science diary data. The results have shown that the method correctly identifies patterns and conveys them effectively to the social scientist in a manner that allows them quick and easy understanding of the significance of the patterns.

In the past, delay test data has been overlooked in the correlation study. In this paper, we take path delay testing as an example to illustrate how test data can be incorporated in the overall design-silicon correlation effort. We describe a path-based methodology that correlates measured path delays from the good chips, to the path delays predicted by timing analysis. We discuss how statistical data mining can be employed for extracting information and show experimental results to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.

J	Wurst, M; Morik, K				Wurst, Michael; Morik, Katharina			Distributed feature extraction in a p2p setting - a case study	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING THEORY METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; distributed architectures; collaborative computing		Finding the right data representation is essential for virtually every data mining application. In this work we describe an approach to collaborative feature extraction, selection and aggregation in distributed, loosely coupled domains. In contrast to other work in the field of distributed data mining, we focus on scenarios in which a large number of loosely coupled nodes apply data mining to different, usually very small and overlapping, subsets of the entire data space. The aim is not to find a global concept to cover all data, but to learn a set of local concepts. Our prototypical application is a distributed media organization platform, called Nemoz, that assists users in maintaining their media collections. We propose two models for collaborative feature extraction, selection and aggregation for supervised data mining. One is based on a centralized p2p architecture, and the other on a fully distributed p2p architecture. We compare both models on a real world data set and discuss their advantages and problems.

Traditional signature-based antivirus systems fail to detect polymorphic and new, previously unseen malicious executables. In this paper, resting on the analysis of Windows API execution sequences called by PE files, we develop the Intelligent Malware Detection System (IMDS) using Objective-Oriented Association (OOA) mining based classification. IMDS is an integrated system consisting of three major modules: PE parser, OOA rule generator, and rule based classifier. An OOA_Fast_FP-Growth algorithm is adapted to efficiently generate OOA rules for classification. A comprehensive experimental study on a large collection of PE files obtained from the anti-virus laboratory of King-Soft Corporation is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our IMDS system outperform popular anti-virus software such as Norton AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan, as well as previous data mining based detection systems which employed Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree techniques.

A new challenge to feature selection is the so-called "small labeled-sample problem" in which labeled data is small and unlabeled data is large. The paucity of labeled instances provides insufficient information about the structure of the target concept, and can cause supervised feature selection algorithms to fail. Unsupervised feature selection algorithms can work without labeled data. However, these algorithms ignore label information, which may lead to performance deterioration. In this work, we propose to use both (small) labeled and (large) unlabeled data in feature selection, which is a topic has not yet been addressed in feature selection research. We present a semi-supervised feature selection, algorithm based on spectral analysis. The algorithm exploits both labeled and unlabeled data through a regularization framework, which provides an effective way to address the "small labeled-sample" problem. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our approach and confirmed that small labeled samples can help feature selection with unlabeled data.

J	Chang, JH; Lee, WS				Chang, Joong Hyuk; Lee, Won Suk			Finding recently frequent itemsets adaptively over online transactional data streams	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						recently frequent itemsets; data streams; information decay; decay rate; delayed insertion; itemset pruning; lexicographic tree	GENERATION; ALGORITHM; DATABASES	A data stream is a massive unbounded sequence of data elements continuously generated at a rapid rate. Consequently, the knowledge embedded in a data stream is more likely to be changed as time goes by. Identifying the recent change of a data stream, especially for an online data stream, can provide valuable information for the analysis of the data stream. However, most of mining algorithms or frequency approximation algorithms over a data stream do not differentiate the information of recently generated data elements from the obsolete information of old data elements which may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present. Therefore, they are not able to extract the recent change of information in a data stream adaptively. This paper proposes a data mining method for finding recently frequent itemsets adaptively over an online transactional data stream. The effect of old transactions on the current mining result of a data steam is diminished by decaying the old occurrences of each itemset as time goes by. Furthermore, several optimization techniques are devised to minimize processing time as well as memory usage. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This requirement implies that the semantics of the data should be incorporated into the mining process. Data mining is ready to deal with this challenge because recent developments in data mining have shown an increasing interest on mining of complex data (as exemplified by graph mining, text mining, etc.). By incorporating the relationships of the data along with the data itself (rather than focusing on the data alone), complex data injects semantics into the mining process, thus enhancing the potential of making better contribution to knowledge economy. Since the relationships between the data reveal certain behavioral aspects underlying the plain data, this shift of mining from simple data to complex data signals a fundamental change to a new stage in the research and practice of knowledge discovery, which can be termed as behavior mining. Behavior mining also has the potential of unifying some other recent activities in data mining. We discuss important aspects on behavior mining, and discuss its implications for the future of data mining.

In order to ameliorate the criterion, we propose a new method of match as the substitution of confidence. We analyze in detail the property of the proposed measurement. Experimental results show that the generated rules by the improved method reveal high correlation between the antecedent and the consequent when the rules were compared with that produced by the support-confidence framework. Furthermore, the improved method decreases the generation of redundant rules. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, DS; Gahegan, M				Guo, Diansheng; Gahegan, Mark			Spatial ordering and encoding for geographic data mining and visualization	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						spatial data mining; spatio-temporal visualization; space-filling curve; hierarchical clustering; linear ordering; multidimensional scaling	SPACE-FILLING CURVES; RULES	Geographic information (e.g., locations, networks, and nearest neighbors) are unique and different from other aspatial attributes (e.g., population, sales, or income). It is a challenging problem in spatial data mining and visualization to take into account both the geographic information and multiple aspatial variables in the detection of patterns. To tackle this problem, we present and evaluate a variety of spatial ordering methods that can transform spatial relations into a one-dimensional ordering and encoding which preserves spatial locality as much possible. The ordering can then be used to spatially sort temporal or multivariate data series and thus help reveal patterns across different spaces. The encoding, as a materialization of spatial clusters and neighboring relations, is also amenable for processing together with aspatial variables by any existing (non-spatial) data mining methods. We design a set of measures to evaluate nine different ordering/encoding methods, including two space-filling curves, six hierarchical clustering based methods, and a one-dimensional Sammon mapping (a multidimensional scaling approach). Evaluation results with various data distributions show that the optimal ordering/encoding with the complete-linkage clustering consistently gives the best overall performance, surpassing well-known space-filling curves in preserving spatial locality. Moreover, clustering-based methods can encode not only simple geographic locations, e.g., x and y coordinates, but also a wide range of other spatial relations, e.g., network distances or arbitrarily weighted graphs.

J	Borges, J; Levene, M				Borges, Jose; Levene, Mark			Ranking pages by topology and popularity within web sites	WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						web data mining; web usage mining; Page Rank; Popularity Rank; Site Rank	FRAMEWORK	We compare two link analysis ranking methods of web pages in a site. The first, called Site Rank, is an adaptation of PageRank to the granularity of a web site and the second, called Popularity Rank, is based on the frequencies of user clicks on the outlinks in a page that are captured by navigation sessions of users through the web site. We ran experiments on artificially created web sites of different sizes and on two real data sets, employing the relative entropy to compare the distributions of the two ranking methods. For the real data sets we also employ a nonparametric measure, called Spearman's footrule, which we use to compare the top-ten web pages ranked by the two methods. Our main result is that the distributions of the Popularity Rank and Site Rank are surprisingly close to each other, implying that the topology of a web site is very instrumental in guiding users through the site.

Current IDS do not provide support for historical data analysis and data summarization. This paper presents techniques to model network traffic and alerts using a multi-dimensional data model and star schemas. This data model was used to perform network security analysis and detect denial of service attacks. Our data model can also be used to handle heterogeneous data sources (e.g. firewall logs, system calls, net-flow data) and enable up to two orders of magnitude faster query response times for analysts as compared to the current state of the art. We have used our techniques to implement a prototype system that is being successfully used at Army Research Labs. Our system has helped the security analyst in detecting intrusions and in historical data analysis for generating reports on trend analysis.

This study differs from other missing value handling research in that it does not handle missing values but builds a rule-based classification model to tolerate missing values. Based on a commonly used rule-based classification model, we characterize the robustness of a hierarchy of rule sets as k-optimal rule sets with the decreasing size corresponding to the decreasing robustness. We build classifiers based on k-optimal rule sets and show experimentally that they are more robust than some benchmark rule-based classifiers, such as C4.5rules and CBA. We also show that the proposed approach is better than two well-known missing value handling methods for missing values in test data.

J	Liu, Y; Sung, SY; Xiong, H				Liu, Y; Sung, SY; Xiong, H			A cubic-wise balance approach for privacy preservation in data cubes	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data warehouse; OLAP; privacy preservation; range query; data perturbation	DATABASES; SECURITY	A data warehouse stores current and historical records consolidated from multiple transactional systems. Securing data warehouses is of ever-increasing interest, especially considering areas where data are sold in pieces to third parties for data mining practices. In this case, existing data warehouse security techniques, Such as data access control, may not be easy to enforce and can be ineffective. Instead, this paper proposes a data perturbation based approach, called the cubic-wise balance method, to provide privacy preserving range queries on data cubes in a data warehouse. This approach is motivated by the following observation: analysts are usually interested in summary data rather than individual data values. Indeed, our approach can provide a closely estimated summary data for range queries without providing access to actual individual data values. As demonstrated by our experimental results on APB benchmark data set from the OLAP council, the cubic-wise balance method can achieve both better privacy preservation and better range query accuracy than random data perturbation alternatives.

J	Li, ST; Shue, LY; Lee, SF				Li, ST; Shue, LY; Lee, SF			Enabling customer relationship management in ISP services through mining usage patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						customer relationship management; Internet service provider; attribute-oriented induction; customer knowledge rules; visual data mining		The monopoly of state ownership of telecommunication industry in Taiwan was lifted in 1997. In choosing an ISP, pricing was and still is a main differentiating factor in the mind of customers; however, service quality has emerged as a major concern among users lately. Management of ISP has discovered that service quality is important not only for attracting new customers, but, more importantly, for retaining existing customers who may otherwise be lured away by lower fees. Hence, it is essential to develop a CRM system, which could help keeping existing customers and exploring further business opportunities at the same time. In this study, we, based on the IP traffic data, developed a CRM systematic approach for a major ISP company in Taiwan to enhance customers' longer-term loyalty. This approach employs CRISP-DM methodology, and applies Attribute-Oriented Induction as the mining technique to discover network usage behaviors of customers, which help management identify usage pattern and also pinpoint the time when usage is excessively heavy. The former allows management to make effective personal calls for services or maintenance, and the latter presents opportunities for management to offer personalized cares and advanced products. Pixel-oriented visualization is applied to improve the understanding of mining results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared to the traditional statistical and machine learning data analysis techniques, data mining emphasizes providing a convenient and complete environment for the data analysis. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework for visualized, exploratory data clustering, and pattern extraction from mixed data. We further discuss its implementation techniques: a generalized self-organizing map (GSOM) and an extended attribute-oriented induction (EAOI), which not only overcome the drawbacks of their original algorithms, but also provide additional analysis capabilities. Specifically, the GSOM facilitates the direct handling of mixed data, including categorical and numeric values The EAOI enables exploration for major values hidden in the data and, in addition, offers an alternative for processing numeric attributes, instead of generalizing them. A prototype was developed for experiments with synthetic and real data sets, and comparison with those of the traditional approaches. The results confirmed the feasibility of the framework and the superiority of the extended techniques.

This trade-off is investigated in the context of correlated pattern mining, which is concerned with finding the k-best patterns according to a convex criterion, for the pattern languages of itemsets, multi-itemsets, sequences, trees and graphs. The criteria used in our investigation are the typical ones in data mining: computational cost and predictive accuracy and the domain is that of mining molecular graph databases. More specifically, we provide empirical answers to the following questions: how does the expressive power of the language affect the computational cost? and what is the trade-off between expressiveness of the pattern language and the predictive accuracy of the learned model? While answering the first question, we also introduce a novel stepwise approach to correlated pattern mining in which the results of mining a simpler pattern language are employed as a starting point for mining in a more complex one. This stepwise approach typically leads to significant speed-ups (up to a factor 1000) for mining graphs.

To this end, many methodologies have been developed. However, they either view data mining as an autonomous data-driven trial-and-error process, or only analyze the issues in an isolated and case-by-case manner. As a result, the knowledge discovered is often not actionable to constrained business. This paper proposes a practical perspective, referred to as domain-driven in-depth pattern discovery (DDID-PD). It presents a domain-driven view of discovering knowledge satisfying real business needs. Its main ideas include constraint mining, in-depth mining, human-cooperated mining, and loop-closed mining. We demonstrate its deployment in mining actionable trading strategies in Australian Stock Exchange data.

Among different data mining technique, classification analysis is widely adopted for healthcare applications for supporting medical diagnostic decisions, improving quality of patient care, etc. If a training dataset contains irrelevant features (i.e., attributes), classification analysis may produce less accurate and less understandable results. Two commonly employed feature selection approaches include use of automatic feature selection mechanisms (i.e., data-driven) or expert judgment (i.e., knowledge-driven). Due to differences in their underlying processes, the two prevailing feature selection approaches may have their unique biases that possibly lead to dissimilar classification effectiveness. In this study, we empirically evaluate the classification effectiveness resulted from the two feature selection approaches on a risk prediction of cardiovascular disease dataset. Our evaluation results suggest that the feature subsets selected domain experts improve the sensitivity of a classifier, while the feature subsets selected by an automatic feature selection mechanism improve the predictive power of a classifier on the majority class (i.e., the specificity in this study).			cts@mail.stut.edu.tw; cpwei@mx.nthu.edu.tw; tsengsm@mail.ncku.edu.tw					Anand S.

In this paper we present a two-stage classifier that improves its predictive accuracy by making use of the available unlabeled data. It uses a weighted nearest neighbor classification algorithm using the combined example-sets as a knowledge base. The examples from the unlabeled set are "pre-labeled" by an initial classifier that is build using the limited available training data. By choosing appropriate weights for this prelabeled data, the nearest neighbor classifier consistently improves on the original classifier.

AcouMotion's main components are (i) a sensor device for measuring motion parameters (ii) a computer simulation to represent the dynamical evolution of a model world, and (iii) a sonification engine which generates an auditory representation of objects and any interactions in the model world. The intended applications of AcouMotion range from new kinds of sport games that can be played without visual displays and therefore may be particularly interesting for people with visual impairment to further applications in data mining, physiotherapy and cognitive research. The first application of AcouMotion presented in this paper is Blindminton, a sport game similar to Badminton which is particularly adapted to the abilities of people with visual impairment. We describe our current system and its state of development, and we present first sound examples for interactive sonification using an early prototype. Finally, we discuss some interesting research directions based on the fact that AcouMotion binds auditory stimuli and body motion, and thus can represent a counterpart to the Eye-tracker device that exploits the binding of visual stimuli and eye-movement in cognitive research.

Although very powerful data mining techniques exist to extract classification models from data, the techniques often infer counter-intuitive patterns or lack patterns that are logical for domain experts. The problem of consolidating the knowledge extracted from the data with the knowledge representing the experience of domain experts, is called the knowledge fusion problem. Providing a proper solution for this problem is a key success factor for any data mining application. In this paper, we explain how the AntMiner+ classification technique can be extended to incorporate such domain knowledge. By changing the environment and influencing the heuristic values, we can respectively limit and direct the search of the ants to those regions of the solution space that the expert believes to be logical and intuitive.

Yet the data driven scientific models and data mining algorithms do not necessarily account for the inaccuracies when assimilating the data. Low overhead provenance collection partially solves this problem. We propose a data model and collection model for near real time provenance collection. We define a system architecture for stream provenance tracking and motivate with a real-world application in meteorology forecasting.

So, learning with unlabeled data has attracted much attention during the past few years. This paper shows that how such techniques can be helpful in a difficult task, content-based image retrieval, for improving the retrieval performance by exploiting images existing in the database.

J	Tan, S; Xu, H; Gu, J				Tan, Songbo; Xu, Hongbo; Gu, Jun			Efficient algorithms for attributes reduction problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						rough set; attributes reduction; discernibility matrix; data mining	ROUGH SETS; SYSTEMS	The theory of rough set, proposed by Pawlak, provides a formal tool for knowledge discovery from imprecise and incomplete data. Attributes reduction is a crucial problem for rough set based data mining. Unfortunately, finding minimal reduct turns out to be a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose a heuristic reduction algorithm HeuriRed and a complete heuristic reduction algorithm HeuriComRed based on discernibility matrix. The time and space requirements of two proposed algorithms are both O(\A\*\U\(2)). In our experiment, in order to investigate the robustness, efficiency and completeness of proposed algorithms, we execute our algorithms HeuriRed, HeuriComRed and genetic reduct on some problems from UCI repository. The experimental results not only indicate the robustness and efficiency of our algorithms, but also provide proofs for the completeness of our algorithm HeuriComRed.

The new tool, called maximal associations, is geared toward discovering associations that are frequently lost when using regular association rules. Intuitively, a maximal association rule X double right arrow(max) Y says that whenever X is the only item of its type in a transaction, than Y also appears, with some confidence. Maximal associations allow the discovery of associations pertaining to items that most often do not appear alone, but rather together with closely related items, and hence associations relevant only to these items tend to obtain low confidence. We provide a formal description of maximal association rules and efficient algorithms for discovering all such associations. We present the results of applying maximal association rules to two text corpora.

J	Palpanas, T; Koudas, N; Mendelzon, A				Palpanas, T; Koudas, N; Mendelzon, A			Using datacube aggregates for approximate querying and deviation detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data warehouse; datacube; approximate query answering; deviation detection		Much research has been devoted to the efficient computation of relational aggregations and, specifically, the efficient execution of the datacube operation. In this paper, we consider the inverse problem, that of deriving ( approximately) the original data from the aggregates. We motivate this problem in the context of two specific application areas, approximate query answering and data analysis. We propose a framework based on the notion of information entropy that enables us to estimate the original values in a data set, given only aggregated information about it. We then show how approximate queries on the data from which the aggregates were derived can be performed using our framework. We also describe an alternate use of the proposed framework that enables us to identify values that deviate from the underlying data distribution, suitable for data mining purposes. We present a detailed performance study of the algorithms using both real and synthetic data, highlighting the benefits of our approach as well as the efficiency of the proposed solutions. Finally, we evaluate our techniques with a case study on a real data set, which illustrates the applicability of our approach.

J	Lariviere, B; Van den Poel, D				Lariviere, B; Van den Poel, D			Investigating the post-complaint period by means of survival analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; customer relationship management; consumer complaint behavior; actual customer behavior; proportionality; survival forests	WORD-OF-MOUTH; CUSTOMER PERCEPTIONS; FINANCIAL SERVICES; PERCEIVED JUSTICE; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; SATISFACTION; INTENTIONS; REGRESSION; MANAGEMENT	Firms increasingly view each contact with their customers as an opportunity that needs to be managed. The primary purpose of this article is to gain a better understanding of the customers' post-complaint period. Specific focus is placed on the impact of effective complaint handling on actual customer behavior throughout the time, whereas previous research has mainly focused on time-invariant or intentional measures. Survival analysis techniques are used to investigate the longitudinal behavior of complainants after their problem recovery. The proportionality assumption is tested for each explanatory variable under investigation. In addition, the impact for each variable is estimated by means of survival forests. Survival forests enable us to explore the evolution over time of the effects of the covariates under investigation. As such, the impact of each explanatory variable is allowed to change when the experiment evolves over time, in contrast to `proportional' models that restrict these estimates to be stationary. Our research is performed in the context of a financial services provider and analyses the post-complaint periods of 2326 customers. Our findings indicate that (i) it is interesting to consider complainants since they represent a typical and rather active customer segment, (ii) furthermore, it is beneficiary to invest in complaint handling, since these investments are likely to influence customers' future behavior and (iii) survival forests are a helpful tool to investigate the impact of complaint handling on future customer behavior, since its components provide evidence of changing effects over time.

In real world data the knowledge used for mining rule is almost time varying. The item have the dynamic characteristic in terms Of transaction, which have seasonal selling rate and it hold time-based associationship with another item. It is also important that in database, some items which are infrequent in whole dataset but those may be frequent in a particular time period If these items are ignored then associationship WVW200R3100221-398 result will no longer be accurate. To restrict the time based associationship calendar based pattern can be used [YPXS03].

J	Bar-Or, A; Keren, D; Schuster, A; Wolff, R				Bar-Or, A; Keren, D; Schuster, A; Wolff, R			Hierarchical decision tree induction in distributed genomic databases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; distributed algorithms; decision trees; classification	PUBLIC-HEALTH SURVEILLANCE	Classification based on decision trees is one of the important problems in data mining and has applications in many fields. In recent years, database systems have become highly distributed, and distributed system paradigms, such as federated and peer-to-peer databases, are being adopted. In this paper, we consider the problem of inducing decision trees in a large distributed network of genomic databases. Our work is motivated by the existence of distributed databases in healthcare and in bioinformatics, and by the emergence of systems which automatically analyze these databases, and by the expectancy that these databases will soon contain large amounts of highly dimensional genomic data. Current decision tree algorithms require high communication bandwidth when executed on such data, which are large-scale distributed systems. We present an algorithm that sharply reduces the communication overhead by sending just a fraction of the statistical data. A fraction which is nevertheless sufficient to derive the exact same decision tree learned by a sequential learner on all the data in the network. Extensive experiments using standard synthetic SNP data show that the algorithm utilizes the high dependency among attributes, typical to genomic data, to reduce communication overhead by up to 99 percent. Scalability tests show that the algorithm scales well with both the size of the data set, the dimensionality of the data, and the size of the distributed system.

The data could be a sequence of characters or sets of characters or even real values. In practice, the patterns or motifs of interest are the ones that also allow a variable number of gaps (or dont-care characters): these are patterns with spacers termed extensible patterns In a bioinformatics context, similar patterns have also been called flexible patterns or motifs. The extensibility is succinctly defined by a single integer parameter D >= 1 which is interpreted as the allowable space to be between I and D characters between two successive solid characters in a reported motif. We introduce a data structure called the inexact-suffix tree and present an algorithm based on this data structure. This has been tested on primarily biological data such as DNA and protein sequences. However the generality of the system makes it equally applicable in other data mining, clustering, and knowledge extraction applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chou, SC; Hsu, CL				Chou, SC; Hsu, CL			MMDT: a multi-valued and multi-labeled decision tree classifier for data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						multi-valued attribute; multiple labels; classification; decision tree; data mining		We have proposed a decision tree classifier named MMC (multi-valued and multi-labeled classifier) before. MMC is known as its capability of classifying a large multi-valued and multi-labeled data. Aiming to improve the accuracy of MMC, this paper has developed another classifier named MMDT (multi-valued and multi-labeled decision tree). MMDT differs from MMC mainly in attribute selection. MMC attempts to split a node into child nodes whose records approach the same multiple labels. It basically measures the average similarity of labels of each child node to determine the goodness of each splitting attribute. MMDT, in contrast, uses another measuring strategy which considers not only the average similarity of labels of each child node but also the average appropriateness of labels of each child node. The new measuring strategy takes scoring approach to have a look-ahead measure of accuracy contribution of each attribute's splitting. The experimental results show that MMDT has improved the accuracy of MMC. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we describe a framework, knowledge sharing for protein families (KSPF), that uses sequence pattern data mining and knowledge management to improve upon traditional approaches. It is divided into three modules: automation, retrieval and refinement. This framework builds an environment that allows biological researchers to submit an unknown protein sequence and search for information on its sub-family. Once this sub-family protein category has been found, the related literature and knowledge records provided by previous users can be retrieved. The possible functions of the protein can then be predicted by use of the literature and records. The proposed framework is applicable. to all types of protein families. We describe the search for a plant lipid transfer protein (PLTP) with use of the framework. The system KS-PLTP functions to map an unknown. sequence to the sub-family of the PLTP knowledge base and predict the sequence's possible function. The prediction rate of KS-PLTP reached 89.6%.

J	Chang, CC; Lin, CY				Chang, CC; Lin, CY			Perfect hashing schemes for mining association rules	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article								Hashing schemes are widely used to improve the performance of data mining association rules, as in the DHP algorithm that utilizes the hash table in identifying the validity of candidate itemsets according to the number of the table's bucket accesses. However, since the hash table used in DHP is plagued by the collision problem, the process of generating large itemsets at each level requires two database scans, which leads to poor performance. In this paper we propose perfect hashing schemes to avoid collisions in the hash table. The main idea is to employ a refined encoding scheme, which transforms large itemsets into large 2-itemsets and thereby makes the application of perfect hashing feasible. Our experimental results demonstrate that the new method is also efficient (about three times faster than DHP), and scalable when the database size increases. We also propose another variant of the perfect hash scheme with reduced memory requirements. The properties and performances of several perfect hashing schemes are also investigated and compared.

In case uncertainty is present in data, or it is introduced in a pre-processing step, specific data mining and knowledge discovery techniques and methodologies must be provided. The theory of fuzzy subsets is a helpful tool to reach this goal. In this paper we introduce a new definition and an algorithm for computing fuzzy approximate dependencies, a type of relations that can be found between attributes in a fuzzy database, on the basis of a previous definition of fuzzy association rule. We will discuss about possible applications of this new tool. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

One of the most well known such rules is the k-nearest neighbor decision rule (also known as lazy learning) in which an unknown pattern is classified into the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors in the training set. This rule gives low error rates when the training set is large. However, in practice it is desired to store as little of the training data as possible, without sacrificing the performance. It is well known that thinning (condensing) the training set with the Gabriel proximity graph is a viable partial solution to the problem. However, this brings up the problem of efficiently computing the Gabriel graph of large training data sets in high dimensional spaces. In this paper we report on a new approach to the instance-based learning problem. The new approach combines five tools: first, editing the data using Wilson-Gabriel-editing to smooth the decision boundary, second, applying Gabriel-thinning to the edited set, third, filtering this output with the ICF algorithm of Brighton and Mellish, fourth, using the Gabriel-neighbor decision rule to classify new incoming queries, and fifth, using a new data structure that allows the efficient computation of approximate Gabriel graphs in high dimensional spaces. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach is the best on the market.

Although efficient supervised discretization methods are available, the unsupervised Equal Frequency discretization method is still widely used by the statistician both for data exploration and data preparation. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, based on a Bayesian approach, to optimize the number of bins for Equal Frequency discretizations in the context of supervised learning. We introduce a space of Equal Frequency discretization models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in the definition of a Bayes optimal evaluation criterion for Equal Frequency discretizations. We then propose an optimal search algorithm whose run-time is super-linear in the sample size. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the method works quite well in many cases.

However, it should be recalled that objective measures are just an estimate of the true degree of interestingness of a rule to the user, the so-called real human interest. The latter is inherently subjective. Hence, it is not clear how effective, in practice, objective measures are. More precisely, the central question investigated in this paper is: "how effective objective rule interestingness measures are, in the sense of being a good estimate of the true, subjective degree of interestingness of a rule to the user?" This question is investigated by extensive experiments with 11 objective rule interestingness measures across eight real-world data sets.

In this paper, we present a holistic approach to estimation that uses rough sets theory to determine a similarity template and then compute a runtime estimate using identified similar task. The approach is based on frequencies of attributes appeared in discernibility matrix. Experimental result validates our hypothesis that rough sets provide an intuitively sound solution to the problem of scheduling tasks in Grid environment.

This work aims to prove why AIS are of interest; starting from the real-world of applications that is asking for a radical change of the information systems framework. Namely, the component-based framework must be replaced with an agent-based one, Where the system complexity requires that any agent to be clearly featured by its autonomy. The AIS methods build adaptive large-scale multi-agent systems that are open to the environment, systems that are not at all fixed just after the design phase, but are real-time adaptive to unpredictable situations and malicious defects. The AIS perform the defense of a complex system against malicious defects achieving its survival strategy by extension of the concept of organization of multicellular organisms to the information systems. The main behavioral features of AIS - as self-maintenance, distributed and adaptive computational systems - are defined and described in relation to the Immune System as an information system. A comparison of AIS methodology with other Intelligent Technologies is another point of the lecture. The overview of some actual AIS applications is made using a practical engineering design strategy that views AIS as the effective software with agent-based architecture.

The disadvantage of this elegant methodology is based on its high space and time complexity. In this paper we present a modified BR approach that can overcome those difficulties. This methodology is called the approximate boolean reasoning (ABR) approach. We summarize some most recent applications of ABR approach in development of new efficient algorithms in rough sets and data mining.

The changes on the database may invalidate some existing sequential patterns and introduce new ones. Instead of recomputing the database each time, the incremental mining algorithms target efficiently maintaining the sequential patterns in the dynamically changing database. Recently, a new incremental mining algorithm, called IncSpan was proposed at the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'04). However, we find that in general, IncSpan fails to mine the complete set of sequential patterns from an updated database. In this paper, we clarify this weakness by proving the incorrectness of the basic properties in the IncSpan algorithm. Also, we rectify the observed shortcomings by giving our solution.

Yet, the search for the optimal ANN is a challenging task: the architecture should learn the input-output mapping without overfitting the data and training algorithms tend to get trapped into local minima. Under this scenario, the use of Evolutionary Computation (EC) is a promising alternative for ANN design and training. Moreover, since EC methods keep a pool of solutions, an ensemble can be build by combining the best ANNs. This work presents a novel algorithm for the optimization of ANNs, using a direct representation, a structural mutation operator and Lamarckian evolution. Sixteen real-world classification /regression tasks were used to test this strategy with single and ensemble based versions. Competitive results were achieved when compared with a heuristic model selection and other DM algorithms.

Although there have been efforts for spatial association rule mining, but mostly researchers discuss only the positive spatial association rules; they have not considered the spatial negative association rules. Negative association rules are very useful in some spatial problems and are capable of extracting some useful and previously unknown hidden information. We have proposed a novel approach of mining spatial positive and negative association rules. The approach applies multiple level spatial mining methods to extract interesting patterns in spatial and/or non-spatial predicates. Data and spatial predicates/association-ship are organized as set hierarchies to mine them level-by-level as required for multilevel spatial positive and negative association rules. A pruning strategy is used in our approach to efficiently reduce the search space. Further efficiency is gained by interestingness measure.

S	Tong, Q; Yan, BP; Zhou, YC		Li, X; Wang, S; Dong, ZY		Tong, Q; Yan, BP; Zhou, YC			Mining quantitative association rules on overlapped intervals	ADVANCED DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications	JUL 22-24, 2005	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					Mining association rules is an important problem in data mining. Algorithms for mining boolean data have been well studied and documented, but they cannot deal with quantitative and categorical data directly. For quantitative attributes, the general idea is partitioning the domain of a quantitative attribute into intervals, and applying boolean algorithms to the intervals. But, there is a conflict between the minimum support problem and the minimum confidence problem, while existing partitioning methods cannot avoid the conflict. Moreover, we expect the intervals to be meaningful. Clustering in data mining is a discovery process which groups a set of data such that the intracluster similarity is maximized and the intercluster similarity is minimized. The discovered clusters are used to explain the characteristics of the data distribution. The present paper will propose a novel method to find quantitative association rules by clustering the transactions of a database into clusters and projecting the clusters into the domains of the quantitative attributes to form meaningful intervals which may be overlapped. Experimental results show that our approach can efficiently find quantitative association rules, and can find important association rules which may be missed by the previous algorithms.

Privacy-Preserving Classification of Customer Data without Loss of Accuracy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 21-23, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc				Privacy has become an increasingly important issue in data mining. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a data miner surveys a large number of customers to learn classification rules on their data, while the sensitive attributes of these customers need to be protected. Solutions have been proposed to address this problem using randomization techniques. Such solutions exhibit a tradeoff of accuracy and privacy: the more each customer's private information is protected, the less accurate result the miner obtains; conversely, the more accurate the result, the less privacy for the customers. In this paper, we propose a simple cryptographic approach that is efficient even in a many-customer setting, provides strong privacy for each customer, and does not lose any accuracy as the cost of privacy. Our key technical contribution is a privacy-preserving method that allows a data miner to compute frequencies of values or tuples of values in the customers' data, without revealing the privacy-sensitive part of the data. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic protocols, this method requires no interaction between customers, and each customer only needs to send a single flow of communication to the data miner. However, we are still able to ensure that nothing about the sensitive data beyond the desired frequencies is revealed to the data miner. To illustrate the power of our approach, we use our frequency mining computation to obtain a privacy-preserving naive Bayes classifier learning algorithm. Initial experimental results demonstrate the practical efficiency of our solution. We also suggest some other applications of privacy-preserving frequency mining.

There may be several answers to this question according to the model of the process that creates the incompleteness. This paper develops a rigorous modelling framework that makes it clear the conditions that justify the different answers; and, on this basis, it derives a new conditioning rule for predictive inference to be used in a wide range of states of knowledge about the incompleteness process, including near-ignorance, which, surprisingly, does not seem to have received attention so far. Such a case is instead particularly important, as modelling incompleteness processes can be highly impractical, and because there are limitations to statistical inference with incomplete data: it is generally not possible to learn how incompleteness processes work by using the available data; and it may not be possible, as the paper shows, to measure empirically the quality of the predictions. Yet, these depend heavily on the assumptions made.

B	Zhou, ZH; Li, M		Kaelbling, LP; Saffotti, A		Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Li, Ming			Semi-Supervised Regression with Co-Training	19TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI-05)			English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 05)	JUL 30-AUG 05, 2005	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	BCS, Scottish Enterprise, QinetiQ, BTO, Foresight, Microsoft Research, ERCIM, Intelligent Applications Ltd, IBM, CologNET, Intel, Google			EM	In many practical machine learning and data mining applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semi-supervised learning algorithms such as co-training have attracted much attention. Previous research mainly focuses on semi-supervised classification. In this paper, a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm, i.e. COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two k-nearest neighbor regressors with different distance metrics, each of which labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor where the labeling confidence is estimated through consulting the influence of the labeling of unlabeled examples on the labeled ones. Experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.

J	Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM				Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM			Mining interesting association rules from customer databases and transaction databases	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							PERSPECTIVE	In this paper, we examine a new data mining issue of mining association rules from customer databases and transaction databases. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: identifying all the large itemsets from the transaction database and mining association rules from the customer database and the large itemsets identified. For the first subproblem, we propose an efficient algorithm to discover all the large itemsets from the transaction database. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. For the second subproblem, a relationship graph is constructed according to the identified large itemsets from the transaction database and the priorities of condition attributes from the customer database. Based on the relationship graph, we present an efficient graph-based algorithm to discover interesting association rules embedded in the transaction database and the customer database.

Many data mining methods for finding interesting gene expression patterns are based on thresholding single discriminants, e. g. the ratio of between-class to within-class variation or correlation to a template. Here a different approach is introduced for extracting information from gene microarrays. The approach is based on multiple objective optimization and we call it Pareto front analysis (PFA). This method establishes a ranking of genes according to estimated probabilities that each gene is Pareto-optimal, i.e., that it lies on the Pareto front of the multiple objective scattergram. Both a model-driven Bayesian Pareto method and a data-driven non-parametric Pareto method, based on rank-order statistics, are presented. The methods are illustrated for two gene microarray experiments.

This functionality can be implemented through data mining techniques. However, since the conventional studies oil data mining do not consider spatial and temporal aspects of data simultaneously. these techniques have limited application in studying the moving objects of LBS with respect to the spatial attributes that is changing over time. Defining individual users of LBS as moving objects, this paper proposes a new data mining technique and algorithms for identifying temporal patterns from series of locations of moving objects that have temporal and spatial dimensions. For this purpose, we use the spatial operation to generalize a location of moving point, applying time constraints between locations of moving objects to make valid moving sequences. Through the experiments, we show that our technique generates temporal patterns found in frequent moving sequences in efficient. Finally, the spatio-temporal technique proposed in this work is an innovative approach in providing knowledge applicable to improving the quality of LBS. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bove, VM; Mallett, J				Bove, VM; Mallett, J			Collaborative knowledge building by smart sensors	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article							NETWORKS	In this paper we explore decentralised approaches for gathering knowledge from sensing devices. We contrast these with centralised processes like data mining, which assume that sensors, devices, or even people contributing information to a pool, do not have a sense of the 'whole picture' or the goal of the data collection. Thus it is necessary for a centralised mining process to create value by sorting, co-ordinating, and distilling the raw information. We consider instead a situation in which the contributors are given a goal, and are given the ability to co-ordinate among themselves in such a way that each can maximise its contribution to the pool. We discuss advantages of this new approach such as scalability and communication efficiency, and explore how it may change the design of devices, communication infrastructures, and algorithm, using several projects from the Media Laboratory as illustrations.

Evaluation of test outcomes is also associated with a considerable effort by human testers who often have imperfect knowledge of the requirements specification. Not surprisingly, this manual approach to software testing results in heavy losses to the world's economy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential use of data mining algorithms for automated modeling of tested systems. The data mining models can be utilized for recovering system requirements, designing a minimal set of regression tests, and evaluating the correctness of software outputs. To study the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied a state-of-the-art data mining algorithm called Info-Fuzzy Network (IFN) to execution data of a complex mathematical package. The IFN method has shown a clear capability to identify faults in the tested program.

J	Hermann, T; Ritter, H				Hermann, T; Ritter, H			Sound and meaning in auditory data display	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Human Supervision and Control in Engineering and Music	SEP, 2001	Kassel, GERMANY			auditory perception; exploratory data analysis; human-computer interaction; sonification	WORLD; HEAR	Auditory data display is an interdisciplinary field linking auditory perception research, sound engineering, data mining, and human-computer interaction in order to make semantic contents of data perceptually accessible in the form of (nonverbal) audible sound. For this goal it is important to understand the different ways in which sound can encode meaning. We discuss this issue from the perspectives of language, music, functionality, listening modes, and physics, and point out some limitations of current techniques for auditory data display, in particular when targeting high-dimensional data sets. As a promising, potentially very widely applicable approach, we discuss the method of model-based sonification (MBS) introduced recently by the authors and point out how its natural semantic grounding in the physics of a sound generation process supports the design of sonifications that are accessible even to untrained, everyday listening. We then proceed to show that MBS also facilitates the design of an intuitive, active navigation through "acoustic aspects," somewhat analogous to the use of successive two-dimensional views in three-dimensional visualization. Finally, we illustrate the concept with a first prototype of a "tangible" sonification interface which allows us to "perceptually map" sonification responses into active exploratory hand motions of a user and give an outlook on some planned extensions.

In this paper we define a rule set for a given transaction database that is much smaller than the association rule set but makes the same predictions as the association rule set by the confidence priority. We call this rule set informative rule set. The informative rule set is not constrained to particular target items; and it is smaller than the non-redundant association rule set. We characterise relationships between the informative rule set and non-redundant association rule set. We present an algorithm to directly generate the informative rule set without generating all frequent itemsets first that accesses the database less frequently than other direct methods. We show experimentally that the informative rule set is much smaller and can be generated more efficiently than both the association rule set and non-redundant association rule set.

In this paper, we show how visualizing the hierarchical clustering structure of a database of objects can aid the user in his time consuming task to find similar objects. We present related work and explain its shortcomings which led to the development of our new methods. Based on reachability plots, we introduce approaches which automatically extract the significant clusters in a hierarchical cluster representation along with suitable cluster representatives. These techniques can be used as a basis for visual data mining. We implemented our algorithms resulting in an industrial prototype which we used for the experimental evaluation. This evaluation is based on real world test data sets and points out that our new approaches to automatic cluster recognition and extraction of cluster representatives create meaningful and useful results in comparatively short time.

The specific problem of frequent set mining from potentially huge boolean matrices has given rise to tens of efficient solvers. Frequent sets are indeed useful for many data mining tasks, including the popular association rule mining task but also feature construction, association-based classification, clustering, etc. The research in this area has been boosted by the fascinating concept of condensed representations w.r.t. frequency queries. Such representations can be used to support the discovery of every frequent set and its support without looking back at the data. Interestingly, the size of condensed representations can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of frequent set collections. Most of the proposals concern exact representations while it is also possible to consider approximated ones, i.e., to trade computational complexity with a bounded approximation on the computed support values.

The theoretical framework is based on first-order temporal logic and allows the definition of the main temporal data mining notions (event, temporal rule, constraint) in a formal way. The concepts of consistent linear time structure and general interpretation are fundamentals in the design of algorithms for inferring higher order temporal rules, (called temporal meta-rules), from local sets of temporal rules.

Several algorithms for clustering large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. Density-based method is one of these methodologies which can detect arbitrary shaped clusters where clusters are defined as dense regions separated by low density regions. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm to enhance the density-based algorithm DBSCAN. Synthetic datasets are used for experimental evaluation which shows that the new clustering algorithm is faster and more scalable than the original DBSCAN.

The ILP-based approaches are taken into account as well as ideas influenced by basket analyses proposed lately. A remaining question is how the different approaches can be tailored to meet the needs for mining molecules. In this area special problems occur as Molecules are not just "normal arbitrary graphs". There are structures that are typical and frequent as rings and chains, some node types resp. atoms occur more often than others. It is an unsolved question how chemically isomorphic mining can be handled.

Rough sets theory provides a mechanism of selecting feature subsets. In the rough set community, most feature subset selection algorithms are attributes reduct-oriented; that is, finding minimum reducts of the conditional attributes of a decision table. Two main approaches to finding attribute reducts are categorized as discernibility functions-based and attribute dependency-based. These algorithms, however, suffer from intensive computations of either discernibility functions for the former or positive regions for the latter. In this paper, we propose a new concept, called relative attribute dependency, and present a sufficient and necessary condition of the minimum conditional attributes reduct of a decision table represented with the relative attribute dependency. The relative attribute dependency can be calculated by counting the distinct rows of the sub-decision table, instead of generating discernibility functions or positive regions. Thus the computation efficiency of minimum reducts are highly improved. We develop two algorithms for finding minimum reducts of the conditional attributes, one brute-force algorithm and the other heuristic algorithm using attribute entropy as the heuristic function. We also show the results of these algorithms by an illustrative example.

Detection of outliers is important for many applications and has recently attracted much attention in the data mining research community. In this paper, we present a new method to detect outliers by discovering frequent patterns (or frequent itemsets) from the data set. The outliers are defined as the data transactions which contain less frequent patterns in their itemsets. We define a measure called FPOF (Frequent Pattern Outlier Factor) to detect the outlier transactions and propose the FindFPOF algorithm to discover outliers. The experimental results show that our approach outperformed the existing methods on identifying interesting outliers.

Filtering the training dataset, i.e., removing noisy data, can be used to improve the accuracy of the induced data mining learners. Tuning the few parameters of the Ensemble-Partitioning Filter allows filtering a given data mining problem appropriately. For example, it is possible to specialize the Ensemble-Partitioning Filter into the Classification, Ensemble, Multiple-Partitioning, or Iterative-Partitioning Filter. The predictions of the filtering experts are then utilized such that if an instance is misclassified by a certain number of experts or learners, it is identified as noisy. The conservativeness of the Ensemble-Partitioning Filter depends on the filtering level and the number of filtering iterations. A case stutdy of software metrics data from a high assurance software project analyzes the similarities between the filters obtained from the specialization of the Ensemble-Partitioning Filter. We show that over 2516 of the time, the filters at different levels of conservativeness agree on labeling instances as noisy. In addition, the Classification Filter has the lowest agreement with the other filters.

Existing approaches employ different parameters to search for interesting rules. This fact and the large number of rules make it difficult to compare the output of confidence-based association rule miners. This paper explores the use of classification performance as a metric for evaluating their output. Previous work on forming classifiers from association rules has focussed on accurate classification, whereas we concentrate on using the properties of the resulting classifiers as a basis for comparing confidence-based association rule learners. Therefore, we present experimental results on 12 UCI datasets showing that the quality of small rule sets generated by Apriori can be improved by using the predictive Apriori algorithm. We also show that CBA, the standard method for classification using association rules, is generally inferior to standard rule learners concerning both running time and size of rule sets.

The particular focus was on the prediction of cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients, specifically the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness of the heart of individual patients as an important quantitative indicator to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy. The work was based on data from 63 long-term hemodialysis patients of the KfH Dialysis Centre in Jena, Germany. Methods: The approach applied is based on data mining methods and involves four major steps: data based clustering and rule based prediction. The methods employed include crisp and fuzzy algorithms. At each step, logical and medical validation of results was carried out. Different sets of randomly selected patient data were used to train, test and optimize the clusterbases and rulebases for prediction. Results: Using the best clusterbase/rulebase combination designed, the IVS thickness cluster ('small' or 'large') was predicted correctly for 30 of the 35 patients with known IVS values in the training data set; no patient was predicted incorrectly and 5 were partly predicted. For the test data set, 4 of the 6 patients with known IVS values were predicted correctly, no patient incorrectly and 2 partly. The results did not substantially differ from those obtained using the second best clusterbase/rulebase combination which was finally recommended for use based on further performance criteria. The prediction of the IVS thickness clusters of the 22 patients with unknown IVS values also yielded good results that were (and could only be) validated by a medical individual risk assessment of these patients. Conclusions: The approach applied proved successful for the cluster and rule based prediction of a quantitative variable, such as IVS thickness, for individual patients from other variables relevant to the problem. The results obtained demonstrate the high potential of the approach and the methods developed and validated to support decision-making in hemodialysis and other fields of medicine by individual risk prediction.

But they often output a large amount of low-level or incomplete alert information. Such alerts can be unmanageable and also be mixed with false alerts. In this paper we proposed a false alarm classification model to reduce the false alarm rate using classification analysis of data mining techniques. The model was implemented based on associative classification in the domain of DDOS attack. We evaluated the false alarm classifier deployed in front of Snort with Darpa 1998 dataset and verified the reduction of false alarm rate. Our approach is useful to reduce false alerts and to improve the detection rate of network-based intrusion detection systems.

A subset S of the attributes ( or variables) of such a data set is called a support set if the positive and negative examples can be distinguished by using only the attributes in S. In this paper we study the problem of finding small support sets, a frequently arising task in various fields, including knowledge discovery, data mining, learning theory, logical analysis of data, etc. We study the distribution of support sets in randomly generated data, and discuss why finding small support sets is important. We propose several measures of separation ( real valued set functions over the subsets of attributes), formulate optimization models for finding the smallest subsets maximizing these measures, and devise efficient heuristic algorithms to solve these ( typically NP-hard) optimization problems. We prove that several of the proposed heuristics have a guaranteed constant approximation ratio, and we report on computational experience comparing these heuristics with some others from the literature both on randomly generated and on real world data sets.

J	Wu, CH				Wu, CH			Data mining applied to material acquisition budget allocation for libraries: design and development	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						acquisition budget allocation; circulation; data mining	DECISION-SUPPORT	Library management frequently faces the need of making the value of the acquired materials significant as far as the most beneficial use of the allocated acquisition budget is concerned. Knowledge in the circulation databases can be explored in-depth to relevantly reflect this need. In this paper, a data mining based model (DMBA) is designed and developed to help allocate the library material acquisition budget by opening up the utilization of library materials that users have made use. The developed model is based on the feature of ID3 algorithm to explore explanatory knowledge via information theory and statistics to derive appropriateness via utilization gain. The main output of the DMBA is the weights as the basis of library material acquisition budget allocation for departments via the combination of explored explanatory knowledge and appropriateness. The developed DMBA was supported by a practical application case. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this case, replacing the traditional weighted average or, more generally, the linear mapping from a higher dimensional space to a one-dimensional space, relevant nonlinear integrals should be used as the aggregation tool to express how the objective attribute depends on predictive attributes. Several different types of nonlinear integral, such as the Choquet integral and the. Wang integral, have been discussed in literature. In these models, the objective attribute is the integral, while the predictive attributes are the integrand. In this paper, a new concept of indeterminate integral is introduced when the universe of discourse is finite. It is a family of integrals, including nonlinear integrals mentioned above and, therefore, possesses a large adaptability as a new aggregation tool. Each specified type of indeterminate integral can be obtained from the family of indeterminate integrals by specifying a decomposition of the integrand. Such a new aggregation tool can be used in information fusion and data mining as well as in expert systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our paper introduces a package of substring-based new algorithms to determine Field Similarity. Combined together, our new algorithms not only achieves higher accuracy, but also gains the time complexity O(knm) (k<0.75) for the worst case, O(beta*n) where beta<6 for the average case and O(1) for the best case. Throughout the paper, we use the approach of comparative examples to show the higher accuracy of our algorithms compared to that proposed in Lee et al. [1]. Theoretical analysis, concrete examples and experimental results show that our algorithms can significantly improve the accuracy and time complexity of the calculation of field similarity.

J	Domingo-Ferrer, J; Torra, V				Domingo-Ferrer, J; Torra, V			On the connections between statistical disclosure control for microdata and some artificial intelligence tools	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						artificial intelligence; data mining; re-identification procedures; statistical disclosure control; synthesis of information; official statistics; data cleaning	KNOWLEDGE ELICITATION; CONSENSUS; ALGORITHM; SECURITY	Statistical disclosure control (SDC) and artificial intelligence (AI) use similar tools for different purposes. This work describes the common elements of both areas to increase their synergy. SDC is a discipline that seeks to modify statistical data so that they can be published (typically by National Statistical Offices) without giving away the identity of any individual behind the data. When dealing with individual data (microdata in SDC jargon), both SDC procedures and AI knowledge integration procedures use similar principles for different purposes (masking data vs. improving its quality). Similarities can also be found for methods evaluating re-identification risk in SDC and data mining tools for making data consistent. This paper explores those methodological connections with the aim of stimulating interaction between both fields. In particular, data mining turns out to be a common interest of both fields.

J	Cantu-Paz, E; Kamath, C				Cantu-Paz, E; Kamath, C			Evolving neural networks to identify bent-double galaxies in the FIRST survey	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						astronomical surveys; radio-emitting galaxies; network design; genetic algorithms; feature extraction; feature selection; data mining	ALGORITHMS	The FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm) survey is an ambitious project scheduled to cover 10,000 square degrees of the northern and southern galactic caps. Until recently, astronomers associated with FIRST identified radio-emitting galaxies with a bent-double morphology through a visual inspection of images. Besides being subjective, prone to error and tedious, this manual approach is becoming increasingly infeasible: upon completion, FIRST will include almost a million galaxies. This paper describes the application of six methods of evolving neural networks (NNs) with genetic algorithms (GAs) to the identification of bent-double galaxies. The objective is to demonstrate that GAs can successfully address some common problems in the application of NNs to classification problems, such as training the networks, choosing appropriate network topologies. and selecting relevant features. We measured the overall accuracy of the networks using the arithmetic and geometric means of the accuracies on bent and non-bent galaxies, Most of the combinations of GAs and NNs perform equally well on our data, but using GAs to select feature subsets produces the best results, reaching accuracies of 90% using the arithmetic mean and 87% with the geometric mean, The networks found by the GAs were more accurate than hand-designed networks and decision trees.

[19] We describe some simple techniques for speeding up the calculation of sufficient statistics for decision trees and related hypothesis classes from multi-relational data. Because missing values are fairly common in many real-world applications of data mining, our implementation also includes some simple techniques for dealing with missing values. We describe results of experiments with several real-world data sets from the KDD Cup 2001 data mining competition and PKDD 2001 discovery challenge. Results of our experiments indicate that MRDTL is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms for learning classifiers from relational databases.

Several groups have reported differences in the X-ray scattering patterns of normal and tumour tissue from the breast. This gives rise to the hope that X-ray scatter analysis techniques may lead to a more accurate and cost effective method of diagnosing beast cancer which lends itself to automation. This is a particularly challenging exercise due to the inherent complexity of the information content in X-ray scatter patterns from complex hetrogenous tissue samples. We use a simple naive Bayes classier as our classification system. High-level features are extracted from the low-level pixel data. This paper reports some preliminary results in the ongoing development of this classification method that can distinguish between the diffraction patterns of normal and cancerous tissue, with particular emphasis on the invention of features for classification.

Changes to these master data is a frequent threat to the correctness of OLAP results, in particular for multi- period data analysis, trend calculations, etc. As dimension data might change in underlying data sources without notifying the data warehouse, we are exploring the application of data mining techniques for detecting such changes and contribute to avoiding incorrect results of OLAP queries.

It has been shown that they are very powerful distinguishable features and they are very useful for constructing accurate classifiers. Previous EP mining approaches often produce a large number of EPs, which makes it very difficult to choose interesting ones manually. Usually, a post-processing filter step is applied for selecting interesting EPs based on some interestingness measures. In this paper, we first generalize the interestingness measures for EPs, including the minimum support, the minimum growth rate, the subset relationship between EPs and the correlation based on common statistical measures such as chi-squared value. We then develop an efficient algorithm for mining only those interesting EPs, where the chi-squared test is used as heuristic to prune the search space. The experimental results show that our algorithm maintains efficiency even at low supports on data that is large, dense and has high dimensionality. They also show that the heuristic is admissible, because only unimportant EPs with low supports are ignored. Our work based on EPs for classification confirms that the discovered interesting EPs are excellent candidates for building accurate classifiers.

This paper aims to integrate the newly emerging XML technology with data mining technology, using association rule mining as a case in point. Compared with traditional association mining in the well-structured world (e.g., relational databases), mining from XML data is faced with more challenges due to the inherent flexibilities of XML in both structure and semantics. The primary challenges include 1) a more complicated hierarchical data structure; 2) an ordered data context; and 3) a much bigger data size. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extended XML-enabled association rule framework, which is flexible and powerful enough to represent both simple and complex structured association relationships inherent in XML data.

The paper gives definitions of same-field contexts, consistent contexts, same-field concept lattices, and consistent concept lattices, provides definitions of the addition operation of two same-field and consistent contexts as well as the union operation of two same-field and consistent concept lattices, and proves that the two operations above are isomorphic and satisfy other interesting mathematical properties, such as commutative and associative laws as well as having left and right identity elements. According to the definitions and properties of the union operation, a union algorithm of multiple concept lattices is deduced, in which some heuristic knowledge from order relation of the concepts is used, so the time efficiency of the algorithm can be improved. Experiments show that using the algorithm to merge two concept lattices distributed on different sites into one is evidently superior to the method of using Gordin's algorithm to insert the objects of the formal context corresponding to second concept lattice one by one into the first lattice. Evidently, the algorithm provided in the paper is an effective parallel algorithm to construct concept lattice.

ID3 is a greedy algorithm that considers one attribute at a time for splitting at a node. In C4.5, all attributes, barring the nominal attributes used at the parent nodes, are retained for further computation. This leads to extra overheads of memory and computational efforts. Rough Set theory (RS) simplifies the search for dominant attributes in the information systems. In this paper, Rough set based Decision Tree (RDT) model combining the RS tools with classical DT capabilities, is proposed to address the issue of computational overheads. The experiments compare the performance of RDT with RS approach and ID3 algorithm. The performance of RDT over RS approach is observed better in accuracy and rule complexity while RDT and ID3 are comparable.

In each iteration a comparatively small batch of documents is evaluated for relating to the human interesting. We apply active learning techniques based on support Vector Machine for evaluating successive batches which is called relevance feedback. Finally, our proposed approach is very useful for document retrieval with relevance feedback experimentally.

In this paper we discuss the use of a specific form of evolutionary computation known as Cultural Algorithms that has been applied successfully in various real-world applications to solve problems of a very dynamic and complex nature. Cultural Algorithms [1] introduce a learning component into an evolutionary framework that influences the search strategy and is in turn modified by the best-performing members of the population during the entire process. Cultural Algorithms have been used in various applications, including fraud analysis for automotive accident claims, the re-engineering of a dynamic automobile manufacturing knowledge base, the modeling of pricing strategies for automobiles in a multi-agent environment and for data mining.

These dynamic data sets have immense potential for reflecting changes in customer behaviour patterns. One of the strategies of data mining is association rule discovery, which correlates the occurrence of certain attributes in the database leading to the identification of large data itemsets. This paper seeks to generate large itemsets in a dynamic transaction database using the principles of Genetic Algorithms. Intra transactions, Inter transactions and distributed transactions axe considered for mining association rules. Further, we analyze the time complexities of single scan DMARG (Dynamic Mining of Association Rules using Genetic Algorithms), with Fast UP date (FUP) algorithm for intra transactions and E-Apriori for inter transactions. Our study shows that DMARG outperforms both FUP and E-Apriori in terms of execution time and scalability, without compromising the quality or completeness of rules generated. The problem of mining association rules in the distributed environment is explored in DDMARG (Distributed and Dynamic Mining of Association Rules using Genetic Algorithms).

Case mining constructs a case base from a large raw dataset with an objective to improve the case-base reasoning systems' efficiency and quality. Our approach starts from a raw database of objects with class attributes together with a historical database of past action sequences on these objects. The object databases can be customer records and the historical action logs can be the technical advises given to the customers to solve their problems. Our goal is to discover effective and highly representative problem descriptions associated with solution plans that accomplish their tasks. To maintain efficiency of computation, data mining methods are employed in the process of composing the case base. We motivate the application of the case mining model using a financial application example, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the model using both real and simulated datasets.

J	Lan, N; Jansen, R; Gerstein, M				Lan, N; Jansen, R; Gerstein, M			Toward a systematic definition of protein function that scales to the genome level: Defining function in terms of interactions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						function; grid; interaction; ontology; proteome	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; ANNOTATION TRANSFER; EXPRESSION DATA; YEAST GENOME; CELL-CYCLE; SEQUENCE; GENE; NETWORKS; DNA; IDENTIFICATION	The ultimate goal of functional genomics is to elucidate the function of all the genes in the genome. However, the current notions of function are crafted for individual proteins. The degree to which they can scale to the genomic level is not clear. In this paper, we review the diverse approaches to functional classification, focusing on their ability to meet this challenge of scale. Our review emphasizes a number of key parameters of the systems: their accuracy, comprehensiveness, level of standardization, flexibility, and support for data mining. We then propose an approach that synthesizes a number of the promising features of the existing systems. Our approach, which we call a function grid, is based on the notion of defining a protein's function through molecular interactions-specifically, in terms of its probability of interaction with various ligands, the list of which can be expanded infinitely. To illustrate how our function grid can be used in genome-wide prediction of function, we construct a grid of yeast genes; combine it with other genomic information, including sequence features, structure, subcellular localization, and messenger ribonucleic acid expression; and then use decision trees and support vector machines to predict deoxyribonucleic acid binding.

In this paper, we present G-Net, a distributed evolutionary algorithm able to infer classifiers from precollected data. The main features of the system include robustness with respect to parameter settings, use of the minimum description length criterion coupled with a stochastic search bias, coevolution as a high-level control strategy, ability to face problems requiring structured representation languages, and suitability to parallel implementation on a network of workstations (NOW). Its parallel version, NOW G-Net, also described in this paper, is able to profitably exploit the computing power delivered by these platforms by incorporating a set of dynamic load distribution techniques that allow it to adapt to the variations of computing power arising typically in these systems. A proof-of-concept implementation is used in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of NOW G-Net on a variety of datasets.

In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting star-shaped and smooth objects in 2-D and tubular objects in 3-D images. Image objects of these shapes are often studied in medical applications. For the 2-D case of the problem, we present an O(IJ log J) time algorithm, improving the previously best known O(IJ(2)M) time algorithm by a factor of O(JM/logJ) time where the size of the input 2-D image is I x J and M is the smoothness parameter with 1 less than or equal to M less than or equal to J. Our 2-D algorithm is based on a combination of dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer strategy, and on computing an optimal path in an implicitly represented graph. We also prove that a generalized version of the 3-D case of the problem is NP-hard.

J	Bianchi-Berthouze, N				Bianchi-Berthouze, N			Mining multimedia subjective feedback	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						multimedia data mining; adaptive subjective user modeling; human computer interaction; externalisation feedback; web-based image retrieval	IMAGE RETRIEVAL	Personalising web search engines, a crucial issue nowadays, would obviously benefit from the system's ability to capture such an important aspect of a user's personality as visual impressions and their communication. Unfortunately, such impressions are intrinsically variable and very difficult to make explicit. In this paper, we propose a methodology to dynamically create personalised models of visual impression words. We suggest that it can be achieved by exploiting multimedia data mining on the large amount of information contained in an image and in its mapping onto an impression word. The continuous adaptation of each model utilises not only relevance feedback but also externalisation feedback. The externalisation process, triggered by the data mining activity, is supported by a conceptual space whose tools allow users to transform their mental model into formal specifications. For experimental validation purposes, a web-based meta search engine has been developed that can retrieve images on the basis of impression words.

J	Erlich, Z; Gelbard, R; Spiegler, I				Erlich, Z; Gelbard, R; Spiegler, I			Data mining by means of binary representation: A model for similarity and clustering	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						binary representation; similarity; clustering; data mining		In this paper we outline a new method for clustering that is based on a binary representation of data records. The binary database relates each entity to all possible attribute values (domain) that entity may assume. The resulting binary matrix allows for similarity and clustering calculation by using the positive ('1' bits) of the entity vector. We formulate two indexes: Pair Similarity Index (PSI) to measure similarity between two entities and Group Similarity Index (GSI) to measure similarity within a group of entities. A threshold factor for each attribute domain is defined that is dependent on the domain but independent of the number of entities in the group. The similarity measure provides simplicity of storage and efficiency of calculation. A comparison of our similarity index to other indexes is made. Experiments with sample data indicate a 48% improvement of group similarity over standard methods pointing to the potential and merit of the binary approach to clustering and data mining.

J	Le, SY; Liu, WM; Maizel, JV				Le, SY; Liu, WM; Maizel, JV			A data mining approach to discover unusual folding regions in genome sequences	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; statistical model; RNA/DNA folding; UFR	RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURE; MESSENGER-RNA; STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY; VIRUS; SITES	Numerous experiments and analyses of RNA structures have revealed that the local distinct structure closely correlates with the biological function. In this study, we present a data mining approach to discover such unusual folding regions (UFRs) in genome sequences. Our approach is a three-step procedure. During the first step, the quality of a local structure different from a random folding in a genomic sequence is evaluated by two z-scores, significance score (SIGSCR) and stability score (STBSCR) of the local segment. The two scores are computed by sliding a fixed window stepped a base along the sequence from the start to end position. Next, based on the non-central Student's t distribution theory we derive a linearly transformed non-central Student's t distribution (LTNSTD) to describe the distribution of SIGSCR and STBSCR computed in the sequence. In the third step, we extract these significant UFRs from the sequence whose SIGSCR and/or STBSCR are greater or less than a given threshold calculated from the derived LTNSTD. Our data mining approach is successfully applied to the complete genome of Mycoplasma genitalium (M. gen) and discovers these statistical extremes in the genome. By comparisons with the two scores computed from randomly shuffled sequences of the entire M. gen genome, our results demonstrate that the UFRs in the M. gen sequence are not selected by chance. These UFRs may imply an important structure role involved in their sequence information. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
