J	Wang, TH; Zhong, LY; Chen, JT				Wang, Tinghua; Zhong, Liyun; Chen, Junting			Choosing General Gaussian Kernel Parameters for Multiclass Pattern Classification	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE			English	Article						Kernel Optimization; General Gaussian Kernel; Multiclass Kernel Polarization; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); Multiclass Classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION; POLARIZATION; HYPERPARAMETERS; ALIGNMENT	Kernel methods have been established as powerful tools in machine learning and data mining. However, the burden of choosing the appropriate kernel function and its parameters is left to the user. This paper presents an effective general Gaussian kernel parameter selection method for multiclass pattern classification. Unlike the standard single scale Gaussian kernel, the general Gaussian kernel adopts some linear transformations of the input space such that not only the scaling but also the rotation is adapted. We propose to optimize the general Gaussian kernel parameters by maximizing a newly presented kernel evaluation criterion named multiclass kernel polarization (MKP), and this problem is solved through a gradient-based optimization technique. MKP makes full use of all the training samples available and can assess the quality of a kernel in the multiclass classification scenario. The experiments with several UCI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Bibliometric analysis has been widely used as a practical tool to evaluate scientific activities. Although there were many bibliometric-based attempts to model product innovation stages, there have not been any trials that approach it from the standpoint of uncertainty reduction in technological product innovation. This paper suggests two hypotheses: 1) at a macro level, the year-to-year difference in relative research volumes of each component decreases over time as the uncertainty of a product decreases; and 2) at a micro level, the year-to-year difference in relative research volumes of each component is correlated with the technological life cycle of a product's core component. In addition, we provide empirical evidence that supports the hypotheses in the case study of mobile phones. From the evidence, we conclude that bibliometric analysis using research papers can measure the uncertainty in a product's technological innovation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results show that Twitter users generated a loosely connected hub-and-spoke network, suggesting that information was likely to be organized by several central users in the network and that these users bridged small communities. On YouTube, homogeneously themed videos formed a dense mesh network, reinforcing shared ideas and meanings. According to the geographic distribution, both Twitter and YouTube networks were actively organized by U.S. users, but the YouTube network was activated mainly by anonymous users. These results highlight differing roles of social media in political information diffusion in which the Twitter network not only organizes and coordinates information but also facilitate the exchange of ideas between different groups. YouTube is suitable for disseminating ideas and reinforcing solidarity among members. The results demonstrate useful analytical techniques for data mining and analyzing Twitter and YouTube networks and have important implications for distinct roles of social media platforms in organizing collective action.

Data Mining as a Guide for the Construction of Cross-Linked Nanoparticles with Low Immunotoxicity via Control of Polymer Chemistry and Supramolecular Assembly	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							KNEDEL-LIKE NANOPARTICLES; SIRNA DELIVERY; DECATIONIZED POLYPLEXES; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; IN-VIVO; NANOSTRUCTURES; CYTOTOXICITY; BIODISTRIBUTION; NANOMATERIALS; DEGRADATION	The potential immunotoxicity of nanoparticles that are currently being approved, in different phases of clinical trials, or undergoing rigorous in vitro and in vivo characterizations in several laboratories has recently raised special attention. Products with no apparent in vitro or in vivo toxicity may still trigger various components of the immune system unintentionally and lead to serious adverse reactions. Cytokines are one of the useful biomarkers for predicting the effect of biotherapeutics on modulation of the immune system and for screening the immunotoxicity of nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo, and they were recently found to partially predict the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of nanomaterials. Control of polymer chemistry and supramolecular assembly provides a great opportunity for the construction of biocompatible nanoparticles for biomedical clinical applications. However, the sources of data collected regarding immunotoxicities of nanomaterials are diverse, and experiments are usually conducted using different assays under specific conditions. As a result, making direct comparisons nearly impossible, and thus, tailoring the properties of nanomaterials on the basis of the available data is challenging. In this Account, the effects of chemical structure, cross-linking, degradability, morphology, concentration, and surface chemistry on the immunotoxicity of an expansive array of polymeric nanomaterials will be highlighted, with a focus on assays conducted using the same in vitro and in vivo models and experimental conditions. Furthermore, numerical descriptive values have been utilized uniquely to stand for induction of cytokines by nanoparticles. This treatment of available data provides a simple way to compare the immunotoxicities of various nanomaterials, and the values were found to correlate well with published data. On the basis of the polymeric systems investigated in this study, valuable information has been collected that will aid in the future design of nanomaterials for biomedical applications, including the following: (a) the immunotoxicity of nanomaterials is concentration-and dose-dependent; (b) the synthesis of degradable nanoparticles is essential to decrease toxicity; (c) cross-linking minimizes the release of free polymeric chains and maintains high stability of the nanoparticles, thereby lowering their immunotoxicity; (d) lowering the amine density for cationic polymers that are being utilized for delivery of nucleic acids lowers the toxicity of the nanoparticles; (e) among neutral, zwitterionic, anionic, and cationic nanomaterials, neutral and cationic nanoparticles usually have the lowest and highest immunotoxicities, respectively; and (f) morphology, dimension, and surface chemistry have a great influence on the ability of nanomaterials to interact with the various components of the biological system and to modulate the immune system.

To perform studies at scale and transfer knowledge from one institution to another in a meaningful way, we need to harmonize the phenotypes in such systems. Traditionally, this has been accomplished through expert specification of phenotypes via standardized terminologies, such as billing codes. However, this approach may be biased by the experience and expectations of the experts, as well as the vocabulary used to describe such patients. The goal of this work is to develop a data-driven strategy to (1) infer phenotypic topics within patient populations and (2) assess the degree to which such topics facilitate a mapping across populations in disparate healthcare systems. Methods: We adapt a generative topic modeling strategy, based on latent Dirichlet allocation, to infer phenotypic topics. We utilize a variance analysis to assess the projection of a patient population from one healthcare system onto the topics learned from another system. The consistency of learned phenotypic topics was evaluated using (1) the similarity of topics, (2) the stability of a patient population across topics, and (3) the transferability of a topic across sites. We evaluated our approaches using four months of inpatient data from two geographically distinct healthcare systems: (1) Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) and (2) Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Results: The method learned 25 phenotypic topics from each healthcare system. The average cosine similarity between matched topics across the two sites was 0.39, a remarkably high value given the very high dimensionality of the feature space. The average stability of VUMC and NMH patients across the topics of two sites was 0.988 and 0.812, respectively, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Also the VUMC and NMH topics have smaller variance of characterizing patient population of two sites than standard clinical terminologies (e.g., ICD9), suggesting they may be more reliably transferred across hospital systems. Conclusions: Phenotypic topics learned from EHR data can be more stable and transferable than billing codes for characterizing the general status of a patient population. This suggests that EHR-based research may be able to leverage such phenotypic topics as variables when pooling patient populations in predictive models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While the problem has been extensively studied, few of the available techniques are sufficiently scalable to handle datasets with billions of sequences; such large-scale datasets arise, for instance, in text mining and session analysis. In this article, we propose MG-FSM, a scalable algorithm for frequent sequence mining on MapReduce. MG-FSM can handle so-called "gap constraints", which can be used to limit the output to a controlled set of frequent sequences. Both positional and temporal gap constraints, as well as appropriate maximality and closedness constraints, are supported. At its heart, MG-FSM partitions the input database in a way that allows us to mine each partition independently using any existing frequent sequence mining algorithm. We introduce the notion of w-equivalency, which is a generalization of the notion of a "projected database" used by many frequent pattern mining algorithms. We also present a number of optimization techniques that minimize partition size, and therefore computational and communication costs, while still maintaining correctness. Our experimental study in the contexts of text mining and session analysis suggests that MG-FSM is significantly more efficient and scalable than alternative approaches.

We present how a survey analysis approach initially developed for customer satisfaction research in marketing can be adapted for an introduction of clinical pharmacy services into a hospital. Methods and material: We use a data mining analytical approach to extract relevant managerial consequences. We evaluate the importance of competences for users of a clinical pharmacy with the OrdEval algorithm and determine their nature according to the users' expectations. For this, we need substantially fewer questions than are required by the Kano approach. Results: From 52 clinical pharmacy activities we were able to identify seven activities with a substantial negative impact (i.e., negative reinforcement) on the overall satisfaction of clinical pharmacy services, and two activities with a strong positive impact (upward reinforcement). Using analysis of individual feature values, we identified six performance, 10 excitement, and one basic clinical pharmacists' activity. Conclusions: We show how the OrdEval algorithm can exploit the information hidden in the ordering of class and attribute values, and their inherent correlation using a small sample of highly relevant respondents. The visualization of the outputs turns out highly useful in our clinical pharmacy research case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research paper presents a novel classifier ensemble framework based on enhanced bagging approach with multi-objective weighted voting scheme for prediction and analysis of heart disease. The proposed model overcomes the limitations of conventional performance by utilizing an ensemble of five heterogeneous classifiers: Na < ve Bayes, linear regression, quadratic discriminant analysis, instance based learner and support vector machines. Five different datasets are used for experimentation, evaluation and validation. The datasets are obtained from publicly available data repositories. Effectiveness of the proposed ensemble is investigated by comparison of results with several classifiers. Prediction results of the proposed ensemble model are assessed by ten fold cross validation and ANOVA statistics. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed framework deals with all type of attributes and achieved high diagnosis accuracy of 84.16 %, 93.29 % sensitivity, 96.70 % specificity, and 82.15 % f-measure. The f-ratio higher than f-critical and p value less than 0.05 for 95 % confidence interval indicate that the results are extremely statistically significant for most of the datasets.

Towards the end of the phase, 99 cities were designated progressively through the life of the phase (2009-14). The paper establishes the values, systems and aspirations that these cities sign up for, as foundations for the selection of methodology. We assert that a realist synthesis methodology, driven by a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods, is the most appropriate perspective to address the wide geopolitical, demographic, population and health diversities of these cities. The paper outlines the rationale for a structured multiple case study approach, the deployment of a comprehensive questionnaire, data mining through existing databases including Eurostat and analysis of management information generation tools used throughout the period. Response rates were considered extremely high for this type of research. Non-response analyses are described, which show that data are representative for cities across the spectrum of diversity. This paper provides a foundation for further analysis on specific areas of interest presented in this supplement.

In particular, cells entirely made of metal oxides (MOs) have the potential to provide clean and affordable energy if their power conversion efficiencies are improved. Such improvements require the development of new MOs which could benefit from combining combinatorial material sciences for producing solar cells libraries with data mining tools to direct synthesis efforts. In this work we developed a data mining work-flow and applied it to the analysis of two recently reported solar cell libraries based on Titanium and Copper oxides. Our results demonstrate that QSAR models with good prediction statistics for multiple solar cells properties could be developed and that these models highlight important factors affecting these properties in accord with experimental findings. The resulting models are therefore suitable for designing better solar cells.

Using visual statistical inference to better understand random class separations in high dimension, low sample size data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Statistical graphics; Lineup; Visualization; Projection pursuit; Data mining	EXPLORATORY DATA-ANALYSIS; PROJECTION PURSUIT; FEATURE-SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; CLASSIFICATION	Statistical graphics play an important role in exploratory data analysis, model checking and diagnosis. With high dimensional data, this often means plotting low-dimensional projections, for example, in classification tasks projection pursuit is used to find low-dimensional projections that reveal differences between labelled groups. In many contemporary data sets the number of observations is relatively small compared to the number of variables, which is known as a high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) problem. This paper explores the use of visual inference on understanding low-dimensional pictures of HDLSS data. Visual inference helps to quantify the significance of findings made from graphics. This approach may be helpful to broaden the understanding of issues related to HDLSS data in the data analysis community. Methods are illustrated using data from a published paper, which erroneously found real separation in microarray data, and with a simulation study conducted using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

This work proposes a generic methodology using temporal sequence classification algorithms. It is based on a low sampling rate unlike other approaches in this domain. An innovative time series distance-based approach in the temporal classification domain is compared with a standard NILM application based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm. The method is validated over a data-set of 100 houses for a duration of 1 year (with a 10 min sampling rate).

Development and assessment of EST-SSR marker for the genetic diversity among tobaccos (Nicotiana tabacum L.)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAGS; LOTUS NELUMBO-NUCIFERA; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; LINKAGE MAP; GERMPLASM; WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM; RESISTANCE; REPEATS	Because of the advantages of EST-SSR markers, it has been employed as powerful markers for genetic diversity analysis, comparative mapping and phylogenetic studies. In this study, a total of 429,869 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) ESTs were downloaded from the public databases, which offers an opportunity to identify SSRs in ESTs by data mining, and 38,165 SSRs were identified from 379,967 uni-ESTs with the frequency of one SSR per 5.52 kb. Mono- and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the dominant repeat types, accounting for 40.53 and 34.51% of all SSRs, respectively. After eliminating mononucleotide-containing sequences, 86 pairs of primers were designed to amplify in four tobacco accessions. Only 15 primers (17.44%) showed polymorphism, and then they were further used to assess genetic diversity of 20 tobacco accessions. Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average dendrograms (UPGMA) and principal coordinates analysis plots (PCA) revealed genetic differentiation between N. rustica and N. tabacum, and between oriental tobacco and other accessions of N. tabacum. The present study reported the development of EST-SSR markers in tobacco by exploiting EST databases, and confirmed the effective way to develop markers. These EST-SSRs can serve in studies on cultivar identification, genetic diversity analysis, and genetics in tobacco.

Data mining offers excellent nonlinear modeling and self-organized learning, and it can play a vital role in the interpretation of well logging data of complex reservoirs. We used data mining to identify the lithologies in a complex reservoir. The reservoir lithologies served as the classification task target and were identified using feature extraction, feature selection, and modeling of data streams. We used independent component analysis to extract information from well curves. We then used the branch-andbound algorithm to look for the optimal feature subsets and eliminate redundant information. Finally, we used the C5.0 decision-tree algorithm to set up disaggregated models of the well logging curves. The modeling and actual logging data were in good agreement, showing the usefulness of data mining methods in complex reservoirs.

Methods: Cephalometric data of 54 Class III patients (32 females, 22 males) taken before (T1, mean age 8.2 +/- 1.6 years) and after (T2, mean age 14.6 +/- 1.8 years) early rapid maxillary expansion and facemask therapy followed by fixed appliances were analysed. Patients were classified at T1 on the basis of high membership grade into three main dentoskeletal fuzzy cluster phenotypes: hyperdivergent (HD), hypermandibular (HM), and balanced (Bal) phenotypes. The prevalence rate of successful and unsuccessful cases at T2 was calculated for the three clusters and compared by means of Fisher's exact test corrected for multiple testing (Holm-Bonferroni method). Results: Unsuccessful cases were 9 out of 54 patients (16.7%). Once patients were framed into their cluster membership, the individualized pre-treatment prediction of unsuccessful cases was largely differentiated: HD and HM patients showed a significantly greater prevalence rate of unsuccessful cases than Bal patients (0% in Bal cluster, 28.6% in HM cluster, and 33.3% in HD cluster). Network analysis captured some noticeable interdependencies of Class III patients, showing a more connected interactive structure of cephalometric data sets in HM and HD patients compared with Bal patients. The results were confirmed after minimizing the geometrical connections between cephalometric variables in the model. Conclusions: Fuzzy clustering repartition can be usefully used to estimate an individualized risk of unsuccessful treatment outcome in Class III patients.

Yet the impact of the latter was often ignored by previous EF determinations. We developed piecewise statistical models (PMs) to explain how the N2O EFs in agricultural soils depend upon various predictors such as climate, soil attributes, and agricultural management. The PMs are derived from a new Bayesian Recursive Regression Tree algorithm. The PMs were applied to the case of EFs from agricultural soils in China, a country where large EF spatial gradients prevail. The results indicate substantial improvements of the PMs compared with other EF determinations. First, PMs are able to reproduce a larger fraction of the variability of observed EFs for upland grain crops (84%, n=381) and paddy rice (91%, n=161) as well as the ratio of EFs to nitrogen application rates (73%, n=96). The superior predictive accuracy of PMs is further confirmed by evaluating their predictions against independent EF measurements (n=285) from outside China. Results show that the PMs calibrated using Chinese data can explain 75% of the variance. Hence, the PMs could be reliable for upscaling of N2O EFs and fluxes for regions that have a phase space of predictors similar to China. Results from the validated models also suggest that climatic factors regulate the heterogeneity of EFs in China, explaining 69% and 85% of their variations for upland grain crops and paddy rice, respectively. The corresponding N2O EFs in 2008 are 0.840.18% (as N2O-N emissions divided by the total N input) for upland grain crops and 0.650.14% for paddy rice, the latter being twice as large as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 defaults. Based upon these new estimates of EFs, we infer that only 22% of current arable land could achieve a potential reduction of N2O emission of 50%.

Due to the difficulties that arise from the application of data mining techniques to real-world data sets, we close a gap in literature and focus on robust bagging classifiers. In this work, we answer the question, if the recognition rate of ensemble classifiers is significantly better than the recognition rate of the native classifiers. We analyse two types of bagging classifiers, i.e. (i) support vector machine and nearest neighbour ensembles and (ii) random forests. We compare their performance in terms of accuracy and robustness on a NIALM data set recorded in a field study. The experimental analysis concentrates on recognition rates w.r.t. various training set sizes, on the influence of neighbourhood sizes and the numbers of decision trees in random forest ensembles. It turns out that the decision tree ensembles belong to the best classifiers in the employed scenarios.

Nevertheless, satisfying solutions have not been found with the considerations of both accuracy and system complexity. From the perspective of lightweight mobile devices, they are extremely important characteristics, because both the processor power and energy availability are limited. Hence, an indoor localization system with high computational complexity can cause complete battery drain within a few hours. In our research, we use a data mining technique named boosting to develop a localization system based on multiple weighted decision trees to predict the device location, since it has high accuracy and low computational complexity. The localization system is built using a dataset from sensor fusion, which combines the strength of radio signals from different wireless local area network access points and device orientation information from a digital compass built-in mobile device, so that extra sensors are unnecessary.

This article argues that an interdisciplinary approach, combining the body of statistical research in small area estimation with the body of research in social data mining based on Big Data, can provide novel means to tackle this problem successfully. Big Data derived from the digital crumbs that humans leave behind in their daily activities are in fact providing ever more accurate proxies of social life. Social data mining from these data, coupled with advanced model-based techniques for fine-grained estimates, have the potential to provide a novel microscope through which to view and understand social complexity. This article suggests three ways to use Big Data together with small area estimation techniques, and shows how Big Data has the potential to mirror aspects of well-being and other socioeconomic phenomena.

Segregation in steel cast products is an internal defect that can be very harmful when slabs are rolled in heavy plate mills. In this research work, the central segregation was studied with success using the data mining methodology based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique. For this purpose, the most important physical-chemical parameters are considered. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical-chemical variable on the segregation is presented through the model. Second, a model for forecasting segregation is obtained. Regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.93 for continuity factor estimation and 0.95 for average width were obtained when the MARS technique was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter.

About 537 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), 140 with lung squamous carcinoma (SCC), 9 with lung large-cell carcinoma (LCC), 56 with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and 590 without caner were integrated from 16 databases and analyzed in the present study. Three (ASPM, CDC20, KIAA1799) or 28 genes significantly up- or down-expressed in four subtypes of lung cancer. The activated cell division and down-regulated immune responses were identified in patients with lung cancer. Keratinocyte development associated genes S100 and SPRR families dominantly up-expressed in SCC and AKT3 and NRAS in SCLC. Subtype-specific genes of ADC, SCC, LCC, or SCLC were also identified. C1orf106, CAPN8, CDC20, COL11A1, CRABP2, and NBPF9 up-expressed at four stages of ADC. Fifty six related with keratinocytes or potassium channels up-expressed in three stages of SCC. CDC20, IL10, ECM1, GABPB2, CRABP2, and COL11A1 significantly predicted the poor overall survival of ADC patients and S100A2 and TIMM17A in SCC patients. Our data indicate that a number of altered chromosome 1 genes have the subtype and stage specificities of lung cancer and can be considered as diagnostic and prognosis biomarkers.

If a cause-and-effect relationship follows a oneaEurotoaEuroone relation, we can focus on a cause to treat an effect, but such a relation cannot be applied in cardiovascular diseases. To identify novel drugs in the cardiovascular field, we generally adopt two different strategies: induction and deduction. In the cardiovascular field, it is difficult to use deduction because cardiovascular diseases are caused by many factors, leading us to use induction. In this method, we consider all clinical data, such as medical records or genetic data, and identify a few candidates. Recent computational and mathematical advances enable us to use data-mining methods to uncover hidden relationships between many parameters and clinical outcomes. However, because these candidates are not identified as promoting or inhibiting factors, or as causal or consequent factors of cardiovascular diseases, we need to test them in basic research, and bring them back to the clinical field to test their efficacy in clinical trials. With such a "back-and-forth loop" between clinical observation and basic research, data-mining methods may provide novel strategies leading to new tools for clinicians, basic findings for researchers, and better outcomes for patients.

The main challenge is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Due to the intrinsic complexity and the uncertainty in gene sequence, the adoption of data mining methods is increasingly becoming popular. There are various methods developed on different strategies in this direction. This article focuses on the construction of new hybrid machine learning ensembles that solve the splice junction task more effectively. A novel supervised feature reduction technique is developed using entropy-based fuzzy rough set theory optimized by greedy hill-climbing algorithm. The average prediction accuracy achieved is above 98% with 95% confidence interval. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using various metrics to establish the statistical significance of the results. The experiments are conducted using various schemes with human DNA sequence data. The obtained results are highly promising as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in literature.

In this work, we used a whole-cell based assay to screen a diverse collection of small molecules for growth inhibitors of a relevant strain of Bcc, B. cenocepacia K56-2. The primary screen used bacterial growth in 96-well plate format and identified 206 primary actives among 30,259 compounds. From 100 compounds with no previous record of antibacterial activity secondary screening and data mining selected a total of Bce bioactives that were further analyzed. An experimental pipeline, evaluating in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, toxicity and in vivo antibacterial activity using C. elegans was used for prioritizing compounds with better chances to be further investigated as potential Bcc antibacterial drugs. This high throughput screen, along with the in vitro and in vivo analysis highlights the utility of this experimental method to quickly identify bioactives as a starting point of antibacterial drug discovery.

The postoperative complications present great challenges within treatment and they're hard for early warning. Methods: Data from 525 patients diagnosed with HNSCC including a training set (n = 513) and an external testing set (n = 12) in our institution between 2006 and 2011 was collected. Variables involved are general demographic characteristics, complications, disease and treatment given. Five data mining algorithms were firstly exploited to construct predictive models in the training set. Subsequently, cross-validation was used to compare the different performance of these models and the best data mining algorithm model was then selected to perform the prediction in an external testing set. Results: Data from 513 patients (age > 60 y) with HNSCC in a training set was included while 44 variables were selected (P < 0.05). Five predictive models were constructed; the model with 44 variables based on the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the best accuracy (89.084 %) and the best AUC value (0.949). In an external testing set, the accuracy (83.333 %) and the AUC value (0.781) were obtained by using the random forest algorithm model. Conclusions: Data mining should be a promising approach used for elderly patients with HNSCC to predict the probability of postoperative complications. Our results highlighted the potential of computational prediction of postoperative complications in elderly patients with HNSCC by using the random forest algorithm model.

Extracting Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma from Electronic Medical Records for Genetic Association Studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; EMERGE NETWORK; UNITED-STATES; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; VISUAL IMPAIRMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY PAGE; HEALTH RECORDS; PHENOME-WIDE; RISK	Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being widely implemented for use in genetic and genomic studies. As a phenotypic rich resource, EMRs provide researchers with the opportunity to identify disease cohorts and perform genotype-phenotype association studies. The Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) study, as part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) I study, has genotyped more than 15,000 individuals of diverse genetic ancestry in BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's biorepository linked to a de-identified version of the EMR (EAGLE BioVU). Here we develop and deploy an algorithm utilizing data mining techniques to identify primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in African Americans from EAGLE BioVU for genetic association studies. The algorithm described here was designed using a combination of diagnostic codes, current procedural terminology billing codes, and free text searches to identify POAG status in situations where gold-standard digital photography cannot be accessed. The case algorithm identified 267 potential POAG subjects but underperformed after manual review with a positive predictive value of 51.6% and an accuracy of 76.3%. The control algorithm identified controls with a negative predictive value of 98.3%.

Proton Pump Inhibitor Usage and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction in the General Population	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; PLASMA ASYMMETRIC DIMETHYLARGININE; CORONARY-ANGIOGRAPHY; CLOPIDOGREL; MORTALITY; DISEASE; ASPIRIN; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; ASSOCIATION; OMEPRAZOLE	Background and Aims Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes amongst clopidogrel users after an acute coronary syndrome. Recent pre-clinical results suggest that this risk might extend to subjects without any prior history of cardiovascular disease. We explore this potential risk in the general population via data-mining approaches. Methods Using a novel approach for mining clinical data for pharmacovigilance, we queried over 16 million clinical documents on 2.9 million individuals to examine whether PPI usage was associated with cardiovascular risk in the general population. Results In multiple data sources, we found gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients exposed to PPIs to have a 1.16 fold increased association (95% CI 1.09-1.24) with myocardial infarction (MI). Survival analysis in a prospective cohort found a two-fold (HR = 2.00; 95% CI 1.07-3.78; P = 0.031) increase in association with cardiovascular mortality. We found that this association exists regardless of clopidogrel use. We also found that H-2 blockers, an alternate treatment for GERD, were not associated with increased cardiovascular risk; had they been in place, such pharmacovigilance algorithms could have flagged this risk as early as the year 2000. Conclusions Consistent with our pre-clinical findings that PPIs may adversely impact vascular function, our data-mining study supports the association of PPI exposure with risk for MI in the general population. These data provide an example of how a combination of experimental studies and data-mining approaches can be applied to prioritize drug safety signals for further investigation.

People may use data mining tools to discover useful relationships from shared data. However, some relationships are sensitive to the data owners and they hope to conceal them before sharing. In this paper, we address this problem in forms of association rule hiding. A hiding method based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) is proposed, which performs the hiding task by selectively inserting items into the database to decrease the confidence of sensitive rules below specified thresholds. The side effects generated during the hiding process are taken as optimization goals to be minimized. HypE, a recently proposed EMO algorithm, is utilized to identify promising transactions for modification to minimize side effects. Results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively perform sanitization with fewer damages to the non-sensitive knowledge in most cases.

Therefore, feature selection has become a necessary step to make the analysis more manageable and to extract useful knowledge about a given domain. A large variety of feature selection techniques are available in literature, and their comparative analysis is a very difficult task. So far, few studies have investigated, from a theoretical and/or experimental point of view, the degree of similarity/dissimilarity among the available techniques, namely the extent to which they tend to produce similar results within specific application contexts. This kind of similarity analysis is of crucial importance when two or more methods are combined in an ensemble fashion: indeed the ensemble paradigm is beneficial only if the involved methods are capable of giving different and complementary representations of the considered domain. This paper gives a contribution in this direction by proposing an empirical approach to evaluate the degree of consistency among the outputs of different selection algorithms in the context of high dimensional classification tasks. Leveraging on a proper similarity index, we systematically compared the feature subsets selected by eight popular selection methods, representatives of different selection approaches, and derived a similarity trend for feature subsets of increasing size. Through an extensive experimentation involving sixteen datasets from three challenging domains (Internet advertisements, text categorization and micro-array data classification), we obtained useful insight into the pattern of agreement of the considered methods. In particular, our results revealed how multivariate selection approaches systematically produce feature subsets that overlap to a small extent with those selected by the other methods.

Ensemble learning methods for pay-per-click campaign management	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sponsored search; Pay-per-click advertising; Classification; Ensemble modeling	STACKED GENERALIZATION; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; STRENGTH DETECTION; SPONSORED SEARCH; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS; COST; TEXT	Sponsored search advertising has become a successful channel for advertisers as well as a profitable business model for the leading commercial search engines. There is an extensive sponsored search research stream regarding the classification and prediction of performance metrics such as clickthrough rate, impression rate, average results page position and conversion rate. However, there is limited research on the application of advanced data mining techniques, such as ensemble learning, to pay per click campaign classification. This research presents an in-depth analysis of sponsored search advertising campaigns by comparing the classification results from four base classification models (Naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, and Support Vector Machines) with four popular ensemble learning techniques (Voting, Boot Strap Aggregation, Stacked Generalization, and MetaCost). The goal of our research is to determine whether ensemble learning techniques can predict profitable pay-per-click campaigns and hence increase the profitability of the overall portfolio of campaigns when compared to standard classifiers. We found that the ensemble learning methods were superior classifiers based on a profit per campaign evaluation criterion. This paper extends the research on applied ensemble methods with respect to sponsored search advertising. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems have become ubiquitous in wind energy technology and they pose the challenge of extracting from them simple and explanatory information on goodness of operation and performance. In the present work, post processing methods are applied on the SCADA measurements of two onshore wind farms sited in southern Italy. Innovative and meaningful indicators of goodness of performance are formulated. The philosophy is a climax in the granularity of the analysis: first, Malfunctioning Indexes are proposed, which quantify goodness of merely operational behavior of the machine, irrespective of the quality of output. Subsequently the focus is shifted to the analysis of the farms in the productive phase: dependency of farm efficiency on wind direction is investigated through the polar plot, which is revisited in a novel way in order to make it consistent for onshore wind farms. Finally, the inability of the nacelle to optimally follow meandering wind due to wakes is analysed through a Stationarity Index and a Misalignment Index, which are shown to capture the relation between mechanical behavior of the turbine and degradation of the power output.

The predictive models of the HVAC energy consumption and the environment conditions of multiple zones are constructed by data mining algorithms. Two major environment conditions, the room temperature and the relative room humidity, are considered. Two variables of operating the HVAC system, the supply air temperature set point and the supply air static pressure set point, in the predictive models are optimized with respect to minimizing the HVAC energy while maintaining the predefined environment conditions of each zone. A novel heuristic search algorithm, the firefly algorithm, is utilized to solve the data-driven predictive models and derive the optimal settings of two set points under required HVAC operational constraints. The firefly algorithm is compared with the particle swarm optimization and evolutionary strategy to demonstrate its advantages in solving the proposed optimization problem. HVAC energy saving with the proposed data-driven framework is examined in the computational studies. A sensitivity analysis of the potential of energy saving based on different types of environment condition constraints is conducted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose exploring returns from 21 European stock markets by model-based clustering of regime switching models. These econometric models identify clusters of time series with similar dynamic patterns and moreover allow relaxing assumptions of existing approaches, such as the assumption of conditional Gaussian returns. The proposed model handles simultaneously the heterogeneity across stock markets and over time, i.e., time-constant and time-varying discrete latent variables capture unobserved heterogeneity between and within stock markets, respectively. The results show a clear distinction between two groups of stock markets, each one characterized by different regime switching dynamics that correspond to different expected return-risk patterns. We identify three regimes: the so-called bull and bear regimes, as well as a stable regime with returns close to 0, which turns out to be the most frequently occurring regime. This is consistent with stylized facts in financial econometrics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Over the last several years, the experimental determination of RNA structures through x-ray crystallography and NMR seems to have reached a plateau in the number of structures resolved each year, but as more and more RNA sequences are being discovered, the need for structure prediction tools to complement experimental data is strong. Theoretical approaches to RNA folding have been developed since the late nineties, when the first algorithms for secondary structure prediction appeared. Over the last 10 years a number of prediction methods for 3D structures have been developed, first based on bioinformatics and data-mining, and more recently based on a coarse-grained physical representation of the systems. In this review we are going to present the challenges of RNA structure prediction and the main ideas behind bioinformatic approaches and physics-based approaches. We will focus on the description of the more recent physics-based phenomenological models and on how they are built to include the specificity of the interactions of RNA bases, whose role is critical in folding. Through examples from different models, we will point out the strengths of physics-based approaches, which are able not only to predict equilibrium structures, but also to investigate dynamical and thermodynamical behavior, and the open challenges to include more key interactions ruling RNA folding.

It aims to select a compact feature subset with the maximal discriminative capability. The discriminability of a feature subset requires that selected features have a high relevance to class labels, whereas the compactness demands a low redundancy within the selected feature subset. This paper defines a new feature redundancy measurement capable of accurately estimating mutual information between features with respect to the target class (MIFS-CR). Based on a relevance measure and this new redundancy measure, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with class-dependent redundancy for feature selection (MECY-FS) is presented. The MECY-FS algorithm employs the Pareto optimality to evaluate candidate feature subsets and finds compact feature subsets with both the maximal relevance and the minimal redundancy. Experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the new redundancy measure, and the MECY-FS algorithm is verified to be able to generate compact feature subsets with a high predictive capability.

Among many, one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However, due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify three operational factors underlying social network effects, including interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the monetary aspect in users' decision making process of product adoption. Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7 in. tablets is used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model. The results demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model with average F-scores of 89.8% for the week prediction model and of 86.7% for the bi-week prediction model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Ronowicz, J; Thommes, M; Kleinebudde, P; Krysinski, J				Ronowicz, Joanna; Thommes, Markus; Kleinebudde, Peter; Krysinski, Jerzy			A data mining approach to optimize pellets manufacturing process based on a decision tree algorithm	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Aspect ratio; Data mining; Decision trees; Pellets	ALTERNATIVE PELLETIZATION AID; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; KAPPA-CARRAGEENAN; MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE; FORMULATION; DESIGN; EXTRUSION/SPHERONISATION; TABLETS; FILLER; DRUG	The present study is focused on the thorough analysis of cause-effect relationships between pellet formulation characteristics (pellet composition as well as process parameters) and the selected quality attribute of the final product. The shape using the aspect ratio value expressed the quality of pellets. A data matrix for chemometric analysis consisted of 224 pellet formulations performed by means of eight different active pharmaceutical ingredients and several various excipients, using different extrusion/spheronization process conditions. The data set contained 14 input variables (both formulation and process variables) and one output variable (pellet aspect ratio). A tree regression algorithm consistent with the Quality by Design concept was applied to obtain deeper understanding and knowledge of formulation and process parameters affecting the final pellet sphericity. The clear interpretable set of decision rules were generated. The spehronization speed, spheronization time, number of holes and water content of extrudate have been recognized as the key factors influencing pellet aspect ratio. The most spherical pellets were achieved by using a large number of holes during extrusion, a high spheronizer speed and longer time of spheronization. The described data mining approach enhances knowledge about pelletization process and simultaneously facilitates searching for the optimal process conditions which are necessary to achieve ideal spherical pellets, resulting in good flow characteristics. This data mining approach can be taken into consideration by industrial formulation scientists to support rational decision making in the field of pellets technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because hyperlipidemia and related disease are common issues worldwide, this study analyzed the prescription patterns and frequencies of CHPs for treating patients with hyperlipidemia in Taiwan. Background: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become popular as a therapy for controlling symptoms in patients with hyperlipidemia. This study aimed to analyze the prescription patterns of TCM for patients with hyperlipidemia in Taiwan. Methods: The study population was recruited from a random-sampled cohort of 1,000,000 people from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2003 and 2009. We identified 30,784 outpatient visits related with hyperlipidemia diagnosis and collected these medical records. Association rules of data mining were conducted to explore the co-prescription patterns for Chinese herbal products (CHPs). Results: The most commonly prescribed herbal formula for hyperlipidemia treatment was Xue-Fu-ZhuYu-Tang (16.1%), and Shan Zha (Crataegi fnictus; 25.0%) was the most commonly prescribed single herb. The most commonly prescribed combination of an herbal formula and a single herb was Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang and Dan Shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), and the most commonly prescribed combination of couplet herbs was Dan Shen and Shan Zha. Conclusion: Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang is the most frequently prescribed formula and is typically prescribed with Shan Zha, Dan Shen, and He Shou Wu for patients with hyperlipidemia. Clinical trials are warranted in future research to investigate the effects of the CHPs in terms of safety and efficacy and in particular to evaluate potential interactions with conventional treatments.

Spondin-2 is a conserved secreted extracellular matrix protein and a candidate cancer biomarker. Here we found that Spondin-2 mRNA was upregulated in CRC tissues using quantitative RT-PCR and data-mining of public Oncomine microarray datasets. Spondin-2 protein was increased in CRC tissues, as revealed by immunohistochemistry analyses of two tissue microarrays containing 180 cases. Spondin-2 gene expression was significantly associated with CRC stage, T stage, M stage and Dukes stage, while its protein was associated with age and M stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the upregulated Spondin-2 mRNA and protein predicted poor prognosis of CRC patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that grade, recurrence, N stage and high Spondin-2 were independent predictors of overall survival of CRC patients. ELISA revealed that plasma Spondin-2 was upregulated in CRC and dropped after surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that plasma Spondin-2 has superior predictive performance for CRC with an area under the curve of 0.959 and the best sensitivity/specificity of 100%/90%. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Spondin-2 enhanced colon cancer cell proliferation. Spondin-2 could be an independent diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of colon cancer.

J	Hofmann-Apitius, M				Hofmann-Apitius, Martin			Is dementia research ready for big data approaches?	BMC MEDICINE			English	Editorial Material						Big data; Data interoperability; Semantic harmonization; Disease modeling; Data mining; Disease mechanisms		The "big data" paradigm has gained a lot of attention recently, in particular in those areas of biomedicine where we face clear unmet medical needs. Coined as a new paradigm for complex problem solving, big data approaches seem to open promising perspectives in particular for a better understanding of complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In this commentary, we will provide a brief overview on big data principles and the potential they may bring to dementia research, and - most importantly - we will do a reality check in order to provide an answer to the question of whether dementia research is ready for big data approaches.

Data-mining studies of protein crystals find that similar to 80% of the T-shaped histidine...aromatic contacts are CH...pi, and only similar to 20% are NH...pi interactions. We investigated the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the supersonic-jet-cooled imidazole.benzene (Im.Bz) complex as a model for the NH...pi interaction between histidine and phenylalanine. Ground- and excited-state dispersion-corrected density functional calculations and correlated methods (SCS-MP2 and SCS-CC2) predict that Im.Bz has a C-s-symmetric T-shaped minimum-energy structure with an NH...pi hydrogen bond to the Bz ring; the NH bond is tilted 12 degrees away from the Bz C-6 axis. IR depletion spectra support the T-shaped geometry: The NH stretch vibrational fundamental is red shifted by -73 cm(-1) relative to that of bare imidazole at 3518 cm(-1), indicating a moderately strong NH...pi interaction. While the S-0(A(1g)) -> S-1(B-2u) origin of benzene at 38 086 cm(-1) is forbidden in the gas phase, Im.Bz exhibits a moderately intense S-0 -> S-1 origin, which appears via the D-6h -> C-s symmetry lowering of Bz by its interaction with imidazole. The NH...pi ground-state hydrogen bond is strong, D-e=22.7 kJ/mol (1899 cm(-1)). The combination of gas-phase UV and IR spectra confirms the theoretical predictions that the optimum Im.Bz geometry is T shaped and NH...pi hydrogen bonded. We find no experimental evidence for a CH...pi hydrogen-bonded ground-state isomer of Im.Bz. The optimum NH...pi geometry of the Im.Bz complex is very different from the majority of the histidine.aromatic contact geometries found in protein database analyses, implying that the CH...pi contacts observed in these searches do not arise from favorable binding interactions but merely from protein side-chain folding and crystal-packing constraints. The UV and IR spectra of the imidazole.(benzene)(2) cluster are observed via fragmentation into the Im.Bz(+) mass channel. The spectra of Im.Bz and Im.Bz(2) are cleanly separable by IR hole burning. The UV spectrum of Im.Bz(2) exhibits two 000 bands corresponding to the S-0 -> S-1 excitations of the two inequivalent benzenes, which are symmetrically shifted by -86/+88 cm(-1) relative to the 0(0)(0) band of benzene.
