J	Raahemi, B; Zhong, WC; Liu, J				Raahemi, Bijan; Zhong, Weicai; Liu, Jing			Exploiting unlabeled data to improve peer-to-peer traffic classification using incremental tri-training method	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Stream data mining; Concept drift; Windowing technique; Tri-training; Unlabeled data; Peer-to-peer traffic; IP traffic identification		Unlabeled training examples are readily available in many applications, but labeled examples are fairly expensive to obtain. For instance, in our previous works on classification of peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet traffics, we observed that only about 25% of examples can be labeled as "P2P" or "NonP2P" using a port-based heuristic rule. We also expect that even fewer examples can be labeled in the future as more and more P2P applications use dynamic ports. This fact motivates us to investigate the techniques which enhance the accuracy of P2P traffic classification by exploiting the unlabeled examples. In addition, the Internet data flows dynamically in large volumes ( streaming data). In P2P applications, new communities of peers often join and old communities of peers often leave, requiring the classifiers to be capable of updating the model incrementally, and dealing with concept drift. Based on these requirements, this paper proposes an incremental TriTraining (iTT) algorithm. We tested our approach on a real data stream with 7.2 Mega labeled examples and 20.4 Mega unlabeled examples. The results show that iTT algorithm can enhance accuracy of P2P traffic classification by exploiting unlabeled examples. In addition, it can effectively deal with dynamic nature of streaming data to detect the changes in communities of peers. We extracted attributes only from the IP layer, eliminating the privacy concern associated with the techniques that use deep packet inspection.

In Nearest Prototype classifiers, a collection of prototypes has to be found that accurately represents the input patterns. The classifier then assigns classes based on the nearest prototype in this collection. The MPSO algorithm is used to process training data to find those prototypes. In the MPSO algorithm each particle in a swarm represents a single prototype in the solution and it uses modified movement rules with particle competition and cooperation that ensure particle diversity. The proposed method is tested both with artificial problems and with real benchmark problems and compared with several algorithms of the same family. Results show that the particles are able to recognize clusters, find decision boundaries and reach stable situations that also retain adaptation potential. The MPSO algorithm is able to improve the accuracy of 1-NN classifiers, obtains results comparable to the best among other classifiers, and improves the accuracy reported in literature for one of the problems.

Exact Knowledge Hiding through Database Extension	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Privacy preserving data mining; knowledge hiding; association rule mining; binary integer programming	DISTRIBUTED CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION; ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHMS	In this paper, we propose a novel, exact border-based approach that provides an optimal solution for the hiding of sensitive frequent item sets by 1) minimally extending the original database by a synthetically generated database part-the database extension, 2) formulating the creation of the database extension as a constraint satisfaction problem, 3) mapping the constraint satisfaction problem to an equivalent binary integer programming problem, 4) exploiting underutilized synthetic transactions to proportionally increase the support of nonsensitive item sets, 5) minimally relaxing the constraint satisfaction problem to provide an approximate solution close to the optimal one when an ideal solution does not exist, and 6) using a partitioning in the universe of the items to increase the efficiency of the proposed hiding algorithm. Extending the original database for sensitive item set hiding is proved to provide optimal solutions to an extended set of hiding problems compared to previous approaches and to provide solutions of higher quality. Moreover, the application of binary integer programming enables the simultaneous hiding of the sensitive item sets and thus allows for the identification of globally optimal solutions.

Since existing methods for estimation of class membership probability are designed for binary classification, in which only a single score outputted from a classifier can be used, an approach for multiclass classification requires both a decomposition of a multiclass classifier into binary classifiers and a combination of estimates obtained from each binary classifier to a target estimate. We propose a simple and general method for directly estimating class membership probability for any class in multiclass classification without decomposition and combination, using multiple scores not only for a predicted class but also for other proper classes. To make it possible to use multiple scores, we propose to modify or extend representative existing methods. As a non-parametric method, which refers to the idea of a binning method as proposed by Zadrozny et al., we create an "accuracy table" by a different method. Moreover we smooth accuracies on the table with methods such as the moving average to yield reliable probabilities (accuracies). As a parametric method, we extend Platt's method to apply a multiple logistic regression. On two different datasets (open-ended data from Japanese social surveys and the 20 Newsgroups) both with Support Vector Machines and naive Bayes classifiers, we empirically show that the use of multiple scores is effective in the estimation of class membership probabilities in multiclass classification in terms of cross entropy, the reliability diagram, the ROC curve and AUC (area under the ROC curve), and that the proposed smoothing method for the accuracy table works quite well. Finally, we show empirically that in terms of MSE (mean squared error), our best proposed method is superior to an expansion for multiclass classification of a PAV method proposed by Zadrozny et al., in both the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the Pendigits dataset, but is slightly worse than the state-of-the-art method, which is an expansion for multiclass classification of a combination of boosting and a PAV method, on the Pendigits dataset.

A retrospective analysis was performed in 381 breast cancer patients diagnosed. Age, menopausal status, age of menarche, family history of cancer, histologic tumor type, quadrant of tumor, tumor size, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, histologic and nuclear grading, axillary nodal status, pericapsular involvement of lymph nodes, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy were assessed. Based on these prognostic factors, new prognostic indexes for C&RT, CHAID, QUEST, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 and Cox regression were obtained. Prognostic indexes showed a good degree of classification, which demonstrates that an improvement seems possible using standard risk factors. We obtained that C4.5 has a better performance than C&RT, CHAID, QUEST, ID3, C5.0 and Cox regression to determine risk groups using Random Survival Forests (RSF). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Beghdad, R				Beghdad, Rachid			Efficient deterministic method for detecting new U2R attacks	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Linear programming system; Behavior classes; Misuse detection; Simulation tool; Knowledge discovery; Data mining (KDD) dataset		The purpose of this study is to describe an efficient deterministic intrusion detection approach that detects both old and new attacks. We especially focused on detecting the user to root (U2R) attacks of the 1999 DARPA evaluation dataset. The main idea of our approach is to test if an unknown behavior is close enough to a known behavior (attack or normal) such as we can conclude that it belongs to its class. To achieve that, we formulate the problem of intrusion detection as a linear programming system (LPS). The objective function of this LPS leads to minimize the distance between an unknown behavior and one of the known behaviors, by respect of some constraints. The solution of such a problem is a set of bivalent variables x(ij). If (x(ij) = 1) then we can conclude that the unknown behavior i belong to the class of behaviors j. Our experiments demonstrated the efficiency of our approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NETMINE performs generalized association rule extraction to profile communications, detect anomalies, and identify recurrent patterns. Association rule extraction is a widely used exploratory technique to discover hidden correlations among data. However, it is usually driven by frequency constraints on the extracted correlations. Hence, it entails (i) generating a huge number of rules which are difficult to analyze, or (ii) pruning rare itemsets even if their hidden knowledge might be relevant. To overcome these issues NETMINE exploits a novel algorithm to efficiently extract generalized association rules, which provide a high level abstraction of the network traffic and allows the discovery of unexpected and more interesting traffic rules. The proposed technique exploits (user provided) taxonomies to drive the pruning phase of the extraction process. Extracted correlations are automatically aggregated in more general association rules according to a frequency threshold. Eventually, extracted rules are classified into groups according to their semantic meaning, thus allowing a domain expert to focus on the most relevant patterns. Experiments performed on different network dumps showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the NETMINE framework to characterize traffic data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jacquemont, S; Jacquenet, F; Sebban, M				Jacquemont, Stephanie; Jacquenet, Francois; Sebban, Marc			Mining probabilistic automata: a statistical view of sequential pattern mining	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Sequence mining; Probabilistic automaton; Privacy preserving data mining	DATA STREAMS; PRIVACY; DISCOVERY; SEQUENCES	During the past decade, sequential pattern mining has been the core of numerous research efforts. It is now possible to efficiently extract knowledge of users' behavior from a huge set of sequences collected over time. This has applications in various domains such as purchases in supermarkets, Web site visits, etc. However, sequence mining algorithms do little to control the risks of extracting false discoveries or overlooking true knowledge. In this paper, the theoretical conditions to achieve a relevant sequence mining process are examined. Then, the article offers a statistical view of sequence mining which has the following advantages: First, it uses a compact and generalized representation of the original sequences in the form of a probabilistic automaton. Second, it integrates statistical constraints to guarantee the extraction of significant patterns. Finally, it provides an interesting solution in a privacy preserving context in order to respect individuals' information. An application in car flow modeling is presented, showing the ability of our algorithm (acsm) to discover frequent routes without any private information. Comparisons with a classical sequence mining algorithm (spam) are made, showing the effectiveness of our approach.

The application of SOM as a decision support tool to identify AACSB peer schools	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Kohonen SOM networks; Cluster analysis; AACSB accreditation; Data mining	NETWORK	For a business school, the selection of its peer schools is an important component of its International Association for Management Education (AACSB) (re)accreditation process. A school typically compares itself with other institutions having similar structural and identity-based attributes. The identification of peer schools is critical and can have a significant impact on a business school's accreditation efforts. For many schools the selection of comparable peer schools is a judgmental process. This study offers an alternative means for selection; a quantitative technique called Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network for clustering. In this research, we first demonstrate the capability of SOM as a clustering tool to visually uncover the relationships among AACSB-accredited schools. The results suggest that SOM is an effective and robust Clustering method. Then, we compare the results of SOM with that of other clustering methods, such as K-means. Factor/K-means analysis, and kth nearest neighbor procedure.

Our proposed method consists of three phases. First, we scan the database once and create an index structure. Next, the index structure is scanned to find all frequent patterns of length two. Finally, we use the frequent k-patterns (k >= 2) to generate candidate (k + 1)-patterns and check if the support of each candidate generated is not less than the user-specified minimum support threshold by using the index structure. Then, the steps in the third phase are repeated until no more frequent patterns can be found. Since the 9DSPA-Miner algorithm uses the characteristics of the 9D-SPA representation to prune most of impossible candidates, the experiment results demonstrate that it is more efficient and scalable than the modified Apriori method.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			A sliding window method for finding top-k path traversal patterns over streaming Web click-sequences	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Web usage mining; Data streams; Top-k pattern mining; Path traversal patterns; Stream sliding windows	ITEMSETS	Online mining of path traversal patterns from Web click-streams is one of the most important problems of Web usage mining. In this paper, we propose a sliding window-based Web data mining algorithm, called Top-SW (Top-k path traversal patterns of Stream sliding Window), to discover the set of top-k path traversal patterns from streaming maximal forward references, where k is the desired number of path traversal patterns to be mined. A new summary data structure, called Top-list (a list of Top-k path traversal patterns) is developed to maintain the essential information about the top-k path traversal patterns from the current maximal forward references stream. Experimental studies show that the proposed Top-SW algorithm is an efficient, single-pass algorithm for mining the set of top-k path traversal patterns from a continuous stream of maximal forward references.

J	Shih, CC; Chiang, DA; Lai, SW; Hu, YW				Shih, Chien-Chou; Chiang, Ding-An; Lai, Sheng-Wei; Hu, Yen-Wei			Applying hybrid data mining techniques to web-based self-assessment system of Study and Learning Strategies Inventory	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rule; Decision tree; Self-assessment; LASSI		Traditional assessment tools, such as "Learning and Study Strategy Scale Inventory (LASSI)", are typically pen-and-paper tests that require responses to a multitude of questions. This may easily lead to student's resistance, fatigue and unwillingness to complete the assessment. To improve the situation, a hybrid data mining technique was applied to analyze the LASSI surveys of freshmen students at Tamkang University. The most significant contribution of this research is in dynamically reducing the number of questions while the LASSI assessment is proceeding. To verify the appliance of the proposed method, a web-based LASSI self-assessment system (Web-LSA) was developed. This system can be used as a guide to determine study disturbances for high-risk groups, and can provide counselors with fundamental information on which to base follow-up counseling services to its users.

We employ both a traditional C4.5 decision tree approach, and a novel locally profit-optimal decision algorithm, called SBP, to discover the characteristics of profitable demographics for PetPlan to market to. We use publicly available data, including US census data, and veterinary clinic location data as Our data sources. We evaluate our results, and give actionable recommendations for the managers of PetPlan USA. Our results indicate that entropy-based decision tree induction approaches, which focus oil node purity (predominance of one category over mother at each node in the tree), can produce lower profits compared to SBP, which is a novel profit-based decision tree approach.

J	Chen, TC; Tsao, HL				Chen, Ta-Cheng; Tsao, Huei-Ling			Using a hybrid meta-evolutionary rule mining approach as a classification response model	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Meta-evolutionary; Classification; Decision rules	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FUZZY RULES; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; TRAINING EXAMPLES; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	Data mining usually means the approaches and appliances for the valid new knowledge discovery from databases. A response model can be built as a decision model for prediction or classification of a domain problem potential like expert systems. In this paper, a hybrid meta-evolutionary rule mining based approach to assess numerical data pattern in the classification problems is proposed for extracting the decision rules including the predictors. the corresponding inequalities and parameters simultaneously so as to building a decision-making model with maximum classification accuracy. In real world, problems are highly nonlinear in nature so that it's hard to develop a comprehensive model taking into account all the independent variables through the conventional statistical methods. Recently, nonlinear and complex machine learning approaches such as neural networks and support vector Machines have been demonstrated to be with more reliable than the conventional statistical approaches. Although the usefulness of using neural networks and support machines has been reported in literatures. the most obstacles are in model building and use of model in which the classification rules are hard to be realized. Through two numerical experiments, we compared our results against the commercial data mining software and other methods in literature. and then We show experimentally that the proposed approach is promising for improving prediction accuracy and enhancing modeling simplicity.

Hence, knowledge and feedback on customer demand and consumption experience has become an important information and asset for enterprises. This paper investigates the following research issues in a world leading bicycle brand/manufacture company, GIANT of Taiwan: what exactly are the customers' "functional needs" and "wants" for bicycles? Does knowledge of the customers and the product itself reflect the needs of the market? Can product design and planning for production tines be integrated with the knowledge of customers and market channels? Can the knowledge of customers and market channels be transformed into knowledge assets of the enterprises during the stage of NPD? The a priori algorithm is a methodology of association rule for data mining, which is implemented for mining demand chain knowledge from channels (sales and maintenance) and customers. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the case firm for NPD and marketing.

This paper employs sUpervised Classifier System (UCS), a supervised learning classifier system, that was introduced in 2003 for classification tasks in data mining. We present an adaptive framework of UCS on top of a self-organized map (SOM) neural network. The overall classification problem is decomposed adaptively and in real time by the SOM into subproblems, each of which is handled by a separate UCS. The framework is also tested with replacing UCS by a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). Experiments on several synthetic and real data sets, including a very large real data set, show that the accuracy of classifications in the proposed distributed environment is as good or better than in the nondistributed environment, and execution is faster. In general, each UCS attached to a cell in the SOM has a much smaller population size than a single UCS working on the overall problem; since each data instance is exposed to a smaller population size than in the single population approach, the throughput of the overall system increases. The experiments show that the proposed framework can decompose a problem adaptively into subproblems, maintaining or improving accuracy and increasing speed.

J	Woon, WL; Wong, KSD				Woon, Wei Lee; Wong, Kuok-Shoong Daniel			String alignment for automated document versioning	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						String matching; Text processing; Data mining; Versioning; Information retrieval	SEQUENCE; KERNELS	The automated analysis of documents is an important task given the rapid increase in availability of digital texts. Automatic text processing systems often encode documents as vectors of term occurrence frequencies, a representation which facilitates the classification and clustering of documents. Historically, this approach derives from the related field of data mining, where database entries are commonly represented as points in a vector space. While this lineage has certainly contributed to the development of text processing, there are situations where document collections do not conform to this clustered structure, and where the vector representation may be unsuitable for text analysis. As a proof-of-concept, we had previously presented a framework where the optimal alignments of documents could be used for visualising the relationships within small sets of documents. In this paper we develop this approach further by using it to automatically generate the version histories of various document collections. For comparison, version histories generated using conventional methods of document representation are also produced. To facilitate this comparison, a simple procedure for evaluating the accuracy of the version histories thus generated is proposed.

J	Allampalli-Nagaraj, G; Bichindaritz, I				Allampalli-Nagaraj, Gowri; Bichindaritz, Isabelle			Automatic semantic indexing of medical images using a web ontology language for case-based image retrieval	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Ontologies; Image indexing; Semantic annotation; Semantic indexing; Image retrieval methods; Visual feature extraction; Content-based retrieval		This paper presents a system implemented to evaluate the retrieval efficiency of images when they are semantically indexed using a combination of a web ontology language and the low-level features of the image. Finding a similarity measure algorithm to retrieve images based on the semantic metadata can be very challenging due to diverse image content and inadequate domain-specific ontologies describing the content. The existing methods for indexing images are primarily based on text. While these methods are widely used due to their simplicity, they are not very efficient as they require a domain expert and the textual interpretations of image content vary from person to person, In our approach, we leverage sophisticated image-processing techniques to automatically extract image content information into MPEG-7 format and associate them to the existing domain ontologies developed by experts, thereby, bridging the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. This implementation and validation experiments show that a high retrieval accuracy rate is obtained when all the image descriptors are combined with an ontology while building the semantic metadata for indexing images.

The comparison of patterns is a fundamental issue, which can be exploited, among others, to synthetically measure dissimilarities in evolving or different datasets and to compare the output produced by different data mining algorithms on a same dataset. In this paper, we present the PANDA framework for computing the dissimilarity of both simple and complex patterns, defined upon raw data and other patterns, respectively. In PANDA the problem of comparing complex patterns is decomposed into simpler sub-problems on the component (simple or complex) patterns and so-obtained partial solutions are then smartly aggregated into an overall dissimilarity score. This intrinsically recursive approach grants PANDA with a high flexibility and allows it to easily handle patterns with highly complex structures. PANDA is built upon a few basic concepts so as to be generic and clear to the end user. We demonstrate the generality and flexibility Of PANDA by showing how it can be easily applied to a variety of pattern types, including sets of itemsets and clusterings. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A distinctive feature of the aspect Bernoulli (AB) model is its ability to automatically detect and distinguish between "true absences" and "false absences" (both of which are coded as 0 in the data), and similarly, between "true presences" and "false presences" (both of which are coded as 1). This is accomplished by specific additive noise components which explicitly account for such non-content bearing causes. The AB model is thus suitable for noise removal and data explanatory purposes, including omission/addition detection. An important application of AB that we demonstrate is data-driven reasoning about palaeontological recordings. Additionally, results on recovering corrupted handwritten digit images and expanding short text documents are also given, and comparisons to other methods are demonstrated and discussed.

J	da Silva, FAB; Senger, H				da Silva, Fabricio A. B.; Senger, Hermes			Improving scalability of Bag-of-Tasks applications running on master-slave platforms	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						Master-slave platforms; Scalability analysis; Bag-of-Tasks applications	SHARING FILES; GRIDS	Bag-of-Tasks applications are parallel applications composed of independent tasks. Examples of Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications include Monte Carlo simulations, massive searches (such as key breaking), image manipulation applications and data mining algorithms. This paper analyzes the scalability of Bag-of-Tasks applications running on master-slave platforms and proposes a scalability-related measure dubbed input file affinity. In this work, we also illustrate how the input file affinity, which is a characteristic of an application, can be used to improve the scalability of Bag-of-Tasks applications running on master-slave platforms. The input file affinity was considered in a new scheduling algorithm dubbed Dynamic Clustering, which is oblivious to task execution times. We compare the scalability of the Dynamic Clustering algorithm to several other algorithms, oblivious and non-oblivious to task execution times, proposed in the literature. We show in this paper that, in several situations, the oblivious algorithm Dynamic Clustering has scalability performance comparable to non-oblivious algorithms, which is remarkable considering that our oblivious algorithm uses much less information to schedule tasks.

Most of these claims have to do with evaluating FL accuracy. Our investigation centers on a new subject program having properties useful for FL experiments. We find that Tarantula (Jones et al.) works well on the program, and we show weak support for the assertion that coverage-based test suites help Tarantula to localize faults. Baudry et al. used automatically-generated mutants to evaluate the accuracy of an FL technique that generates many distinct scores for program locations. We find no evidence to suggest that the use of mutants for this purpose is invalid. However, we find evidence that the standard method for evaluating FL accuracy is unfairly biased toward techniques that generate many distinct scores, and we propose a fairer method of accuracy evaluation. Finally, Denmat et al. suggest that data mining techniques may apply to FL. We investigate this suggestion with the data mining tool Weka, using standard techniques for evaluating the accuracy of data mining classifiers. We find that standard classifiers suffer from the class imbalance problem. However, we find that adding cost information improves accuracy.

It is a tool for decision support that allows the coach to understand the strategy of the opponent. To reach that goal we employ Data Mining classification techniques. TO understand the simulated robotic soccer domain we briefly describe the Simulation system, some related work and the use of Data Mining techniques for the detection of formations. In order to perform a robotic soccer match with different formations we develop a way to configure the formations in a training base team (FC Portugal) and a data preparation process. The paper describes the base team and the test team,, used and the respective configuration process. After the matches between test teams the data is subjected to a reduction process taking into account the players' position in the field given the collective. In the modeling stage appropriate learning algorithms were selected. In the solution analysis, the error rate (% incorrectly classify instances) with the statistic test t-Student for paired samples were selected, as the evaluation measure. Experimental results show that it is possible to automatically identify the formations used by the base team (FC Portugal) in distinct matches against different opponents, using Data Mining techniques.

The overarching theme and goal of the program are to train the next-generation scientists in the tools and techniques of cyber-enabled science (e-Science) to prepare them to confront the emerging petascale challenges of data intensive science. The Mason CDS program has a significantly stronger focus on data-oriented approaches to science than do most computational science and engineering programs. The program has been designed specifically to focus both oil simulation (Computational Science) and on data-intensive applications (Data Science). New courses include Introduction to Computational & Data Sciences, Scientific Data and Databases, Scientific Data & Information Visualization, Scientific Data Mining, and Scientific Modeling & Simulation. This is an interdisciplinary science program, drawing examples, classroom materials, and student activities from a broad range of physical and biological sciences. We will describe some of the motivations and early results from the program. More information is available at http://cds.gmu.edu/.

Motivated by the recent theory on direct information sampling called compressed sensing (CS), we propose a framework for detecting anomalies from these large-scale data mining applications where the full information is not practically possible to obtain. Exploiting the fact that the intrinsic dimension of the data in these applications are typically small relative to the raw dimension and the fact that compressed sensing is capable of capturing most information with few measurements, our work show that spectral methods that used for volume anomaly detection can be directly applied to the CS data with guarantee on performance. Our theoretical contributions are supported by extensive experimental results on large datasets which show satisfactory performance.

While many mutual issues exist in both multi-agent and data mining areas, most of them can be described in terms of or related to ubiquitous intelligence. It is certainly very important to define, specify, represent, analyze and utilize ubiquitous intelligence in agents, data mining, and agent mining. This paper presents a novel but preliminary investigation of ubiquitous intelligence in these areas. We specify five types of ubiquitous intelligence: data intelligence, human intelligence, domain intelligence, network and web intelligence, organizational intelligence, and social intelligence. We define and illustrate them, and discuss techniques for involving them into agents, data mining, and agent mining for complex problem-solving. Further investigation on involving and synthesizing ubiquitous intelligence into agents, data mining, and agent mining will lead to a disciplinary upgrade from methodological, technical and practical perspectives.

It differs from the classical supervised learning setting in that, training samples are packed into bags with only the aggregate outputs (labels for classification or real values for regression) provided. This problem is associated with several kinds of application background. We focus on the aggregate outputs classification problem in this paper, and set up a framework based on kernel K-means to solve it. Two concrete algorithms based on our framework are proposed, each of which can cope with both binary and multi-class scenarios. The experimental results suggest that our algorithms outperform the state-of-art technique. Also, we propose a new setting for patch extraction in the Content Based Image Retrieval procedure by using the algorithm.

The task of distributed data mining is to extract and integrate knowledge from different sources. Solving such tasks requires a special approach and tools, different from those applied to learning from data located in a single database. One of the approaches suitable for the DDM is to select relevant local patterns from the distributed databases. Such patterns often called prototypes, are subsequently merged to create a compact representation of the distributed data repositories. Next, the global classifier, called combiner, can be learned from such a compact representation. The paper proposes and reviews several strategies for constructing combiner classifiers to be used in solving the DDM tasks. Suggested strategies are evaluated experimentally. The evaluation process is based on several well-known benchmark data sets.

In this paper, we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) solution to the Netflix Prize problem [1] based on weighted co-clustering [5]. The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware, while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing, threading, memory management, and deadlocks. The dataflow CF implementation first compresses the large, sparse training dataset into co-clusters. Then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies. When configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the Netflix training dataset, the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an RMSE of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge. This is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 mu s per rating which is far superior to previously reported results. Moreover, the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large, dyadic datasets [4, 7].

Examples include queries and URLs in query logs, and authors and papers in scientific literature. However, one of the issues is that previous algorithms only consider the content and link information from one side of the bipartite graph. There is a lack of constraints to make sure the final relevance of the score propagation on the graph, as there are many noisy edges within the bipartite graph. In this paper, we propose a novel and general Co-HITS algorithm to incorporate the bipartite graph with the content information from both sides as well as the constraints of relevance. Moreover, we investigate the algorithm based on two frameworks, including the iterative and the regularization frameworks, and illustrate the generalized Co-HITS algorithm from different views. For the iterative framework, it contains HITS and personalized PageRank as special cases. In the regularization framework, we successfully build a connection with HITS, and develop a new cost function to consider the direct relationship between two entity sets, which leads to a significant improvement over the baseline method. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the Co-HITS algorithm, with many different settings, to the application of query suggestion by mining the AOL query log data. Experimental results demonstrate that CoRegu-0.5 (i.e., a model of the regularization framework) achieves the best performance with consistent and promising improvements.

Methods such as Apriori and FP-growth have been shown to work efficiently in this setting. However, these techniques are typically restricted to a single concept level. Since typical business data bases support hierarchies that represent the relationships amongst many different concept levels, it is important that we extend our focus to discover frequent patterns in multi-level environments. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to this research area. In this paper, we present two novel algorithms that efficiently discover multi-level frequent patterns. Adopting either a top-down or bottom-up approach, our algorithms exploit existing fp-tree structures, rather than excessively scanning the raw data set multiple times, as might be done with a naive implementation. In addition, we also introduce an algorithm to mine cross-level frequent patterns. Experimental results have shown that our new algorithms maintain their performance advantage across a broad spectrum of test environments.

In the real world, however, there are many physical obstacles (e.g., buildings, blindages, etc.), and their presence may affect the visibility/distance between two objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel variant of RNN queries, namely visible reverse nearest neighbor (VRNN) search, which considers the obstacle influence on the visibility of objects. Given a data set P, an obstacle set O, and a query point q, a VRNN query retrieves the points in P that have q as their nearest neighbor and are visible to q. We propose an efficient algorithm for VRNN query processing, assuming that both P and O are indexed by R-trees. Our method does not require any pre-processing, and employs half-plane property and visibility check to prune the search space.

It aims to find two nonnegative matrices whose product can well approximate the nonnegative data matrix, which naturally lead to parts-based representation. In this paper, we present a local learning regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (LLNMF) for clustering. It imposes an additional constraint on NMF that the cluster label of each point can be predicted by the points in its neighborhood. This constraint encodes both the discriminative information and the geometric structure, and is good at clustering data on manifold. An iterative multiplicative updating algorithm is proposed to optimize the objective, and its convergence is guaranteed theoretically. Experiments on many benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms NMF as well as many state of the art clustering methods.

Abbreviated input is expanded into keywords by a Hidden Markov Model learned from a corpus of existing code. The technique does not require the user to memorize abbreviations and provides incremental feedback of the most likely completions. This paper presents the algorithm for abbreviation completion, integrated with a new user interface for multiple-keyword completion. We tested the system by sampling 3000 code lines from open source projects and found that more than 98% of the code lines could be resolved from acronym-like abbreviations. A user study found 30% reduction in time usage and 41% reduction of keystrokes over conventional code completion.

We present an algorithm which is able to learn regression trees from fast and unbounded data streams in the presence of concept drifts. To our best knowledge there is no other algorithm for incremental learning regression trees equipped with change detection abilities. The FIRT-DD algorithm has mechanisms for drift detection and model adaptation, which enable to maintain accurate and updated regression models at any time. The drift detection mechanism is based on sequential statistical tests that track the evolution of the local error, at each node of the tree, and inform the learning process for the detected changes. As a response to a local drift, the algorithm is able to adapt the model only locally, avoiding the necessity of a global model adaptation. The adaptation strategy consists of building a new tree whenever a change is suspected in the region and replacing the old ones when the new trees become more accurate. This enables smooth and granular adaptation of the global model. The results from the empirical evaluation performed over several different types of drift show that the algorithm has good capability of consistent detection and proper adaptation to concept drifts.

J	Jagnjic, Z; Bogunovic, N; Pizeta, I; Jovic, F				Jagnjic, Zeljko; Bogunovic, Nikola; Pizeta, Ivanka; Jovic, Franjo			Time series classification based on qualitative space fragmentation	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Time series classification; Discrete-space; Feature extraction; Qualitative domain	CHART PATTERN-RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; NETWORKS; WAVELETS; QUERIES	In knowledge discovery and data mining from time series the goal is to detect interesting patterns in the series that may help a human to better recognize the regularities in the observed variables and thereby improve the understanding of the system. Ideally, knowledge discovery algorithms use time series representations that are close to those that are used by a human. The impressive pattern recognition capabilities of the human brain help to establish connections between different time series or different parts of a single time series on the basis of their visual appearance. When dealing with time series data there are two main objectives: (i) prediction of future behavior based on past behaviors and (ii) description (explanation) of time series data. Description of time series data can be used for generalization, clustering and classification. In this paper, a novel time series classification method based on Qualitative Space Fragmentation is presented. The main characteristics of the presented method are expansion and coding of quantitative time series data together with extraction of symbolic and numeric features based on human visual perception. The expansion and coding process results in the creation of a qualitative difference vector. The qualitative difference vector conveys full information on the variation of the particular time series and can be seen as a single point in m-dimensional qualitative-space. Symbolic and numeric features based on human visual perception are extracted from the qualitative space and used for the decision tree construction that is later employed in time series classification. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated through two different case studies. in the first case study, the method was tested in the context of synthetic Control Chart Pattern data, which are time series developed for the assessment of the statistical process control. The obtained results were compared with the standard Qualitative Similarity Index method. In the second case study the method was tested in the field of analytic chemistry - polarography, an electrochemical method for analyzing solutions containing reducible or oxidizable substances.

We propose a clustering algorithm P-DBSCAN to cluster polygons in space. P-DBSCAN is based on the well established density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN. In order to cluster polygons, we incorporate their topological and spatial properties in the process of clustering by using a distance function customized for the polygon space. The objective of our clustering algorithm is to produce spatially compact clusters. We measure the compactness of the clusters produced using P-DBSCAN and compare it with the clusters formed using DBSCAN, using the Schwartzberg Index. We measure the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm using a synthetic dataset and two real datasets. Results show that the clusters produced using P-DBSCAN have a lower compactness index (hence more compact) than DBSCAN.

They have been implemented in business contexts (cf. Kacprzyk & Zadroiny, ????, Kacprzyk, Wilbik and Zadrozny, 2006-2008). An effective and efficient way of their generation was proposed by Kacprzyk & Zadroiny (????) by using an interactive procedure based on Kacprzyk & Zadrozny's (????) fuzz), database queries with linguistic quantifiers. Moreover, in Kacprzyk & Zadroiny (???) the role of Zadeh's (???) protoform was shown and their use advocated. Though linguistic database summaries have a strong resemblance to natural language generation (NLG), this issue was never considered. In this paper we indicate some important issues that are common to linguistic database summarization and natural language generation, and propose some possible research directions.

J	Kousha, K				Kousha, Kayvan			Characteristics of open access scholarly publishing A multidisciplinary study	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Research work; Free publications; Publishing; Generation and dissemination of information; Worldwide web	4 SCIENCE DISCIPLINES; CITATION ADVANTAGE; WEB CITATIONS; ARTICLES; IMPACT; AUTHORS	Purpose - More knowledge about open access (OA) scholarly publishing on the web would be helpful for citation data mining and the development of web-based citation indexes. Hence, the main purpose of this study is to identify common characteristics of open access publishing, which may therefore enable us to measure different aspects of e-research on the web. Design/methodology/approach - In the current study, five characteristics of 545 OA citing sources targeting OA research articles in four science and four social science disciplines were manually identified, including file format, hyperlinking, internet domain, language and publication year. Findings - About 60 per cent of the OA citing sources targeting research papers were in PDF format, 30 per cent were from academic domains ending in edu and ac and 70 per cent of the citations were not hyperlinked. Moreover, 16 per cent of the OA citing sources targeting studied papers in the eight selected disciplines were in non-English languages. Additional analyses revealed significant disciplinary differences in some studied characteristics across science and the social sciences. Originality/value - The OA web citation network was dominated by PDF format files and non-hyperlinked citations. This knowledge of characteristics shaping the OA citation network gives a better understanding about their potential uses for open access scholarly research.

We present a parallel implementation of EM for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of Gaussian mixture models, designed for many-core architecture of Graphics Processing Units (GPU). The algorithm is implemented on NVIDIA's GPUs using CUDA, following the single instruction multiple threads model. In this paper, the emphasis is laid on exploiting the data parallelism with CUDA, thus accelerating the computations. CUDA implementation of EM is designed in such a way that the speed of computation of the algorithm scales up with the number of GPU cores. Experimental results confirm the scalability across cores. The results also show that CUDA implementation of EM when applied to an input of 230K for a 32-order mixture of 32-dimensional Gaussian model takes 264 msec on Quadro FX 5800 (NVIDIA 200 series) with 240 cores to complete one iteration which is about 164 times faster when compared to a naive single threaded C implementation on CPU.			nskumar@nvidia.com; ssatoor@nvidia.com; ianbuck@nvidia.com					Dempster A.P., 1977, J ROYAL STAT SOC B, V39; JEFF A, GENTLE TUTORIAL EM A; McLachlan G., 1997, WILEY SERIES PROBABI; Rabiner L., 1993, FUNDAMENTALS SPEECH; Reynolds D.

In our definition, a person's experience can be expressed by five attributes: time, location, activity, opinion and emotion,. The system implementing our proposed method actually generates and ranks association rules between attributes by applying several interestingness meausures proposed in the area of data mining to the experiences extracted from 48 million blog entries. An experiment shows that the system successfully mines peoples' activities and emotions which are specific to location and time peroid.

Biclustering is a very useful data mining technique for discovering genes which have similar behavior. In microarray data, several objectives have to be optimized simultaneously and often these objectives are in conflict with each other. A multi objective model is very suitable for solving this problem. Our method proposes a Hybrid algorithm which is based on adaptive multi objective particle swarm optimization for discovering biclusters in gene expression data. In our method, we will consider a low level of overlapping among biclusters and as possible, will cover all elements of gene expression matrix. Experimental result in bench mark data base present a significant improvement in overlap among biclusters and coverage of elements in gene expression and quality of biclusters.

Although there are many studies for temporal data mining, they do not deal with discovering knowledge from temporal interval data such as patient histories, purchaser histories, and web logs etc. We propose a new temporal data mining technique that can extract temporal interval relation rules from temporal interval data by using Allen's theory: a preprocessing algorithm designed for the generalization of temporal interval data and a temporal relation algorithm for mining temporal relation rules from the generalized temporal interval data. This technique can provide more useful knowledge in comparison with conventional data mining techniques. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			Pattern discovery and change detection of online music query streams	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multimedia data mining; Music query streams; Melody structure mining; Change detection	MELODY	Mining of music data is one of the most important problems in multimedia data mining. In this paper, two research issues of mining music data, i.e., online mining of music query streams and change detection of music query streams, are discussed. First, we proposed an efficient online algorithm, FTP-stream (Frequent Temporal Pattern mining of streams), to mine all frequent melody structures over sliding windows of music melody sequence streams. An effective bit-sequence representation is used in the proposed algorithm to reduce the time and memory needed to slide the windows. An effective list structure is developed in the FTP-stream algorithm to overcome the performance bottleneck of 2-candidate generation. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm FTP-stream only needs a half of memory requirement of original melody sequence data, and just scans the music query stream once. After mining frequent melody structures, we developed a simple online algorithm, MQS-change (changes of Music Query Streams), to detect the changes of frequent melody structures in current user-centered music query streams. Two music melody structures (set of chord-sets and string of chord-sets) are maintained and four melody structure changes (positive burst, negative burst, increasing change and decreasing change) are monitored in a new summary data structure, MSC-list (a list of Music Structure Changes). Experiments show that the MQS-change algorithm is an effective online method to detect the changes of music melody structures over continuous music query streams.

As a result, many time series representations and distance measures have been proposed. However most existing work on time series similarity search focuses on finding shape-based similarity. While some of the existing approaches work well for short time series data, they typically fail to produce satisfactory results when the sequence is long. For long sequences, it is more appropriate to consider the similarity based on the higher-level structures. In this work, we present a histogram-based representation for time series data, similar to the "bag of words" approach that is widely accepted by the text mining and information retrieval communities. We show that our approach outperforms the existing methods in clustering, classification, and anomaly detection on several real datasets.

In supervised classification, several approaches were proposed such as: Induction of Decision Trees, and Formal Concept Analysis. The learning of formal concepts is based, generally, on the mathematical structure of Galois lattice (or concept lattice). The complexity of generation of Galois lattice, limits the application fields of these systems. In this paper, we present several methods of supervised classification based on Formal Concept Analysis. We present methods based on concept lattice or sub lattice. We also present the boosting of classifiers, an emerging technique of classification. Finally, we propose the boosting of formal concepts: a new adaptive approach to build only a part of the lattice including the best concepts. These concepts are used as classification rules. Experimental results are given to prove the interest of the proposed method.

During mammography screening, radiologists use a strict lexicon (BI-RADS) to describe and report their findings. Mammography records are then stored in a well-defined database format (NMD). Lately, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these databases. They successfully built breast cancer classifiers that can help in early detection of malignancy. However, the validity of these models depends on the quality of the underlying databases. Unfortunately, most databases suffer from inconsistencies, missing data, inter-observer variability and inappropriate term usage. In addition, many databases are not compliant with the NMD format and/or solely consist of text reports. BI-RADS feature extraction from free text and consistency checks between recorded predictive variables and text reports are crucial to addressing this problem. We describe a general scheme for concept information retrieval from free text given a lexicon, and present a BI-RADS features extraction algorithm for clinical data mining. It consists of a syntax analyzer, a concept finder and a negation detector. The syntax analyzer preprocesses the input into individual sentences. The concept finder uses a semantic grammar based on the BI-RADS lexicon and the experts' input. It parses sentences detecting BI-RADS concepts. Once a concept is located, a lexical scanner checks for negation. Our method can handle multiple latent concepts within the text, filtering out ultrasound concepts. On our dataset, our algorithm achieves 97.7% precision, 95.5% recall and an F(1)-score of 0.97. It outperforms manual feature extraction at the 5% statistical significance level.

Decisions made during the search process are usually driven by some fixed heuristic policies. Despite the outstanding progress in SAT solving in recent years, there is still an appealing lack of techniques for selecting policies appropriate for solving specific input formulae. In this paper we present; a methodology for instance-based selection of solver's policies that uses a data-mining classification technique. The methodology also relies on analysis of relationships between formulae, their families, and their suitable solving strategies. The evaluation results are very good, demonstrate practical usability of the methodology, and encourage further efforts in this direction.

It is based on a structural algorithm that takes advantage of the fuzzy set theory to represent the medical knowledge on which it relies. The method aims to generate information that could serve as a starting point for gaining a deeper insight into the Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome by means of data mining techniques. This has led to a sacrifice of sensitivity for specificity. We have validated our proposal over 37 hours of polysomnographic recordings. 88% of the hypoventilations present in the recordings were associated with the desaturations they caused, presenting a rate of false associations of 0.86%.

Data mining techniques are being used to extract valuable information that can help in detecting intrusions. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and Decision Table (DT) with Naive Bayes (NB) along with their ensemble approach. We also propose to use the Semi-Naive Bayesian approach (DTNB) that combines Naive Bayes with the induction of Decision Tables in order to enhance the performance of an intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is faster, reliable, and accurate with low false positive rates, which are the essential features of an efficient network intrusion detection system.

However, despite its long history of application, it is difficult to use in domain model search Procedures, has not been used to capture learning where multiple skills are needed to perform a single action, and has not been used to compute latencies of actions. On the other hand, existing models used for educational data mining (e.g. Learning Factors Analysis (LFA)[2]) and model search do not tend to allow the creation of a "model overlay" that traces predictions for individual students with individual skills so as to allow the adaptive instruction to automatically remediate performance. Because these limitations make the transition from model search to model application in adaptive instruction more difficult, this paper describes our work to modify an existing data mining model so that it can also be used to select practice adaptively. We compare this new adaptive data mining model (PFA, Performance Factors Analysis) with two versions of LFA and then compare PFA with standard KT.

Early detection of financial risks can help credit grantors to reduce risk and losses, establish appropriate policies for different credit products and increase revenue. As the size of financial databases increases, large-scale data mining techniques that can process and analyze massive amounts of electronic data in a timely manner become a key component of many financial risk detection strategies and continue to be a subject of active research. However, the knowledge gap between the results data mining methods can provide and actions can be taken based on them remains large in financial risk detection. The goal of this research is to bring the concept of chance discovery into financial risk detection to build the knowledge-rich data mining process and therefore increase the usefulness of data mining results in financial risk detection. Using six financial risk related datasets. this research illustrates that the combination of data mining techniques and chance discovery can provide knowledge-rich data mining results to decision makers; promote the awareness of previously unnoticed chances; and increase the actionability of data mining results.

In this paper, we propose a method to mine the whole set of frequent emerging graph patterns, given a, frequency threshold and an emergence threshold. Our results are achieved thanks to a, change of the description of the initial problem so that we are able to design a process combining efficient algorithmic and data mining methods. Experiments on a real-world database composed of chemicals show the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.

Targeting social-network neighbors resonates well with advertisers, and on-line browsing behavior data counterintuitively can allow the identification of good audiences anonymously. Besides being one of the first papers to our knowledge on data mining for on-line brand advertising, this paper makes several important contributions. We introduce a framework for evaluating brand audiences, in analogy to predictive-modeling holdout evaluation. We introduce methods for extracting quasi-social networks from data on visitations to social networking pages, without collecting any information on the identities of the browsers or the content of the social-network pages. We introduce measures of brand proximity in the network, and show that audiences with high brand proximity indeed show substantially higher brand affinity. Finally, we provide evidence that the quasi-social network embeds a true social network, which along with results from social theory offers one explanation for the increase in brand affinity of the selected audiences.

In this paper, we show how to estimate these conditional quantile functions within a Bayes risk minimization framework using a Gaussian process prior. The resulting non-parametric probabilistic model is easy to implement and allows non-crossing quantile functions to be enforced. Moreover, it can directly be used in combination with tools and extensions of standard Gaussian Processes such as principled hyperparameter estimation, sparsification, and quantile regression with input-dependent noise rates. No existing approach enjoys all of these desirable properties. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we try to develop a method for recognizing and transferring learned knowledge of activities between different residents. Our method is able to map activities despite intra-subject variability and inter-subject variability, by using a discontinuous mining method and a similarity measurement method. At the end, we will provide the results of our experiments on real data obtained from a smart apartment.

However existing visualizations are often complex or restricted to specific classifiers and attributes. In this work, we propose an intuitive visualization system to observe and understand classification processes and results. Our system can handle multiple classes, nominal and numeric attributes, and supports all. classifiers whose predictions can be interpreted as probabilities. We state that the possibility to observe the training process of a classifier boosts the understanding of classification results also for non-expert users. In combination with an intuitive visualization, we provide a system to generate in-depth understanding of classification processes and results. Our simulations revealed that the system could support the user to better understand a classifier's decision, and to gain in-sights into classification processes.

Although large hospitals have already introduced database systems for automated collection of patients' laboratory results and monitoring data, physicians and nurses are still confronted with time-consuming manual infection control. There is a lack of integrated computerized medical services that could aid physicians in making the most optimal decision in the antibiotic therapies and infection treatment for every patient. Today, current ICU platforms are not offering an infrastructure for infection surveillance, extended data mining and modeling of critical illness. Therefore, this paper describes the design of time- and data-driven software services to reduce improper use of antibiotics, prescriptions, inappropriate therapies and to offer an earlier and more accurate detection of infections and antibiotic resistance, contributing to increased efficiency of patient care.

In this paper, a fast incremental clustering algorithm is proposed by changing the radius threshold value dynamically. The algorithm restricts the number of the final clusters and reads the original dataset only once. At the same time an inter-cluster dissimilarity measure taking into account the frequency information of the attribute values is introduced. It can be used for the categorical data. The experimental results on the mushroom dataset show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective. It can be used for the large-scale data set.

Filtering techniques in particular have received much attention, but detailed comparisons of their performance is lacking. This work considers three filters using classifier performance metrics and six commonly-used filters. All nine filtering techniques are compared and contrasted using five different microarray expression datasets. In addition, given that these datasets exhibit an imbalance between the number of positive and negative examples, the utilization of sampling techniques in the context of feature selection is examined.

Real-world data analysis, data mining, classification and modeling problems usually involve a large number of candidate inputs or features. Less relevant or highly correlated features decrease, in general, the classification accuracy, and enlarge the complexity of the classifier. Feature selection is a multi-criteria optimization problem, with contradictory objectives, which are difficult to properly describe by conventional cost functions. The use of fuzzy decision making may improve the performance of this type of systems, since it allows an easier and transparent description of the different criteria used in the feature selection process. In previous work an ant colony optimization algorithm for feature selection was presented, which minimizes two objectives: number of features and classification error. Two pheromone matrices and two different heuristics are used for each objective. In this paper, a fuzzy objective function is proposed to cope with the difficulty of weighting the different criteria involved in the optimization algorithm.	[Vieira, Susana M.; Sousa, Joao M.

One of motif models, represented by a position frequency matrix (PFM), has been widely employed to search for putative motifs. Detection and discovery of motifs can be done by comparing kmers with a motif model, or clustering kmers according to some criteria. In the past, information content based similarity scores have been widely used in searching tools. In this paper, we present a mismatch-based matrix similarity score (namely, MISCORE) for motif searching and discovering purpose. The proposed MISCORE can be biologically interpreted as an evolutionary metric for predicting a kmer as a motif member or not. Weighting factors, which are meaningful for biological data mining practice, are introduced in the MISCORE. The effectiveness of the MISCORE is investigated through exploring its separability, recognizability and robustness. Three well-known information content-based matrix similarity scores are compared, and results show that our MISCORE works well.

Our target is the InhA enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis bound to NADH, TCL, PIF and ETH ligands. After testing some mining strategies on these data, we conclude that, to obtain better outcomes, the development of an organized repository is especially useful. Thus, we built a comprehensive and robust database called FReDD to store the InhA-ligand docking results. Using this database we concentrate efforts on data mining to explore the docking results in order to accelerate the identification of promising ligands against the InhA target.

Different from existing solutions, we use a two stage detection system. The first stage uses frequent pattern mining and distribution estimation techniques to capture the dominant patterns (both frequent sequences and time duration). The second stage use principal component analysis based anomaly detection technique to identify actual problems. Using real system data from a 203-node Hadoop [1] cluster, we show that we can not only achieve highly accurate and fast problem detection, but also help operators better understand execution patterns in their system.

Many approaches have been proposed for mining frequent pattern. However, either the search space or memory space is huge, such that the performance for the previous approach degrades when the database is massive or the threshold for mining frequent Patterns is low. In order to decrease the usage of memory space and speed up the mining process, we study some methods for mining frequent patterns based on frequent pattern tree. The concept of our approach is to only construct a FP-tree and traverse a subtree of the FP-tree to generate all the frequent patterns for an item without constructing any other subtrees. After traversing a subtree for an item, our approach merges and removes the subtree to reduce the FP-tree smaller and smaller. We propose four methods based on this concept and compare the four methods with the famous algorithm FP-Growth which also construct a FP-tree and recursively mines frequent patterns by building conditional FP-tree.

J	Yun, U				Yun, Unil			On pushing weight constraints deeply into frequent itemset mining	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; weighted frequent pattern mining; weighted support; minimum weight		There have been many studies on mining frequent itemset (or pattern) in the data mining field because of its broad applications in mining association rules, correlations, graph patterns, constraint based frequent patterns, sequential patterns, and many other data mining tasks. One of major challenges in frequent pattern mining is a huge number of result patterns. As the minimum threshold becomes lower, an exponentially large number of itemsets are generated. Therefore, pruning unimportant patterns effectively in mining process is one of main topics in frequent pattern mining. In weighted frequent pattern mining, not only support but also weight are used and important patterns can be detected. In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms for mining weighted frequent itemsets in which the main approaches are to push weight constraints into the Apriori algorithm and the pattern growth algorithm respectively. Additionally, we show how to maintain the downward closure property in mining weighted frequent itemsets. In our approach, the normalized weights within the weight range are used according to the importance of items. A weight range is used to restrict weights of items and a minimum weight is utilized to balance between weight and support of items for pruning the search space. Our approach generates fewer but important weighted frequent itemsets in large databases, particularly dense databases with low minimum supports. An extensive performance study shows that our algorithm outperforms previous mining algorithms. In addition, it is efficient and scalable.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting spatial regions that are highly discriminative among different classes of three dimensional (3D) image data. The main idea of our approach is to treat the initial 3D image as a hyper-rectangle and search for discriminative regions by adaptively partitioning the space into progressively smaller hyper-rectangles (sub-regions). We use statistical information about each hyper-rectangle to guide the selectivity of the partitioning. A hyper-rectangle is partitioned only if its attribute cannot adequately discriminate among the distinct labeled classes, and it is sufficiently large for further splitting. To evaluate the discriminative power of the attributes corresponding to the detected regions, we performed classification experiments on artificial and real datasets. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms major competitors, achieving 30% and 15% better classification accuracy on synthetic and real data respectively while reducing by two orders of magnitude the number of statistical tests required by voxel-based approaches.

J	Ohta, S; Kurebayashi, R; Kobayashi, K				Ohta, Satoru; Kurebayashi, Ryosuke; Kobayashi, Kiyoshi			Minimizing False Positives of a Decision Tree Classifier for Intrusion Detection on the Internet	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet; Intrusion detection; Data mining; Machine learning; Decision tree	DESIGN	Machine learning or data mining technologies are often used in network intrusion detection systems. An intrusion detection system based on machine learning utilizes a classifier to infer the current state from the observed traffic attributes. The problem with learning-based intrusion detection is that it leads to false positives and so incurs unnecessary additional operation costs. This paper investigates a method to decrease the false positives generated by an intrusion detection system that employs a decision tree as its classifier. The paper first points out that the information-gain criterion used in previous studies to select the attributes in the tree-constructing algorithm is not effective in achieving low false positive rates. Instead of the information-gain criterion, this paper proposes a new function that evaluates the goodness of an attribute by considering the significance of error types. The proposed function can successfully choose an attribute that suppresses false positives from the given attribute set and the effectiveness of using it is confirmed experimentally. This paper also examines the more trivial leaf rewriting approach to benchmark the proposed method. The comparison shows that the proposed attribute evaluation function yields better solutions than the leaf rewriting approach.

Evolving model trees for mining data sets with continuous-valued classes	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; continuous-valued classes; genetic programming; model trees	NEURAL NETWORKS	This paper presents a genetic programming (GP) approach to extract symbolic rules from data sets with continuous-valued classes, called GPMCC. The GPMCC makes use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve multi-variate non-linear models [Potgieter, G., & Engelbrecht, A. (2007). Genetic algorithms for the structural optimisation of learned polynomial expressions. Applied Mathematics and Computation] at the terminal nodes of the GP. Several mechanisms have been developed to optimise the GP, including a fragment pool of candidate non-linear models, k-means clustering of the training data to facilitate the use of stratified sampling methods, and specialized mutation and crossover operators to evolve structurally optimal and accurate models. It is shown that the GPMCC is insensitive to control parameter values. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the GPMCC is comparable to that of NeuroLinear and Cubist, while producing significantly less rules with less complex antecedents.

J	Tadiparthi, GR; Sueyoshi, T				Tadiparthi, Gopalakrishna Reddy; Sueyoshi, Toshiyuki			A novel steganographic algorithm using animations as cover	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information Hiding; Steganographic model; Encoding; Decoding; Animation	INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; SECURITY; INTRANET; SCHEME; MODEL	Information security is gaining widespread importance in distributed decision support systems [T.S. Raghu, and H. Chen, Cyberinfrastructure for homeland security: Advances in information sharing, data mining, and collaboration systems. Decision Support Systems 43 (2007) 1321-1323]. Conventional steganographic models available in the literature on information hiding use the knowledge of cover-object and stego-object to extract embedded data. Embedding algorithms have been predominantly used in steganography for hiding data whereas encoding algorithms have been used for data compression. This research study proposes a modified model for steganographic system that incorporates encoding algorithms based upon the information theoretic model documented in Cachin [C. Cachin, An Information-Theoretic Model for Steganography, information and Computation 192 (1) (2004) 41-56.]. The differences between the conventional model and the proposed model are analyzed in this study. We further implement the proposed model by designing a novel steganographic algorithm that utilizes animations as cover-objects. The proposed approach is then compared with an encoding algorithm for gif animations and a modified embedding algorithm with animations as the cover. Gifshuffle is a steganographic software that hides data in gif animations. Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit (DIIT) is a software that uses embedding algorithm to conceal data into images. DIIT is remodeled to hide data within animated images in this study. Experiments reveal that the encoding algorithms are suitable for information hiding using animations. The study finds that the proposed encoding framework with animations provides a practical framework for analysis and has a better security performance than Gifshuffle and DIIT. Although the proposed model achieves more hiding rate, Gifshuffle is computationally faster than other techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The temporal regularity of a pattern can be another key criterion for assessing the importance of a pattern in several applications. A pattern can be said regular if it appears at a regular user-defined interval in the database. Even though there have been some efforts to discover periodic patterns in time-series and sequential data, none of the existing studies have provided an appropriate method for discovering the patterns that occur regularly in a transactional database. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel concept of mining regular patterns from transactional databases. We also devise an efficient tree-based data structure, called a Regular Pattern tree (RP-tree in short), that captures the database contents in a highly compact manner and enables a pattern growth-based mining technique to generate the complete set of regular patterns in a database for a user-defined regularity threshold. Our performance study shows that mining regular patterns with an RP-tree is time and memory efficient, as well as highly scalable.

Mixed-drove spatiotemporal co-occurrence pattern mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						spatiotemporal data mining; spatiotemporal co-occurrence pattern mining; composite interest measure; mixed-drove spatiotemporal co-occurrence pattern		Mixed-drove spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns (MDCOPs) represent subsets of two or more different object-types whose instances are often located in spatial and temporal proximity. Discovering MDCOPs is an important problem with many applications such as identifying tactics in battlefields and games and tracking predator-prey interactions. However, mining MDCOPs is computationally very expensive because the interest measures are computationally complex, data sets are larger due to the archival history, and the set of candidate patterns is exponential in the number of object-types. We propose a monotonic composite interest measure for discovering MDCOPs and novel MDCOP mining algorithms. Analytical results show that the proposed algorithms are correct and complete. Experimental results also show that the proposed methods are computationally more efficient than naive alternatives.

J	Lee, CHL; Liu, A				Lee, Chiung-Hon Leon; Liu, Alan			Applying Fuzzy Candlestick Pattern Ontology to Investment Knowledge Management	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fuzzy candlestick pattern; data mining; ontology; financial time series	PREDICTION	A fuzzy candlestick pattern based ontology is proposed for assisting candlestick pattern representation, storage, and reuse. Japanese candlestick theory is a widely used technical analysis method for stock and commodity investment decision making. The theory assumes that candlestick patterns reflect the psychology of market, and investors make investment decision by observing the pattern in the Candlestick chart. A candlestick pattern is composed of candlestick lines. We model the different part of a candlestick line with fuzzy linguistic variables and transfer the financial time series data to fuzzy candlestick lines. The user can use data mining algorithm such as decision tree to mine some candlestick patterns for investment decision making and the mined candlestick patterns could be stored in a database for different user's future reuse. Based on the, proposed approach, we implement a system prototype to get experimental results. Our approach can be future used with other financial time series prediction results to provide users more information for investment decision making.

This method, using closed set properties of formal concept analysis, has been previously described and tested on rather large sets of deterministic data. Inspite of the fact that formal concept techniques have been used to prune frequent set data mining results, frequency and/or statistical significance are totally irrelevant to this method. It is strictly logical and deterministic. The contribution of this paper is a completely new extension of this method to create implications involving numeric inequalities. That is, numerical in equalities such as "age > 39" can be treated as logical predicates that have been extracted from the data itself and not postulated apriori.

J	Kianmehr, K; Alhajj, R				Kianmehr, Keivan; Alhajj, Reda			CARSVM: A class association rule-based classification framework and its application to gene expression data	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning; Association rule mining; Associative classifiers; Support vector machine; Data mining; Gene expression analysis; Gene expression classification; Gene selection	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMERGING PATTERNS; CANCER; PREDICTION; SELECTION	Objective: In this study, we aim at building a classification framework, namely the CARSVM model, which integrates association rule mining and support vector machine (SVM). The goal is to benefit from advantages of both, the discriminative knowledge represented by class association rules and the classification power of the SVM algorithm, to construct an efficient and accurate classifier model that improves the interpretability problem of SVM as a traditional machine learning technique and overcomes the efficiency issues of associative classification algorithms. Method: In our proposed framework: instead of using the original training set, a set of rule-based feature vectors, which are generated based on the discriminative ability of class association rules over the training samples, are presented to the learning component of the SVM algorithm. We show that rule-based feature vectors present a high-qualified source of discrimination knowledge that can impact substantially the prediction power of SVM and associative classification techniques. They provide users with more conveniences in terms of understandability and interpretability as well. Results: We have used four datasets from LICI ML repository to evaluate the performance of the developed system in comparison with five well-known existing classification methods. Because of the importance and popularity of gene expression analysis as real world application of the classification model, we present an extension of CARSVM combined with feature selection to be applied to gene expression data. Then, we describe how this combination wilt provide biologists with an efficient and understandable classifier model. The reported test results and their biological interpretation demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion: From the results, it can be concluded that a considerable increase in classification accuracy can be obtained when the rule-based feature vectors are integrated in the learning process of the SVM algorithm. In the context of applicability according to the results obtained from gene expression analysis, we can conclude that the CARSVM system can be utilized in a variety of real world applications with some adjustments.

While existing methods are efficient for the mining of frequent path traversal patterns from the access information contained in a log file, these approaches are likely to over evaluate associations. Explicitly, most previous studies of mining path traversal patterns are based on the model of a uniform support threshold, where a single support threshold is used to determine frequent traversal patterns without taking into consideration such important factors as the length of a pattern, the positions of Web pages, and the importance of a particular pattern, etc. As a result, a low support threshold will lead to lots of uninteresting patterns derived whereas a high support threshold may cause some interesting patterns with lower supports to be ignored. In view of this, this paper broadens the horizon of frequent path traversal pattern mining by introducing a flexible model of mining Web traversal patterns with dynamic thresholds. Specifically, we study and apply the Markov chain model to provide the determination of support threshold of Web documents; and further, by properly employing some effective techniques devised for joining reference sequences, the proposed algorithm dynamic threshold miner (DTM) not only possesses the capability of mining with dynamic thresholds, but also significantly improves the execution efficiency as well as contributes to the incremental mining of Web traversal patterns. Performance of algorithm DTM and the extension of existing methods is comparatively analyzed with synthetic and real Web logs. It is shown that the option of algorithm DTM is very advantageous in reducing the number of unnecessary rules produced and leads to prominent performance improvement.

Many real-life sequences have a strong segmental structure, with segments of different complexities. In this paper we study the description of sequence segments using variable length Markov chains (VLMCs), also known as tree models. We discover the segment boundaries of a sequence and at the same time we compute a VLMC for each segment. We use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and a variant of the minimum description length (MDL) principle that uses the Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) code length to select the number of segments of a sequence. On DNA data the method selects segments that closely correspond to the annotated regions of the genes.

J	Kumar, D; Ramakrishnan, N; Helm, RF; Potts, M				Kumar, Deept; Ramakrishnan, Naren; Helm, Richard F.; Potts, Malcolm			Algorithms for storytelling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; mining methods and algorithms; retrieval models; graph and tree search strategies	SIMILARITY SEARCH; TREE	We formulate a new data mining problem called storytelling as a generalization of redescription mining. In traditional redescription mining, we are given a set of objects and a collection of subsets defined over these objects. The goal is to view the set system as a vocabulary and identify two expressions in this vocabulary that induce the same set of objects. Storytelling, on the other hand, aims to explicitly relate object sets that are disjoint (and, hence, maximally dissimilar) by finding a chain of (approximate) redescriptions between the sets. This problem finds applications in bioinformatics, for instance, where the biologist is trying to relate a set of genes expressed in one experiment to another set, implicated in a different pathway. We outline an efficient storytelling implementation that embeds the CARTwheels redescription mining algorithm in an A* search procedure, using the former to supply next move operators on search branches to the latter. This approach is practical and effective for mining large data sets and, at the same time, exploits the structure of partitions imposed by the given vocabulary. Three application case studies are presented: a study of word overlaps in large English dictionaries, exploring connections between gene sets in a bioinformatics data set, and relating publications in the PubMed index of abstracts.

Though the search space for spatiotemporal knowledge is extremely challenging, imposing spatial and timing constraints on moving sequences makes the computation feasible. The proposed technique includes two algorithms, ARMOP and MaxMOP, to find all frequent patterns and maximal patterns, respectively. In addition, to support the service provider in sending information to a user in a push-driven manner, we propose a rule-based location prediction technique to predict the future location of the user. The idea is to employ the algorithm ARMOP to discover the frequent movement patterns in the user's historical movements, from which frequent movement rules are generated. These rules are then used to estimate the future location of the user. The performance is assessed with respect to precision and recall. The proposed techniques could be quite efficiently applied in a location-based service (LBS) system in which diverse types of data are integrated to support a variety of LBSs.

To this end, the patient rule induction method (PRIM), widely used in various application areas, could be adopted. However, the PRIM may fail to provide successful solutions when some process variables are in discrete types. Thus, we propose a new PRIM-like method specially to deal with ordinal discrete variables. For an illustrative purpose, the proposed method is applied to a real steel-making process. Also, performance of the proposed method is compared with the original PRIM through an extensive simulation using artificial data sets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kianrnehr, K; Alhajj, R				Kianrnehr, Keivan; Alhajj, Reda			Effectiveness of support vector machine for crime hot-spots prediction	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SPATIAL DATA-ANALYSIS; GENERATION; MODEL	Crime hot-spot location prediction is important for public safety. The output from the predict tion can provide useful information to improve the activities aimed at detecting and preventing safely and security problems. Location prediction is a special case of spatial data mining classification. Tor instance, in the public safety domain, it may be interesting to predict location(s) of crime hot spots. In, this study, we present a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach to predict the location as an alternative to existing modeling approaches. Support vector machine forms the new generation of machine-learning techniques used to find optimal separability between classes within datasets. We compare the performance of two types of SVMs techniques: two-class SVMs and one-class SVMs. We also compared SVM with a neural network-based approach and spatial auto-regression-based approach. Experiments on two different spatial datasets demonstrate that the former approach performs slightly better and the latter one gives reasonable results. Furthermore, in this study, toe provide a general framework to customize the spatial data classification task for other spatial domains that have datasets similar to the analyzed crime datasets.

Histograms based on the minimum description length principle	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						query processing; approximate query answering; data summarization; histograms		Histograms have been widely used for selectivity estimation in query optimization, as well as for fast approximate query answering in many OLAP, data mining, and data visualization applications. This paper presents a new family of histograms, the Hierarchical Model Fitting (HMF) histograms, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Rather than having each bucket of a histogram described by the same type of model, the HMF histograms employ a local optimal model for each bucket. The improved effectiveness of the locally chosen models offsets more than the overhead of keeping track of the representation of each individual bucket. Through a set of experiments, we show that the HMF histograms are capable of providing more accurate approximations than previously proposed techniques for many real and synthetic data sets across a variety of query workloads.

An interesting solution consists then in applying an appropriate closure operator that structures frequent itemsets into equivalence classes, such that two itemsets belong to the same class if they appear in the same sets of objects. Among equivalent itemsets, minimal elements (w.r.t. the number of items) are called minimal generators (MGs), while their associated closure is called closed itemset (CI), and is the largest one within the corresponding equivalence class. Thus, the pairs-composed by MGs and their associated CIs - make easier localizing each itemset since it is necessarily encompassed by an MG and an CI. In addition, they offer informative implication/association rules, with minimal premises and maximal conclusions, which losslessly represent the entire rule set. These important concepts - MG and CI - were hence at the origin of various works. Nevertheless, the inherent absence of a unique MG associated to a given CI leads to an intra-class combinatorial redundancy that leads an exhaustive storage and impractical use. This motivated an in-depth study towards a lossless reduction of this redundancy. This study was started by Dong et al. who introduced the succinct system of minimal generators (SSMG) as an attempt to eliminate the redundancy within this set. In this paper, we give a thorough study of the SSMG as formerly defined by Dong et al. This system will be shown to suffer from some flaws. As a remedy, we introduce a new lossless reduction of the MG set allowing to overcome its limitations. The new SSMG will then be incorporated into the framework of generic bases of association rules. This makes it possible to only maintain succinct and informative rules. After that, we give a thorough formal study of the related inference mechanisms allowing to derive all redundant association rules, starting from the maintained ones. Finally, an experimental evaluation shows the utility of our approach towards eliminating important rate of redundant information.

Like most data mining algorithms, existing privacy-preserving data mining algorithms assume data is complete. In order to maintain privacy in the data mining process while cleaning data, privacy-preserving methods of data cleaning are required. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preserving data imputation of missing data. We present a privacy-preserving protocol for filling in missing values using a lazy decision-tree imputation algorithm for data that is horizontally partitioned between two parties. The participants of the protocol learn only the imputed values. The computed decision tree is not learned by either party. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liao, SH; Chen, CM; Wu, CH				Liao, Shu-Hsien; Chen, Chyuan-Meei; Wu, Chung-Hsin			Mining customer knowledge for product line and brand extension in retailing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						retailing; product line extension; brand extension; data mining; association rules; cluster analysis; knowledge extraction	MODEL; SYSTEM; RULES; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGIES; COMMONALITY; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; TIME	Retailing consists of the final activities and steps needed to place a product in the hands of the consumer or to provide services to the consumer. In fact, retailing is actually the last step in a supply chain that may stretch from Europe or Asia to the customer's hometown. Therefore, any firm that sells a product or provides a service to the final consumer is performing the retailing function. On the other hand, product line extension, which adds depth to an existing product line by introducing new products in the same product category, can give customers greater choice and help to protect the firm from flanking attack by a competitor. In addition, a product line extension is marketed under the same general brand as a previous item or items. Thus, to distinguish the brand extension from the other item(s) under the primary brand, the retailer can either add secondary brand identification or add a generic brand. This paper investigates product line and brand extension issues in the Taiwan branch of a leading international retailing company, Carrefour, which is a hypermarket retailer. This paper develops a relational database and proposes Apriori algorithm and K-means as methodologies for association rule and cluster analysis for data mining, which is then implemented to mine customer knowledge from household customers.

Inferring gene regulatory networks from expression data by discovering fuzzy dependency relationships	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						bioinformatics; data mining; fuzzy logic; gene regulatory networks (GRNs)	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; DNA MICROARRAY; PATTERNS; LOGIC; CLASSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PREDICTION; SELECTION	For one to infer the structures of a gene regulatory network (GRN), it is important to identify, for each gene in the GRN, which other genes can affect its expression and how they can affect it. For this purpose, many algorithms have been developed to generate hypotheses about the presence or absence of interactions between genes. These algorithms, however, cannot be used to determine if a gene activates or inhibits another. To obtain such information to better infer GRN structures, we propose a fuzzy data mining technique here. By transforming quantitative expression values into linguistic terms, it defines a measure of fuzzy dependency among genes. Using such a measure, the technique is able to discover interesting fuzzy dependency relationships in noisy, high dimensional time series expression data so that it can not only determine if a gene is dependent on another but also if a gene is supposed to be activated or inhibited. In addition, the technique can also predict how a gene in an unseen sample (i.e., expression data that are not in the original database) would be affected by other genes in it and this makes statistical verification of the reliability of the discovered gene interactions easier. For evaluation, the proposed technique has been tested using real expression data and experimental results show that the use of fuzzy-logic based technique in gene expression data analysis can be quite effective.

J	Calders, T				Calders, Toon			Itemset frequency satisfiability: Complexity and axiomatization	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; frequent itemset; complexity	PROBABILISTIC LOGIC; DEDUCTION	Computing frequent itemsets is one of the most prominent problems in data mining. We study the following related problem, called FREQSAT, in depth: given some itemset-interval pairs, does there exist a database such that for every pair the frequency of the itemset falls into the interval? This problem is shown to be NP-complete. The problem is then further extended to include arbitrary Boolean expressions over items and conditional frequency expressions in the form of association rules. We also show that, unless P equals NP, the related function problem - find the best interval for an itemset under some frequency constraints cannot be approximated efficiently. Furthermore, it is shown that FREQSAT is recursively axiomatizable, but that there cannot exist an axiomatization of finite arity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we address the task of scaling up k-medoid-based algorithms through the utilization of metric access methods, allowing clustering algorithms to be executed by database management systems in a fraction of the time usually required by the traditional approaches. We also present an optimization strategy that can be applied as an additional step of the proposed algorithm in order to achieve better clustering solutions. Experimental results based on several datasets, including synthetic and real ones, show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of distance calculations by a factor of more than three thousand times when compared to existing algorithms, while producing clusters of equivalent quality.

CF can often be formulated as identifying patterns in a large and mostly empty rating matrix. In this paper, we focus on predicting unobserved ratings. This task is often a part of a recommendation procedure. We propose a new CIF approach called interlaced generalized linear models (GLM); it is based on a factorization of the rating matrix and uses probabilistic modeling to represent uncertainty in the ratings. The advantage of this approach is that different configurations, encoding different intuitions about the rating process can easily be tested while keeping the same learning procedure. The GLM formulation is the keystone to derive an efficient learning procedure, applicable to large datasets. We illustrate the technique on three public domain datasets. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Maintaining bounded-size sample synopses of evolving datasets	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	32nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases	SEP 12-15, 2006	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA			database sampling; reservoir sampling; sample maintenance; synopsis		Perhaps the most flexible synopsis of a database is a uniform random sample of the data; such samples are widely used to speed up processing of analytic queries and data-mining tasks, enhance query optimization, and facilitate information integration. The ability to bound the maximum size of a sample can be very convenient from a system-design point of view, because the task of memory management is simplified, especially when many samples are maintained simultaneously. In this paper, we study methods for incrementally maintaining a bounded-size uniform random sample of the items in a dataset in the presence of an arbitrary sequence of insertions and deletions. For "stable" datasets whose size remains roughly constant over time, we provide a novel sampling scheme, called "random pairing" (RP), that maintains a bounded-size uniform sample by using newly inserted data items to compensate for previous deletions. The RP algorithm is the first extension of the 45-year-old reservoir sampling algorithm to handle deletions; RP reduces to the "passive" algorithm of Babcock et al. when the insertions and deletions correspond to a moving window over a data stream. Experiments show that, when dataset-size fluctuations over time are not too extreme, RP is the algorithm of choice with respect to speed and sample-size stability. For "growing" datasets, we consider algorithms for periodically resizing a bounded-size random sample upwards. We prove that any such algorithm cannot avoid accessing the base data, and provide a novel resizing algorithm that minimizes the time needed to increase the sample size. We also show how to merge uniform samples from disjoint datasets to obtain a uniform sample of the union of the datasets; the merged sample can be incrementally maintained. Our new RPMerge algorithm extends the HRMerge algorithm of Brown and Haas to effectively deal with deletions, thereby facilitating efficient parallel sampling.

J	Akcan, H; Astashyn, A; Bronnimann, H				Akcan, Huseyin; Astashyn, Alex; Bronnimann, Herve			Deterministic algorithms for sampling count data	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						sampling; data reduction; data streams; data mining		Processing and extracting meaningful knowledge from count data is an important problem in data mining. The volume of data is increasing dramatically as the data is generated by day-to-day activities such as market basket data, web click-stream data or network data. Most mining and analysis algorithms require multiple passes over the data, which requires extreme amounts of time. One solution to save time would be to use samples, since sampling is a good surrogate for the data and the same sample can be used to answer many kinds of queries. In this paper, we propose two deterministic sampling algorithms, Biased-L2 and DRS. Both produce samples vastly superior to the previous deterministic and random algorithms, both in sample quality and accuracy. Our algorithms also improve on the run-time and memory footprint of the existing deterministic algorithms. The new algorithms can be used to sample from a relational database as well as data streams, with the ability to examine each transaction only once, and maintain the sample on-the-fly in a streaming fashion. We further show how to engineer one of our algorithms (DRS) to adapt and recover from changes to the underlying data distribution, or sample size. We evaluate our algorithms on three different synthetic datasets, as well as on realworld clickstream data, and demonstrate the improvements over previous art. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The decentralized unstructured P2P model with certain overheads, i.e., peer clustering and update procedures, is adopted to compromise with the structured one while still reserving flexible routing control when peers join/leave or network fails. The peer CBIRM engine is designed to utilize multi-instance query with multi-feature types to effectively reduce network traffic while maintaining high retrieval accuracy. It helps to enhance the knowledge discovery and image data mining capability. The proposed P2P-CBIRM system provides the scalable retrieval and mining function that the query scope and retrieval accuracy can be adaptively and progressively controlled. To improve the query efficiency (recall-rate/query-scope), it effectively utilizes both: 1) forwarding query message (forward phase) to reduce the query scope and 2) transmitting retrieval results (backward phase) such that activated peers keep filtering high similarity images on the link-path toward the query peer. Experiments show that the query efficiency of the scalable retrieval approach is better than previous methods, i.e., firework query model and breadth-first search. It provides a scalable knowledge discovery platform for efficient image data mining applications. We also proposed to optimally configure the P2P-CBIRM system such that, under a certain number of online users, it would yield the highest recall rate. Simulations demonstrate that, with the optimal configuration, recall rates can be improved to 2.5 to 3 times larger while the network traffic of each peer is reduced to 30% of the original, under the same number of on-line users.

J	Yang, XC; Ng, YK				Yang, Xiaochun; Ng, Yiu-Kai			Answering form-based web queries using the data-mining approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						inferred rules; query interface; query-rewriting approach		Web users often post queries through form-based interfaces on the Web to retrieve data from the Web; however, answers to these queries are mostly computed according to keywords entered into different fields specified in a query interface, and their precision and recall could be low. The precision and recall ratios in answering this type of query can be improved by considering closely related previous queries submitted through the same interface, along with their answers. In this paper, we present an approach for enhancing the retrieval of relevant answers to a form-based Web query by adopting the data-mining approach using previous, relevant queries and their answers. Experimental results on a randomly selected set of 3,800 documents retrieved from various Web sites show that our data-mining, query-rewriting approach achieves average precision and true positive ratios on rewritten queries in the upper 80% range, whereas the average false positive ratio is less than 2.0%.

The aim of this study is to cluster samples in the object mode of a three-way array, which is done using the scores (sample loadings) of a three-way factor model, for example, a Tucker3 or a PARAFAC model. Further, tools are developed to explore and identify reasons for particular clusters by visually mining the data using the clustering results as guidance. We introduce a three-way clustering tool and demonstrate our results on a metabolite profiling dataset. We explore how high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of commercial extracts, of St. John's wort (natural remedies for the treatment of mild to moderate depression) differ and which chemical compounds account for those differences. Using common distance measures, for example, Euclidean or Mahalanobis, on the scores of a three-way model, we verify that we can capture the underlying clustering structure in the data. Beside this, by making use of the visualization approach, we are able to identify the variables playing a significant role in the extracted cluster structure. The suggested approach generalizes straightforwardly to higher-order data and also to two-way data. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper presents a generic stock pricing prediction model based on a rough set approach. To increase the efficiency of the prediction process, rough sets with Boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is used to discretize the data. The rough set reduction technique is applied to find all the reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for prediction. Finally, rough sets dependency rules are generated directly from all generated reducts. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. Using a data set consisting of the daily movements of a stock traded in Kuwait Stock Exchange, a preliminary assessment indicates that rough sets are shown to be applicable and is an effective tool to achieve this goal. For comparison, the results obtained using the rough set approach were compared to that of the neural networks algorithm and it was shown that the Rough set approach has a higher overall accuracy rate and generates more compact and fewer rules than the neural networks.

Up to this moment, these strategies focus on either detection or response features, but often lack of having both features together. Without considering those features together, intrusion detection systems probably will not be able to highly detect on low false alarm rates. To offset the abovementioned constraints, this paper proposes a strategy to focus on detection involving statistical analysis of both attack and normal traffics based on the training data of KDD Cup 99. This strategy also includes a hybrid statistical approach which uses Data Mining and Decision Tree Classification. As a result, the statistical analysis can be manipulated to reduce misclassification of false positives and distinguish between attacks and false positives for the data of KDD Cup 99. Therefore, this strategy can be used to evaluate and enhance the capability of the IDS to detect and at the same time to respond to the threats and benign traffic in critical segments of network, application and database infrastructures.

Such graphs play a prominent role in graph drawing. They express strict dependencies and occur in many areas, e.g., in scheduling problems and program inheritance structures. In this paper we extend level graphs to cyclic level graphs. Such graphs occur as repeating processes in cyclic scheduling, visual data mining, life sciences, and VLSI. We provide a complete study of strongly connected cyclic level graphs. In particular, we present a linear time algorithm for the planarity testing and embedding problem, and we characterize forbidden subgraphs. Our results generalize earlier work on level graphs.

Here, we approach VQ from a different perspective: We use the histogram of the codeword usage as a feature vector representing the initial image. As ductal tree topology has predictive value for a variety of diseases, such as papilloma, ductal ectasia, and ductal carcinoma. We chose to apply this technique to compare texture of the breast ductal tree in x-ray galactograms against the same tissue in corresponding unenhanced mammograms, which do not visualize the ductal tree. We also investigate the relationship between texture and the underlying ductal branching topology using descriptors adapted from the data mining literature. We believe that our method has the potential to assist the interpretation of clinical images and deepen our understanding of relationships among struture, texture, function, and pathology.

The machine perception lab at UC San Diego has developed a system based on machine learning for fully automated detection of 30 actions from the facial action coding system (FACS). The system, called Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), operates in real-time and is robust to the video conditions in real applications. This paper describes two experiments which are the first applications of this system to analyzing spontaneous human behavior: Automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. The analysis revealcd information about facial behavior during these conditions that were previously unknown, including the coupling of movements. Automated classifiers were able to differentiate real from fake pain significantly better than na:fve human subjects, and to detect critical drowsiness above 98% accuracy.

The main purpose is to determine a set of composite DRs which are a combination of conventional DRs (i.e., FIFO, SPT). In or-der to achieve this, full factorial experiments are carried out to determine the effect of input parameters on predetermined performance measures. Afterwards, the data set which is obtained from the full factorial simulation analyses is feed into the TACO-miner in order to determine composite DRs. The preliminary verification study has shown that composite DRs have an acceptable performance.

We are using data mining models built on the basis of historic measurements of network performance gathered using WING system. These measurements reflect Web performance as experienced by the end-users located in Wroclaw, Poland. Data mining models are created using the algorithms available in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and IBM Intelligent Miner tools. Our results show that our data mining based TCP throughput prediction returns accurate results. The application of our method in building of so-called "best performance hit" operation mode of the search engines is proposed.

Consequently, the use of graph based representation for data mining has become a promising approach to extracting novel and useful knowledge from relational data. In order to check whether a certain graph occurs, as a. substructure, within a larger database graph, the widely studied concept of subgraph isomorphism can be used. However, this conventional approach is rather limited. In the present paper the concept of subgraph isomorphism is substantially extended such that it can cope with don't care symbols, variables, and constraints. Our novel approach leads to a powerful graph matching methodology which can be used for advanced graph based data mining.

From data analysis perspective, we view it valuable for smart trading in designing legal and profitable trading strategies and smart regulation in maintaining market integrity, transparency and fairness. The existing trading pattern analysis only focuses oninterday data which discloses explicit and high-level market dynamics. In the mean time, the existing market surveillance systems available from large exchanges are facing crucial challenges of diversified, dynamic, distributed and cyber-based misuse, mis-disclosure and misdealing of information, announcement and orders in one market or crossing multiple markets. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop innovative and workable methods for smart trading and surveillance. To deal with such issues, we propose the innovative concept microstructure pattern analysis and corresponding approaches in this paper. Microstructure pattern analysis studies trading behaviour patterns of traders in market microstructure data by utilizing market microstructure knowledge. The identified market microstructure patterns are then used for powering market trading and surveillance agents for automatically detecting/ designing profitable and legal trading strategies or monitoring abnormal market dynamics and trader's behaviour. Such trading/surveillance agent-driven market trading/surveillance systems can greatly enhance the analytical, discovery and decision-support capability of market trading/surveillance than the current predefined rule/alert-based systems.

While exploring the cube, end-users are rapidly confronted by analyzing a huge number of drill paths according to the different dimensions. Generally, analysts are only interested in a small part of them which corresponds to either high statistical associations between dimensions or atypical cell values. This paper fits in the scope of discovery-driven dynamic exploration. It presents a method coupling OLAP technologies and mining techniques to facilitate the whole process of exploration of the data cube by identifying the most relevant dimensions to expand. At each step of the process, a built-in rank on dimensions is restituted to the users. It is performed through indicators computed on the fly according to the user-defined data selection. A proof of the implementation of this concept on the ORACLE 10G system is described at the end of the paper.

This is especially true for large and complex projects in which requirements knowledge is distributed across thousands of stakeholders. This short paper introduces a new process and related framework that utilizes data mining and recommender technologies to create an open, scalable, and inclusive requirements elicitation process capable of supporting projects with thousands of stakeholders. The approach is illustrated and evaluated using feature requests mined from an open source software product.

Feature subset selection basically depends on selecting a criterion function for evaluation of the feature subset and a search strategy to find the best feature subset from a large number of feature subsets. Lots of techniques have been developed so far, mainly from statistical theory, still research is going on to find better solutions in terms of optimality and computational ease. Recently soft computing techniques are gaining popularity for solving real world problems for their more flexibility compared to statistical or mathematical techniques. In this work an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization with fuzzy fitness function has been proposed for getting optimal feature subset from a feature set with large number of features. Simple simulation experiments with two benchmark data sets show that the proposed method is similar in performance to the results reported earlier and is computationally less demanding in comparison to Genetic Alogrithm, another population based evolutionary search technique proposed earlier for feature subset selection by author.

Many different clustering paradigms have been developed over the years, which include partitional, hierarchical, mixture model based, density-based, spectral, subspace, and so on. The focus of this paper is on full-dimensional, arbitrary shaped clusters. Existing methods for this problem suffer either in terms of the memory or time complexity (quadratic or even cubic). This shortcoming has restricted these algorithms to datasets of moderate sizes. In this paper we propose SPARCL, a simple and scalable algorithm finding clusters with arbitrary shapes and sizes, and it has linear space and time complexity. SPARCL consists of two stages - the first stage runs a carefully initialized version of the Kmeans algorithm to generate many small seed clusters. The second stage iteratively merges the generated clusters to obtain the final shape-based clusters. Experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets to highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our approach. On the large datasets SPARCL is an order of magnitude faster than the best existing approaches.

To solve this problem, projective clustering has been defined as an extension of traditional clustering that seeks to find projected clusters in subsets of dimensions of a data space. In this paper the problem of modeling projected clusters is first discussed, and an axtended Gaussian model is proposed. Second, a general objective criterion used with kmeans type projective clustering is presented based on the model. Finally, the expressions to learn model parameters are derived and then used in a new algorithm named FPC to perform fuzzy clustering on high dimensional data. The experimental results on document clustering show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering model.

This paper focuses on a method of optimizing classifiers of neural network by Genetic Algorithm based on principle of gene reconfiguration, and implement classification by training the weight. The paper uses shift reverse logic crossover operation and the improved genetic algorithm The article using the typical method for optimizing BP neural network weight is BP algorithm, which has such disadvantages as slow practice speed and easy,for running into local minimum. The article uses genetic algorithm based on gene reconfiguration to largely resolve the problem. Genetic algorithm optimizes neural network, mainly including neural network structure evolvement and neural network connection weight evolvement. The article firstly uses Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) for network structure evolvement and then adopts genetic algorithm based on gene reconfiguration for network weight practice. Experiment results show that Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) improve classifying veracity.

In this paper we propose a model of temporal pattern discovery from multiple time series based on temporal logic. Firstly, multiple time series are transform to multiple event sequences, and then they are synthesized into one event sequence. Secondly, we generate the observation sequence to mining the temporal pattern and the rules based on the interval temporal logic. The algorithm is proposed to mining online frequent episodes and mining change of patterns on mass event sequences. Finally, efficiency of the model and the algorithm is proved through experiments.

It is the union of inductive logic programming, (statistical) relational learning and multi-relational data mining and constitutes a general class of techniques and methodology for learning from structured data (such as graphs, networks, relational databases) and background knowledge. During the course of its existence, logical and relational learning has changed dramatically. Whereas early work was mainly concerned with logical issues (and even program synthesis from examples), in the 90s its focus was on the discovery, of new and interpretable knowledge from structured data, often in the form of rules or patterns. Since then Hie range of tasks to which logical and relational learning has been applied has significantly broadened and now covers almost all machine learning problems and settings. Today, there exist logical and relational learning methods for reinforcement learning, statistical learning. distance- and kernel-based learning in addition to traditional symbolic machine learning approaches. At the same time, logical and relational learning problems are appearing everywhere. Advances in intelligent systems are enabling the generation of high-level symbolic and structured data in a wide variety of domains, including the semantic web, robotics, vision, social networks, and the life sciences, which ill turn raises new challenges and opportunities for logical and relational learning. These developments have led to a new view on logical and relational learning and its role in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this talk, I shall reflect oil this view by identifying some of the lessons learned ill logical and relational learning and formulating some challenges, for future developments.

While this modular approach delivers ultimate flexibility, it gives the user almost no guidance on the issue of choosing an efficient combination of algorithms in the current problem context. In the field of Software Engineering the Pattern Based development process has empirically proven its high potential. Patterns provide a broad and generic framework for the solution process in its entirety and are based on equally broad characteristics of the problem. Details of the individual steps are filled in at later stages. Basic research on pattern based thinking has provided us with a list of generally applicable and proven patterns. User interaction in a pattern based approach to data mining will be divided into two steps: (1) choosing a pattern from a generic list based an a handful of characteristics of the problem and later (2) filling in data mining algorithms for the subtasks.

In this paper we investigate the application in psychopathological field of two well known soft computing techniques, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms (GAs). The investigation started from a practical need: the creation of a tool for a quick and correct classification of mental retardation level, which is needed to choose the right treatment for rehabilitation and to assure a quality of life that is suitable for the specific patient condition. In order to meet this need we researched an adaptive data mining technique that allows us to build interpretable models for automatic and reliable diagnosis. Our work concerned a genetic fuzzy system (GFS), which integrates a classical GA and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. This GFS, called genetic fuzzy C-means (GFCM), is able to select the best subset of features to generate an efficient classifier for diagnostic purposes from a database of examples. Additionally, thanks to an extension of the FCM algorithm, the proposed technique could also handle databases with missing values. The results obtained in a practical application on a real database of patients and comparisons with established techniques showed the efficiency of the integrated algorithm, both in data mining and completion.

Neural networks, because of their plasticity and degrees of freedom, seem to be a good approach to consider the enormous variability of physiological systems. Several architectures and training algorithms are comparatively proposed in this work showing that it is possible to find an adequate net work for one patient, but care must be taken to generalize to other patients. It is claimed that each patient will have his (her) own seizure prediction algorithms.

In this paper, we describe our implementation of three important classes of data mining algorithms: clustering (k-Means), classification (RBF network), and association rule ruining (Apriori) on the CBE. We explain our parallelization methodology and describe the exploitation of thread- and data-level parallelism in each of the three algorithms. Finally we present experimental results on the Cell hardware, where we could achieve a high performance of up to 10 GFLOP/s and a speedup of up to 40.

However, one presented binary mining algorithm is only suitable for mining some relative short frequent item sets since the way of generating candidate item sets is also similar to Apriori, another is only suitable for mining long frequent item sets, which generates candidate item sets by up-down search strategy. And so aiming to mining general frequent item sets, this paper proposes an algorithm of association rules double search mining based on binary, which is different from tradition association rules mining algorithm based on double search strategy. The algorithm doesn't use combination of set theory to generate candidate item sets but binary logic operation that is also used to compute support of candidate item sets, which can use character digital to reduce the number of scanned transaction. The algorithm gets rid of shortage about some presented algorithms based on binary. The experiment based on above three algorithms indicates that the efficiency about double search strategy is fast and efficient when mining general frequent item sets which aren't confined.

As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment, credit card frauds are becoming increasingly rampant in recent years. In this paper, we model the sequence of operations in credit card transaction processing using a confidence-based neural network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis technology is also introduced to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of fraud detection. A neural network is initially trained with synthetic data. If an incoming credit card transaction is not accepted by the trained neural network model (NNM) with sufficiently low confidence, it is considered to be fraudulent. This paper shows how confidence value, neural network algorithm and ROC can be combined successfully to perform credit card fraud detection.

So far, various data mining and machine learning algorithms have been enhanced to incorporate privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving solutions for Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) over horizontally and vertically partitioned data. FDA is one of the widely used discriminant algorithms that seeks to separate different classes as much as possible for discriminant analysis or dimension reduction. It has been applied to face recognition, speech recognition, and handwriting recognition. The secure solutions are designed based on two basic secure building blocks that we have proposed-the Secure Matrix Multiplication protocol and the Secure Inverse of Matrix Sum protocol-which are in turn based on cryptographic techniques. We conducted experiments to evaluate the scalability of the proposed secure building blocks and overheads to achieve privacy when performing FDA.

Many algorithms have been developed in the Machine Learning, Statistical Data Mining, and Pattern Classification communities that perform such tasks with remarkable accuracy. Many of these algorithms, however, when implemented in software, suffer poor frame rates due to the amount and complexity of the computation involved This paper presents an FPGA friendly implementation of a Gaussian Radial Basis SVM well suited to classification of grayscale images. We identify a novel optimization of the SVM formulation that dramatically reduces the computational inefficiency of the algorithm. The implementation achieves 88.6% detection accuracy in gender classification which is to the same degree of accuracy of software implementations using the same classification mechanism.

We propose a novel iterative algorithm which utilize the existing graph ordering algorithm to solve the optimal visualization problem. This algorithm can always converge to a local minimum. Pie detailed experimental evaluation using a set of publicly available transactional datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm,	[Jin, Ruoming; Xiang, Yang; Fuhry, David; Dragan, Feodor F.] Kent State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA	Jin, RM (reprint author), Kent State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA.	jin@cs.kent.edu; yxiang@cs.kent.edu; dfuhry@cs.kent.edu; dragan@cs.kent.edu					Adolphson D.

The method is aimed at extracting formal concepts, representing sets of genes that present similar quantitative variations of expression in certain biological situations or environments. Formal Concept Analysis is used both for its abilities in data-mining and information representation. We structure the method around three steps: numerical data is turned into binary data, then formal concepts are extracted and filtered with a new formalism. The method has been applied to a gene expression dataset obtained in a fungal species named Laccaria bicolor. The paper ends with a discussion and research perspectives.

The objects we look at are chordal graphs sandwiched by a given pair of graphs where we assume at least one of the input pair is chordal. The setting is a natural generalization of chordal completions and deletions. For the listing problem, we give an efficient algorithm running in polynomial time per output with polynomial space. As for the sampling problem, we give two clues that seem to imply that a random sampling is not easy. The first clue is that we show #P-completeness results for counting problems. The second clue is that we give an instance for which a natural Markov chain suffers from an exponential mixing time. These results provide a unified viewpoint from algorithms theory to problems arising from various areas such as statistics, data mining, and numerical computation.

The novelty of our approach is two-fold. First, we introduce the notion of k-order alpha-hull and alpha-shape - generalizations of alpha-hull and alpha-shape. Second, we use white noise to "train" our k-order alpha-shaper, i.e., to choose the right values of alpha and k. The difference of the k-order alpha-hull and alpha-shape from the alpha-hull and alpha-shape is also two-fold. First, k-order alpha-hull and alpha-shape provide a robust estimate of the shape by ignoring outliers. Second, it reconstructs the "inner" shape, with the amount of "digging" into the data controlled by k.

This is an enabling technology for content-based video annotation, query and retrieval with applications in Internet video search and video data mining. The method involves identifying objects in the scene, describing their inter-relations, detecting events of interest, and representing them semantically in a human readable and query-able format. The SAVE framework is composed of three main components. The first component is an image parsing engine that performs scene content extraction using bottom-up image analysis and a stochastic attribute image grammar, where we define a visual vocabulary from pixels, primitives, parts, objects and scenes, and specify their spatio-temporal or compositional relations; and a bottom-up top-down strategy is used for inference. The second component is an event inference engine, where the Video Event Markup Language (VEML) is adopted for semantic representation, and a grammar-based approach is used for event analysis and detection. The third component is the text generation engine that generates text report using head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG). The main contribution of this paper is a framework for an end-to-end system that infers visual events and annotates a large collection of videos. Experiments with maritime and urban scenes indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Although these disturbed cloaked data cannot reveal the privacy information of individual users, they can still help perform some data mining tasks such as data classification. In this paper, we study one important and fundamental query predicate, that is, to find the cloaked time series that are similar to a query pattern. In this paper, we formalize such similarity search problem over the cloaked time series, and propose a novel approach to index the cloaked series, which can facilitate the similarity query.

These techniques typically involve using a human expert and automated software analysis (Data Mining). Often the human expertise is used initially to choose which data is processed, and then finally to determine which results are relevant. However studies have noted that some domains contain data stores too extensive and detailed and existing knowledge too complex, for effective data selection or efficient Data Mining. A different approach is suggested which involves the human expert more pervasively, taking advantage of their expertise at each step, while using Data Mining techniques to assist in discovering data trends and in verifying the expert's findings. Preliminary results suggest that the approach can be successfully applied to discover new knowledge in a complex domain, and reveal many potential areas for research and development.

In this paper, we study primarily the feature selection of network traffic and its impact on the detection rates. We use KDD CUP 1999 dataset as the sample for the study. We group the features of the dataset into 4 groups: Group I contains the basic network traffic features; Group 11 is actually not network traffic related, but the features collected from hosts; Group III and IV are temporally aggregated features. In this paper, we demonstrate the different detection rates of choosing the different combinations of these groups. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and the ineffectiveness in finding anomalies by looking at the network data alone. In addition, we also briefly investigate the effectiveness of data normalization. To validate our findings, we conducted the same experiments with 3 different clustering algorithms - K-means clustering, fuzzy C means clustering (FCM), and fuzz), entropy clustering (FE).

A prominent approach is spectral ordering that computes a similarity measure between the sites and orders them such that similar sites become adjacent and dissimilar sites are placed far apart. In the paleontological domain, the similarity measure is based on the mammal genera whose remains are retrieved at each site of excavation. Although spectral ordering achieves good performance in the seriation task, it ignores the background knowledge that is naturally present in the domain, as paleontologists can derive the ages of the sites of excavation within some accuracy. On the other hand, the age information is uncertain, so the best approach would be to combine the background knowledge with the information on mammal co-occurrences. Motivated by this kind of partial supervision we propose a novel semi-supervised spectral ordering algorithm. Our algorithm modifies the Laplacian matrix used in spectral ordering, such that domain knowledge of the ordering is taken into account. Also, it performs feature selection (sparsification) by discarding features that contribute most to the unwanted variability of the data in boot-strap sampling. The theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed and it is demonstrated that the proposed framework enhances the stability of the spectral ordering output and induces computational gains.

This problem has been studied extensively in static databases. However, in recent years, emerging applications have introduced a new form of data called data stream. In a data stream, new elements are generated continuously. This poses additional constraints on the methods used for mining such data: memory usage is restricted, the infinitely flowing original dataset cannot be scanned multiple times, and current results should be available on demand. This paper introduces two effective methods for mining sequential patterns from data streams: the SS-BE method and the SS-MB method. The proposed methods break the stream into batches and only process each batch once. The two methods use different pruning strategies that restrict the memory usage but can still guarantee that all trite sequential patterns are output at the end of any batch. Both algorithms scale linearly in execution time as the number of sequences grows, making them effective methods for sequential pattern mining in data streams. The experimental results also show that our methods are very accurate in that only a small fraction of the patterns that are output are false positives. Even for these false positives, SS-BE guarantees that their true support is above a pre-defined threshold.

The main purpose of this article is to provide guidance for federated search tool technicians and support teams about user issues, including the need for training. Design/methodology/approach - Log files were exploited to examine the behaviour of users of information retrieval systems. This study examined two log files extracted from federated search tools available to the Egyptian scholars' community for accessing electronic resources. A data mining approach was implemented to investigate User behaviour through deep analysis of these logs. Findings - Results show that: none of the available tools provide error messages for dummy queries; most of the Egyptian scholars had short queries; Boolean operators are not used in about 50 per cent of the queries; federated search tools do not provide techniques for query reformation: the optimal days for system maintenance are the non-weekend vacations: and early morning is the best time for maintenance. Practical implications - To maximise the value of the federated search tools by understanding user trends when utilising federated search tools. The study shows that more attention should be given to the search capabilities through ongoing training and awareness in order to maximise the if benefit from the available resources and tools. Originality/value - The hypothetical value of the federated search tools has not been previously examined and analysed to understand user trends.

But at large scales, mining for useful patterns still presents challenges in terms of data management as well as computation. These issues can be addressed by dividing both data and computation to build ensembles of classifiers in a distributed fashion, but trade-offs in cost, performance, and accuracy must be considered when designing or selecting an appropriate architecture. In this paper we present air abstraction for scalable data mining that allows us to explore these trade-offs. Data and computation are distributed to a computing cloud with minimal effort from the user and multiple models for data management are available depending on the workload and system configuration.

The term Surgical Workflows is used for describing the methodical framework for acquiring formal descriptions of surgical interventions. A formal model and a uniform recording scheme of a surgical process are crucialfor systematic accumulation of relevant data from running surgical instances in a form, appropriate for analysis. This paper describes the process of designing a data warehouse for surgical workflow analysis. Data warehousing technology, originally developed for quantitative business data analysis for the purpose of decision making, is adaptable to the requirements of surgical data and analysis. We describe a conceptual model of a surgical procedure obtained in accordance with the multidimensional data model. We demonstrate how a subject-oriented multidimensional perspective of a surgery and its components enables powerful analysis and exploration by defining the metrics of interests. and aggregating those metrics along various dimensions and levels of details. Apart from its primary function, i.e. quantitative analysis, the data of the surgical data warehouse may serve as input for other data-intensive systems, e.g. visualization and data mining tools.

The effectiveness of a clustering approach is mainly judged by its capability of producing clusters by maximizing both: within cluster similarity and between clusters dissimilarity. However, clustering algorithms expect the number of clusters be specified beforehand; this requires domain expertise. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different validity indices in guiding the process of a clustering approach that automatically determines the number of clusters before starting the actual clustering process. The target is achieved by first running a multi-objective genetic algorithm on a sample of the given dataset to find the set of alternative Solutions for a given range of possible number of clusters. Then, we apply cluster validity indexes to find the most appropriate number of clusters. We decide on running the genetic algorithm on a sample rather than the whole dataset simply because we want to benefit from the power of the genetic algorithm in automatically estimating the number of clusters, without being negatively affected by the poor performance of the genetic algorithm process as the dataset size increases. Finally, we run CURE to do the actual clustering of the whole dataset by feeding the determined number of clusters as input. The reported test results on two datasets demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Moreover, our algorithm is online and exact; in that, unlike the previous batch algorithms [4, 5, 6, 7, 1,41, which needs to read the entire input beforehand, our algorithm reports the longest match just after reading each character. This algorithm cart be directly used for data compression, pattern analysis, and data mining. Our algorithm also supports the window buffer, in that we can bound the working space by discarding the history from the oldest character. Using the dynamic rank/select dictionary [17], our algorithm requires n log sigma + o(n log sigma) + O(n) bits of working space, and O (log(3) n) time per character, O (n log(3) n) total time, n is the length of the history, and sigma is the alphabet size. We implemented our algorithm and compared it with the recent algorithms [4, 5, 14] in terms of speed and the working space. We found that our algorithm can work with a smaller working space, less than 1/2 of those for the previous methods in real-world data, and with a reasonable decline in speed.

Multi-level database mining using AFOPT data structure and adaptive support constrains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery in databases; support constrains; multi-level databases; multi-level association rules mining	PATTERNS	Finding frequent itemsets is one of the most investigated fields of database mining. The classic association mining based on a uniform support misses interesting patterns of low support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation. A better solution is to exploit support constrains, witch specifies what minimum support is required for what itemsets and so that only necessary itemsets are generated. In this paper, an algorithm for multilevel database mining is proposed. The algorithm is obtained by extending the AFOPT algorithm for multi-level databases.

This dataset consists of records describing 786 female patients of Pima Indian heritage which are at least 21 years old living near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The problem is to predict whether a new patient would test positive for diabetes. However, the correct classification percentage of current algorithms oil this dataset is oftentimes coincidental. The root to the above critical problem is the overfitting and overgeneralization behaviors of a given classification algorithm when it is processing a dataset. Although the above situation is of fundamental importance in data mining, it has not been studied from a comprehensive point of view. Thus, this paper describes a new approach, called the Homogeneity- Based Algorithm (or HBA) as developed by Pham and Triantaphyllou in [2-3], to optimally control the overfitting and overgeneralization behaviors of classification on this dataset. The HBA is used in conjunction with traditional classification approaches (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), or Decision Trees (DTs)) to enhance their classification accuracy. Some computational results seem to indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms current approaches.

Many information concerning cases is still stored in databases as unstructured text. Formal Concept Analysis is showcased as an exploratory data analysis technique for discovering new knowledge from police reports. It turns out that it provides a powerful framework for exploring the dataset, resulting in essential knowledge for improving current practices. It is shown that the domestic violence definition employed by the police organisation of the Netherlands is not always as clear as it should be, making it hard to use it effectively for classification purposes. In addition, newly discovered knowledge for automatically classifying certain cases as either domestic or non-domestic violence is presented. Moreover, essential techniques for detecting incorrect classifications, performed by police officers, are provided. Finally, some problems encountered because of the sometimes unstructured way of working of police officers are discussed. Both using Formal Concept Analysis for exploratory data analysis and its application on this area are novel enough to make this paper into a valuable contribution to the literature.

A Framework of an Automated Data Mining System Using Autonomous Intelligent Agents	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology	AUG 29-SEP 02, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IACSIT, Sichuan Comp Federat China, Nanyang Technol Univ, Sichuan Univ China, Meiji Univ				Data mining is the analysis of (often large) observational data sets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data owner. In other words data mining is a process of finding previously unknown, profitable and use patterns hidden in data, with no prior hypothesis. Automated Data Mining and modeling software gives managers a tool to perform analyses that otherwise would need to be handled by a highly trained researcher. Automated data mining methodologies is not to provide more accurate results but strives to empower nonexpert users to achieve reasonable results with minimum effort Data mining is a difficult and laborious activity that requires a great deal of expertise for obtaining quality results. We need new methods for intelligent data analysis to extract relevant information with less effort. With the use of the autonomous intelligent agents several data mining steps are possibly be automated. The goal is to empower non-expert users to achieve reasonable results with minimum effort. In this paper we present an automated approach for a Data mining System using Autonomous Intelligent Agents.

Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations. The system uses an interactive data mining module that supports the insertion of the user's knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model of the environment.

Most of the current algorithms for mining frequent patterns assume that two objects subdescriptions are similar if and only if they are equal, but in soft sciences some other similarity functions are used. In this work, we focus on the search of frequent patterns on Mixed Data, incorporating similarity between objects. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm to mine frequent similar patterns for a family of similarity functions that fulfill Downward Closure property and we also propose another algorithm for the remaining families of similarity functions. Some experiments over mixed datasets are done, and the results are compared against the ObjectMiner algorithm.

In general there are two approaches to tackling PPDM, one is statistics-based and the other is crypto-based. The statistics-based approach has the advantage of being efficient enough to deal with large volume of datasets. The basic idea underlying this approach is to let the data owners publish some sanitized versions of their data (e.g., via perturbation, generalization, or l-diversification), which are then used for extracting useful knowledge models such as decision trees. In this paper, we present a new method for statistics-based PPDM. Our method differs from the existing ones because it lets the data owners share with each other the knowledge models extracted from their own private datasets, rather than to let the data owners publish any of their own private datasets (not even in any sanitized form). The knowledge models derived from the individual datasets are used to generate some pseudo-data that are then used for extracting the desired "global" knowledge models. While instrumental, there are some technical subtleties that need be carefully addressed. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for generating pseudo-data according to paths of a decision tree, a method for adapting anonymity measures of datasets to measure the privacy of decision trees, and an algorithm that prunes a decision tree to satisfy a given anonymity requirement. Through an empirical study, we show that predictive models learned using our method are significantly more accurate than those learned using the existing E-diversity method in both centralized and distributed environments with different types of datasets, predictive models, and utility measures.

Utility is a measure of the usefulness of the discovered knowledge and satisfaction of the user with that knowledge. We motivate and address the question of usefulness of sanitized data using the notion of utility in data mining systems. For this we measure the success of patterns and rules discovered from the original data to make predictions about the sanitized data using a previously developed framework. Using experimental results on a set of medical data we demonstrate that it is possible to make useful predictions about the sanitized medical data when rules discovered from the original unsanitized medical data are used. We explain our results and compare it with the case where no sanitization is involved.

In this paper we consider discovering association rules from large transaction databases. The problem of discovering association rules can be decomposed into two sub-problems: find large itemsets and generate association rules from large itemsets. The second sub-problem is easier one and the complexity of discovering association rules is determined by complexity of discovering large itemsets. In this paper, we suggest Apriori-based algorithm for discovering large itemsets. Actually, we suggest a new procedure for large itemsets generation which is more efficient than the appropriate procedure of the original Apriori algorithm. For its implementation, we suggest a modified sort-merge-join algorithm, which is more efficient than nested-loop-join algorithm, which is suggested in the original Apriori algorithm.

Utilizing visual and aural information, we extract some high-level features to describe video segments. The audiovisual features are further transformed to symbolic streams and an efficient mining technique is applied to derive all frequent patterns that characterize tennis events. After mining, we categorize frequent patterns into several kinds of events and therefore achieve event detection for tennis videos by checking the correspondence between mined patterns and events. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a promising way to detect events in broadcasting tennis video.

Since sampling rates of streams are frequently different, and their time period varies in practical situations, the method which deals with time warping such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is suitable for measuring similarity. However, finding pairs of similar subsequences between co-evolving sequences is difficult due to increase of the complexity because DTW is a method for detecting sequences that are similar to a given query sequence. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding pairs of similar subsequences and periodicity over data streams. propose a method to detect similar subsequences in streaming fashion. Our approach for measuring similarity relies on a proposed scoring function that incrementally updates a score. which is suitable for data stream processing. We also present an efficient algorithm based oil the scoring function. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that, our method detects the pairs of qualifying subsequeuce correctly and that it is dramatically faster than the existing method.

Action rule mining presents an approach to automatically construct relevantly useful and understandable strategies by comparing the profiles of two sets of targeted objects - those that are desirable and those that are undesirable. The discovered knowledge provides an insight of how relationships should be managed so that objects of low performance can be improved. Traditionally, it was constructed from one or two classification rules. The quality and quantity of such Action Rules depend on adopted classification methods. In this paper, we present StrategyGenerator, a new algorithm for constructing a complete set of Action Rules which satisfies specified constraints. This algorithm does not require prior extraction of classification rules. Action rules are generated directly from a database.

Yet, the information contained in these experiments might have uses beyond their original intent and, if properly stored, could be of great use to future research. In this paper, we hope to stimulate the development of such learning experiment repositories by providing a bird's-eye view of how they can be created and used in practice, bringing together existing approaches and new ideas. We draw parallels between how experiments are being curated in other sciences, and consecutively discuss how both the empirical and theoretical details of learning experiments can be expressed, organized and made universally accessible. Finally, we discuss a range of possible services such a resource can offer, either used directly or integrated into data mining tools.

We first defined the behaviors of an executable by observing its usage of dynamically linked libraries and Application Programming Interfaces. Then, information gain and support vector machines were applied to filter out the redundant behavior attributes and select informative feature for training a virus classifier. The performance of our model was evaluated by a dataset contains 1, 758 benign executables and 846 viruses. The experiment results are promising, and the overall accuracies are 99% and 96.66% for detecting the known viruses and the previously unseen viruses respectively.

In this paper, we combine clinical epidemiology, proteome technique and data mining research to investigate the molecular basis of syndrome. We do a clinical epidemiology survey of Coronary Heart Disease to collect case patients and control patients. We also analysis the two-dimensional electrophoresis results of blood samples of included patients to find out the proteins with significant expression. We find out that the blood stasis syndrome has significant association with 10 inflammatory factors proteins. Based on the collected data, we proposed an unsupervised pattern discovery algorithm to detect the significantly associated patterns in the data. 14 patterns containing syndrome and proteins are retrieved, which can be considered as the evidence of association between syndrome of TCM and proteome. Furthermore, we validate the unsupervised pattern discovery results by combining Support Vector Machine and 10-fold cross validation, finding that the accuracy of classifying is higher than 90%, which indicates that the pattern discovery results is believable. The research effort here presents a better insight to the integration of TCM and western medicine and develops a better way to study the molecular basis of syndrome.

The underlying transitions may be obtained by discretizing observed time series, or they are generated based on existing knowledge, e.g. by Boolean networks or their nondeterministic generalization. We use the mathematical discipline of formal concept analysis (FCA), which has been applied successfully in domains its knowledge representation, data mining or software engineering. By the attribute exploration algorithm, an expert or a supporting computer program is enabled to decide about the validity of a minimal set of implications and thus to construct a sound and complete knowledge base. From this all valid implications are derivable that relate to the selected properties of a. set of genes. We present results of our method for the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. However the formal structures are exhibited ill it illost general manner. Therefore the approach may be adapted to signal transduction or metabolic networks, as well its to discrete temporal transitions in many biological and nonbiological areas.

In this paper, we hope to discover possible trends and needs of business aviation for supporting the government to make decision in anticipation of eventual deregulation in the near future. We adopt knowledge-discovery tools based on rough set to analyze the potential for business aviation through an empirical study.

Generally, an association rule A -> B is used to predict that B likely occurs when A occurs. This is a kind of strong correlation, and indicates that the two events will probably happen simultaneously. However, in real world applications such as bioinformatics and medical research, there are many follow-up correlations between itemsets A and B, such as, B is likely to occur n times after A has occurred m times. That is, the correlative itemsets do not belong to the same transaction. We refer to this relation as a follow-up correlation pattern (FCP). The task of mining FCP patterns brings more challenges on efficient processing than normal pattern discovery because the number of potentially interesting patterns becomes extremely large as the length limit of transactions no longer exists. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to identify FCP patterns in time-related databases. We also experimentally evaluate our approach, and provide extensive results on mining this new kind of patterns.

We especially focus on explorative interactive techniques where analysts try to analyze large amounts of financial data for long-term investments, and show how visualization can effectively support an investor to gain insight into large amounts of financial time series data. After presenting methods for improving the traditional performance/risk computation in order to take user-specific regions of interest into account, we present a novel visualization approach that demonstrates how changes in these regions of interest affect the ranking of assets in a long-term investment strategy.

Mining for trigger events with survival analysis	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						survival analysis; customer lifetime value; CRM; trigger events; one-to-one marketing; time-dependent covariates	CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE	This paper discusses a new application of data mining, quantifying the importance of responding to trigger events with reactive contacts. Trigger events happen during a customer's lifecycle and indicate some change in the relationship with the company. If detected early, the company can respond to the problem and retain the customer; otherwise the customer may switch to another company. It is usually easy to identify many potential trigger events. What is needed is a way of prioritizing which events demand interventions. We conceptualize the trigger event problem and show how survival analysis can be used to quantify the importance of addressing various trigger events. The method is illustrated on four real data sets from different industries and countries.

J	Moon, YS; Kim, J				Moon, Yang-Sae; Kim, Jinho			Fast normalization-transformed subsequence matching in time-series databases	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; time-series databases; subsequence matching; normalization transform	SIMILARITY SEARCH	Normalization transform is known to be very useful for finding the overall trend of time-series data since it enables finding sequences with similar fluctuation patterns. Previous subsequence matching methods with normalization transform, however, would incur index overhead both in storage space and in update maintenance since they should build multiple indexes for supporting query sequences of arbitrary length. To solve this problem, we adopt a single-index approach in the normalization-transformed subsequence matching that supports query sequences of arbitrary length. For the single-index approach, we first provide the notion of inclusion-normalization transform by generalizing the original definition of normalization transform. To normalize a window, the inclusion-normalization transform uses the mean and the standard deviation of a subsequence that includes the window while the original transform uses those of the window itself. Next, we formally prove the correctness of the proposed normalization-transformed subsequence matching method that uses the inclusion-normalization transform. We then propose subsequence matching and index-building algorithms to implement the proposed method. Experimental results for real stock data show that our method improves performance by up to 2.5 similar to 2.8 times compared with the previous method.

One of the applications of data mining in the field of the Bioinformatics is classification of tissue samples. In the present work, a wavelet power spectrum based approach has been presented for feature selection and successful classification of the multi class dataset. The proposed method was applied on SRBCT and the breast cancer datasets which are multi class cancer datasets. The selected features are almost those selected in previous works. The method was able to produce almost 100% accurate classification results. The method is very simple and robust to noise. No extensive preprocessing is required. The classification was performed with comparatively very lesser number of features than those used in the original works. No information is lost due to the initial pruning of the data usually performed using a threshold in other methods. The method utilizes the inherent nature of the data in performing various tasks. So, the method can be used for a wide range of data.

J	Kim, SW; Jeong, BS				Kim, Sang-Wook; Jeong, Byeong-Soo			Performance bottleneck of subsequence matching in time-series databases: Observation, solution, and performance evaluation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; time-series databases; similar sequence matching; performance	INDEX-BASED APPROACH; SIMILARITY SEARCH; SEQUENCE DATABASES; WAVELETS; RETRIEVAL	Subsequence matching is an operation that finds subsequences whose changing patterns are similar to a given query sequence from time-series databases. This paper identifies a performance bottleneck in subsequence matching, and then proposes an effective method that substantially improves the performance of entire subsequence matching by resolving the performance bottleneck. First, we analyze the disk access and CPU processing times required during the index searching and post-processing steps of subsequence matching through preliminary experiments. Based on these results, we show that the post-processing step is a main performance, bottleneck in subsequence matching. Then, we argue that the optimization of the post-processing step is a crucial issue overlooked in previous approaches. In order to resolve the performance bottleneck, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for expediting the post-processing step. By rearranging the order of candidate subsequences to be compared with a query sequence, our method completely eliminates the redundancies of disk accesses and CPU processing that occur in the post-processing step. Our method is fairly efficient, and does not incur any false dismissal. We quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of our method through extensive experimentation. The results show that our method produces a significantly faster post-processing step; When using a data set of real-world stock sequences, our method was 43.36-96.75 times faster than previous methods, and when using data sets of large numbers of synthetic sequences, our method was 12.48-26.95 times faster than previous methods. Also, the results show that our method reduces the weight of the post-processing step over entire subsequence matching from more than 97% to less than 67%. This implies that our method successfully resolves the performance bottleneck in subsequence matching. As a result, our method provides excellent performance in entire subsequence matching. Compared with previous methods, our method is 16.17-32.64 times faster when using a data set of real-world stock sequences and 8.64-14.29 times faster when using data sets of large numbers of synthetic sequences.

Michael			Graph-based analysis of human transfer learning using a game testbed	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; graph algorithms; transfer learning; games	INDUCTION	The ability to transfer knowledge learned in one environment in order to improve performance in a different environment is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. Insights into human transfer learning help us to design computer-based agents that can better adapt to new environments without the need for substantial reprogramming. In this paper, we study the transfer of knowledge by humans playing various scenarios in a graphically realistic urban setting that are specifically designed to test various levels of transfer. We determine the amount and type of transfer that is being performed based on the performance of trained and untrained human players. In addition, we use a graph-based relational learning algorithm to extract patterns from player graphs. These analyses reveal that indeed humans are transferring knowledge from one set of games to another and the amount and type of transfer varies according to player experience and scenario complexity. The results of this analysis help us understand the nature of human transfer in such environments and shed light on how we might endow computer-based agents with similar capabilities. The game simulator and human data collection also represent a significant testbed in which other AI capabilities can be tested and compared to human performance.

To exploit these resources, new distributed algorithms are necessary, particularly concerning the way to distribute data and to use this partition. We present a clustering algorithm dubbed Progressive Clustering that provides an "intelligent" distribution of data on grids. The usefulness of this algorithm is shown for several distributed datamining tasks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huysmans, J; Baesens, B; Vanthienen, J				Huysmans, Johan; Baesens, Bart; Vanthienen, Jan			A new approach for measuring rule set consistency	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; rule extraction; consistency; model selection	NEURAL NETWORKS; CREDIT	Various algorithms are capable of learning a set of classification rules from a number of observations with their corresponding class labels. Whereas the obtained rule set is usually evaluated by measuring its accuracy on a number of unseen examples, there are several other evaluation criteria, such as comprehensibility and consistency, that are often overlooked. In this paper we focus on the aspect of consistency: if a rule learner is applied several times on the same data set, will it provide rule sets that are similar over the different runs? A new measure is proposed and various examples show how this new measure can be used to decide between different algorithms and rule sets or to find out whether the rules in a knowledge base need to be updated.

However, a SVM requires the user to set the form of its kernel function and parameters in the function, both of which directly affect to the performance of the classifier. This paper proposes a novel method, named a kernel-tree, the function of which is composed of multiple kernels in the form of a tree structure. The optimal kernel tree structure and its parameters is determined by genetic programming (GP). To perform a fine setting of kernel parameters, the gradient descent method is used. To evaluate the proposed method, benchmark datasets from UCI and dataset of text classification are applied. The result indicates that the method can find a better optimal solution than the grid search and the gradient search.

Historically, however, ecologists have collected and stored data idiosyncratically, making data integration even among close collaborators difficult. Further, effective ecology data warehouses and subsequent data mining require that individual databases be accurately described with metadata against which the data themselves have been validated. Using database technology would make documenting data sets for archiving, integration, and data mining easier, but few ecologists have expertise to use database technology and they cannot afford to hire programmers. In this paper, we identify the benefits that would accrue from ecologists' use of modern information technology and the obstacles that prevent that use. We describe our prototype, the Canopy DataBank, through which we aim to enable individual ecologists in the forest canopy research community to be their own database programmers. The key feature that makes this possible is domain-specific database components, which we call templates. We also show how additional tools that reuse these components, such as for visualization, could provide gains in productivity and motivate the use of new technology. Finally, we suggest ways in which communities might share database components and how components might be used to foster easier data integration to solve new ecological problems.

The use of exploratory data mining technology can mitigate these limitations by requiring fewer assumptions. We present the design of the ATHENS system, which discovers novel information, relative to a specified set of existing knowledge, in large information repositories such as the World Wide Web. We illustrate the use of the system by starting from the terms "al Qaeda" and "bin Laden"" and running the ATHENS system as if on September 12th, 2001. This provides a picture of what novel information could have been known at the time.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yi			Combining data mining and Game Theory in manufacturing strategy analysis	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	PROLAMAT 2006 Conference on Knowledge Enterprise	JUN 15-17, 2006	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IFIP TC5	Shanghai Univ	data mining; Game Theory; manufacturing strategy analysis; Nash equilibrium; formal concept		The work presented in this paper is result of a rapid increase of interest in game theoretical analysis and a huge growth of game related databases. It is likely that useful knowledge can be extracted from these databases. This paper argues that applying data mining algorithms together with Game Theory poses a significant potential as a new way to analyze complex engineering systems, such as strategy selection in manufacturing analysis. Recent research shows that combining data mining and Game Theory has not yet come up with reasonable solutions for the representation and structuring of the knowledge in a game. In order to examine the idea, a novel approach of fusing these two techniques has been developed in this paper and tested on real-world manufacturing datasets. The obtained results have been indicated the superiority of the proposed approach. Some fruitful directions for future research are outlined as well.

We propose a summarized representation of XML data, based on the concept of instance pattern, which can both provide succinct information and be directly queried. The physical representation of instance patterns exploits itemsets or association rules to summarize the content of XML datasets. Instance patterns may be used for (possibly partially) answering queries, either when fast and approximate answers are required, or when the actual dataset is not available, for example, it is currently unreachable. Experiments on large XML documents show that instance patterns allow a significant reduction in storage space, while preserving almost entirely the completeness of the query result. Furthermore, they provide fast query answers and show good scalability on the size of the dataset, thus overcoming the document size limitation of most current XQuery engines.

J	Shu, Y				Shu, Yufei			Inference of power plant quake-proof information based on interactive data mining approach	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						interactive data mining; cognitive model; information inference; structural health assessment		This paper presents a nonlinear structural health inference technique, based on an interactive data mining approach. A mining control agent emulating cognitive process of human analysts is developed and integrated in the data mining loop, analyzing and verifying the output of the data miner and controlling the data mining process to improve the interaction between human users and computer system. Additionally, an artificial neural network method, which is adopted as a core component of the proposed interactive data mining method, is evolved by adding a novelty detecting and retraining function for handling complicated nuclear power plant quake-proof data. Based on proposed approach, an information inference system has been developed. To demonstrate how the proposed technique can be used as a powerful tool for inferring of structural health status in unclear power plant, quake-proof testing data have been applied.

A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attribute correlations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications - since rules would fail in the absence of pattern - but also the identification of groups of mutually correlated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes, from which existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper, we describe a scalable, effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes, and is not restricted to a specific family of mapping functions, such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of the algorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to spot the correlated attributes. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed technique is linear on the number of elements and of correlations in the dataset.

An improved methodology on information distillation by mining program source code	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data/code mining; software maintenance issues; program comprehension; knowledge acquisition methods	COMPREHENSION; SYSTEM	This paper presents a methodology for knowledge acquisition from source code. We use data mining to support semiautomated software maintenance and comprehension and provide practical insights into systems specifics, assuming one has limited prior familiarity with these systems. We propose a methodology and an associated model for extracting information from object oriented code by applying clustering and association rules mining. K-means clustering produces system overviews and deductions, which support further employment of an improved version of MMS Apriori that identifies hidden relationships between classes, methods and member data. The methodology is evaluated on an industrial case study, results are discussed and conclusions are drawn. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lancieri, L; Boubchir, L				Lancieri, Luigi; Boubchir, Larbi			Using multiple uncertain examples and adaptative fuzzy reasoning to optimize image characterization	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						uncertainty; data mining; collective intelligence; probabilistic reasoning; vision		This article proposes an automatic characterization method by comparing unknown images with examples more or less known. Our approach allows to use uncertain examples but easy to obtain (e.g. by automatic retrieval on the Internet). The use of fuzzy logic and adaptive clustering makes it possible to reduce automatically the noise from this database by preserving only the examples having a strong level of redundancy in the dominant shapes. To validate this method, we compared our artificial process of recognition with the estimation of human operators. The tests show that the automatic process gives an average accuracy of the characterization near, to 95%. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main challenge of the problems lies in the combinatorial explosion of potential candidates. In this paper, we propose and study a Generalized Center String (GCS) problem, where not only all models (center strings) of any length, but also the positions of all their (degenerative) instances in input sequences are searched for. Inspired by frequent pattern mining techniques in data mining field, we present an exact and efficient method to solve GCS. First, a highly parallelized TRIE-like structure, consensus tree, is proposed. Based on this structure, we present three Bpriori algorithms step by step. Bpriori algorithms can solve GCS with reasonable time and/or space complexities. We have proved that GCS is fixed parameter tractable with respect to fixed symbol set size and fixed length of input sequences. Experiment results on both artificial and real data have shown the correctness of the algorithms and the validity of our complexity analysis. A comparison with some current algorithms for solving Common Approximate Substring problems is also given.

J	Schwartz, F; Fang, YC				Schwartz, Frank; Fang, Y. C.			Citation data analysis on hydrogeology	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This article explores the status of research in hydrogeology using data mining techniques. First we try to explain what citation analysis is and review some of the previous work on citation analysis. The main idea in this article is to address some common issues about citation numbers and the use of these data. To validate the use of citation numbers, we compare the citation patterns for Water Resources Research papers in the 1980s with those in the 1990s. The citation growths for highly cited authors from the 1980s are used to examine whether it is possible to predict the citation patterns for highly-cited authors in the 1990s. If the citation data prove to be steady and stable, these numbers then can be used to explore the evolution of science in hydrogeology. The famous quotation, "If you are not the lead dog, the scenery never changes," attributed to Lee Iacocca, points to the importance of an entrepreneurial spirit in all forms of endeavor. In the case of hydrogeological research, impact analysis makes it clear how important it is to be a pioneer. Statistical correlation coefficients are used to retrieve papers among a collection of 2,847 papers before and after 1991 sharing the same topics with 273 papers in 1991 in Water Resources Research. The numbers of papers before and after 1991 are then plotted against various levels of citations for papers in 1991 to compare the distributions of paper population before and after that year. The similarity metrics based on word counts can ensure that the "before" papers are like ancestors and "after" papers are descendants in the same type of research. This exercise gives us an idea of how many papers are populated before and after 1991 (1991 is chosen based on balanced numbers of papers before and after that year). In addition, the impact of papers is measured in terms of citation presented as "percentile," a relative measure based on rankings in one year, in order to minimize the effect of time.

In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating click rates for (webpage, advertisement) pairs (called impressions) where both the pages and the ads are classified into hierarchies that capture broad contextual information at different levels of granularity. Typically the click rates are low and the coverage of the hierarchies is sparse. To overcome these difficulties we devise a sampling method whereby we analyze a specially chosen sample of pages in the training set, and then estimate click rates using a two-stage model. The first stage imputes the number of (webpage, ad) pairs at all resolutions of the hierarchy to adjust for the sampling bias. The second stage estimates click rates at all resolutions after incorporating correlations among sibling nodes through a tree-structured Markov model. Both models are scalable and suited to large scale data mining applications. On a real-world dataset consisting of 1/2 billion impressions, we demonstrate that even with 95% negative (non-clicked) events in the training set, our method can effectively discriminate extremely rare events in terms of their click propensity.

B	Alvarez, MA; Lim, SJ				Alvarez, Marco A.; Lim, SeungJin			A graph modeling of semantic similarity between words	ICSC 2007: International Conference on Semantic Computing, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007)	SEP 17-19, 2007	Irvine, CA					The problem of measuring the semantic similarity between pairs of words has been considered a fundamental operation in data mining and information retrieval. Nevertheless, developing a computational method capable of generating satisfactory results close to what humans would perceive is still a difficult task somewhat owed to the subjective nature of similarity. In this paper, it is presented a novel algorithm for scoring the semantic similarity (SSA) between words. Given two input words w(1) and w(2), SSA exploits their corresponding concepts, relationships, and descriptive glosses available in WordNet in order to build a rooted weighted graph G(sim). The output score is calculated by exploring the concepts present in G(sim) and selecting the minimal distance between any two concepts c(1) and c(2) of w(1) and w(2) respectively. The definition of distance is a combination of: 1) the depth of the nearest common ancestor between c(1) and c(2) in G(sim), 2) the intersection of the descriptive glosses of c(1) and c(2), and 3) the shortest distance between c(1) and c(2) in G(sim). A correlation of 0.913 has been achieved between the results by SSA and the human ratings reported by Miller and Charles [15] for a dataset of 28 pairs of nouns. Furthermore, using the full dataset of 65 pairs presented by Rubenstein and Goodenough [20], the correlation between SSA results and the known human ratings is 0.903, which is higher than all other reported algorithms for the same dataset. The high correlations of SSA with human ratings suggest that SSA would be convenient in solving several data mining and information retrieval problems.

However, the high dimensionality of graph grammars result in costly effort for their construction and maintenance. Additionally, they are often error prone. These costs limit the research potential for studying the growing graph based data in many fields. As interest in applications for natural languages and data mining has increased, the machine learning of graph grammars poses a prime area of research. A unified graph grammar construction, parsing, and inference tool is proposed. Existing technologies can provide a context-free tool. However, a general context-sensitive tool has been elusive.

Here we consider the case where labels on the:nodes are nonexistent or unreliable, and propose data mining processes focusing on just the link structure. We propose a representation of ordered trees, describe a combinatorial characterization and some properties, and use them to propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed subtrees from a set of input trees. Then we focus on unordered trees, and show that intrinsic characterizations of our representation provide for a way of avoiding the repeated exploration of unordered trees, and then we give an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed unordered trees.

However, the stream nature of the data, the limited resources, and the distributed nature of sensor networks bring new challenges for the mining techniques that need to be address. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation for the association rules, a well known data mining technique, that is able to generate the time relations between sensor devices in a particular sensor network. This new formulation will allow traditional data mining algorithms proposed to solve the classical association rules mining problem to be applied on sensor based class of applications that generate and use sensor data. The generated rules will give a clear picture about the correlations between sensors in the network and can be used to make decisions about the network performance, or it can be used to predict the sources of future events. In order to prepare for the data needed in the mining process and to maximize the network lifetime, a distributed extraction methodology is introduced, in this distributed methodology sensors perform optimization based on local computation to decide whether it will participate in sending data or not. Experimental results have shown that the distributed extraction solution is able to reduce the number of exchanged messages and the data size by 50% compared to a direct transmission of the data.

The programming of lattice-based automata for real-world applications is cast as a data mining problem. Our approach to achieving this is to use evolutionary computing and reinforcement learning with performance fed back indicating the predictive accuracy of future behaviour of the given system. The purpose of this work is to develop an approach to learning automata rules that can achieve good performance using data from a variety of kinds of complex systems. Results indicate the approach is effective for both nearest neighbour and non-proximal cellular automata.

One task in SDM is the discovery of characterization and peculiarities of communities sharing socio-economic aspects in order to identify potentialities, needs and public intervention. Emerging patterns (EPs) are a special kind of pattern which contrast two classes. In this paper, we face the problem of extracting EPs from spatial data. At this aim, we resort to a multi-relational approach in order to deal with the degree of complexity of discovering EPs from spatial data (i.e., (i) the spatial dimension implicitly defines spatial properties and relations, (ii) spatial phenomena are affected by autocorrelation). Experiments on real datasets are described.	Univ Bari, Dipartimento Informat, I-70126 Bari, Italy	Ceci, M (reprint author), Univ Bari, Dipartimento Informat, Via Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy.

In these methods, a collection of prototypes has to be found that accurately represents the input patterns. The classifier then assigns classes based on the nearest prototype in this collection. In this paper we develop a new algorithm (called AMPSO), based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, that can be used to find those prototypes. Each particle in a swarm represents a single prototype in the solution; the swarm evolves using modified PSO equations with both particle competition and cooperation. Experimentation includes an artificial problem and six common application problems from the UCI data sets. The results show that the AMPSO algorithm is able to find solutions with a reduced number of prototypes that classify data with comparable or better accuracy than the 1-NN classifier. The algorithm can also be compared or improves the results of many classical algorithms in each of those problems; and the results show that AMPSO also performs significantly better than any tested algorithm in one of the problems.

Number of decision tree algorithms has been developed in the past. The SLIQ algorithm [ 2] was developed with an aim to reduce diversity of the decision tree at each split. However the number of split points which needs to be examined while building the decision tree becomes enormous as the SLIQ algorithm evaluates Gini Index at every successive midpoint of attribute values. The paper proposes a novel approach to tackle this problem by reducing the number of split points to a large extent in order to improve the performance of SLIQ algorithm. The improved performance is shown on large number of benchmark datasets taken from UCI machine learning repository.	[Chandra, B.; Varghese, P.

To learn a metric in the unsupervised setting, most metric learning algorithms project observed data to a low-dimensional manifold, where geometric relationships such as pairwise distances are preserved. It can be extended to the nonlinear case by applying the kernel trick, which embeds the data into a feature space by specifying the kernel function that computes the dot products between data points in the feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised Nonlinear Adaptive Metric Learning algorithm, called NAML, which performs clustering and distance metric learning simultaneously. NAML first maps the data to a high-dimensional space through a kernel function; then applies a linear projection to find a low-dimensional manifold where the separability of the data is maximized; and finally performs clustering in the low-dimensional space. The performance of NAML depends on the selection of the kernel function and the projection. We show that the joint kernel learning, dimensionality reduction, and clustering can be formulated as a trace maximization problem, which can be solved via an iterative procedure in the EM framework. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

With open source software an enterprise can easily initiate a data mining project using the most current technology. Often the software is available at no cost, allowing the enterprise to instead focus on ensuring their staff can freely learn the data mining techniques and methods. Open source ensures that staff can understand exactly how the algorithms work by examining the source codes, if they so desire, and can also fine tune the algorithms to suit the specific purposes of the enterprise. However, diversity, instability, scalability and poor documentation can be major concerns in using open source data mining systems. In this paper, we survey open source data mining systems currently available on the Internet. We compare 12 open source systems against several aspects such as general characteristics, data source accessibility, data mining functionality, and usability.

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a pre-specified number of clusters K, therefore the problem of determining '' the right number of clusters '' has attracted considerable interest. However, to the authors' knowledge, no experimental results of their comparison have been reported so far. This paper presents results of such a comparison involving eight selection options presenting four approaches. We generate data according to a Gaussian-mixture distribution with clusters' spread and spatial sizes variant. Most consistent results are shown by the least squares and least modules version of an intelligent version of the method, iK-Means by Mirkin [14]. However, the right K is reproduced best by the Hartigan's [5] method. This leads us to propose an adjusted iK-Means method, which performs well in the current experiment setting.

Kohonen self-organizing maps have been used successfully in the visualization and analysis of multidimensional data. In this work, a projection technique that compresses multidimensional datasets into two dimensional space using growing self-organizing maps is described. With this embedding scheme, traditional Kohonen visualization methods have been implemented using growing cell structures networks. New graphical map displays have been compared with Kohonen graphs using two groups of simulated data and one group of real multidimensional data selected from a satellite scene.

In general terms, cluster validity criteria can be classified in three categories: internal, external and relative. In this work we focus on the external criteria, which evaluate the results of a clustering algorithm based on a pre-specified structure S, that pertains to the data but which is independent of it. Usually S is a crisp partition (i.e. the data labels), and the most common approach for external validation of fuzzy partitions is to apply measures defined for crisp partitions to fuzzy partitions, using crisp partitions derived (hardened) from them. In this paper we discuss fuzzy generalizations of two well known crisp external measures, which are able to assess the quality of a partition U without the hardening of U. We also define a new external validity measure, that we call DNC index, useful for comparing a fuzzy U to a crisp S. Numerical examples based on four real world data sets are given, demonstrating the higher reliability of the DNC index.

In this paper, we propose a generic framework for mining and developing domain ontologies and apply it to mine brainwave (ERP) ontologies. The concepts and relationships in ERP ontologies can be mined according to the following steps: pattern decomposition, extraction of summary metrics for concept candidates, hierarchical clustering of patterns for classes and class taxonomies, and clustering-based classification and association rules mining for relationships (axioms) of concepts. We have applied this process to several dense-array (128-channel) ERP datasets. Results suggest good correspondence between mined concepts and rules, on the one hand, and patterns and rules that were independently formulated by domain experts, on the other. Data mining results also suggest ways in which expert-defined rules might be refined to improve ontology representation and classification results. The next goal of our ERP ontology mining framework is to address some long-standing challenges in conducting large-scale comparison and integration of results across ERP paradigms and laboratories. In a more general context, this work illustrates the promise of an interdisciplinary research program, which combines data mining, neuroinformatics and ontology engineering to address real-world problems.

In this paper we present a novel approach called PRISM, for mining frequent sequences. PRISM utilizes a vertical approach for enumeration and support counting, based on the novel notion of prime block encoding, which in turn is based on Prime factorization theory. Via an extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets, we show that PRISM outperforms popular sequence mining methods like SPADE [10], PrefixSpan [6] and SPAM [2], by an order of magnitude or more.

One apriori knowledge PCA based attack was recently investigated to show the vulnerabilities of this distance-preserving projected based perturbation approach when a sample dataset is available to attackers. As a result, non-distance-preserving projection was suggested to be applied since it is resilient to the PCA attack with the sacrifice of data mining accuracy to some extent. In this paper we investigate how to recover the original data from arbitrarily projected data and propose AKICA, an Independent Component Analysis based reconstruction method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that both distance-preserving and non-distance-preserving projection approaches are vulnerable to this attack. Our results offer insight into the vulnerabilities of projection based approach and suggest a careful scrutiny when it is applied in privacy-preserving data mining.

In this work we introduce a novel temporal abstraction method to this study by detecting and exploiting temporal patterns and relations between events in viral hepatitis such as "event A slightly happened before event B and B simultaneously ended with event C". We developed algorithms to first detect significant temporal patterns in temporal sequences and then to identify temporal relations between these temporal patterns. Many findings by data mining methods applied to transactions/graphs of temporal relations shown to be significant by physician evaluation and matching with published in Medline.

A direct measure for the efficacy of Bayesian network structures learned from data	Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 18-20, 2007	Leipzig, GERMANY				PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE; BELIEF NETWORKS	Current metrics for evaluating the performance of Bayesian network structure learning includes order statistics of the data likelihood of learned structures, the average data likelihood, and average convergence time. In this work, we define a new metric that directly measures a structure learning algorithm's ability to correctly model causal associations among variables in a data set. By treating membership in a Markov Blanket as a retrieval problem, we use ROC analysis to compute a structure learning algorithm's efficacy in capturing causal associations at varying strengths. Because our metric moves beyond error rate and data-likelihood with a measurement of stability, this is a better characterization of structure learning performance. Because the structure learning problem is NP-hard, practical algorithms are either heuristic or approximate. For this reason, an understanding of a structure learning algorithm's stability and boundary value conditions is necessary. We contribute to state of the art in the data-mining community with a new tool for understanding the behavior of structure learning techniques.

To meet the personalized needs of web based education; an improved association mining rule was proposed in the paper. First, data cube from database was established. Then, frequent item-set that satisfies the minimum support on data cube was mined out. Furthermore, association rules of frequent item-set were generated. Finally, redundant association rules through the relative method in statistics were wiped off. The algorithm had two advantages, and the first was that the execution time was short while searching for the frequent item-set; the second was that the precision of the rules was high. The algorithm was also used in personality mining system based on web based education model. The result manifested that the algorithm was effective.

And the segmentation is often used for the trend analysis. In this paper, a new stock time series segmentation algorithm is proposed based on PIP(Perceptually Important Point) approach. This proposed segmentation method contributes to containing both the important data points and the primitive trends like uptrend and downtrend, while most of the current algorithms only contain one aspect of that The proposed segmentation algorithm is proved to be more efficient and effective in reserving the trends and less complexity than those combined split-and-merge piecewise linear approximation segmentation algorithms.

It particularly focuses on a monitoring task that requires frequent computation of correlation matrices using lightweight on-board computing devices. It motivates this problem in the context of the MineFleet Real-Tine system and offers a randomized algorithm for fast monitoring of correlation (FMC), inner product, and Euclidean distance matrices among others. Unlike the existing approaches that compute all the entries of these matrices from a data set, the proposed technique works using a divide-and-conquer approach. This paper presents a probabilistic test for quickly detecting whether or not a subset of coefficients contains a significant one with a magnitude greater than a user given threshold. This test is used for quickly identifying the portions of the space that contain significant coefficients. The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for monitoring correlation and related matrices computed from continuous data streams.

A novel algorithm is presented for the extraction of this kind of patterns from a melody music object. The proposed algorithm discovers all maximum-length repeating patterns using an "aggressive" accession during searching, by avoiding costly repetition frequency calculation and by examining as few as possible repeating patterns in order to reach the maximum-length repeating pattern(s). Detailed experimental results illustrate the significant performance gains due to the proposed algorithm, compared to an existing baseline algorithm.

Time series discords are subsequences of longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. While discords have many uses for data mining, they are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. While the brute force algorithm to discover time series discords is quadratic in the length of the time series, we show a simple algorithm that is three to four orders of magnitude faster than brute force, while guaranteed to produce identical results. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse data sources including electrocardiograms, space telemetry, respiration physiology, anthropological and video datasets.

An inductive database is a concept of the next generation database in that the repository should contain not only persistent and derived data, but also the patterns of stored data in a unified format. Hence, the database management system should support both data processing and data mining tasks. Having provided with a tightly-coupling environment, users can then interact with the system to create, access, and modify data as well as to induce and query mining patterns. In this paper, we present a framework and techniques of query evaluation in such an environment so that the induced patterns can play a key role as semantic knowledge in the query rewriting and optimization process. Our knowledge induction approach is based on rough set theory. We present the knowledge induction algorithm driven by a user's query and explain the method through running examples. The advantages of the proposed techniques are confirmed with experimental results.

In data cleaning, outliers are identified for data noise reduction. In applications such as fraud detection, and stock market analysis, outliers suggest abnormal behavior requiring further investigation. Existing outlier detection methods have focused on class outliers and research on attribute outliers is limited, despite the equal role attribute outliers play in depreciating data quality and reducing data mining accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect attribute outliers from the deviating correlation behavior of attributes. We formulate three metrics to evaluate outlier-ness of attributes, and introduce an adaptive factor to distinguish outliers from non-outliers. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world data sets indicate that the proposed method is effective in detecting attribute outliers.

The motivation for this paper is based upon the fallibility of Hornbostel and Sachs generic classification scheme, used in Music Information Retrieval for instruments. In eliminating the redundancy and discrepancies of Hornbostel and Sachs' classification of musical sounds we present a procedure that draws categorization from numerical attributes, describing both time domain and spectrum of sound. Rather than using classification based directly on Hornbostel and Sachs scheme, we rely on the empirical data describing the log attack, sustainability and harmonicity. We propose a categorization system based upon the empirical musical parameters and then incorporating the resultant structure for classification rules.

Currently, the studies of AHP models usually evaluate the uncertainty problems based on fuzzy or interval number theory but the evaluation results can not provide complete decision information to the decision makers satisfactorily. Hierarchical Risk Element Transmission (HRET) theory is a new idea of the uncertain evaluation problems. This paper constructs a frame of HRET at first, fuzzy extended analytic hierarchy process (FEAHP) is used to decide the weight of HRET model, then the triangle fuzzy numbers which is used to solve HRET problems is acquired by the data mining technology based on history data. By doing this, the concluded results can provide more complete information to the decision makers with the consideration of the risk.

Thus, in this paper, to reduce the influences of the size of the predefined grids and the threshold of the significant cells, we adopt deflect and conquer techniques to propose a new grid-based clustering algorithm, which is called Adaptable Deflect and Conquer Clustering (ADCC) algorithm. The idea of ADCC is to utilize the predefined grids and predefined threshold to identify the significant cells, by which nearby cells that are also significant can be merged to develop a cluster in the first place. Next, the modified grids which are deflected to half size of the grid are used to identify the significant cells again. Finally, the new generated significant cells and the initial significant cells are merged so as to offset the round-off error and improve the precision of clustering task. And we verify by experiment that the performance of our new grid-based clustering algorithm, ADCC, is good.

This paper incorporates ensemble learning into BN structure learning algorithms and presents a novel ensemble BN structure learning approach. Based on the Markov condition and the faithfulness condition of BN structure learning, our ensemble approach proposes a novel sample decomposition technique and a components integration technique.

We apply a feature-based detection technique. These features are extracted using different statistical and behavioral analysis of emails sent over a certain period of time. The number of features thus extracted is too large. So, our goal is to select the best set of features that can efficiently distinguish between normal and viral emails using classification techniques. First, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the high dimensionality of data and to find a projected, optimal set of attributes. We observe that the application of PCA on a benchmark dataset improves the accuracy of detecting novel worms. Second, we apply J48 decision tree algorithm to determine the relative importance of features based on information gain. We are able to identify a subset of features, along with a set of classification rules that have a better performance in detecting novel worms than the original set of features or PCA-reduced features. Finally, we compare our results with published results and discuss our future plans to extend this work.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent, behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation system. To analyze amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the seperation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data. mining. lit the present study, we developed a scalable, data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent, evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters. we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that, MOCK, shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. in this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.

While traditional data mining tools make use of numerical data and cannot easily be applied to knowledge extracted from free text, traditional information extraction is either not adapted for the financial domain, or does not address the issue of information integration: the merging of information from different kinds of sources. We describe here the development of a system for content mining using domain ontologics, which enables the extraction of relevant information to be fed into models for analysis of financial and operational risk and other business intelligence applications such as company intelligence, by means of the XBRL standard. The results so far are of extremely high quality, due to the implementation of primarily high-precision rules.

We have proposed a CWW architecture for making subjective judgments, called a Perceptual Computer (Perm. Because words mean different things to different people, the Per-C uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs). The encoder of the Per-C transforms words, in an application-dependent word-codebook, into IT2 FSs. The central element of the Per-C is the CWW engine, which maps IT2 FSs to IT2 FSs. Several CWW engines have appeared in the literature, e.g., fuzzy IF-THEN rules to perform inference and/or reasoning based on Mamdani or TSK models, linguistic weighted averages (LWAs) to aggregate linguistic data, and linguistic summarization to perform human friendly data mining. In this paper a new CWW engine-Perceptual Reasoning (PR) - is proposed. It also uses fuzzy IF-THEN rules; however, unlike a traditional Mamdani or TSK model, in which fired rules are combined using the union, or addition, or during the defuzzification process, in PR a LWA is used to combine the fired rules. We prove that the output IT2 FSs of PR can only look like the IT2 FSs in the application codebook. This is very important for CWW, because the last component of the Per-C is a decoder which converts the CWW output IT2 FS back into a word, e.g. a word whose IT2 FS is most similar to it.

SMC is also called secure function evaluation, which is extensively studied in classical cryptography. SMC protocol allows n participants p(1),...p(n) to compute an n-input data through trusted third party (TTP) without revealing the information of the parties. All the parties may perform secure communication with TTP for computation. During the computation, TTP may undesirably extract data of all the parties for misuse. It may be risky if the data is sent out. To achieve security in SMC, numbers of solutions are available, but they use cryptography as secure communication between the parties and not for the computation. Basically cryptography is used for the secure communication but in our protocol, we use it for the secure communication as well as for computation. TTP computes entire encrypted data received by all the parties without being aware that the data is encrypted so that if data is disclosed by TTP to others even than no one can reveal the actual data of the party. In this protocol, we have tried to remove the concept of hiding the data using anonymizer. Our earlier protocol uses the anonymizer between parties and TTP to hide the identity of parties. Even after enforcing all these securities, the anonymizer can become malicious, causing leakage of data. To prevent this, we require some additional measures. Thus we propose a new cryptographic protocol that causes a secure communication between the parties and the TTP as well as perform secure computation using encryption. The protocol uses a polynomial to encrypt data by party itself before sending to TTP for computation. It also embeds some dummy data at random places. The purpose of dummy data is to check the honesty of TTP because result of dummy data is known to the party. All the data send to TTP is in the form of numbers as it is assumed that TTP performs only arithmetic computation to produce the result. After computation, TTP sends result to respective parties and each party will removes all dummies to get the actual result as well as check the honesty of TTP by dummies. If any other party wants to reveal the actual data then the probability of breaking the data will be of the order 1/m(n), which is quite high and cannot be done in a polynomial time. The security is the most important factor in SMC that is why this protocol meets our requirements. Only limitation of protocol is encryption time. By choosing proper polynomials and their constants, we can reduce the encryption time.

Embedded systems are increasingly used for sophisticated data mining algorithms to make intelligent decisions while storing and analyzing data. Since data mining applications are designed and implemented considering the resources available on a conventional computing platform, their performance degrades when executed on an embedded system. In this paper, we analyze the bottlenecks faced in implementing these algorithms in an embedded environment and explore their portability to the embedded systems domain. Particularly, we analyze the floating point computation in these applications and convert them into fixed point operations. Our results reveal that the execution time of five representative applications can be reduced by as much as 11.5x and 5.2x on average, without a significant impact on accuracy.

The proposed method conducts irregular sampling on the data preserving the subjectively noteworthy features using a user specified gradient. It also conducts irregular quantization, preserving the intrinsically objective characteristics of the data using statistical distributions. It then extracts representative patterns from the discretized data using group average clustering. Experimental results using benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method does not destroy the intrinsically objective features, since it has the same performance as the basic subsequence clustering using K-Means algorithm. Results using a dataset from a clinical hepatitis study indicate that it extracts interesting patterns for a medical expert.

In this paper, we propose a novel scale-space based boosting framework which applies scale-space theory for choosing the optimal regressors during the various iterations of the boosting algorithm. In other words, the data is considered at different resolutions for each iteration in the boosting algorithm. Our framework chooses the weak regressors for the boosting algorithm that can best fit the current resolution and as the iterations progress, the resolution of the data is increased. The amount of increase in the resolution follows from the wavelet decomposition methods. For regression modeling, we rise logitboost update equations based on first derivative of the loss function. We clearly manifest the advantages of using this scale-space based framework for regression problems and show results on different real-world regression datasets.

Instead, the feature space can be discretized and ansatz functions centered on grid points can be used. This allows for classification algorithms scaling only linearly in the number of training data points, enabling to learn from data sets with millions of data points. As the curse of dimensionality prohibits the use of standard grids, sparse grids have to be used. Adaptive sparse grids allow to get a trade-off between both worlds by refining in rough regions of the target function rather than in smooth ones. We present new results for some typical classification tasks and show first observations of dimension adaptivity. As the study of the critical parameters during development involves many computations for different parameter values, we used a grid environment which we present.

Hence, researchers have proposed to mine a more relaxed version of frequent patterns, where transactions are allowed to miss some items in the itemset they support. Patterns exhibiting such "faults" are called frequent fault-tolerant patterns (FFT-patterns) if they are significant in number In this paper the term "pattern" is distinguished from "item-set" as referring to a pair (tidset x itemset). Unlike classical frequent patterns, the number of FFT-patterns grows exponentially not only with the number of items, but also with the number of transactions. Since the latter may reach millions, mining FFT-patterns by enumerating them becomes infeasible. Hence, the challenge is to represent FFT-patterns concisely without losing any useful information. To address this, we draw on the observation that, in transactional databases, the transactions themselves are not important from the data mining point-of view; i.e. researchers are interested in finding item sets contained in lots of transactions, rather than in the transactions per se. Therefore, we propose to mine only the frequent item sets along with the statistical information of the supporting transaction sets, rather than enumerate entire FFT-patterns. Then we present our approach - the BIAS frame-work, consisting of Backtracking algorithm, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) constraints, and aggregation statistics to solve this problem. Algorithms under this framework not only increase the efficiency of the FFT-patterns mining process by more than an order of magnitude, but also provide a more comprehensive analysis of FFT-Patterns.

One is probability theory and the other is fuzzy set theory. One of the basic ideas of fuzzy set theory is how to define and interpret membership functions. In this paper, we will study tree-structured data mining model based on a new interpretation of fuzzy theory. In this new theory, fuzzy labels will be used for modelling. The membership function is interpreted as appropriateness degrees for using labels to describe a fuzzy concept. Each fuzzy concept is modelled by a distribution on the appropriate fuzzy label sets. Previous work has shown that the new model outperforms some well-known data mining models such as Naive Bayes and Decision trees. However, the fuzzy labels used in previous works were predefined. We are interested in study the influences on the performance by using fuzzy labels with different degrees of overlapping. We test a series of UCI datasets and the results show that the performance of the model increased almost monotonically with the increase of the overlapping between fuzzy labels. For this empirical study with the LDT model, we can conclude that more fuzziness implies better performance.

It is interesting to discover exceptions, as they challenge the existing knowledge and often lead to the growth of knowledge in new directions. Discovering exceptions from voluminous data sets still remains a great challenge. In Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), it is also significant to extract the knowledge in a form that is flexible and efficient enough for approximate reasoning. A Censored Production Rule (CPR) is a special kind of knowledge structure that is represented as an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to rule. If P Then D part of CPR holds frequently while Unless C part holds rarely. Discovery of CPRs not only provides a computational mechanism to exhibit variable precision logic but also results in the discovery of a set of rules of considerably reduced size. In this paper, a Parallel Genetic Algorithm approach is suggested for automated discovery of Censored Production Rules. The parallel Genetic Algorithm involves both data and control parallelism. A fitness function that incorporates the constraints of CPRs, is proposed. The experimental results establish the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

While Data Analysis (DA) represents a significant advance in the type of analytical tools currently available, there are limitations to its capability. In order to address one of the limitations on the DA capabilities of identifying a causal relationship, we propose an integrated approach, called robust data mining (RDM), which can reduce dimensionality of the large data set, may provide detailed statistical relationships among the factors and robust factor settings. The primary objective of this paper is twofold. First, we show how DM techniques can be effectively applied into a wastewater treatment process design by applying a correlation-based feature selection (CBFS) method. This method may be far more effective than any other methods when a large number of input factors are considered on a process design procedure. Second, we then show how DM results can be integrated into a robust design (RD) paradigm based on the selected significant factors. Our numerical example clearly shows that the proposed RDM method can efficiently find significant factors and the optimal settings by reducing dimensionality.

However, since it still suffers from detecting an unknown attack, i.e., 0-day attack, the ultimate challenge in intrusion detection field is how we can exactly identify such an attack. This paper presents a novel approach that is quite different from the traditional detection models based on raw traffic data. The proposed method can extract unknown activities from IDS alerts by applying data mining technique. We evaluated our method over the log data of IDS that is deployed in Kyoto University, and our experimental results show that it can extract unknown(or under development) attacks from IDS alerts by assigning a score to them that reflects how anomalous they are; and visualizing the scored alerts.

The locusts either performed jumps or did not jump in response to visual looming stimuli. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) was employed to sort spike trains into the correct behavioural categories by optimising threshold parameters, so jump behaviour occurred if the spike-train data exceeded the threshold parameters from the EA.

In the conventional spatial clustering methods, data points are clustered mainly according to their geographic attributes. In real applications, however, the obtained data points consist of not only geographic attributes but also non-geographic ones. In general, geographic attributes indicate the data locations and non-geographic attributes show the characteristics of data points. It is thus infeasible, by using conventional spatial clustering methods, to partition the geographic space such that similar data points are grouped together. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient algorithm, named incremental clustering toward the Bound INformation of Geography and Optimization spaces, abbreviated as BINGO, to solve the problem. The proposed BINGO algorithm combines the information in both geographic and non-geographic attributes by constructing a summary structure and possesses incremental clustering capability by appropriately adjusting this structure. Furthermore, most parameters in algorithm BINGO are determined automatically so that it is easy to be applied to applications without resorting to extra knowledge. Experiments on synthetic are performed to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of algorithm BINGO.

The management of a generic image database is pursued using a standard psychophysical experimental procedure followed by a well-suited data analysis methodology that is based on simple geometrical concepts. The end result is a cognitive discriminative biplot, which is a visualization of the intrinsic organization of the image database best reflecting the user's perception. The discriminating power of the introduced cognitive biplot constitutes an appealing tool for image retrieval and a flexible interface for visual data mining tasks. These ideas were evaluated in two ways. First, the separability of semantically distinct image classes was measured according to their reduced representations on the biplot. Then, a nearest-neighbor retrieval scheme was run on the emerged low-dimensional terrain to measure the suitability of the biplot for performing content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The achieved organization performance when compared with the performance of a contemporary system was found superior. This promoted the further discussion of packing these ideas into a realizable algorithmic procedure for an efficient and effective personalized CBIR system.

It currently handles log data from 6 full-year tutoring systems and dozens of smaller, experimental tutoring systems. DataShop requires a representation of log data that supports a variety of tutoring systems, atheoretical analyses and theoretical analyses. The theorybased analyses are strongly related to student modeling, so the lessons learned in developing the DataShop's representation may apply to student modeling in general. This report discusses the representation originally used by the DataShop, the problems encountered, and how the key concept of "step" evolved to meet these challenges.

Classification Association Rule Mining (CARM) is a recent Classification Rule Mining (CRM) approach that builds an Association Rule Mining (ARM) based classifier using CARs. Regardless of which particular methodology is used to build it, a classifier is usually presented as an ordered CAR list, based on an applied rule ordering strategy. Five existing rule ordering mechanisms can be identified: (1) Confidence-Support-size -of-Antecedent (CSA), (2) size-of-Antecedent-Confidence-Support (ACS), (3) Weighted Relative Accuracy (WRA), (4) Laplace Accuracy, and (5) chi(2) Testing. In this paper, we divide the above mechanisms into two groups: (i) pure "support-confidence" framework like, and (ii) additive score assigning like. We consequently propose a hybrid rule ordering approach by combining one approach taken from (i) and another approach taken from (ii). The experimental results show that the proposed rule ordering approach performs well with respect to the accuracy of classification.

Frequent pattern is crucial for association rules generation, time series analysis, classification, etc. There are two categories of algorithms that had been proposed, candidate set generate-and-test approach (Apriori-like) and Pattern growth approach. Many methods had been proposed to solve the association rules mining problem based on FP-tree instead of Apriori-like, since apriori-like algorithm scans the database many times. However, the computation time is costly when the database size is large with FP-tree data structure. Parallel and distributed computing is a good strategy to solve this circumstance. Some parallel algorithms had been proposed, however, most of them did not consider the load balancing issue. In this paper, we proposed a parallel and distributed mining algorithm based on FP-tree structure, Load Balancing FP-Tree (LFP-tree). The algorithm divides the item set for mining by evaluating the tree's width and depth. Moreover, a simple and trusty calculate formulation for loading degree is proposed. The experimental results show that LFP-tree can reduce the computation time and has less idle time compared with Parallel FP-Tree (PFP-tree). In addition, it has better speed-up ratio than PFP-tree when number of processors grow. The communication time can be reduced by preserving the heavy loading items in their local computing node.

Instead of performing exhaustive search on all possible candidates of such spatial patterns at various locations and scales, this paper presents a novel and very efficient algorithm for discovering common visual patterns by designing a provably correct and computationally efficient pruning procedure that has a quadratic complexity. This new approach is able to efficiently search a set of images for unknown visual patterns that exhibit large appearance variations because of rotation, scale changes, slight view changes, color variations and partial occlusions.

In this paper, a new Multi-Criteria Quadratic-Programming Linear Classification (MQLC) model is proposed and tested with VIP E-Mail dataset. This experimental study uses a variance of K-fold Cross-Validation to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the model. Finally, we compare our model with the decision tree by using commercial software C5.0. The result indicates that the proposed MQLC model performs better than decision tree on small samples.

This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, e.g., "home", "work" or "Northwest Health Club". It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places because GPS tracks are continuous data both spatially and temporally, while most existing data mining techniques expect discrete data. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, they all have limitations. Our work proposes a two-step approach that discretized continuous GPS data into places and learns important places from the place features. Our approach was validated using real user data and shown to have good accuracy when applied in predicting not only important and frequent places, but also important and not so frequent places.

However, many developed CAD software have no features to integrate its results with a picture archive and communication system (PACS). This obstacle hinders the extensive use of independent CAD results within a more streamlined diagnosis workflow. In this paper, we demonstrate a universal PACS-CAD toolkit that can seamlessly integrate independent CAD results with a clinical PACS. The PACS-CAD toolkit consisted of two versions, a DICOM Secondary Capture (DICOM-SC) version and a DICONI-IHE version to accommodate various PACS. The DICOM-SC version toolkit installed on a CAD workstation converts the screen shot of CAD results to a DICOM image file for storing in a PACS server and displaying on PACS workstations. The DICONI-IHE version toolkit follows DICOM and IHE standards using DICOM Structured Report and Post-Processing Workflow Profiles; thus, results from various CAD software can be integrated into diagnosis workflow of a PACS having DICOM and IHE-compliance and, most importantly, these quantified CAD results can be directly queried for and retrieved from within PACS for future data mining applications. The successful implementation of this toolkit can greatly ease the extensive use of various CAD results in the clinical diagnosis workflow.

Many researchers proposed methods to resolve this problem, such as FSG, gSpan, and CloseGraph. But we discovered that the result set generated by these methods contains many repetitive structures. In this article, we propose a new method called Frequent Structure Mining Algorithm ( FSMA) to find frequent structure in graph database, and prove corresponding theoretics to guarantee the accuracy of FSMA. The power of FSMA comes from the resolution of finding different structures and the storage of the graph set; it guarantees the completeness of mining results.

This method translates a data layer into a space filling layer where shaped clusters are identified as the resulting regions. The method is based on robustly identifying cluster boundaries in point data using the Delaunay Diagram. The method can then be applied to modelling point data, to displaying choropleth maps of point data without a reference map, to identifying association rules in the spatial dimension for geographical data mining, or to measuring a gap between clusters for cluster validity.

In addition, these algebraic expressions tend to be highly complex. By adding a simple extension to the GP technique, a powerful design data analysis tool is developed. This paper significantly extends the analysis capabilities of GP by searching for multiple simple models within a single population by splitting the population into multiple islands according to the design variables used by individual members. Where members from different islands "cooperate," simple design models can be extracted from this cooperation. This relatively simple extension to GP is shown to have powerful implications to extracting design models that can be readily interpreted and exploited by human designers. The full analysis method, GP heuristics extraction method, is described and illustrated by means of a design case study.

J	Lin, FR; Huang, KJ; Chen, NS				Lin, Fu-ren; Huang, Kuen-jin; Chen, Nian-shing			Integrating information retrieval and data mining to discover project team coordination patterns	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						information retrieval; data mining; sequential pattern analysis; coordination pattern		This study integrates information retrieval and data mining techniques to discover project team coordination patterns from project documents written in Chinese. The coordination pattern of a project team describes the project execution process, including task category, execution sequence and duration, as well as the team member cooperation. The integration comprises two phases. The first phase extracts the most relevant keywords describing tasks executed by projects from unstructured or semi-structured documents using the mutual information estimate and the term weighting system. A concept hierarchy tree generated using the hierarchical clustering technique represents multiple levels of task categories. The second phase discovers project team coordination patterns through sequential pattern analysis. The proposed approach obtains encouraging results by mining coordination patterns from information system development projects. In the present era of the knowledge economy, the application of groupware to facilitate team coordination and collaboration streamlines the collection and analysis of project documents throughout the project life cycle. A project manager can visualize the project execution process of a team, and can anticipate the project outcomes based on discovered team coordination patterns. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be adapted to team projects that share certain characteristics with information system development projects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, Estan et A advanced a comprehensive data mining structure tailored for networking data-a parsimonious, multidimensional flow hierarchy, along with an algorithm for its construction. While they primarily targeted offline auditing, use in interactive traffic visualization and anomaly/attack detection will require real-time data mining. We suggest several improvements to Estan et al.'s algorithm that substantially reduce the computational complexity of multidimensional flow mining. We also propose computational and memory-efficient approaches for unidimensional clustering of the IF address spaces. For baseline implementations, evaluated on the New Zealand (NZIX) trace data, our method reduced CPU execution times of the Estan et al. method by a factor of more than eight. We also develop a methodology for anomaly/attack detection based on flow mining, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach on traces from the Slammer and Code Red worms and the MIT Lincoln Laboratories DDoS data.

J	Hahsler, M				Hahsler, Michael			A model-based frequency constraint for mining associations from transaction data	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; associations; interest measures; mixture models; transaction data	RULES; DATABASES	Mining frequent itemsets is a popular method for finding associated items in databases. For this method, support, the co-occurrence frequency of the items which form an association, is used as the primary indicator of the associations's significance. A single, user-specified support threshold is used to decided if associations should be further investigated. Support has some known problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces misleading associations. In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an alternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint utilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a simple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction data's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified precision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency thresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the notion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all NB-frequent itemsets in a database. In experiments with publicly available transaction databases we show that the new constraint provides improvements over a single minimum support threshold and that the precision threshold is more robust and easier to set and interpret by the user.

The subsets, also called blocks, have the same size and are scheduled according to some fixed and cyclic calendar of b steps. During the ith step, block Bi is selected. Each component takes a copy of its local state and sends it to one of the components in Bi, in such a way that each component stores ( approximately) the same number of local states. Afterward, if a component of Bi crashes, all of its stored data is lost and the computation cannot continue. If there exists a block with no failed components in it, then a recent global state can be retrieved and the computation does not need to start over from the very beginning. The goal is to design storage schemes that tolerate as many crashes as possible, while trying to have each component participating in as few blocks as possible and, at the same time, working with large blocks ( so that a component in a block stores a small number of local states). In this paper, several such schemes are described and compared in terms of these measures.

In this work we present another difficult task: learning, from large numbers of complex performances by concert pianists, to play music expressively. We model the problem as a multi-level decomposition and prediction task. We show that this is a fundamentally relational learning problem and propose a new similarity measure for structured objects, which is built into a relational instance-based learning algorithm named DISTALL. Experiments with data derived from a substantial number of Mozart piano sonata recordings by a skilled concert pianist demonstrate that the approach is viable. We show that the instance-based learner operating on structured, relational data outperforms a propositional k-NN algorithm. In qualitative terms, some of the piano performances produced by DISTALL after learning from the human artist are of substantial musical quality; one even won a prize in an international 'computer music performance' contest.

Experimental data obtained from reactions which involve known concentrations of two or more components are used to calibrate a model that, later, will be used to predict the (unknown) concentrations of those components in a new reaction. This problem can be seen as a selection + prediction one, where the goal is to obtain good values for the variables to predict while minimizing the number of the input variables needed, taking a small subset of really significant ones. Initial approaches to the problem were principal components analysis and filtering combined with two prediction techniques: artificial neural networks and partial least squares regression. Finally, a parallel estimation of distribution algorithm was used to reduce the number of variables to be used for prediction, yielding the best models for all the considered problems.

ResourceLog: An embeddable tool for dynamically monitoring the usage of web-based bioscience resources	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							HEALTH-SCIENCES LIBRARY; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; 2-TIERED MODEL; WEBSITE; STATISTICS; BEHAVIOR; USERS	The present study described an open source application, ResourceLog, that allows website administrators to record and analyze the usage of online resources. The application includes four components: logging, data mining, administrative interface, and back-end database. The logging component is embedded in the host website. It extracts and streamlines information about the Web visitors, the scripts, and dynamic parameters from each page request. The data mining component runs as a set of scheduled tasks that identify visitors of interest, such as those who have heavily used the resources. The identified visitors will be automatically subjected to a voluntary user survey. The usage of the website content can be monitored through the administrative interface and subjected to statistical analyses. As a pilot project, ResourceLog has been implemented in SenseLab, a Web-based neuroscience database system. ResourceLog provides a robust and useful tool to aid system evaluation of a resource-driven Web application, with a focus on determining the effectiveness of data sharing in the field and with the general public.

Our scenario is an important special case of some general probabilistic logic problems that are known to be intractable. We show that despite the limitations our problems are also intractable, namely, we show that checking whether the maximal consistent frequency of a query is larger than a given threshold is NP-complete and that evaluating the Maximum Entropy estimate of a query is PP-hard. We also prove that checking consistency is NP-complete. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Panda, N; Chang, EY				Panda, N; Chang, EY			KDX: An indexer for support vector machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						support vector machine; indexing; top-k retrieval	CLASSIFICATION	Support Vector Machines ( SVMs) have been adopted by many data mining and information-retrieval applications for learning a mining or query concept, and then retrieving the "top-k" best matches to the concept. However, when the data set is large, naively scanning the entire data set to find the top matches is not scalable. In this work, we propose a kernel indexing strategy to substantially prune the search space and, thus, improve the performance of top-k queries. Our kernel indexer (KDX) takes advantage of the underlying geometric properties and quickly converges on an approximate set of top-k instances of interest. More importantly, once the kernel ( e. g., Gaussian kernel) has been selected and the indexer has been constructed, the indexer can work with different kernel-parameter settings ( e. g., gamma and sigma) without performance compromise. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies on a wide variety of data sets, we demonstrate KDX to be very effective. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the 2005 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining [ 24]. This version differs from the previous submission in providing a detailed cost analysis under different scenarios, specifically designed to meet the varying needs of accuracy, speed, and space requirements, developing an approach for insertion and deletion of instances, presenting the specific computations as well as the geometric properties used in performing the same, and providing detailed algorithms for each of the operations necessary to create and use the index structure.

J	Yan, J; Liu, N; Yang, Q; Zhang, B; Cheng, QS; Chen, Z				Yan, J; Liu, N; Yang, Q; Zhang, B; Cheng, QS; Chen, Z			Mining adaptive ratio rules from distributed data sources	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						multiple source data mining; data stream mining; ratio rule; robust statistics; eigen system analysis	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS	Different from traditional association-rule mining, a new paradigm called Ratio Rule (RR) was proposed recently. Ratio rules are aimed at capturing the quantitative association knowledge, We extend this framework to mining ratio rules from distributed and dynamic data sources. This is a novel and challenging problem. The traditional techniques used for ratio rule mining is an eigen-system analysis which can often fall victim to noise. This has limited the application of ratio rule mining greatly. The distributed data sources impose additional constraints for the mining procedure to be robust in the presence of noise, because it is difficult to clean all the data sources in real time in real-world tasks. In addition, the traditional batch methods for ratio rule mining cannot cope with dynamic data. In this paper, we propose an integrated method to mining ratio rules from distributed and changing data sources, by first mining the ratio rules from each data source separately through a novel robust and adaptive one-pass algorithm (which is called Robust and Adaptive Ratio Rule (RARR)), and then integrating the rules of each data source in a simple probabilistic model. In this way, we can acquire the global rules from all the local information sources adaptively. We show that the RARR technique can converge to a fixed point and is robust as well. Moreover, the integration of rules is efficient and effective. Both theoretical analysis and experiments illustrate that the performance of RARR and the proposed information integration procedure is satisfactory for the purpose of discovering latent associations in distributed dynamic data source.

J	Yun, CH; Chuang, KT; Chen, MS				Yun, CH; Chuang, KT; Chen, MS			Adherence clustering: an efficient method for mining market-basket clusters	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; clustering market-basket data; category-based adherence; k-todes	K-MEANS ALGORITHM	We explore in this paper the efficient clustering of market-basket data. Different from those of the traditional data, the features of market-basket data are known to be of high dimensionality and sparsity. Without explicitly considering the presence of the taxonomy, most prior efforts on clustering market-basket data can be viewed as dealing with items in the leaf level of the taxonomy tree. Clustering transactions across different levels of the taxonomy is of great importance for marketing strategies as well as for the result representation of the clustering techniques for market-basket data. In view of the features of market-basket data, we devise in this paper a novel measurement, called the category-based adherence, and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering. With this category-based adherence measurement, we develop an efficient clustering algorithm, called algorithm k-todes, for market-basket data with the objective to minimize the category-based adherence. The distance of an item to a given cluster is defined as the number of links between this item and its nearest tode. The category-based adherence of a transaction to a cluster is then defined as the average distance of the items in this transaction to that cluster. A validation model based on information gain is also devised to assess the quality of clustering for market-basket data. As validated by both real and synthetic datasets, it is shown by our experimental results, with the taxonomy information, algorithm k-todes devised in this paper significantly outperforms the prior works in both the execution efficiency and the clustering quality as measured by information gain, indicating the usefulness of category-based adherence in market-basket data clustering.

It is vital that a software repository should be well-organized and provide efficient tools for developers to locate reusable components that meet their requirements. The growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM), an unsupervised learning neural network, is a powerful data mining technique for the clustering and visualization of large and complex data sets. The resulting maps, serving as retrieval interfaces, can be beneficial to developers in obtaining better insight into the structure of a software repository and increasing their understanding of the relationships among software components. The GHSOM, which is an improvement over the basic self-organizing map (SOM), can adapt its architecture during its learning process and expose the hierarchical structure that exists in the original data. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of the GHSOM for the organization and visualization of a collection of reusable components stored in a software repository, and compare the results with the ones obtained by using the traditional SOM.

A process of knowledge discovery consists of two steps, the data mining step and the evaluation step. In this paper, evaluating and ranking the interestingness of summaries generated from databases, which is a part of the second step, is studied using diversity measures. Sixteen previously analyzed diversity measures of interestingness are used along with three not previously considered ones, brought from different well-known areas. The latter three measures are evaluated theoretically according to five principles that a measure must satisfy to be qualified acceptable for ranking summaries. A theoretical correlation study between the eight measures that satisfy all five principles is presented based on mathematical proofs. An empirical evaluation is conducted using three real databases. Then, a classification of the eight measures is deduced. The resulting classification is used to reduce the number of measures to only two, which are the best over all criteria, and that produce non-similar results. This helps the user interpret the most important discovered knowledge in his decision making process.

This requires not only an understanding of the genetic basis of the disease, based on the patient's tumor gene expression profiles but also the correlation of this data with knowledge normally processed in the clinical setting. In this paper, we present the Mediator component of the PrognoChip Integrated Clinico-Genomics Environment (ICGE), through which the integration of the clinical and genomic information subsystems is achieved. The biomedical investigator can form clinico-genomic queries through the web-based graphical user interface of the Mediator. This is split into several query forms, allowing cancerous sample selection (along with their associated gene expression profiles and patient characteristics), based on criteria of interest. After a query is formed, the Mediator translates it into an equivalent set of local subqueries, which are executed directly against the constituent databases. Then, results are combined for presentation to the user and/or transmission to the Data Mining tools for analysis.

GARC: A new associative classification approach	DATA WAREHOUSING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2006)	SEP 04-08, 2006	Cracow, POLAND			associative classification; generic basis; classification rules; generic association rules; classifier	RULES	Many studies in data mining have proposed a new classification approach called associative classification. According to several reports associative classification achieves higher classification accuracy than do traditional classification approaches. However, the associative classification suffers from a major drawback: it is based on the use of a very large number of classification rules; and consequently takes efforts to select the best ones in order to construct the classifier. To overcome such drawback, we propose a new associative classification method called GARC that exploits a generic basis of association rules in order to reduce the number of association rules without jeopardizing the classification accuracy. Moreover, GARC proposes a new selection criterion called score, allowing to ameliorate the selection of the best rules during classification. Carried out experiments on 12 benchmark data sets indicate that GARC is highly competitive in terms of accuracy in comparison with popular associative classification methods.

A new ant colony algorithm for multi-label classification with application in bioinformatics	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		ant colony optimization; data mining; bioinformatics	ARGENTINE ANT; OPTIMIZATION	The conventional classification task of data mining can be called single-label classification, since there is a single class attribute to be predicted. This paper addresses a more challenging version of the classification task, where there are two or more class attributes to be predicted. We propose a new ant colony algorithm for the multilabel classification task. The new algorithm, called MuLAM (MultiLabel Ant-Miner) is a major extension of Ant-Miner, the first ant colony algorithm for discovering classification rules. We report results comparing the. performance of MuLAM with the performance of three other classification techniques, namely the very simple majority classifier, the original Ant-Miner algorithm and C5.0, a very popular rule induction algorithm. The experiments were performed using five bioinformatics datasets, involving the prediction of several kinds of protein function.

By not enforcing strict rules on the network's topology or content location, such networks can be created quickly and easily. Unfortunately, because of the unstructured nature of these networks, in order to find content, query messages are flooded to nodes in the network, which results in a large amount of traffic. This work borrows the technique of association analysis from the data mining community and extends it to intelligently forward queries through the network. Because only a small subset of a node's neighbors are forwarded queries, the number of times those queries are propagated is also reduced, which results in considerably less network traffic. These savings enable the networks to scale to much larger sizes, which allows for more content to be shared and more redundancy to be added to the system, as well as allowing more users to take advantage of such networks.

In this study we propose a framework to visualize the association mining results, specifically frequent itemsets and association rules, as graphs. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our approach through a Market Basket Analysis (MBA) case study where we visually explore the data mining results for a supermarket data set. In this case study we derive several interesting insights regarding the relationships among the items and suggest how they can be used as basis for decision making in retailing.

Recent years have witnessed many efforts on discovering fuzzy associations. The key strength of fuzzy association rule mining is its completeness. This strength, however, comes with a major drawback. It often produces a huge number of fuzzy associations. This is particularly true for datasets whose attributes are highly correlated. The huge number of fuzzy associations makes it very difficult for a human user to analyze them. Existing research has shown that most of the discovered rules are actually redundant or insignificant. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to overcome this problem. The approach is effective because experiment results show that the set of produced rules is typically very small. Our solution also reduces the size of average transactions and dataset. Our performance study shows that this solution has a superior performance over the other algorithms.

Its principle is a recursive partitioning based on successive bits or digits of data items. Under various guises, it has then surfaced in the management of very large data bases, in the design of efficient communication protocols, in quantitative data mining, in the leader election problem of distributed computing, in data compression, as well as in some corners of computational geometry. The algorithms are invariably very simple, easy to implement, and in a number of cases surprisingly efficient. The corresponding quantitative analyses pose challenging mathematical problems and have triggered a flurry of research works. Generating functions and symbolic methods, singularity analysis, the saddle-point method, transfer operators of dynamical systems theory, and the Mellin transform have all been found to have a bearing on the probabilistic behaviour of trie algorithms. We offer here a perspective on the rich algorithmic, analytic, and probabilistic aspects of tries, culminating with a connection between a sorting problem and the Riemann hypothesis.

The k-anonymity model guarantees that no private information in a table can be linked to a group of less than k individuals. We suggest extended definitions of k-anonymity that allow the k-anonymity of a data mining model to be determined. Using these definitions, we present decision tree induction algorithms that are guaranteed to maintain k-anonymity of the learning examples. Experiments show that embedding anonymization within the decision tree induction process provides better accuracy than anonymizing the data first and inducing the tree later.

It complements predictive data mining methods and methods for outlier detection, which assume the independence between the attributes and the independence between the values of these attributes. Many problems, however, especially phenomena of a more complex nature, are not well suited for these methods. For example, in the analysis of transaction data there are no known suspicious transactions. This paper presents a human-centred methodology and supporting techniques that address the issues of depicting implicit relationships between data attributes and/or specific values of these attributes. The methodology and corresponding techniques are illustrated on a case study from the area of security.

Knowledge is ideally represented as human-comprehensible patterns from which end-users can gain intuitions and insights. Yet not all data mining methods produce such readily understandable knowledge, e.g., most clustering algorithms output sets of points as clusters. In this paper we perform a systematic study of cluster description that generates interpretable patterns from clusters. We introduce and analyze novel description formats leading to more expressive power, motivate and define novel description problems specifying different trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy. We also present effective heuristic algorithms together with their empirical evaluations.

However, only few efforts have been made to extract this kind of patterns in a textual database. Due to its broad applications in text mining problems, finding these textual patterns is important because they can be extracted from text independently of the language. Also, they are human readable patterns or descriptors of the text, which do not lose the sequential order of the words in the document. But the problem of discovering sequential patterns in a database of documents presents special characteristics which make it intractable for most of the apriori-like candidate-generation-and-test approaches. Recent studies indicate that the pattern-growth methodology could speed up the sequential pattern mining. In this paper we propose a pattern-growth based algorithm (DIMASP) to discover all the maximal sequential patterns in a document database. Furthermore, DIMASP is incremental and independent of the support threshold. Finally, we compare the performance of DIMASP against GSP, DELISP, GenPrefixSpan and cSPADE algorithms.

Our next basic assumption is that some of the missing attribute values are lost (e.g., erased) and some are "do not care" conditions (i.e., they were redundant or not necessary to make a decision or to classify a, case). Incompletely specified decision tables axe described by characteristic relations, which for completely specified decision tables are reduced to the indiscernibility relation. It is shown how to compute characteristic relation using an idea of block of attribute-value pairs, used in some rule induction algorithms, such as LEM2. Moreover, the set. of all characteristic relations for a class of congruent incompletely specified decision tables, defined in the paper, is a lattice. Three definitions of lower and upper approximations are introduced. Finally, it; is shown that the presented approach to missing attribute values may be used for other kind of missing attribute values than lost values and "do not; care" conditions.

In this paper, we address one of the sub-tasks in record linkage, i.e., the problem of assigning record pairs with an appropriate matching status. Techniques for solving this problem are referred to as decision models. Most existing decision models rely on good training data, which is, however, not commonly available in real-world applications. Decision models based on unsupervised machine learning techniques have recently been proposed. In this paper, we review several existing decision models and then propose an enhancement to cluster-based decision models. Experimental results show that our proposed decision model achieves the same accuracy of existing models while significantly reducing the number of record pairs required for manual review. The proposed model also provides a mechanism to trade off the accuracy with the number of record pairs required for clerical review.

Similarly, health service providers, security services, transport planners, and education authorities need to know a great deal about their clients. And, of course, commercial operations run more efficiently and can meet the needs of their customers more effectively the more they know about them. In general then, the more data these organisation have, the better. On the other hand, the more private data which is collated and disseminated, the more individuals are at risk of crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, not to mention the simple invasion of privacy that such data collection represents. Most work in data mining has concentrated on the positive aspects of extracting useful information from large data sets, But as the technology and its use advances so more awareness of the potential downside is needed. In this paper I look at some of these issues. I examine how data mining tools and techniques are being used by governments and commercial operations to gain insight into individual behaviour. And I look at the concerns that such advances are bringing.

Simulations reveal optimal network settings. Optimality of discovered ANN topologies' is explained through their links with the ARMA processes, thus presenting identified structures as nonlinear generalizations of such processes. Optimal settings examination demonstrates the weak relationships between statistical and economic criteria. The research demonstrates that fine-tuning ANN settings is an important stage in the computational model set-up for results' improvement and mechanism understanding. Genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to be used for model discovery, making technical decisions less arbitrary and adding additional explanatory power to the analysis of economic systems with Cl. The paper is a step towards the econometric foundation of Cl in finance. The choice of evaluation criteria combining statistical and economic qualities is viewed as essential for an adequate analysis of economic systems.

Possible links between government corruption and terrorism have attracted an increasing interest in this research field. Most of the existing literature discusses the topic from a socio-economical perspective and only few studies tackle this research field from a data mining point of view. In this paper, we apply data mining techniques onto a cross-country database linking macro-economical variables to perceived levels of corruption. In the first part, self organizing maps are applied to study the interconnections between these variables. Afterwards, support vector machines are trained on part of the data and used to forecast corruption for other countries. Large deviations for specific countries between these models' predictions and the actual values can prove useful for further research. Finally, projection of the forecasts onto a self organizing map allows a detailed comparison between the different models' behavior.

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that uses genetic algorithms to mine a set of temporal behavior data output by a biological system in order to determine the kinetic parameters of the system. Analyzing the behavior of a biological network is a complicated task. In our approach, the machine leaming method is integrated with the framework of system dynamics so that its findings are expressed in a form of system dynamics model. An application of the method to the cell division cycle model has shown that the method can discover approximate parametric values of the system and reproduce the input behavior.

Mining outliers in spatial networks	DATABASE SYSTEMS FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications	APR 12-15, 2006	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Natl Univ Singapore, Nanyang Technol Univ				Outlier analysis is an important task in data mining and has attracted much attention in both research and applications. Previous work on outlier detection involves different types of databases such as spatial databases, time series databases, biomedical databases, etc. However, few of the existing studies have considered spatial networks where points reside on every edge. In this paper, we study the interesting problem of distance-based outliers in spatial networks. We propose an efficient mining method which partitions each edge of a spatial network into a set of length d segments, then quickly identifies the outliers in the remaining edges after pruning those unnecessary edges which cannot contain outliers. We also present algorithms that can be applied when the spatial network is updating points or the input parameters of outlier measures are changed. The experimental results verify the scalability and efficiency of our proposed methods.

The process present a multi-strategy mining approach realized by the smooth integration of three distinct data-mining components: clustering (based on a discretized k-means approach), association rules mining, and feature-selection for selecting discrimant genes. The proposed CGKD process is applied on a real-world gene-expression profiling study (i.e., clinical outcome of breast cancer patients). Assessment of the results demonstrates the rationality and reliability of the approach.

Data mining offers tools for quick discovery of relationships, patterns and knowledge in large databases. Growing self-organizing map (GSOM) is established as an efficient unsupervised data-mining algorithm. In this study some modifications to the original GSOM are proposed for manufacturing yield improvement by clustering. These modifications include introduction of a clustering quality measure to evaluate the performance of the programme in separating good and faulty products and a filtering index to reduce noise from the dataset. Results show that the proposed method is able to effectively differentiate good and faulty products. It will help engineers construct the knowledge base to predict product quality automatically from collected data and provide insights for yield improvement.

To find such rules using approaches like the Apriori algorithm, minimum support must be set very low, which results in a large amount of redundant rules. We are interested in sporadic rules; i.e. those that fall below a maximum support level but above the level of support expected from random coincidence. In this paper we introduce an algorithm called MIISR to find a particular type of sporadic rule efficiently: where the support of the antecedent as a whole falls below maximum support, but where items may have quite high support individually. Our proposed method uses item constraints and coincidence pruning to discover these rules in reasonable time.

Created by R. Brunet, chorems are a schematic representation of a territory. Presently, geographic decision-makers are not totally satisfied by conventional cartography, essentially because they want to know where and what are the problems. And so chorems appear as an interesting approach to unveil geographic problems, and so to help decision makers understand their territory, their structure and their evolution. After having given the definition and presented some applications of chorems, we show how chorems can be discovered by spatial data mining, can help decision making, and also how chorem maps can be a novel approach to visually entry a geographic database or datawarehouse. Comparing with the Ben Shneiderman's approach, chorems can give an overview of the territory; then by zooming and filtering, and sub-chorem maps can be generated for smaller territories. Finally a list of barriers to overcome is given as main landmarks for a new research program in order to design new kind of geographic information systems or spatial decision support systems.

Adding this function to location-based services provides necessary information to the user within the location to be aware of the user's position. But some LBS have insufficiencies of providing relevant information to the mobile subscriber. In this research, we proposed a location-aware agent that interacts with the LBS and provides location-aware service by adding a of data mining task. This agent extracts additional information by deploying a mobile agent in the database of LBS and mines the data. To make our approach efficient, we used a data mining method that extracts the relevant information according to the user agent profiles. This enables the proposed system to select information and summarizes the result of location-aware data for the user.

Data sharing pattern aware scheduling on grids	2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing, Proceedings	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL PROCESSING		English	Proceedings Paper	35th International Conference on Parallel Processing	AUG 14-18, 2006	Columbus, OH	Int Assoc Comp & Commun, Ohio State Univ				These days an increasing number of applications, especially in science and engineering, are dealing with a massive amount of data; hence they are data-intensive. Bioinformatics, data-mining and image processing are some typical areas of data-intensive applications. Such applications tend to be deployed on grids that provide powerful processing capabilities at reasonable cost. One fundamental scheduling issue, that arises when exploiting grids with these types of applications, is the minimization of data transfer. Therefore, the use of an efficient scheduling scheme that takes into account data transfers is rather essential in order to achieve both a shorter application completion time and efficient system utilization. In this paper, a novel scheduling algorithm, called the Shared Input data based Listing (SIL) algorithm for data-intensive bag-of-tasks (DBoT) applications in grid environments is proposed The algorithm uses a set of task lists that are constructed taking the data sharing pattern into account and that are reorganized dynamically, based on performance of resources, during the execution of the application. The primary goal of this dynamic listing is to minimize data transfer, thus leading to shortening the overall completion time of DBoT applications. SIL further attempts to reduce serious schedule increases by adopting task duplication. In our evaluation study extensive simulation tests with three different types of the DBoT application model have been conducted. Based on the experimental results, SIL noticeably outperforms two previously proposed algorithms in schedule length.

However, some sampling-based clustering algorithms for large scale data set cannot achieve ideal result. For this purpose, a FCM-based clustering ensemble algorithm is proposed. Firstly, it performs the atom clustering algorithm on the large data set. Then, randomly select a sample from each atom as representative to reduce the data amount. And the ensemble learning technique is used to improve the clustering performance. For the complex large data sets, the new algorithm has high classification speed and robustness. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm.

An memory binary particle swarm optimization (MBPSO) is proposed. A memory influence is added to a binary particle swarm optimization. The purpose of the added memory feature is to prevent and overcome premature convergence by providing particle specific alternate target points to be used at times instead of the best current position of the particle. In addition, our algorithm, like some previous work, does not need to have a complete variable ordering as input. The experimental results illustrate that our algorithm not only improves the quality of the solutions, but also reduces the time cost.

The recently published technique of Itemset Trees expedited the processing of so-called "targeted queries" where the user is interested only in itemsets that contain certain prespecified items. However, the technique did not seem to offer any cost-effective way how to find all frequent itemsets ("general queries") as it is common with other association-mining algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to rectify this deficiency by a newly developed algorithm that we call IT-Mining. Experimental results indicate that itemset trees can now with advantage be used to answer both targeted and general queries, and that the technique compares favorably with previous attempts under a broad range of data parameters.

And the high cost has motivated extensive research on automated fault localization in both software engineering and data mining communities. Fault localization aims at automatically locating likely fault locations, and hence assists manual debugging. A number of fault localization algorithms have been developed in recent years, which prove effective when multiple failing and passing cases are available. However, we notice what is more commonly encountered in practice is the two-sample debugging problem, where only one failing and one passing cases are available. This problem has been either overlooked or insufficiently tackled in previous studies. In this paper, we develop a new fault localization algorithm, named BAYESDEBUG, which simulates some manual debugging principles through a Bayesian approach. Different from existing approaches that base fault analysis on multiple passing and failing cases, BAYESDEBUG only requires one passing and one failing cases. We reason about why BAYESDEBUG fits the two-sample debugging problem and why other approaches do not. Finally, an experiment with a real-world program grep-2.2 is conducted, which exemplifies the effectiveness of BAYESDEBUG.

Usage-based Web personalization is widely applied today. But most Web personalization systems based on usage require much recourse such as time and memory and are not too reasonable. In this paper we describe an approach to psychology-based Web personalization taking into account the full spectrum of Web mining techniques and activities. Our approach is described by the architecture shown in Figure 1, which heavily uses data mining techniques, thus making the personalization process both automatic and dynamic, and hence up-to-date. Artificial psychology techniques are used to support more effective and more precise transaction clustering.

One of the main problems to be solved is the integration between data and patterns and pattern maintenance when data update. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of the patterns that represent the extracted knowledge and of the different conceptual tools used to find the patterns make difficult this integration in a unique framework. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using XML as the unifying framework for inductive databases, and present a model, named XDM (XML for Data Mining). We will show the basic features of the model, such as the storage in the same database of both data and patterns. To store patterns, we consider determinant for their interpretation the storage of the pattern derivation process which is described by the concept of statement, based on data mining operators. Some of the statements are automatically generated by the system while maintaining consistence between source and derived data. Furthermore, we show how the use of XML namespaces allows the effective coexistence of different data mining operators and provides extensibility to new operators. Finally, we show that with the use of XML-Schema we are able to define the schema, the state and the integrity constraints of an inductive database.

Although improving performance and efficiency of various ARM algorithms is important, determining Healthy Buying Patterns (HBP) from customer transactions and association rules is also important. This paper proposes a framework for mining fuzzy attributes to generate HBP and a method for analysing healthy buying patterns using ARM. Edible attributes are filtered from transactional input data by projections and are then converted to Required Daily Allowance (RDA) numeric values. Depending on a user query, primitive or hierarchical analysis of nutritional information is performed either from normal generated association rules or from a converted transactional database. Query and attribute representation can assume hierarchical or fuzzy values respectively. Our approach uses a general architecture for Healthy Association Rule Mining (HARM) and prototype support tool that implements the architecture.

Permutations patterns (groups of genes in some "close" proximity) on gene sequences of genomes across species is being studied under different models, to cope with this explosion of data. The challenge is to (intelligently and efficiently) analyze the genomes in the context of other genomes. In this paper we present a generalized model that uses three notions, gapped permutation patterns (with gap g), genome clusters, via quorum, K > 1, parameter, and, possible multiplicity in the patterns. The task is to automatically discover all permutation patterns (with possible multiplicity), that occur with gap g in at least K of the given m genomes. We present O(log mN(I) + vertical bar Sigma vertical bar log vertical bar Sigma vertical bar N-O) time algorithm where m is the number of sequences, each defined on Sigma, N-I is the size of the input and N-O is the size of the maximal gene clusters that appear in at least K of the m genomes.

At the roots of rough set theory, was a deep knowledge of ideas going back to Frege, Russell, Lukasiewicz, Popper, and others. Rough sets owe this attitude the intrinsic clarity of ideas, elegant simplicity (not to be confused with easy triviality), and a fortiori a wide spectrum of applications. Over the years, rough set theory has been enriched with new ideas. One of those additions has been rough mereology, an attempt at introducing a regular form of tolerance relations on objects in an information system, in order to provide a more flexible scheme of relating objects than indiscernibility. The theory of mereology, proposed long ago (1916) by S. Lesniewski, proved a valuable source of inspiration. As a result, a more general theory has emerged, still far from completion. Rough mereology, operating with so called rough inclusions, allows for definitions of a class of logics, that in turn have applications to distributed systems, perception analysis, granular computing etc. etc. In this article, we give a survey of the present state of art in the area of rough mereological theory of reasoning, as we know it, along with comments on some problems.

This paper proposes a random feature selection procedure integrated within the multinomial logit (MNL) classifier to perform both tasks simultaneously. We assess the potential of the random feature selection procedure (exploiting randomness) as compared to an expert feature selection method (exploiting domain-knowledge) on a CRM cross-sell application. The results show great promise as the predictive accuracy of the integrated random feature selection in the MNL algorithm is substantially higher than that of the expert feature selection method.

Clustering becomes more challenging when data are categorical and the amount of available memory is less than the size of the data set. In this paper, we introduce CBC (Clustering Based on Compressed Data), an extension of the Birch algorithm whose main characteristics refer to the fact that it can be especially suitable for very large databases and it can work both with categorical attributes and mixed features. Effectiveness and performance of the CBC procedure were compared with those of the well-known K-modes clustering algorithm, demonstrating that the CBC summary process does not affect the final clustering, while execution times can be drastically lessened.

We are collecting audio and video recordings for the first three years of one child's life, in its near entirety, as it unfolds in the child's home. A network of ceiling-mounted video cameras and microphones are generating approximately 300 giga-bytes of observational data each day from the home. One of the worlds largest single-volume disk arrays is under construction to house approximately 400,000 hours of audio and video recordings that will accumulate over the three year study. To analyze the massive data set, we are developing new data mining technologies to help human analysts rapidly annotate and transcribe recordings using semi-automatic methods, and to detect and visualize salient patterns of behavior and interaction. To make sense of large-scale patterns,that span across months or even years of observations, we are developing computational models of language acquisition that are able to learn from the childs experiential record. By creating and evaluating machine learning systems that step into the shoes of the child and sequentially process long stretches of perceptual experience, we will investigate possible language learning strategies used by children with an emphasis on early word learning.

In many cases OLAP based tools are used in the business area, which enable multiple views on data and through that a deductive approach to data analysis. Data mining extends the possibilities for decision support by discovering patterns and relationships hidden in data and therefore enabling the inductive approach of data analysis. The paper introduces data mining based decision support system, which was designed for business users to enable them to use data mining models to facilitate decision support with only a basic level of knowledge of data mining.

In this paper, we illustrate how to use background knowledge related to a domain more efficiently. For a given data, the number of classes is investigated by using the must-link constraints before clustering and these must-link data are assigned to the corresponding classes. When the clustering algorithm is applied, we make use of the cannot-link constraints for assignment. The proposed clustering approach improves the result of COP k-means by about 10%.

The screening of outliers prior to the principal component analysis adds the resistance property to the classifier which makes the method applicable to both the supervised and unsupervised training data. Several experiments using the KDD Cup 1999 data were conducted and the experimental results demonstrated that our proposed PCC method is superior to the k-nearest neighbor (KNV) method, density-based local outliers (LOF) approach, and the outlier detection algorithm based on the Canberra metric.

Among them are decision rules and Bayesian networks. Both methods have specific advantages and disadvantages. A conversion method would allow to exploit advantages of both techniques. In this paper an algorithm that converts Naive Bayes models with multi-valued attribute domains into sets of rules is proposed. Experimental results show that it is possible to generate rule-based classifiers, which have relatively high accuracy and are simpler than original models.

Meanwhile, GrC provides us with both structured thinking at the philosophical level and structured problem solving at the practical level. The main objective of the present paper is to develop a simple and more concrete model for flow graph using GrC. At first, FG will be mainly discussed in three aspects under GrC, namely, granulation of FG, some relationships and operations of granules. Moreover, as one of advantages of this interpretation, an efficient approximation reduction algorithm of flow graph is given under the framework of GrC.

Tuning a configurable cache to a target application has been shown to reduce memory-access power by over 50%. However, searching the configuration space for the best configuration can require much time or power, even when using recent cache tuning heuristics. We sought to determine, for a particular domain of applications, the smallest subset of cache configurations that would still enable effective tuning. For a suite of 34 benchmarks and a cache with 18 possible configurations, we determine through an exhaustive search of all possible subsets, that only 3 or 4 candidate configurations are necessary to support tuning. We introduce a new heuristic, adapted from an efficient and effective heuristic developed for data mining, to quickly determine the best configurations for any sized subset, with near optimal results. We then consider a configurable cache with 17, 640 possible configurations and improve our heuristic to include a pre-pruning step, yielding near optimal tuning results. We conclude that only 3 or 4 possible cache configurations are needed to offer a near optimal configuration for every benchmark in our suite - resulting in a 91% reduction in design space exploration time over a state-of-the-art cache tuning heuristic.

In this paper, we further our previous work on applying matrix techniques to protect privacy and present a novel algebraic technique based on iterative methods for non-negative-valued data distortion. As an unsupervised learning method for uncovering latent features in high-dimensional data, a low rank nonnegative matrix factorization (NNME) is used to preserve natural data non-negativity and avoid subtractive basis vector and encoding interactions present in techniques such as principal component analysis. It is the first in privacy preserving data mining in our paper that combining non-negative matrix decomposition with distortion processing. Two iterative methods to solve bound-constrained optimization problem in NMF are compared by experiments on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The overall performance of NMF on distortion level and data utility is compared to our previously-proposed SVD-based distortion strategies and other existing popular data perturbation methods. Data utility is examined by cross validation of a binary classification using the support vector machine. Our experimental results on data mining benchmark datasets indicate that, in comparison with standard data distortion techniques, the proposed NMF-based method are very efficient in balancing data privacy and data utility, and it affords a feasible solution with a good promise on high-accuracy privacy preserving data mining.

A Bayesian network is used to describe associations among a large number of variables, such as a gene network and a network describing relationships among symptoms. Cluster analysis is used to cluster associated variables, For example, genes with similar expressions or associated symptoms are grouped into a cluster. In this paper, we combine these approaches of network construction and cluster analysis together. On the one hand, we use Bayesian networks to explain relationships among variables in each cluster; on the other hand we use hierarchical cluster approach to assist network construction, and we propose a structure learning approach. In the stepwise approach, a subnetwork over a larger cluster is constructed by combining several sub-networks over small clusters whenever these small clusters are grouped together. The proposed approach is applied to a traditional Chinese medical study on a kidney disease.

The chapter begins by drawing out the flow of personal information in today's digital environment, while emphasizing the collection, storage, analysis and subsequent uses of such data. The chapter then focuses on a specific use stemming from the information flow - the ability of online content providers to tailor advertisements and marketing materials for every user. The chapter argues that these forms of advertising are more effective than those practiced in other media, and at times might prove to be unfair and manipulative. Therefore, the chapter states that at times regulatory steps must be taken to mitigate these concerns. Finally, the chapter mentions a recent incident in which the tailoring of advertisements on the basis of personal information has caused a somewhat surprising public outcry, and compares these events with the dynamics addressed above.

Most extant data mining is a data-driven trial-an-error process. Patterns discovered via predefined models in the above process are often of limited interest to constraint-based real business. In order to work out patterns really interesting and actionable to the real world, pattern discovery is more likely to be a domain-driven human-machine-cooperated process. This talk proposes a practical data mining methodology named "domain-driven data mining". The main ideas include a Domain-Driven In-Depth Pattern Discovery framework (DDID-PD), constraint-based mining, in-depth mining, human-cooperated mining and loop-closed mining. Guided by this methodology, we demonstrate some of our work in identifying useful correlations in real stock markets, for instance, discovering optimal trading rules from the existing rule classes, and mining trading rule-stock correlations in stock exchange data. The results have attracted strong interest from both traders and researchers in stock markets. It has shown that the methodology is potential for guiding deep mining of patterns interesting to real business.

Recently, we have been approached by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to help them build highly accurate ozone level alarm forecasting models for the Houston area, where these technical difficulties come together in one single problem. Key characteristics of this problem that are challenging and interesting include: 1) the dataset is sparse (72 features, and 2% or 5% positives depending on the criteria of "ozone days"), 2) evolving over time from year to year 3) limited in collected data size (7 years or around 2500 data entries), 4) contains a large number of irrelevant features, 5) is biased in terms of 11 sample selection bias", and 6) the true model is stochastic as a function of measurable factors. Besides solving a difficult application problem, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore new and existing data mining techniques, and to provide experience and guidance for similar problems. Our main technical focus addresses on how to estimate reliable probability given both sample selection bias and a large number of irrelevant features, and how to choose the most reliable decision threshold to predict the unknown future with different distribution. On the application side, the prediction accuracy of our approach is 20% higher in recall (correctly detects I to 3 more ozone days, depending on the year) and 10% higher in precision (15 to 30 fewer false alarm days per year) than state-of-the-art methods used by air quality control scientists, and these results are significant for TCEQ.

This problem is a natural extension of the traditional MAST (maximum agreement subtree) problem. To solve the problem, we first present a novel canonical form for leaf-labeled trees and an efficient tree expansion algorithm for generating candidate subtrees level by level. We then show how to efficiently discover all frequent agreement subtrees from a given set of phylogenetic trees, through an Apriori-like data mining approach. We discuss the correctness and completeness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can discover interesting patterns from different phylogenetic trees for multiple species. The algorithms were implemented in C++ and integrated into an online toolkit, which is fully operational and accessible on the World Wide Web.

However, most k-means methods require expensive distance calculations of centroids to achieve convergence. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to implement a k-means clustering that produces Clusters comparable to slower methods. In our algorithm, we partition the original dataset into blocks; each block unit, called a unit block (UB), contains at least one pattern. We can locate the centroid of a unit block (CUB) by using a simple calculation. All the computed CUBs form a reduced dataset that represents the original dataset. The reduced dataset is then used to compute the final centroid of the original dataset. We only need to examine each UB on the boundary of candidate clusters to find the closest final centroid for every pattern in the UB. In this way, we can dramatically reduce the time for calculating final converged centroids. In our experiments, this algorithm produces comparable clustering results as other k-means algorithms, but with much better performance.

J	Jiang, DX; Pei, J; Zhang, AD				Jiang, DX; Pei, J; Zhang, AD			An interactive approach to mining gene expression data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						bioinformatics; gene expression (microarray) data; clustering; interactive data mining	CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; PATTERNS; NETWORK	Effective identification of coexpressed genes and coherent patterns in gene expression data is an important task in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications. Several clustering methods have recently been proposed to identify coexpressed genes that share similar coherent patterns. However, there is no objective standard for groups of coexpressed genes. The interpretation of co-expression heavily depends on domain knowledge. Furthermore, groups of coexpressed genes in gene expression data are often highly connected through a large number of "intermediate" genes. There may be no clear boundaries to separate clusters. Clustering gene expression data also faces the challenges of satisfying biological domain requirements and addressing the high connectivity of the data sets. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for exploring coherent patterns in gene expression data. A novel coherent pattern index is proposed to give users highly confident indications of the existence of coherent patterns. To derive a coherent pattern index and facilitate clustering, we devise an attraction tree structure that summarizes the coherence information among genes in the data set. We present efficient and scalable algorithms for constructing attraction trees and coherent pattern indices from gene expression data sets. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective in mining gene expression data and is scalable for mining large data sets.

J	Konias, S; Chouvarda, I; Vlahavas, I; Maglaveras, N				Konias, S; Chouvarda, I; Vlahavas, I; Maglaveras, N			A novel approach for incremental uncertainty rule generation from databases with missing values handling: Application to dynamic medical databases	MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND THE INTERNET IN MEDICINE			English	Article						data mining; association rules; missing values; incremental update		Current approaches for mining association rules usually assume that the mining is performed in a static database, where the problem of missing attribute values does not practically exist. However, these assumptions are not preserved in some medical databases, like in a home care system. In this paper, a novel uncertainty rule algorithm is illustrated, namely URG-2 (Uncertainty Rule Generator), which addresses the problem of mining dynamic databases containing missing values. This algorithm requires only one pass from the initial dataset in order to generate the item set, while new metrics corresponding to the notion of Support and Confidence are used. URG-2 was evaluated over two medical databases, introducing randomly multiple missing values for each record's attribute (rate: 5 - 20% by 5% increments) in the initial dataset. Compared with the classical approach (records with missing values are ignored), the proposed algorithm was more robust in mining rules from datasets containing missing values. In all cases, the difference in preserving the initial rules ranged between 30% and 60% in favour of URG-2. Moreover, due to its incremental nature, URG-2 saved over 90% of the time required for thorough re-mining. Thus, the proposed algorithm can offer a preferable solution for mining in dynamic relational databases.

Data aggregation is a common operation in business, science, engineering, medicine, etc.; it is performed for purposes such as statistical. financial, and sales and marketing analysis - particularly within the context of a data warehouse. We showed experimentally that, for this example, as long as aggregation does not shrink the sample size unduly, it does not significantly impair the performance of the logistic regression model for predicting the direction of the DJIA stock market index. We also observed that aggregation-based models are simpler (less over-parameterized) than detail-based models. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the robustness of such predictive models. Specifically, we used the area under the ROC curve as a summary measure of the overall performance of a given model. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, HX; Perng, CS; Ma, S; Yu, PS				Wang, HX; Perng, CS; Ma, S; Yu, PS			Demand-driven frequent itemset mining using pattern structures	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						association rule mining; database integration; data mining		Frequent itemset mining aims at discovering patterns the supports of which are beyond a given threshold. In many applications, including network event management systems, which motivated this work, patterns are composed of items each described by a subset of attributes of a relational table. As it involves an exponential mining space, the efficient implementation of user preferences and mining constraints becomes the first priority for a mining algorithm. User preferences and mining constraints are often expressed using patterns' attribute structures. Unlike traditional methods that mine all frequent patterns indiscriminately, we regard frequent itemset mining as a two-step process: the mining of the pattern structures and the mining of patterns within each pattern structure. In this paper, we present a novel architecture that uses pattern structures to organize the mining space. In comparison with the previous techniques, the advantage of our approach is two-fold: (i) by exploiting the interrelationships among pattern structures, execution times for mining can be reduced significantly; and (ii) more importantly, it enables us to incorporate high-level simple user preferences and mining constraints into the mining process efficiently. These advantages are demonstrated by our experiments using both synthetic and real-life datasets.

In this paper we propose a new way to perform that visualization using a variant of Andrews' Curves. Also we show that the interaction between these two methods allows us to find sub-clusters within identified clusters. Perhaps more importantly, using the SOM to pre-process data by identifying gross features enables us to use Andrews' Curves on data sets which would have previously been too large for the methodology. Finally we show how a three way interaction between the human user and these two methods can be a valuable exploratory data analysis tool.

J	Jin, RM; Agrawal, G				Jin, RM; Agrawal, G			A methodology for detailed performance modeling of reduction computations on SMP machines	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION			English	Article						parallel processing; shared memory; memory hierarchy; data mining	PARALLEL; CACHE; PREDICTION	In this paper, we revisit the problem of performance prediction on SMP machines, motivated by the need for selecting parallelization strategy for random write reductions. Such reductions frequently arise in data mining algorithms. In our previous work, we have developed a number of techniques for parallelizing this class of reductions. Our previous work has shown that each of the three techniques, full replication, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive, can outperform others depending upon problem, dataset, and machine parameters. Therefore, an important question is, "Can we predict the performance of these techniques for a given problem, dataset, and machine?". This paper addresses this question by developing an analytical performance model that captures a two-level cache, coherence cache misses, TLB misses, locking overheads, and contention for memory. Analytical model is combined with results from micro-benchmarking to predict performance on real machines. We have validated our model on two different SMP machines. Our results show that our model effectively captures the impact of memory hierarchy (two-level cache and TLB) as well as the factors that limit parallelism (contention for locks, memory contention, and coherence cache misses). The difference between predicted and measured performance is within 20% in almost all cases. Moreover, the model is quite accurate in predicting the relative performance of the three parallelization techniques. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most image analysis software packages have a large number of parameters, each with a range of settings, resulting in a plethora of potential permutations. In order to standardise the process, we have used Plackett-Burman and 2(6-1) fractional designs to select the optimal settings. Nineteen parameters were investigated, and optimal settings were successfully found by running only 42 experiments. The optimal parameter settings for our software, RoBioVision, were compared with expert-derived settings. The comparison results show that the optimal settings reduced within-slide variation. The results also indicate that the median is a good spot signal measurement compared to other studied alternative measurements since it has highest correlation coefficient between the left and right side spots.

J	Toroslu, IH; Yetisgen-Yildiz, M				Toroslu, IH; Yetisgen-Yildiz, M			Data mining in deductive databases using query flocks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; association rule mining; query flock; deductive databases; recursive query evaluation		Data mining can be defined as a process for finding trends and patterns in large data. An important technique for extracting useful information, such as regularities, from usually historical data, is called as association rule mining. Most research on data mining is concentrated on traditional relational data model. On the other hand, the query flocks technique, which extends the concept of association rule mining with a 'generate-and-test' model for different kind of patterns, can also be applied to deductive databases. In this paper, query flocks technique is extended with view definitions including recursive views. Although in our system query flock technique can be applied to a data base schema including both the intensional data base (IDB) or rules and the extensible data base (EDB) or tabled relations, we have designed an architecture to compile query flocks from datalog into SQL in order to be able to use commercially available data base management systems (DBMS) as an underlying engine of our system. However, since recursive datalog views (IDB's) cannot be converted directly into SQL statements, they are materialized before the final compilation operation. On this architecture, optimizations suitable for the extended query flocks are also introduced. Using,the prototype system, which is developed on a commercial database environment, advantages of the new architecture together with the optimizations, are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A frame rate of 9 frames-per-second is achieved for 256 3 particles using 7 render nodes and a display node. This provides real time interaction and interactive exploration of large datasets, which has been a challenge for scientific visualization and other real time data mining applications. A dynamic data distribution technique is designed for highlighting a subset of the particle volume. It maintains load balance of the system and minimizes network traffic by reconfiguring the rendering chain. Experiments show that on a given subset, interactive manipulation of the subset usually requires less than 3% of the particles inside the subset to be redistributed among all render nodes. The method can be easily extended to other large datasets such as hydrodynamic turbulence, fluid dynamics, and so on. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many such services encode access to computational and data resources, comprising single machines to computational clusters. Such services can also be informational, and integrate different resources within an institution. Consequently, we envision a service rich environment in the future, where service consumers are represented by intelligent agents. If interaction between agents is automated, it is necessary for these agents to be able to automatically discover services and choose between a set of equivalent (or similar) set-vices. In such a scenario trust serves as a benchmark to differentiate between services. In this paper we introduce a novel framework for automated service discovery and selection of Web Services based oil a user's trust policy. The framework is validated by a case study of data mining Web Services and is evaluated by an empirical experiment.

This paper presents a novel indexing technique, which represents transactions in a succinct form, appropriate for tightly integrating frequent itemset mining in a relational DBMS. The data representation is complete, i.e., no support threshold is enforced, in order to allow reusing the index for mining itemsets with any support threshold. Furthermore, an appropriate structure of the stored information has been devised, in order to allow a selective access of the index blocks necessary for the current extraction phase. The index has been implemented into the PostgreSQL open source DBMS and exploits its physical level access methods. Experiments have been run for various datasets, characterized by different data distributions. The execution time of the frequent itemset extraction task exploiting the index is always comparable with and sometime faster than a C+ + implementation of the FP-growth algorithm accessing data stored on a flat file.

Methods. Data of molecular genetic analysis and a catalogue of clinical manifestations including aortic elastic parameters were mined in order to (i) assess aortic abnormality before and during medical treatment, and to (ii) identify novel correlations between the genotype and phenotype of the disease using hierarchical cluster analysis and logistic regression analysis. A score measure describing the similarity between a patient's clinical symptoms and a characteristic phenotype class was introduced. Results: A probabilistic model for monitoring the loss of aortic elasticity was built on merely aortic parameters of 34 patients with classic MFS and 43 control subjects showing a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 96%. The clinical phenotypes of 100 individuals with classical of suspected MFS were clustered yielding four different phenotypic expressions. The highest correlation was found between FBN1 missense mutations, which manifested as ectopia lentis, skeletal major and skin minor criteria, and two out of four clustered phenotypes. The probability of the presence of a missense mutation in both phenotype classes is approximately 70%. Conclusions: Monitoring of aortic elastic properties during medical treatment may serve as additional criterion to indicate elective surgical interventions. Genotype-phenotype correlation may contribute to anticipate the clinical consequences of specific FBN1 mutations more comprehensively and may be helpful to identify MFS patients at risk at an early stage of disease.

Visual data mining is going in this direction, exploiting data mining algorithms and methodologies together with information visualization techniques. The demand for visual and interactive analysis tools is particularly pressing in the Association Rules context where often the user has to analyze hundreds of rules in order to grasp valuable knowledge. In this paper, we present a visual strategy that exploits a graph-based technique and parallel coordinates to visualize the results of association rule mining algorithms. This helps data miners to get an overview of the rule set they are interacting with and enables them to deeper investigate inside a specific set of rules. The tools developed are embedded in a framework for Visual Data Mining that is briefly described.

Much effort went into developing efficient and scalable algorithms for this problem. When the support threshold is set too low, however, or the data is highly correlated, the number of frequent itemsets can become too large, independently of the algorithm used. Therefore, it is often more interesting to mine a reduced collection of interesting itemsets, i.e., a condensed representation. Recently, in this context, the non-derivable itemsets were proposed as an important class of itemsets. An itemset is called derivable when its support is completely determined by the support of its subsets. As such, derivable itemsets represent redundant information and can be pruned from the collection of frequent itemsets. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally that the collection of non-derivable frequent itemsets is in general much smaller than the complete set of frequent itemsets. A breadth-first, Apriori-based algorithm, called NDI, to find all non-derivable itemsets was proposed. In this paper we present a depth-first algorithm, dfNDI, that is based on Eclat for mining the non-derivable itemsets. dfNDI is evaluated on real-life datasets, and experiments show that dfNDI outperforms NDI with an order of magnitude.

In the paper we propose a methodology based on the application of several data mining methods for the construction of the "normal" model of the ingoing traffic of a department-level network. The methodology returns a daily model of the network traffic as a result of four main steps: first, daily network connections are reconstructed from TCP/IP packet headers passing through the firewall and represented by means of feature vectors; second, network connections are grouped by applying a clustering method; third, clusters are described as sets of rules generated by a supervised inductive learning algorithm; fourth, rules are transformed into symbolic objects and similarities between symbolic objects are computed for each couple of days. The result is a longitudinal model of the similarity of network connections that can be used by a network administrator to identify deviations in network traffic patterns that may demand for his/her attention. The proposed methodology has been tested on log files of the firewall of our University Department.

In this work we adapt a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to a new problem domain: Identification of homogenous color r regions in biomedical images. Examples of specific problems of this nature include landscape segmentation of satellite imagery, object detection and, in our case, identification of significant color regions in images of skin lesions (tumors). Automated outer and inner boundary segmentation is a key step in segmentation of structures such as skin lesions, tumors of breast, bone, and brain. This step is important because the accuracy of the subsequent steps (extraction of various features, post-processing) crucially depends on the accuracy of this very first step. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to segmentation of pigmented skin lesion images based on DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The color regions identified by the algorithm are compared to those identified by the human subjects and the Kappa coefficient, a statistical indicator of computer-human agreement, is found to be significant.

Loadstar: A Load Shedding Scheme for Classifying Data Streams	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 21-23, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc		data mining; data streams; load shedding; classification; quality of decision; feature prediction; Markov model		We consider the problem of resource allocation in mining multiple data streams. Due to the large volume and the high speed of streaming data, mining algorithms must cope with the effects of system overload. How to realize maximum mining benefits under resource constraints becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a load shedding scheme for classifying multiple data streams. We focus on the following problems: i) how to classify data that are dropped by the load shedding scheme? and ii) how to decide when to drop data from a stream? We introduce a quality of decision (QoD) metric to measure the level of uncertainty in classification when exact feature values of the data are not available because of load shedding. A Markov model is used to predict the distribution of feature values and we make classification decisions using the predicted values and the QoD metric. Thus, resources are allocated among multiple data streams to maximize the quality of classification decisions. Furthermore, our load shedding scheme is able to learn and adapt to changing data characteristics in the data streams. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-life data show that our load shedding scheme is effective in improving the overall accuracy of classification under resource constraints.

CABDET creates a tree structure for every cluster, from which the neighbor's radius of the current object is calculated by the local density of its father node. Those unprocessed objects in the neighbor of the current object are added to extend the tree structure until no new object is founded. Each density-tree is regarded as one cluster. CABDET requires only one input parameter as the initial radius of the root node and has no limitation of density threshold. Other characteristics include the abilities of discovering clusters with arbitrary shape and processing the noise data. The result of our experiments demonstrates that CABDET is significantly more accurate in discovering density-changeable clustering than the algorithm DBSCAN, and that CABDET is less sensitive to input parameters.

A recent practice is to combine Data Mining and Multi-Agent Systems approaches. In this paper we propose the use of cooperative negotiation to construct an integrated and coherent domain model from several sources. Agents encapsule different symbolic machine learning algorithms to induce their individual models. After this, a global model yields from the interaction via cooperative negotiation of these agents. The results shows that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of the individual models, integrating the best representations of each one.

Our endeavor is to create a safer driving environment, by providing assistance in the form of warning, delaying, or re-routing, incoming signals if the assistance system detects that the driver is performing, or is about to perform, a critical maneuver, such as passing, changing lanes, making a turn, or during a sudden evasive maneuver. To accomplish this, our assistance system relies on maneuver detection by continuously evaluating various embedded vehicle sensors, such as speed, steering, acceleration, lane distance, and many others, combined into representing an instance of the "state" of the vehicle. One key issue is how to effectively and efficiently monitor many sensors with constant data streams. Data streams have their unique characteristics and may produce data that is not relevant or pertinent to a maneuver. We propose an adaptive sampling method that takes advantage of these unique characteristics and develop algorithms that attempt to select relevant and important instances to determine which sensors to monitor and how to provide quick and effective responses to this type of mission critical situations. This work can be extended to many similar sensor applications with data streams.

It complements conventional and statistically based data mining methods. Statistical approaches typically flag, alert or alarm instances or events that could represent anomalous behavior or irregularities because of a match with pre-defined patterns or rules. They serve as 'exception detection' methods where the rules or definitions of what might constitute an exception are able to be known and specified ahead of time. Many problems are suited to this approach. Many problems however, especially those of a more complex nature, are not well suited. The rules or definitions simply cannot be specified; there are no known suspicious transactions. This paper presents a human-centered network data mining methodology. A case study from the area of security illustrates the application of the methodology and corresponding data mining techniques. The paper argues that for many problems, a 'discovery' phase in the investigative process based on visualization and human cognition is a logical precedent to, and complement of, more automated 'exception detection' phases.

Thus, they are unsupervised learning methods, very useful when facing unknown, unlabelled and ill-structured databases, as environmental databases are. In this paper, different clustering algorithms are analyzed and compared. They are used on a real environmental data set in order to study their impact in characterizing states in this kind of domains. The comparison of the methods is undertaken using the system GESCONDA, which is a prototype of a data mining tool. Environmental data used in this paper are from a Catalan wastewater treatment plant and refers to different variables of the plant at different spatial points along 149 days.

In this paper, we develop a new computation model based on relative attribute dependency that is defined as the proportion of the projection of the decision table on a subset of condition attributes to the projection of the decision table on the union of the subset of condition attributes and the set of decision attributes. To find an optimal reduct, we use information entropy conveyed by the attributes as the heuristic. A novel algorithm to find optimal reducts of condition attributes based on the relative attribute dependency is implemented using Java, and is experimented with 10 data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. We conduct the comparison of data classification using C4.5 with the original data sets and their reducts. The experiment results demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm.

Especially, it is also an interesting problem in virtual environments. In this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach, called PrefixUnion. Meanwhile, we also introduce the relationships among transactions, views and objects. According to these relationships, we suggest two mining criteria - inter-pattern growth and intra-pattern growth, which utilize these characteristics to offer ordered growth and reduced projected database. As a result, the large-scale VRML models could be accessed more efficiently, allowing for a real-time walk-through in the scene.

The Euclidean distance between coefficients has been the most commonly used distance metric with FFTs. However, on many problems it is not the best measure of similarity available. In this paper we describe an alternative distance measure based on the likelihood ratio statistic to test the hypothesis of difference between series. We compare the new distance measure to Euclidean distance on five types of data with varying levels of compression. We show that the likelihood ratio measure is better at discriminating between series from different models and grouping series from the same model(1).

For the balanced exploration and exploitation with the surrogate model, objective functions are converted to the Expected Improvements (EI) and these values are directly used as fitness values in the multi-objective optimization. Among the non-dominated solutions about EIs, additional sample points for the update of the Kriging model are selected. The present method is applied to a transonic airfoil design. In order to obtain the information about design space, two data mining techniques are applied to design results. One is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the other is Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

From this, we need a system to recommend a visitor good information, This recommendation system can be constructed by web usage mining process. The web usage mining mines web log records to discover user access patterns of web pages. Also it is the application of data mining techniques to large web log data in order to extract usage patterns from user's click streams. In general, the size of web log records is so large that we have difficulty to analyze web log data. To make matter worse, the web log records are very sparse. So it is very hard to estimate the dependency between the web pages. In this paper, we solved this difficulty of web usage mining using support vector machine. In the experiments, we verified our proposed method by given data from UCI machine learning repository and KDD cup 2000.

From observed containments of transaction execution time periods, we estimate the probabilities of accidental and non-accidental containments, and build a competitive model for discovering direct dependencies by using a model estimation method based on the online EM algorithm. Utilizing the discovered dependency information, we also propose a hierarchical problem detection framework, where microscopic dependency information is incorporated with a macroscopic anomaly metric that monitors the behavior of the system as a whole. This feature is made possible by employing a network-based design which provides overall information of the system without any impact on the performance.

J	Keim, DA; Schneidewind, J				Keim, DA; Schneidewind, J			Scalable visual data exploration of large data sets via multiresolution	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						visual data exploration; visualization technique; multiresolution		During the last decade Visual Exploration and Visual Data Mining techniques have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis since they combine human visual perception and recognition capabilities with the enormous storage capacity and the computational power of today's computer systems in order to detect patterns and trends in the data. But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on visualization techniques and concepts. Due to technological progress in computer power and storage capacity to day's scientific and commercial applications are capable of generating, storing and processing massive amounts of data. Most existing visualization metaphors and concepts do not scale well on such large data sets as interaction capabilities and visual representations suffer from the massive number of data points. To bridge this gap, Visual Analytics aim to incorporate more intelligent means than to just retrieve and display the data items to filter the relevant from the non-relevant data. In this context the paper introduces a new approach based on a Multiresolution paradigm to increase the scalability of existing Visual data exploration techniques. The basic idea is to provide relevance driven compact representations of the underlying data set that present the data at different granularities. In the visualization step the available display space is then distributed according to the data granularity, to emphasize relevant information. The paper aims at introducing a technical base of Multiresolution visualization and provides an application example that shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.

However, in many practical cases where FCA has proven to provide theoretical strength, e.g., in data mining, the volume of data to analyze is huge. This fact emphasizes the need for efficient lattice manipulations. The processing of large datasets has often been approached with parallel algorithms and some preliminary studies on parallel lattice construction exist in the literature. We propose here a novel divide- and- conquer (D&C) approach that operates by data slicing. In this paper, we present a new parallel algorithm, called DAC-PARALAX, which borrows its main operating primitives from an existing sequential procedure and integrates them into a multi-process architecture. The algorithm has been implemented using a parallel dialect of the C++ language and its practical performances have been compared to those of a homologue sequential algorithm.

J	Khoshgoftaar, TM; Van Hulse, J				Khoshgoftaar, Taghi M.; Van Hulse, Jason			Identifying noisy features with the Pairwise Attribute Noise Detection Algorithm	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						noise detection; data cleaning; software measurement; software quality	SOFTWARE QUALITY ESTIMATION	A critical issue in data mining and knowledge discovery is the problem of data quality. Quantifying the presence of noise in dataset is often used as an indicator of data quality. While existing works have mostly focused on detecting class noise or mislabeling errors, very limited attention has been given to finding noisy attributes or features. Prior work in the area of noise handling has concentrated on the detection of observations that contain noise in either the attributes or class labels. Methodologies that provide insight into the quality of an attribute can provide valuable knowledge to a domain expert when data analysis is being performed. We present a novel methodology for detecting noisy attributes. The procedure utilizes our recently proposed Pairwise Attribute Noise Detection Algorithm ( PANDA) for detecting instances with attribute noise. From a data analyst's point of view, our approach provides a viable solution to: "Given a dataset, which attribute(s) contains the most noise?". The proposed methodology is investigated with multiple case studies of a real-world software measurement dataset. The empirical study is investigated by injecting simulated noise into one or more attributes of a dataset that has no class noise. Based on a domain expert's inspection of the obtained results, the effectiveness of our technique for detecting noisy attributes is demonstrated.

Data noise are generally of two types: attribute noise and mislabeling errors (class noise). For a given domain-specific dataset, attributes that contain a significant amount of noise can have a detrimental impact on the success of a data mining initiative, e.g., reducing the predictive ability of a classifier in a supervised learning task. Techniques that provide information about the noise quality of an attribute are useful tools for a data mining practitioner when performing analysis on a dataset or scrutinizing the data collection processes. Our technique for detecting noisy attributes uses an algorithm that we recently proposed for the detection of instances with attribute noise. This paper presents case studies that confirm our recent work done on detecting noisy attributes and further validates that our technique is indeed able to detect attributes that contain noise.

In streaming time series the problem is more challenging, taking into account the fact that new values arrive for the series, probably in very high rates. Therefore, effective and efficient methods are required in order to classify a streaming time series based on its trend. Since new values are continuously arrive for each stream, the classification is performed by means of a sliding window which focuses on the last values of each stream. Each streaming time series is transformed to a vector by means of a Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) technique. The PLA vector is a sequence of symbols denoting the trend of the series (either UP or DOWN), and it is constructed incrementally. Efficient in-memory methods are used in order to: 1) determine the class of each streaming time series and 2) determine the streaming time series that comprise a specific trend class. Performance evaluation based on real-life datasets is performed, which shows the efficiency of the proposed approach both with respect to classification time and storage requirements. The proposed method can be used in order to continuously classify a set of streaming time series according to their trends, to monitor the behavior of a set of streams and to monitor the contents of a set of trend classes.

The theory of fuzzy sets can be used over relational databases to discover useful, meaningful patterns. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules over relational databases using Interest and Conviction measures. In the present work, we introduce fuzzy interest and fuzzy conviction measures and eliminate the rules, which have negative correlation. The experiments are conducted on an insurance database using our approach. The presented approach is very useful and efficient when there are more infrequent itemsets in a database.

The most essential and difficult step is to mine associations between different medicine items. This paper proposes an effective approach in solving this problem. The main contributions include: (1) proposing a novel data structure called indexed frequent pattern tree (IFPT) to maintain the ruined frequent patterns (2) presenting an efficient algorithm called Nearest Neighbor First (NNF) to mine association rules from IFPT (3) designing and implementing two optimization strategies that avoid the examinations of a lot of subsets of Y that can't be) the left part of any association rule of the form X double right arrow Y - X and thus achieving a wonderful performance and (4) conducting extensive experiments which show that NNF runs far faster than Apriori algorithm and has better scalability. And finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in Medicine Paring Analysis.

This is a fascinating idea, but to be accepted for mainstream data mining applications, extensive benchmarking is needed to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of these algorithms. In our research we focus on the AIRS classification algorithm. It has been claimed previously that AIRS consistently outperforms other algorithms. However, in these papers AIRS was compared to benchmark results from literature. To ensure consistent conditions we carried out benchmark tests on all algorithms using exactly the same set up. Our findings show that AIRS is a stable and robust classifier that produces around average results. This contrasts with earlier claims but shows AIRS is mature enough to be used for mainstream data mining.

The management of this uncertainty is, therefore, a task of paramount importance for the data analyst. Many methods have been developed for missing data imputation, but few of them approach the problem of imputation as part of a general data density estimation scheme. Amongst the latter, a method for imputing and visualizing multivariate missing data using Generative Topographic Mapping was recently presented. This model and some of its extensions are tested under different experimental conditions. Its performance is compared to that of other missing data imputation techniques, thus assessing its relative capabilities and limitations.

In most previous approaches, the automatic segmentation was evaluated in terms of the performance of the final system like the word error rate for speech recognition systems. In many applications like online audio indexing, and information retrieval systems, the actual boundaries of the segments are required. Therefore we present an approach based on the cumulative sum (CuSum) algorithm for automatic segmentation which minimizes the missing probability for a given false alarm rate. In this paper, we compare the CuSum algorithm to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) algorithm, and a generalization of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test for automatic segmentation of audio streams. We present a two-step variation of the three algorithms which improves the performance significantly. We present also a novel approach that combines hypothesized boundaries from the three algorithms to achieve the final segmentation of the audio stream. Our experiments on the 1998 Hub4 broadcast news show that a variation of the CuSum algorithm significantly outperforms the other two approaches and that combining the three approaches using a voting scheme improves the performance slightly compared to using the a two-step variation of the CuSum algorithm alone.

This is an important problem in developing generally applicable methods in machine learning and data mining for classification and prediction. This paper intorduces a new technique for discretization based on successive pseudo deletion of instances to reduce the conflicting instances, i.e., by reduction of noise in the database. Such successive pseudo deletions in the database are performed by introducing threshold points on maximum information gain boundary points of the continuous attributes. Our empirical experiments show that the state of the art algorithms for learning, such as CN2, C4.5, Naive-Bayes and RISE give improvement in performances with the cliscretized output from our method than outputs with other state of the art discretization algorithms.

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate our analysis of AR by applying a number of various data mining (DM) techniques to real hospital data. The data for the analysis includes instances of sensitivity of nosocomial infections to antibiotics collected in a hospital over three years 2002-2004. The results of our study show that DM makes it easy for experts to inspect patterns that might otherwise be missed by usual (manual) infection control. However, the clinical relevance and utility of these findings await the results of prospective studies. We see our main contribution in this paper in introducing and applying a many-sided analysis approach to real-world data. The application of diversified DM techniques, which are not necessarily accurate and do not best suit to the present problem in the usual sense, still offers a possibility to analyze and understand the problem from different perspectives.

J	Rawat, S; Gulati, VP; Pujari, AK				Rawat, S; Gulati, VP; Pujari, AK			A fast host-based intrusion detection system using rough set theory	TRANSACTIONS ON ROUGH SETS IV	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article						data mining; decision table; rough set; intrusion detection; anomaly; misuse		Intrusion Detection system has become the main research focus in the area of information security. Last few years have witnessed a large variety of technique and model to provide increasingly efficient intrusion detection solutions. We advocate here that the intrusive behavior of a process is highly localized characteristics of the process. There are certain smaller episodes in a process that make the process intrusive in an otherwise normal stream. As a result it is unnecessary and most often misleading to consider the whole process in totality and to attempt to characterize its abnormal features. In the present work we establish that subsequences of reasonably small length of sequence of system calls would suffice to identify abnormality in a process. We make use of rough set theory to demonstrate this concept. Rough set theory also facilitates identifying rules for intrusion detection. The main contributions of the paper are the following- (a) It is established that very small subsequence of system call is sufficient to identify intrusive behavior with high accuracy. We demonstrate our result using DARPA'98 BSM data; (b) A rough set based system is developed that can extract rules for intrusion detection; (c) An algorithm is presented that can determine the status of a process as either normal or abnormal on-line.

Due to incomplete biomedical information databases, the extraction is not straightforward using dictionaries, and several approaches using contextual rules and machine learning have previously been proposed. Our work is inspired by the previous approaches, but is novel in the sense that it is using Google for semantic annotation of the biomedical words. The semantic annotation accuracy obtained - 52% on words not found in the Brown Corpus, Swiss-Prot or LocusLink (accessed using Gsearch.org) - is justifying further work in this direction.

In Japan, more than 58 percent of all traffic crashes occur at intersections. With the advances in Intelligent Transportation Systems, such as off-the-shelf and in-vehicle sensor technology, wireless communication and ubiquitous computing research, safety of intersection environments can be improved. This research aims to investigate an integration of intelligent software agents and ubiquitous data stream mining, for a novel context-aware framework that is able to: (1) monitor an intersection to learn for patterns of collisions and factors leading to a collision; (2) learn to recognize potential hazards in intersections from information communicated by road infrastructures, approaching and passing vehicles, and external entities; (3) warn particular threatened vehicles that are approaching the intersection by communicating directly to the in-vehicle system.

One way to support this goal is to make the semantics of small document regions explicit, e.g. as XML labels, so that query engines can exploit them. To this purpose, the topics of the small document regions must be discovered from the texts; differently from document labelling applications, fine-grain topics cannot be listed in advance for arbitrary collections. Text-understanding approaches can derive the topic of a document region but are less appropriate for the construction of a small set of topics that can be used in queries. To address this challenge we propose the coupling of text mining, prior knowledge explicated in ontologies and human expertise and present the system RELFIN, which is designed to assis the human expert in the discovery of topics appropriate for (i) ontology enhancement with additional concepts or relationships, (ii) semantic characterization and tagging of document regions. RELFIN performs data mining upon linguistically preprocessed corpora to group document regions on topics and constructing the topic labels for them, so that the labels are characteristic of the regions and thus helpful in ontology-based search. We show our first results of applying RELFIN on a case study of text analysis and retrieval.

This paper presents a semantic genetic algorithm (SGA) to learn a complete qualitative structure of a Bayesian network from a database. SGA builds on recent advances in the field and focuses on the generation of initial population, crossover, and mutation operators. Particularly, we introduce two semantic crossover and mutation operators that aid in faster convergence of the SGA. The crossover and mutation operators in SGA incorporate the semantic of the Bayesian network structures to learn the structure with very minimal errors. SGA has been proved to perform better than existing classical genetic algorithms for learning Bayesian networks. We present empirical results to prove the fast convergence of SGA and the predictive power of the obtained Bayesian network structures.

J	Shitong, W; Chung, KFL; Hongbin, S				Shitong, Wang; Chung, Korris F. L.; Hongbin, Shen			Fuzzy taxonomy, quantitative database and mining generalized association rules	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; association rules; fuzzy taxonomic quantitative database		Mining association rules from databases is still a hot topic in data mining community in recent years. Due to the existence of multiple levels of abstraction (i.e, taxonomic structures) among the attributes of the databases, several algorithms were proposed to mine generalized Boolean association rules upon all levels of presumed crisp taxonomic structures. However, fuzzy taxonomic structures may be more suitable in many practical applications. In [ 9], the authors proposed an approach to mine generalized Boolean association rules with such fuzzy taxonomic structures. The main contribution of this paper is to extend their idea to mine generalized association rules from quantitative databases with fuzzy taxonomic structures. A new fuzzy taxonomic quantitative database model is presented, and the experimental results on realistic databases are demonstrated to validate this new model.

The data mining algorithm for reverse engineering uses a genetic program (GP) as a data mining function. A GP is an evolutionary algorithm that automatically evolves populations of computer programs or mathematical expressions, eventually selecting one that is optimal in the sense it maximizes a fitness function. The system to be reverse engineered is typically a sensor that may not be disassembled and for which there are no design documents. The sensor is used to create a database of input signals and output measurements. Rules about the likely design properties of the sensor are collected from experts. The rules are used to create a fitness function for the GP allowing GP based data mining. This procedure incorporates not only the experts' rules into the fitness function, but also the information in the database. The information extracted through this process is the internal design specifications of the sensor. These design properties can be used to create a fitness function for a genetic algorithm, which is in turn used to search for defects in the digital logic design. Significant theoretical and experimental results are provided.	USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA	Smith, JF (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Code 5741, Washington, DC 20375 USA.

Knowledge can be in different forms, for example, decision rules, decision trees, logical expressions, clusters, classifiers, and neural nets with discrete input variables. KV is implemented as a module of the inductive database system VINLEN, which integrates a conventional database system with a range of inductive inference and data mining capabilities. This paper describes briefly the KV module and then focuses on the problem of arranging attributes that span the diagram in a way that leads to the most readable rule visualization in the diagram. This problem has been solved by applying a simulated annealing.

However, scalability still remains an obstacle to applying recommender mechanism for large-scale web-based systems where thousands of items and transactions are readily available. To deal with this issue, data mining techniques have been applied to reduce the dimensions of candidate sets. In this chapter in the context of movie recommendations, we study a different kind of technique to scale down candidate sets by considering the temporal feature of items. In particular, we argue that movies' production year can be regarded as a "temporal context" to which the value (thus the rating) of the movie can be attached; and thus might significantly affect target users' future preferences. We call it the temporal effects of the items on the performance of the recommender systems. We perform some experiments on the MovieLens data sets. The results show that the temporal feature of items can not only be exploited to scale down the candidate sets, but also increase the accuracy of the recommender systems.

Traditionally, process mining has been applied to structured processes. In this paper, we argue that process mining can also be applied to less structured processes supported by Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) systems. In addition, the ProM framework is described Using ProM a wide variety of process mining activities are supported ranging from process discovery and verification conformance checking and social network analysis.

Given a family of distances on a set of objects, a distance is universal up to a certain precision for that family if it minorizes every distance in the family between every two objects in the set, up to the stated precision (we do not require the universal distance to be an element of the family). We consider similarity distances for two types of objects: literal objects that as such contain all of their meaning, like genomes or books, and names for objects. The latter may have literal embodyments like the first type, but may also be abstract like "red" or "christianity:" For the first type we consider a family of computable distance measures corresponding to parameters expressing similarity according to particular features between pairs of literal objects. For the second type we consider similarity distances generated by web users corresponding to particular semantic relations between the (names for) the designated objects. For both families we give universal similarity distance measures, incorporating all particular distance measures in the family. In the first case the universal distance is based on compression and in the second case it is based on Google page counts related to search terms. In both cases experiments on a massive scale give evidence of the viability of the approaches.

To date, most temporal data mining research has focused on events existing at a point in time rather than over a temporal interval. In comparison to static rules, mining with respect to time points provides semantically richer rules. However, accommodating temporal intervals offers rules that are richer still.

It is now widely used in health care industry. Especially breast cancer is the second most cause of cancer and the second most dangerous cancer. The best way to improve a breast cancer victim's chance of long-term survival is to detect it as early as possible. Currently there are three methods to diagnose breast cancer: mammography, FNA (fine needle aspirate) and surgical biopsy. The diagnose accuracy of mammography is from 68% to 79%, the accuracy of FNA is inconsistent with varying from 65% to 98%, the accuracy of a surgical biopsy is nearly 100%. The procedure of a surgical biopsy, however, is both unpleasant and costly. In this paper, we use a FNA with a data mining & statistics method to get an easy way to achieve a best result We combine some statistical methods such as PCA, PLS linear regression analysis with data mining methods such as select attribute, decision trees and association rules to find the unsuspected relationships. In addition, the experimental results are shown and discussed.	Towson State Univ, Towson, MD USA	Xiong, XC (reprint author), Towson State Univ, Towson, MD USA.

Data format which MUSASHI can deal with is either an XML table written in XML or plain text file with table structure. In this paper we shall present a business application system of MUSASHI, called C-MUSASHI, dedicated to CRM oriented systems. Integrating a large amount of customer purchase histories in XML databases with the marketing tools and data mining technology based on MUSASHI, C-MUSASHI offers various basic tools for customer analysis and store management based on which data mining oriented CRM systems can be developed at extremely low cost. We apply C-MUSASHI to supermarkets and drugstores in Japan to discover useful knowledge for their marketing strategy and present possibility to construct useful CRM systems at extremely low cost by introducing MUSASHI.

B	Yin, J; Yang, Q; Ni, L			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Yin, J; Yang, Q; Ni, L			Adaptive temporal radio maps for indoor location estimation	Third IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	MAR 08-12, 2005	Kauai, HI	IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Comp Sci				In this paper we present a novel method to adapt the temporal radio maps for indoor location estimation by offsetting the variational environmental factors using data mining techniques and reference points. Environmental variations, which cause the signals to change from time to time even at the same location, present a challenging task for indoor location estimation in the IEEE 802.11b infrastructure. In such a dynamic environment, the radio maps obtained in one time period may not be applicable in other time periods. To solve this problem, we apply a regression analysis to learn the temporal predictive relationship between the signal-strength values received by sparsely located reference points and that received by the mobile device. This temporal prediction model can then be used for online localization based on the newly observed signal-strength values at the client side and the reference points. We show that this technique can effectively accommodate the variations of signal-strength values over different time periods without the need to rebuild the radio maps repeatedly. We also show that the location of mobile device can be accurately determined using this technique with lower density in the distribution of the reference points.

The DMAIDM applies a fast heuristic clustering algorithm for mixed data (FHCAM) to distinguish intrusions from legal behaviors efficiently and an attribute-constrained based fuzzy mining algorithm (ACFMA) to construct intrusion Pattern-database automatically. Verification tests are carried out by using the 10% subset of KDD Cup 1999 Data Set, The average detection rate is 71.67% and the average false detection rate is 0.92%. And the detection rate increases from 65.25%(the second subset) to 85.7%(the ninth subset) adaptively. The experimental results reveal that the DMAIDM is successful in terms of not only accuracy but also efficiency in networks intrusion detection.

In this paper, a hybrid mining model based on neural network and kernel smoothing technique is developed. The kernel smoothing technique is used to preprocess data and help decision-making. Neural network is employed to predict the long trends of stock price. In addition, some trading rules involving trading decision-making are considered. The China Shanghai Composite Index is as case study. The return achieved by the hybrid mining model is four times as large as that achieved by the buy and hold strategy, so the proposed model is promising and certainly warrants further research.

However, to use the SOM, the network structure must be predetermined, this often leads constrains on potential applications. When the network is unfit to the data model, the resulting map will be of poor quality. In this paper, an intuitive and effective SOM is proposed for mapping high-dimensional data onto the two-dimensional SOM structure with a growing self-organizing map. In the training phase, an improved growing node structure is used. In the procedure of adaptive growing, the probability distribution of sample data is also a criterion to distinguish where the new nodes should to be added or deleted besides the maximal quantization error (mqe) of a unit. The improved method is demonstrated on a data set with promising results and a significantly reduced network size.

J	De, SK; Krishna, PR				De, SK; Krishna, PR			A new approach to mining fuzzy databases using nearest neighbor classification by exploiting attribute hierarchies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							PROXIMITY RELATIONS; ALGORITHM; MODEL; SETS	Data classification is a well-organized operation in the field of data mining. This article presents an application of the k-nearest neighbor classification technique for mining a fuzzy database. We consider a data set in which attribute values have certain similarities in nature and analyze the observations for the domain of each attribute, on the basis of fuzzy similarity relations. The proposed technique is general and the presented case study demonstrates the suitability of using this fuzzy approach for mining fuzzy databases, especially when the database contains various levels of abstraction.

J	Hong, T; Han, I				Hong, T; Han, I			Integrated approach of cognitive maps and neural networks using qualitative information on the World Wide Web: the KBNMiner	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						qualitative information; WWW; data mining; neural networks; cognitive maps	TIME-SERIES; FORECASTING METHODS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DECISION-SUPPORT; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; INDEX; ERROR	In this paper, we propose a method for integrating cognitive maps and neural networks to gain competitive advantage using qualitative information acquired from news information on the World Wide Web. We have developed the KBNMiner, which is designed to represent the knowledge of domain experts with cognitive maps, to search and retrieve news information on the Internet according to the knowledge and to apply the information to a neural network model. In addition, we investigate ways to train neural networks more effectively by separating the learning data into two groups on the basis of event information acquired from news information. To validate our proposed method, we applied 180,000 news articles to the KBNMiner. The experimental results are found to support our proposed method through tenfold cross-validation.

J	Wickramasinghe, LK; Amarasiri, R; Alahakoon, LD				Wickramasinghe, LK; Amarasiri, R; Alahakoon, LD			A hybrid intelligent multiagent system for e-business	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						business agents; e-tourism; agent-based systems; web agents; self-organizing neural networks	ARCHITECTURE	The paper describes a new multiagent system with enhanced capabilities obtained through a hybrid of intelligent techniques. The processing in the model is handled by two types of agents: distributed agents and a central administrator agent. Localized processing at the individual agents is carried out using mathematical techniques and genetic algorithms. The central administrator agent dynamically obtains information about the problem domain from the Internet and maintains a knowledge pool using a clustering technique called the growing self-organizing map (GSOM). Distributed agents communicate with the central administrator agent if they need further knowledge about the problem domain to provide solutions to user-defined tasks. The approach integrates traditional mathematical, data mining, and evolutionary techniques with a multiagent system. The proposed system is implemented as a travel optimizer application for the e-tourism domain. Finally, the possibilities of integrating the proposed technique with currently available e-tourism applications to provide the customer with enhanced solutions are identified.

J	Nakkrasae, S; Sophatsathit, P				Nakkrasae, S; Sophatsathit, P			An rpcl-based indexing approach for software component classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						software component classification; knowledge engineering; neural network; and rival penalized competitive learning		Software Engineering is not only a technical discipline of its own, but also a problem domain where technologies coming from other disciplines are relevant and can play important roles. One important example is knowledge engineering, a term that is used in a broad sense to encompass artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, knowledge bases, data mining, and machine learning [13]. Many typical software development issues can benefit from these disciplines. For this reason, we will employ computational intelligence approach to classify software component repository into similar component cluster groups with the help of Rival Penalized Competitive Learning algorithm. The center of each cluster will be used to construct the coarse grain classification indexing structure. Subsequent retrieval requirements of software components are compared with all the indexed cluster centers. Any software components belonging to the cluster partition whose center is closest to the required software component will be retrieved and participated in selecting the most suitable software component at the fine grain level. This approach not only is suitable for multi-dimensional data, but also automatically decides the correct model classification.

First, we are interested in human-centered issues related to browsing "Popular Music." Popular here means that the music accessed is distributed widely and known to many listeners. Second, we consider "popular browsing" of music, i.e., making music accessible to nonspecialists (music lovers) and allowing sharing of musical tastes and information within communities, departing from the usual, single-user view of digital libraries. This research project covers all areas of the music-to-listener chain, from music description, descriptor extraction from the music signal, or data mining techniques, similarity-based access, and novel music retrieval methods such as automatic sequence generation, and to user interface issues. This article describes the scientific and technical issues at stake and the results obtained, and is illustrated by prototypes developed within the European IST project Cuidado.

J	Chun, SH; Kim, SH				Chun, SH; Kim, SH			Automated generation of new knowledge to support managerial decision-making: case study in forecasting a stock market	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery; data mining; forecasting; neural network; case-based reasoning	AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; CLASSIFICATION; ATTRACTORS	The deluge of data available to managers underscores the need to develop intelligent systems to generate new knowledge. Such tools are available in the form of learning systems from artificial intelligence. This paper explores how the novel tools can support decision-making in the ubiquitous managerial task of forecasting. For concreteness, the methodology is examined in the context of predicting a financial index whose chaotic properties render the time series difficult to predict. The study investigates the circumstances under which enough new knowledge is extracted from temporal data to overturn the efficient markets hypothesis. The efficient markets hypothesis precludes the possibility of anticipating in financial markets. More precisely, the markets are deemed to be so efficient that the best forecast of a price level for the subsequent period is precisely the current price. Certain anomalies to the efficient market premise have been observed, such as calendar effects. Even so, forecasting techniques have been largely unable to outperform the random walk model which corresponds to the behavior of prices under the efficient markets hypothesis. This paper tests the validity of the efficient markets hypothesis by developing knowledge-based tools to forecast a market index. The predictions are examined across several horizons: single-period forecasts as well as multiple periods. For multiperiod forecasts, the predictive methodology takes two forms: a single jump from the current period to the end of the forecast horizon, and a multistage web of forecasts which progresses systematically from one period to the next. These models are first evaluated using neural networks and case-based reasoning, and are then compared against a random walk model. The computational models are examined in the context of forecasting a composite for the Korean stock market.

Identifying software component association is useful for component management and component retrieval. In this paper we design an evolutionary strategy to understand software structure better and identify software component association, by using genetic algorithm. Our mining strategy is effective for global search, especially when the searched space is so large that it is hardly possible to use deterministic search method.

Numerous researches have focused on developing techniques on the analysis, design and management of whole logistics chains in particular in the domain of data mining, data analysis and data classification. While the data mining techniques and computational intelligence techniques are good independently for solving specific tasks, they can be synergized through the formation of an integrated and unified model, which can take advantage of the goods and offset the flaws of the two techniques. In this paper, an intelligent information infrastructure, which is characterized by its ability to encompass a rich collection of knowledge representation formalisms for dealing with a logistics information flow problem, is presented. Such intelligent information infrastructure includes a two-step strategy that embraces the combination of online analytical processing and neural networks to support knowledge discovery. In addition, extensible markup language is used to support the overall infrastructure, in order to facilitate the seamless data interchange within an enterprise.

The issues of missing data in knowledge discovery are often ignored in data mining. This article presents the conceptual foundations of data mining with incomplete survey data, and proposes query processing for knowledge discovery and a set of query functions for the conceptual construction in survey data mining. Through a case, this paper demonstrates that conceptual construction on incomplete data can be accomplished by using artificial intelligence tools such as self-organizing maps. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It first presents a text-structuring method by constructing a language information table from a corpus for each pinyin, which it will then apply to a free-form textual corpus. Data generalization and rule extraction algorithms can then be used to eliminate redundant information and extract consistent PTC conversion rules. The design of our model also addresses a number of important issues such as the long-distance dependency problem, the storage requirements of the rule base, and the consistency of the extracted rules, while the performance of the extracted rules as well as the effects of different model parameters are evaluated experimentally. These results show that by the smoothing method, high precision conversion (0.947) and recall rates (0.84) can be achieved even for rules represented directly by pinyin rather than words. A comparison with the baseline tri-gram model also shows good complement between our method and the tri-gram language model.

J	Bruha, I				Bruha, I			Meta-learner for unknown attribute values processing: Dealing with inconsistency of meta-databases	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS 2002)	JUN 27-29, 2002	LYON, FRANCE	Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, Inst Natl Sci Appl Lyon		unknown attribute value processing; meta-learning; meta-combiner; meta-classifier; base classifiers		Efficient robust data mining algorithms should comprise some routines for processing unknown (missing) attribute values when acquiring knowledge from real-world databases because these data usually contain a certain percentage of missing values. The paper Bruha and Franek (1996) figures out that each dataset has more or less its own `favourite' routine for processing unknown attribute values. It evidently depends on the magnitude of noise and source of unknownness in each dataset. One possibility how to choose an efficient routine for processing unknown attribute values for a given database is exhibited in this paper. The covering machine learning algorithm CN4, a large extension of the well-known CN2 algorithm, is used here as an inductive vehicle. Each of the six routines for unknown attribute value processing ( which are available in CN4) is used independently in order to process a given database. Afterwards, a meta-learner is used to derive a meta-classifier that makes up the overall (final) decision about the class of input unseen objects. The entire system is called a meta-combiner. The meta-database that is formed for the meta-learner could be inconsistent which could decrease the performance of the entire meta-classifier. Therefore, the existing meta-system (Meta-CN4) has been enhanced by a `purification' procedure that appropriately solves up the conflict of inconsistent meta-data. The paper first surveys the CN4 algorithms including its six routines for unknown attribute value processing. Afterwards, it introduces the methodology of the meta-learner including its enhancement that solves inconsistent meta-databases. Finally, the results of experiments with various percentages of unknown attribute values on real-world data are presented and performances of the meta-classifier and the six base classifiers are then compared. The paper also explains the difference between the meta-combiner (meta-learner) described here and the cross-validation procedure used for obtaining the classification accuracy.

The collection of frequent sets gives a collection of marginal frequencies about the underlying data set. Sometimes, we would like to use a collection of such marginal frequencies instead of the entire data set (e.g. when the original data is inaccessible for confidentiality reasons) to compute other interesting summaries. Using combinatorial arguments, we may obtain tight upper and lower bounds on the values of inferred summaries. In this paper, we consider a class of summaries wider than frequent sets, namely that of frequencies of arbitrary Boolean formulae. Given frequencies of a number of any different Boolean formulae, we consider the problem of finding tight bounds on the frequency of another arbitrary formula. We give a general formulation of the problem of bounding formula frequencies given some background information, and show how the bounds can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We illustrate the accuracy of the bounds by giving empirical results on real data sets.

With its online connectivity to huge real stock data in global markets, it can be used for online evaluation of trading strategies and data mining algorithms. The main functions in the F-TRADE include soft plug-and-play, and back-testing, optimization, integration and evaluation of algorithms. In this paper, we'll focus on introducing the intelligent plug-and-play, which is a key system function in the F-TRADE. The basic idea for the soft plug-and-play is to build agent services which can support the online plug-in of agents, algorithms and data sources. Agent UML-based modeling, role model and agent services for the plug-and-play are discussed. With this design, algorithm providers, data source providers, and system module developers of the F-TRADE can expand system functions and resources by online plugging them into the F-TRADE.

Several approaches have been proposed so far to deal with patterns, however all of them lack some of the previous characteristics. The aim of this paper is to present an overall framework to cope with all these features.

Nevertheless, this task may be simplified by reducing the variables which could be considered as equivalent. The aim of this paper is to describe a new method for reducing the number of variables in a large set of data. Implicative analysis, which builds association rules with a measure more powerful than conditional probability, is used to detect quasi-equivalent variables. This technique has some advantages over traditional similarity analysis.

Because the catalogues currently described by UCDs cover many different domains, UCDs can be used to describe a large fraction of astronomical concepts. The different Virtual Observatory (VO) projects, collaborating in the IVOA (International Virtual Observatory Alliance) have therefore decided to support UCDs, and to collaborate to define a new set of standard metadata. This new set of UCD will be more coherent and complete than the old one. It uses a new syntax, and a list of atomic keywords from which UCDs are built. The sharing of a core set of metadata is very important to ensure inter-operability between the various VO elements. We present how this new list of UCDs has been defined, and how it will be expanded in the future. We also present the mechanisms to assign UCDs to (possibly large) datasets, check for validity of UCDs, and make suggestions for including new concepts in the standard core of UCDs. We also discuss several fields of the VO where UCDs will be used, what kind of applications of UCDs are foreseen, how they can be used and how software using UCDs can be designed.

Existing periodic patterns mining algorithms either assume that the periodic rate (or simply the period) is user-specified, or try to detect potential values for the period in a separate phase. The former assumption is a considerable disadvantage, especially in time series databases where the period is not known a priori. The latter approach results in a multi-pass algorithm, which on the other hand is to be avoided in online environments (e.g., data streams). In this paper, we develop an algorithm that mines periodic patterns in time series databases with unknown or obscure periods such that discovering the period is part of the mining process. Based on convolution, our algorithm requires only one pass over a time series of length n, with O(n log n) time complexity.

Since protein-protein interaction is intrinsic to most cellular processes, protein interaction prediction is an important issue in post-genomic biology where abundant interaction data has been produced by many research groups. In this paper, we present an associative feature mining method to predict implicit protein-protein interactions of S.cerevisiae from public protein-protein interaction data. To overcome the dimensionality problem of conventional data mining approach, we employ feature dimension reduction filter (FDRF) method based on the information theory to select optimal informative features and to speed up the overall mining procedure. As a mining method to predict interaction, we use association rule discovery algorithm for associative feature and rule mining. Using the discovered associative feature we predict implicit protein interactions which have not been observed in training data. According to the experimental results, the proposed method accomplishes about 94.8% prediction accuracy with reduced computation time which is 32.5% faster than conventional method that has no feature filter.

This is to satisfy federal trading regulations as well as to prevent crimes, such as insider trading and money laundry. Most existing trading surveillance systems are based on hand-coded expert-rules. Such systems are known to result in long developing process and extremely high "false positive" rates. We participate in co-developing a data mining based automatic trading surveillance system for one of the biggest banks in the US. The challenge of this task is to handle very skewed positive classes (< 0.01%) as well as very large volume of data (millions of records and hundreds of features). The combination of very skewed distribution and huge data volume poses new challenge for data mining; previous work addresses these issues separately, and existing solutions are rather complicated and not very straightforward to implement. In this paper, we propose a simple systematic approach to mine "very skewed distribution in very large volume of data".

However in most real-world problems, labelled data streams are rarely immediately available. Due to this reason, models are reconstructed only when labelled data become available periodically. This passive stream mining model has several drawbacks. We propose a new concept of demand-driven active data mining. In active mining, the loss of the model is either continuously guessed without using any true class labels or estimated, whenever necessary, from a small number of instances whose actual class labels are verified by paying an affordable cost. When the estimated loss is more than a tolerable threshold, the model evolves by using a small number of instances with verified true class labels.

Firstly, we analyze some properties of fuzzy association rules and give the definition of RFA rules. Secondly, using degree of implication on fuzzy implication operator, we introduce a new algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules from frequent itemsets. Finally, an example is given to illustrate our idea.

Previous work are frequency pattern [3], group pattern [9] and parallel pattern [5]. As mobile applications usage increases, the volume of dataset increases dramatically leading to lag time for processing. This paper presents an efficient model that uses the principle to attack the problem early in the process. The proposed model performs rninor data analysis and summary early before the source data arrives to the data mining machine. By the time the source data arrives to the data mining machine, it will be in the form of summary transactions, which reduces the amount of further processing required in order to perform data mining. Performance and evaluation shows that this proposed model is significantly more efficient than traditional model to perform mobile data mining.

But the normal and the intrusions in computer networks are hard to predict as the boundaries between them cannot be well defined. This prediction process may generate false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. This paper presented a method to realize that the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced with fuzzy logic. A set of fuzzy rules can be used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and fuzzy data mining algorithms can be applied over such rules to determine when an intrusion is in progress. In this paper, we have introduced modifications of these methods that mine fuzzy association rules and fuzzy frequent episodes and have described off-line methods that utilize these fuzzy methods for anomaly detection from audit data. We describe experiments that explore their applicability for intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy data mining can provide effective approximate anomaly detection.

In order to achieve more effective diabetes clinic management, data mining techniques have been applied to a patient database. In an attempt to improve the efficiency of data mining algorithms, a feature selection technique ReliefF is used with the data, which can rank the important attributes affecting Type 2 diabetes control. After selecting suitable attributes, classification techniques are applied to the data to predict how well the patients are controlling their condition. Preliminary results have been confirmed by the clinician and this provides optimism that data mining can be used to generate prediction models.

Some of researchers tried to provide prompt information through the tour guide access log. However, evaluating ubiquitous computing systems and their impact on a target population is difficult and costly because it requires analyzing real users in a real context. In this paper, we propose a guide system that combines the positioning technique and location-awareness service to provide the surrounding information for users. The guide system not only accepts the user's search query to find the target but also receives the information from other users who took notes during the tour guide. That is, users can download the related notes as references that were previously recorded by other users. Under such a design concept the contents of our guide system will keep on improving such that an interactive learning environment will be gradually established. Our purpose is thus to develop a Museum's service tour guide system and test its effectiveness in a real-world scenario, at reasonable costs, using available technology. The experimental results show that our proposed model is not only particularly suitable to scenic introductions in the museums, but also can be easily extended to outdoor teaching for students.

Some researchers shun the idea of incorporating explicit knowledge with a Genetic Program environment. At best, very domain specific knowledge is hard wired into the GP modeling process. This work proposes a new approach called the Genetically Engineerable Evolvable Program (GEEP). In this approach, explicit knowledge is made available to the GP. It is considered breadth-based, in that all pieces of knowledge are independent of each other. Several experiments are performed on a NASA-based data set using established equations from other researchers in order to predict software defects. All results are statistically validated.

The industry, academic institutions, small and large businesses and even residences have never been more at risk from the increasing onslaught of computer attacks than more recently. Such malicious efforts cause damage ranging from mere violation of confidentiality and issues of privacy up to actual financial losses if business operations are compromised. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been used along with data mining and machine learning efforts to detect intruders. However, with the limitation of organizational resources, it is unreasonable to inspect every network alarm raised by the IDS. Towards resource- and cost-sensitive IDS models, we investigate the Modified Expected Cost of Misclassification as a model selection measure for building a goal oriented intrusion detection classifier. The case study presented is that of the DARPA 1998 offline intrusion detection project. The empirical results show a promise for building a resource-based intrusion detection model.

New methods are needed for effective extraction of patterns and appropriate visualization tools are necessary to support knowledge construction throughout the exploration process. Based on an approach to combine visual and computational methods, a visualization environment has been developed to support visual data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. This environment integrates non-geographic information spaces with maps and other graphics that allow users to explore patterns and attribute relationships. The development of the tool intends to facilitate knowledge construction using a number of steps that underline data mining and knowledge discovery methodology. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the design concept, an empirical usability testing is planed to assess the tool's ability to meet user performance and satisfaction. In this test, different options of map-based and interactive visualizations of the output of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) are used to explore a socio-demographic dataset. The study emphasizes the knowledge discovery process based on exploratory tasks and visualization operations. This paper describes the usability framework used to guide the design, and examines key aspects of the evaluation of such visual-computational environment.

The proposed architecture hides the complexity of implementation details and enables users to perform data mining in a utility-like fashion. The service-oriented architecture provides an autonomic data mining framework where self-describing data mining services can be automatically discovered on the Internet. Moreover, this structure allows for the implementation of data mining algorithms for processing data on more than one site in a distributed manner. The performance of the proposed distributed data mining framework is compared to a standard data mining approach to demonstrate its effectiveness.

One of the most important attributes in ubiquitous computing is context-awareness. The application that the user's contexts are changed continuously over time normally requires a just-in-time recommendation. This paper describes a new just-in-time recommendation method using multi-agents for context-awareness in ubiquitous computing environment. For the just-in-time recommendation, we locally store the recommendation information that the user is likely to need in the near future based on predictions. To predict the information that be expected to be needed by the user, we use data mining methods. We propose a JITR Server Context Agent and a JITR Client Context Agent. They make the just-in-time recommendation continuously with the change of user's contexts and solve the limitation of storage. We explain our method with an example. Several experiments are performed and the experimental results show that our method has a good recommendation performance.

In these tests performance is often strongly related to or solely based on the accuracy of the classifier on a limited set of instances. The use of measure functions has been suggested as a promising approach to deal with this limitation. However, no usable implementation of a measure function has yet been presented. This article presents such an implementation and demonstrates its usage through a set of experiments. The results indicate that there are cases for which measure functions may be able to capture important aspects of the evaluated classifier that cannot be captured by cross-validation tests.

However, successful applications to business oriented classification problems are still limited. Most real world data sets exhibit vast class imbalances and an accurate identification of the economical relevant minority class is a major challenge within this domain. Based upon an empirical experiment, we evaluate the adequacy of SVMs to identify the respondents of a mailing campaign, massively underrepresented in our data set finding SVM to be capable of handling class imbalances in an internal manner providing robust and competitive results when compared to re-sampling methods which are commonly used to account for class imbalances. Consequently, the overall process of data pre-processing is simplified when applying a SVM classifier leading to less time consuming and more cost-efficient analysis.

Much attention presently has paid to it in compatible information system. However, in practice, many information systems are incompatible because of noise or incomplete data. In this paper, reduct and core computation for incompatible information systems is studied based on the algebraic view. A new method to construct discernibility matrix is proposed, which is a generalization of the methods presented by Hu(1995), Ye(2002) and Qing(2003). Moreover, the results are suitable for compatible information systems.

Aiming at preventing and overcoming premature convergence, the algorithm combines the niche technology into the selection mechanism of EP. In addition, our algorithm, like some previous work, does not need to have a complete variable ordering as input. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we conduct a series of experiments and compare them with previous work based on genetic algorithms (GA). The experimental results illustrate that both quality of the solutions and computational time of our algorithm are superior.

Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, it is time-consuming to update their knowledge. In order to solve this problem, an effective method for misuse intrusion detection with low cost and high efficiency is presented. This paper gives an overview of our research in building a detection model for identifying known intrusions, their variations and novel attacks with unknown natures. The method is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of detection rules from network packet features. After getting a decision table through preprocessing raw packet data, rough-set-based reduction and rule generation algorithms are applied, and useful rules for intrusion detection are obtained. In addition, a rough set and rule-tree-based incremental knowledge acquisition algorithm is presented in order to solve problems of updating rule set when new attacks appear. Compared with other methods, our method requires a smaller size of training data set and less effort to collect training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is effective and more suitable for online intrusion detection.

Hence, even before getting started, this choice biases what can be learned, becoming critical for some real-world applications like data mining. However, such bias may be minimized by hybridizing different knowledge representations via evolutionary mixing. This paper presents a first attempt to produce an evolutionary framework that evolves mixed decision trees of heterogeneous knowledge representations.

The molecular design is essentially based on data warehousing and data mining. Data warehousing techniques are needed to collect relevant data from distributed and heterogeneous databases. Data mining techniques are used to build predictive quantitative structure-property and activity relationship models. Increasingly, the computational resources (databases and analysis and modeling programs) needed for molecular engineering are geographically distributed Grid technology offers a framework to build distributed molecular engineering systems. The OpenMolGRID project is focused on integrating existing software modules into a Grid infrastructure, and on making a solid foundation for next step molecular engineering tools. This involves the design of a seamless and unified user interface and the provision of adapters to make software Grid-aware. The system will be used to develop prototype applications for the generation of molecular structures with given chemical properties or biological activities. It will be intensively tested by academic and industrial users on real applications (multi-drug resistance, G-protein-coupled receptors activity, and toxicity).

Thus, an essential requirement of current web applications is to provide users with instruments for personalized selective retrieval of web information. In this paper, a procedure for making personalized recommendations is proposed. The method is based on building a predictive model from an association model of Web data. It uses a set of association rules generated by a data mining algorithm that discovers knowledge in an incremental way. These rules provide models with relevant patterns that minimize the recommendation errors.

Various techniques have been proposed in this context in order to extract this information in the most efficient way. However efficiency is not our only concern in this study. The security and privacy issues over the extracted knowledge must be seriously considered as well. By taking this into consideration, we study the discovery of association rules in binary data sets and we propose algorithms for selectively hiding sensitive association rules. Association rule hiding is a well researched area in privacy preserving data mining and many algorithms have been proposed to address it. The algorithms that we introduce use a distortion-based technique for hiding the sensitive rules. The hiding process may introduce a number of side effects either by generating rules which were not previously existing (ghost rules) or by eliminating existing non-sensitive rules (lost rules): The proposed algorithms use effective data structures for the representation of the association rules and they strongly rely on the prioritization of the selection of the transactions to choose for falsification (victim transactions) by using weights. In this paper we show that our algorithms perform better than other similar algorithms in this field in eliminating non-sensitive rules without increasing the processing time significantly.

In general the rule generated by Association Rule Mining technique do not consider the negative occurrences of attributes in them, but by using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) over these rules the system can predict the rules which contains negative attributes. The main motivation for using GAs in the discovery of high-level prediction rules is that they perform a global search and cope better with attribute interaction than the greedy rule induction algorithms often used in data mining. The improvements applied in GAs are definitely going to help the rule based systems used for classification as described in results and conclusions.

Because of the huge volume of this information and the high rate of its growth, there is a great demand from enterprises for automated MI management systems. In this paper, an information portal for MI management systems is presented. It is based on a semantic web approach and provides the user a single access point for all relevant information about a specific MI topic. In contrast with traditional knowledge portal methods, our work is based on entity-level computing technologies rather than document-level technologies. We present a knowledge network called EntityNet, which is generated by an information synthesis process and enables the network to store entity-level knowledge and provide semantic services for the knowledge worker. From the systems perspective, EntityNet's most significant features are its customized document-processing flow and personalized category view. The framework can integrate various text collections, apply data-mining and dissemination functions on the collections with a defined process flow, and present a personalized browsing and searching interface.

At the moment the bibliography contains over 1400 entries from more than 450 authors. It is possible to create the bibliography in HTML or BibTeX format. In order to broaden the service contents it is possible to append new data using specially dedicated form. After appending data online the database is updated automatically. If one prefers sending a data file to the database administrator, please be aware that the database is updated once a month. In the current version of the RSDS system, there is the possibility for appending to each publication an abstract and keywords. As a natural consequence of this improvement there exists a possibility for searching a publication by keywords.

Many industries are using data mining tools for analyzing their vast databases and making business decisions. Mining association rules is an important data mining method where interesting associations or correlations are inferred from large databases. Though there are many algorithms for mining association rules, these algorithms have some shortcomings. Most of these algorithms usually find a large number of association rules and many of these rules are not interesting in practice. Hence, there is a need for human intervention in mining interesting association rules. Moreover, such intervention is most effective if the human analyst has a robust visualization tool for mining and visualizing association rules. In this paper we present a three-step visualization method for mining market basket association rules. These steps include discovering frequent itemsets, mining association rules and finally visualizing the mined association rules. Most previous visualization methods have concentrated only on visualizing association rules that have been already mined by using existing algorithms. Our method allows an analyst complete control in mining meaningful association rules through visualization of the mining process.

An approximate realization of random aggregating can be obtained through subsampled bagging, when large training sets are available. In this paper we perform an experimental bias-variance analysis of bagged and random aggregated ensembles of Support Vector Machines, in order to quantitatively evaluate their theoretical variance reduction properties. Experimental results with small samples show that random aggregating, implemented through subsampled bagging, reduces the variance component of the error by about 90%, while bagging, as expected, achieves a lower reduction. Bias-variance analysis explains also why ensemble methods based on subsampling techniques can be successfully applied to large data mining problems.

Most of them will be economically motivated, and will negotiate a variety of goods and services. It is therefore important to consider the economic incentives and behaviours of economic software agents, and to use all available means to anticipate their collective interactions. This paper addresses this concern by presenting a multi-agent market simulator designed for analysing agent market strategies based on a complete understanding of buyer and seller behaviours, preference models and pricing algorithms. The system includes agents that are capable of increasing their performance with their own experience, by adapting to the market conditions. The results of the negotiations between agents are analysed by data mining tools in order to extract rules that give agents feedback to improve their strategies.

It's initial focus is providing the necessary data-grid infrastructure and data-mining tools to support data generated by projects such as WFCAM, VISTA, e-MERLlN, SOHO and Cluster. AstroGrid is a partnership formed by UK archive centres and astronomical computer scientists. Key capabilities of AstroGrid enable multi-disciplinary astronomy, making use of data streams from frontline astronomical instrumentation. This paper presents the development and deployment plans of AstroGrid, describing the products and capabilities already released through the fifth project iteration release. Use of these in early adopter science programmes is noted. AstroGrid is a strongly science driven project that aims to deploy relevant aspects of Grid and Data-Grid technologies. These are discussed here, with an in-depth treatment of specific AstroGrid technological developments to support e.g. collaborative workspaces in the form of MySpace, being discussed elsewhere in this conference. Finally, Astro-Grid's close involvement in broader European initiatives, the Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (AVO) and the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) is highlighted.

Software quality models based upon data mining from past projects can identify fault-prone modules in current similar development efforts. So that resources can be focused on fault-prone modules to improve quality prior to release. Many researchers have applied the neural networks approach to predict software quality. Although neural networks have shown their strengths in solving complex problems, their shortcoming of being 'black boxes' models has prevented them from being accepted as a common practice for fault-prone software modules prediction. That is a significant weakness, for without the ability to produce comprehensible decisions, it is hard to trust the reliability of neural networks that address real-world problems. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable neural network model for software quality prediction. First, a three-layer feed-forward neural network with the sigmoid function in hidden units and the identity function in output unit was trained. The data used to train the neural network is collected from an earlier release of a telecommunications software system. Then use clustering genetic algorithm (CGA) to extract comprehensible rules from the trained neural network. We use the rule set extracted from the trained neural network to detect the fault-prone software modules of the later release and compare the predicting results with the neural network predicting results. The comparison shows that although the rule set's predicting accuracy is a little less than the trained neural network, it is more comprehensible.

Recent literature has provided a transaction-free approach to discover co-location patterns over spatial point data sets to avoid potential loss of proximity relationship information in partitioning continuous geographic space into transactions. This paper provides a more general transaction-free approach to mining data sets with extended spatial objects, e.g. line-strings and polygons. Key challenges include modeling of neighborhood and relationships among extended spatial objects as well as control of related geometric computation costs. The approach we propose is based on a new buffer-based definition of neighborhoods. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two pruning approaches, namely a prevalence-based pruning approach and a geometric filter-and-refine approach. Experimental evaluation with a real data set (a digital roadmap of the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan area) shows that the geometric filter-and-refine approach can speed up the prevalence-based pruning approach by a factor of 30 to 40. Finally, we show how the extended co-location mining algorithm proposed in this paper has been used to find line-string co-location patterns, which can help with decision-makings on selecting most challenging field test routes. These field test routes are important for evaluating a GPS-based approach to accessing road user charges.

However, it takes too much time in scanning database for finding the frequent itemsets. In this paper, based on SOM clustering, a novel algorithm is introduced. In this algorithm, each transaction is converted to an input vector, SOM is employed to train these input vectors, from which we achieve the visualization of the relationship between the items in a database. The time efficiency and the visualized map units make the proposed approach a particularly attractive alternative to current data mining algorithms.

This problem particularly attracts database community as it resembles traditional database querying. In this paper we consider a data mining system which supports storing of previous query results in the form of materialized data mining views. While numerous works have shown that reusing results of previous frequent itemset queries can significantly improve performance of data mining query processing, a thorough study of possible differences between the current query and a materialized view has not been presented yet. In this paper we classify possible differences into six classes, provide I/O cost analysis for all the classes, and experimentally evaluate the most promising ones.

Like many other fields, astronomy has become a very data rich science. Information content measured in multiple Terabytes, and even larger, multi Petabyte data sets are on the horizon. To cope with this data flood, Virtual Observatory (VO) federates data archives and services representing a new information infrastructure for astronomy of the 21st century and provides the platform to science discovery. Data mining promises to both make the scientific utilization of these data sets more effective and more complete, and to open completely new avenues of astronomical research. Technological problems range from the issues of database design and federation, to data mining and advanced visualization, leading to a new toolkit for astronomical research. This is similar to challenges encountered in other data intensive fields today. Outlier detection is of great importance. as one of four knowledge discovery tasks. The identification of outliers can often lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge in various fields. Especially in astronomy, the great interest of astronomers is to discover unusual, rare or unknown types of astronomical objects or phenomena. The outlier detection approaches in large datasets correctly meet the need of astronomers. In this paper we provide an overview of some techniques for automated identification of outliers in multivariate data. Outliers often provide useful information. Their identification is important not only for improving the analysis but also for indicating anomalies which may require further investigation. The technique may be used in the process of data preprocessing and also be used for preselecting special object candidates.

J	Hewett, R				Hewett, R			Data mining for generating predictive models of local hydrology	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 07-10, 2001	TUCSON, AZ	IEEE, Raytheon		data mining; machine learning; inductive technique; decision tables	RAINFALL	The problem of downscaling the effects of global scale climate variability into predictions of local hydrology has important implications for water resource management. Our research aims to identify predictive relationships that can be used to integrate solar and ocean-atmospheric conditions into forecasts of regional water flows. In recent work we have developed an induction technique called second-order table compression, in which learning can be viewed as a process that transforms a table consisting of training data into a second-order table ( which has sets of atomic values as entries) with fewer rows by merging rows in consistency preserving ways. Here, we apply the second-order table compression technique to generate predictive models of future water inflows of Lake Okeechobee, a primary source of water supply for south Florida. We also describe SORCER, a second-order table compression learning system and compare its performance with three well-established data mining techniques: neural networks, decision tree learning and associational rule mining. SORCER gives more accurate results, on the average, than the other methods with average accuracy between 49% and 56% in the prediction of inflows discretized into four ranges. We discuss the implications of these results and the practical issues in assessing the results from data mining models to guide decision-making.

Flexibility is achieved by an open-ended design for extensibility, thus enabling integration of existing data-mining algorithms, new locally developed algorithms, and utility functions such as visualization and preprocessing. Support for new databases is simple and clean: the system interfaces with a standard database server via SQL queries and thus can handle any application database. With a view of serving remote, as well as local, users, internet availability was a design goal. By implementing the system in Java, minor modifications allow us to run the user-end of the system either as a Java applications or (with some limitations on the user) as a Java Applet.

The notion of a metaquery has been proposed as a template or a second-order proposition in a language C that describes the type of pattern to be discovered. This tool has already been successfully applied to several real-world applications. In this paper we advance the state of the art in metaquery research in several ways. First, we argue that the notion of a support value for metaqueries, where a support value is intuitively some indication to the relevance of the rules to be discovered, is not adequately defined in the literature, and, hence, propose our own definition. Second, we analyze some of the related computational problems, classify them as NP-hard and point out some tractable cases. Third, we propose some efficient algorithms for computing support and present preliminary experimental results that indicate the usefulness of our algorithms. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, RS; Hu, YC				Chen, RS; Hu, YC			A novel method for discovering fuzzy sequential patterns using the simple fuzzy partition method	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							IF-THEN RULES; CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; INFERENCE SYSTEM; SETS	Sequential patterns refer to the frequently occurring patterns related to time or other sequences, and have been widely applied to solving decision problems. For example, they can help managers determine which items were bought after some items had been bought. However, since fuzzy sequential patterns described by natural language are one type of fuzzy knowledge representation, they are helpful in building a prototype fuzzy knowledge base in a business. Moreover, each fuzzy sequential pattern consisting of several fuzzy sets described by the natural language is well suited for the thinking of human subjects and will help to increase the flexibility for users in making decisions. Additionally, since the comprehensibility of fuzzy representation by human users is a criterion in designing a fuzzy system, the simple fuzzy partition method is preferable. In this method, each attribute is partitioned by its various fuzzy sets with pre-specified membership functions. The advantage of the simple fuzzy partition method is that the linguistic interpretation of each fuzzy set is easily, obtained. The main aim of this paper is exactly to propose a fuzzy data mining technique to discover fuzzy sequential patterns by using the simple partition method. Two numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.

J	Rantzau, R; Shapiro, LD; Mitschang, B; Wang, Q				Rantzau, R; Shapiro, LD; Mitschang, B; Wang, Q			Algorithms and applications for universal quantification in relational databases	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						query operators; grouping; relational division; set containment join; frequent itemset discovery		Queries containing universal quantification are used in many applications, including business intelligence applications and in particular data mining. We present a comprehensive survey of the structure and performance of algorithms for universal quantification. We introduce a framework that results in a complete classification of input data for universal quantification. Then we go on to identify the most efficient algorithm for each such class. One of the input data classes has not been covered so far. For this class, we propose several new algorithms. Thus, for the first time, we are able to identify the optimal algorithm to use for any given input dataset. These two classifications of optimal algorithms and input data are important for query optimization. They allow a query optimizer to make the best selection when optimizing at intermediate steps for the quantification problem. In addition to the classification, we show the relationship between relational division and the set containment join and we illustrate the usefulness of employing universal quantifications by presenting a novel approach for frequent itemset discovery.

Many XML documents have complex schemas that are not always known, and can vary widely between information sources and applications. In contrast, database applications rely mainly on the flat relational model. We propose a novel, partially supervised approach for extracting user-defined relations from XML documents with unknown schema. The extracted relations can be directly used by an RDBMS, or utilized for information integration or data mining tasks. Our method attempts to automatically capture the lexical and structural features that indicate the relevant portions of the input document, based on a few user-annotated examples. This information can then be used to extract the relation of interest from documents with schemas potentially different from the training examples. We present preliminary experiments showing that our method could be capable of extracting the target relation from XML documents even in the presence of significant variations in the document schemas.

Despite the important developments in the last years, the best algorithm in the area (Prefix-Span) does not deal with gap constraints and consequently doesn't allow for the introduction of background knowledge into the process. In this paper we present the generalization of the PrefixSpan algorithm to deal with gap constraints, using a new method to generate projected databases. Studies on performance and scalability were conducted in synthetic and real-life datasets, and the respective results are presented.

The rich and diverse information content within this "virtual sky" and the array of results to be derived therefrom will far exceed the current capacity of data search and research tools. The new digital surveys have the potential of facilitating a wide range of scientific discoveries about the Universe! To enable this to happen, the astronomical community is embarking on an ambitious endeavor, the creation of a National Virtual Observatory (NVO). This will in fact develop into a Global Virtual Observatory. To facilitate the new type of science enabled by the NVO, new techniques in data mining and knowledge discovery in large databases must be developed and deployed, and the next generation of astronomers must be trained in these techniques. This activity will benefit greatly from developments in the fields of information technology, computer science, and statistics. Aspects of the NVO initiative, including sample science user scenarios and user requirements will be presented. The value of scientific data mining and some early test case results will be discussed in the context of the speaker's research interests in colliding and merging galaxies.

Consideration of a spatial dimension becomes important when data either refer to specific locations and/or have significant spatial dependence which needs to be considered if meaningful patterns are to emerge. For point data there are two main groups of approaches. One stems from traditional statistical techniques such as k-means clustering in which every point is assigned to a spatial grouping and results in a spatial segmentation. The other broad approach searches for 'hotspots' Which can be loosely defined as a localised excess of some incidence rate. Not all points are necessarily assigned to clusters. This paper presents a novel variable resolution approach to cluster discovery which acts in the first instance to define spatial concentrations within the data thus allowing the nature of clustering to be defined. The cluster centroids are then used to establish initial cluster centres in a k-means clustering and arrive at a segmentation on the basis of point attributes. The variable resolution technique can thus be viewed as a bridge between the two broad approaches, towards knowledge discovery in mining point data sets. Applications of the technique to date include the mining of business, crime, health and environmental data.

This paper proposes a method of constructing metadata for a specific topic. The method uses Web pages that are located in a site and are linked from a listing page. Web pages of recipes, real estates, used cars, hotels and syllabi are typical examples of such pages. We call them a series of Web documents. A series of Web pages have the same appearance when a user views them with a browser, because it is often the case that they are written with the same tag pattern. The method uses the tag-pattern as the common structure of the Web pages. Individual contents of the pages appear as plain texts embedded between two consecutive tags. If we remove the tags, it becomes a sequence of plain texts. The plain texts in the same relative position can be interpreted as attribute values if we presume that the pages represent records of the same kind. Most of these plain texts in the same position vary page to page. But, it may happen that the same texts show up at the same relative position in almost all pages. These constant texts can be considered as attribute names. "Location", "Rating" and "Travel from Airport" are examples of such constant texts for pages of hotel information. If the frequency of a text is higher than a threshold, we accept it as a component of metadata. If we mark a constant text with "N" and a variable text with "V", the sequence of plain texts forms a series of N's and V's. A page in a series contain two kinds of NV sequence pattern. The first pattern is (NV)(n), which we call vertical, where an attribute value follows the attribute name immediately. The second pattern is (NVn)-V-n, which we call horizontal, where names occur in the first row and the same number of values follow in the next row. Thus we can understand the meaning of values and can construct records from a series of Web pages.

When analyzing the data, ignoring the records with the missing data values may not be a feasible solution since the ignored records might have essential information for the analysis. There are several statistical based methods to remedy the problem of missing values. In our paper, we propose a method that uses association rules, a data mining technique, to predict the missing value for a particular attribute in a given database. Using our proposed method for each attribute with missing values, all missing values can be predicted with a certain confidence level.

Usually, updates are collected and applied to the data warehouse periodically in a batch mode. As a consequence, all mined patterns discovered in the data warehouse (e.g. clustering structures) have to be updated as well. In this paper, we present a method for incrementally updating the clustering structure computed by the hierarchical clustering algorithm OPTICS. We determine the parts of the cluster ordering that are affected by update operations and develop efficient algorithms that incrementally update an existing cluster ordering. A performance evaluation of incremental OPTICS based on synthetic datasets as well as on a real-world dataset demonstrates that incremental OPTICS gains significant speed-up factors over OPTICS for update operations.

Unfortunately, many of the databases available for mining today violate this assumption. They were gathered over months or years, and the underlying processes generating them may have changed during this time, sometimes radically (this is also known as a concept drift). In clinical institutions, where the patients' data are regularly stored in a central computer databases, similar situations may occur. Expert physicians may easily, even unconsciously, adapt to the changed environment, whereas Machine Learning and Data Mining tools may fail due to their underlaying assumptions. It is therefore important to detect and adapt to the changed situation. In the paper we review several techniques for dealing with concept drift in Machine Learning and Data Mining frameworks and evaluate their use in clinical studies with a case study of coronary artery disease diagnostics.

Yet there exist two big problems in process of acquiring rule by traditional mining algorithms, i.e., the quantity and the quality of rule. Presently there are many methods focus on resolving these two problems. Although these methods can reduce the amount of rules derived to some extent, but the total number is too big as ever. In this paper, we first propose the notations of upper closed itemset and generalized association rule base, and obtain a generalized association rule base of a database, which not only contains the whole information of all association rules, but also has conform structure that is convenient for practical applications. Also, We propose a mining algorithm of generalized association rule base. From our propositions and example, the algorithm is shown valid and can efficiently solve the problem of quantity of rule.

Analysis of the data from the World Wide Web faces certain challenges that are not commonly observed in conventional data analysis. The likelihood of bad or incomplete web usage data is higher than in conventional applications. The clusters and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. Researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets for clustering of web resources. This paper presents clustering using a fuzzy c-means algorithm, on secondary data consisting of access logs from the World Wide Web. This type of analysis is called web usage mining, which involves applying data mining techniques to discover usage patterns from web data. The fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to the web visitors to three educational websites. The analysis shows the ability of the fuzzy c-means clustering to distinguish different user characteristics of these sites.

The genetic program uses information gain as the basis of its fitness. The classification algorithms used are C5, CART, CHAID and a MLP. The results show that, for the majority of the data sets used, all algorithms benefit by the inclusion of the evolved attributes. However, for one data set, whilst the performance of C5 improves, the performance of the other techniques deteriorates. Whilst this is not statistically significant, it does indicate that care must be taken when a pre-processing technique (attribute construction using GP) and the classification technique (in this case, C5) use the same fundamental technology, in this case Information Gain.

Therefore, there is a requirement for querying previously generated mining results or for querying the database against discovered patters. In this paper, we focus on developing methods for the storage and querying of large collections of sequential patterns. We describe a family of algorithms, which address the problem of considering the ordering among elements, that is crucial when dealing with sequential patterns. Moreover, we take into account the fact that the distribution of elements within sequential patterns is highly skewed, to propose a novel approach for the effective encoding of patterns. Experimental results, which examine a variety of factors, illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In our previous work, we have developed how to segment the incoming raw video stream into meaningful pieces, and how to extract and represent some feature (i.e., motion) for characterizing the segmented pieces. We extend this work as follows. To extract motions, we use an accumulation of quantized pixel differences among all frames in a video segment. As a result, the accumulated motions of segment are represented as a two dimensional matrix. We can get very accurate amount of motion in a segment using this matrix. Further, we develop how to capture the location of motions occurring in a segment using the same matrix generated for the calculation of the amount. We study how to cluster those segmented pieces using the features (the amount and the location of motions) we extract by the matrix above. We investigate an algorithm to find whether a segment has normal or abnormal events by clustering and modeling normal events, which occur mostly. In addition to deciding normal or abnormal, the algorithm computes Degree of Abnormality of a segment, which represents to what extent a segment is distant to the existing segments in relation with normal events. Our experimental studies indicate that the proposed techniques are promising.

The goal of this paper is to show that using unlabeled data can be beneficial in a range of important prediction problems and therefore should be an integral part of the learning process. Given an unlabeled dataset representative of the underlying distribution and a K-class labeled sample that might be biased, our approach is to learn K contrast classifiers each trained to discriminate a certain class of labeled data from the unlabeled population. We illustrate that contrast classifiers can be useful in one-class classification, outlier detection, density, estimation, and learning from biased data. The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated by an extensive evaluation on synthetic data followed by real-life bioinformatics applications for (1) ranking PubMed articles by, their relevance to protein disorder and (2) cost-effective enlargement of a disordered protein database.

However, the problem of tuning parameters manually limits its application in practical environment. In this paper, under analyzing the limitation of these existing approaches, a new methodology to tuning kernel parameters, based on the computation of the gradient of penalty function with respect to the RBF kernel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results reveal the feasibility of this new approach and demonstrate an improvement of generalization ability.

It is quite effective to find bow current and past values in the streams of data are related to the future. However, these kind of data sets with high dimensionality are enormous in size results in possibly large number of mined dependencies. This strongly motivates the need of efficient parallel algorithms. In this paper, we propose two parallel algorithms to discover dependency from the large amount of time series data. We introduce the method of extracting sequence of symbols from the time series data by using segmentation and clustering processes. To reduce the search space and speed tip the process we investigate the technique to group the time series data. The experimental results conducted on a shared memory multiprocessors system justifies the inevitability of using parallel techniques for mining huge amount of data in the time series domain.

If the vibrometry sensor has a high enough sampling rate, an accurate estimate of the surface vibration is measured. For vehicles with running engines, an automatic target recognition algorithm can use these measurements to produce identification estimates. The level of identification possible is a function of the distinctness of the vibration signature. This signature is dependent upon many factors, such as engine type and vehicle weight. In this paper, we present results of using data mining techniques to assess the identification potential of vibrometry data. Our technique starts with unlabeled vibrometry measurements taken from a variety of vehicles. Then an unsupervised clustering algorithm is run on features extracted from this data. The final-step is to analyze the produced-clusters and determine if physical vehicle characteristics can be mapped onto the clusters.

Our objective is to induce models that are accurate at predicting these outliers but are also interpretable from the user perspective. We describe a new splitting criterion for regression trees that enables the induction of trees achieving these goals. We evaluate our proposal on several real world problems and contrast the obtained models with standard regression trees. The results of this evaluation show the clear advantage of our proposal in terms of the evaluation statistics that are relevant for these applications.

The discovery from these rules requires deep interpretation from domain knowledge. Although several solutions have been proposed in the studies on data mining and knowledge discovery, these studies are not focused on similarities between rules obtained. When one rule r(1) has reasonable features and the other rule r(2) with high similarity to r(1) includes unexpected factors, the relations between these rules will become a trigger to the discovery of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach to show the similar relations between rules based on multidimensional scaling, which assign a two-dimensional cartesian coordinate to each data point from the information about similiaries between this data and others data. We evaluated this method on two medical data sets, whose experimental results show that knowledge useful for domain experts could be found.

It was shown that, for an ensemble to be successful, it should consist of accurate and diverse base classifiers. However, it is also important that the integration procedure in the ensemble should properly utilize the ensemble diversity. In this paper, we present an algorithm for the dynamic integration of classifiers in the space of extracted features (FEDIC). It is based on the technique of dynamic integration, in which local accuracy estimates are calculated for each base classifier of an ensemble, in the neighborhood of a new instance to be processed. Generally, the whole space of original features is used to find the neighborhood of a new instance for local accuracy estimates in dynamic integration. In this paper, we propose to use feature extraction in order to cope with the curse of dimensionality in the dynamic integration of classifiers. We consider classical principal component analysis and two eigenvector-based supervised feature extraction methods that take into account class information. Experimental results show that, on some data sets, the use of FEDIC leads to significantly higher ensemble accuracies than the use of plain dynamic integration in the space of original features. As a rule, FEDIC outperforms plain dynamic integration on data sets, on which both dynamic integration works (it outperforms static integration), and considered feature extraction techniques are able to successfully extract relevant features.

Our method consists of three steps. Firstly, we take a set of rules, copy these rules into a population of rules, and then perturb the parameters of individuals in this population. Secondly, the maximum robustness bounds for the rules is then found using genetic algorithms, where the performance of each individual is measured with respect to the training data. Finally, the relationship between maximum robustness bounds and generalization capability is constructed using statistical analysis for a large number of rules. The significance of this relationship is that it allows the algorithms that mine rules to be compared in terms of robustness bounds, independent of the test data. This technique is applied in a case study to a protein sequence classification problem.

It has the ability to deal with imprecise, uncertain, and vague information. It has been applied in such fields as machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analyzing and control algorithm acquiring successfully. In this paper, we will make a comparative study of the algebra view and information view of rough set theory. Some inequivalent relationships between these two views of rough set theory in inconsistent decision table systems are discovered. It corrects an error of many researchers, that is, the algebra view and information view of rough set theory are equivalent. It is helpful for developing heuristic knowledge reduction algorithms for inconsistent decision table systems.

The high computational complexity of this algorithm is a well-known problem. The B&B algorithm constructs a search tree, and then searches for the optimal feature subset in the tree. Previous work on the B&B algorithm was focused on how to simplify the search tree in order to reduce the search complexity. Several improvements have already existed. A detailed analysis of basic B&B algorithm and existing improvements is given under a common framework in which all the algorithms are compared. Based on this analysis, an improved B&B algorithm, BBPP+, is proposed. Experimental comparison shows that BBPP+ performs best.

Most traditional mode choice models are based on the principle of random utility maximization derived from econometric theory. Alternatively, mode choice modeling can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem in which multiple human behavioral patterns reflected by explanatory variables determine the choices between alternatives or classes. The capability and performance of two emerging pattern recognition data mining methods, decision trees (DT) and neural networks (NN), for work travel mode choice modeling were investigated. Models based on these two techniques are specified, estimated, and comparatively evaluated with a traditional multinomial logit (MNL) model. For comparison, a unique three-layer formulation of the MNL model is presented. The similarities and differences of the models' mechanisms and structures are identified, and the mechanisms and structures in the models' specifications and estimations are compared. Two performance measures, individual prediction rate and aggregate prediction rate, which represent the prediction accuracies for individual and mode aggregate levels, respectively, were applied to evaluate and compare the performances of the models. Diary data sets from the San Francisco, California, Bay Area Travel Survey 2000 were used for model estimation and evaluation. The prediction results show that the two data mining models offer comparable but slightly better performances than the MNL model in terms of the modeling results, while the DT model demonstrates the highest estimation efficiency and most explicit interpretability, and the NN model gives a superior prediction performance in most cases.

Such data is called tree structured data. Analyzing large tree structured data is a time-consuming process in data mining. If we can reduce the size of input data without loss of information, we can speed up such a heavy process. In this paper, we consider a problem of effective compression of an ordered rooted tree, which represents given tree structured data, without loss of information. Firstly, in order to define this problem in a grammar-based compression scheme, we present a variable replacement grammar (VRG for short) over ordered rooted trees. The grammar-based compression problem for an ordered rooted tree T is defined as a problem of finding a VRG which generates only T and whose size is minimum. For the grammar-based compression problem for an ordered rooted tree, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm with approximation ratio less than 8593/8592 unless P=NP. Secondly, based on this theoretical result, we present an effective compression algorithm for finding a VRG which generates only a given ordered rooted tree and whose size is as small as possible. Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of our grammar-based compression algorithm, we report some experimental results.

These techniques work quite well given the case that one has a model or a valid representation of activity. However, in reality for the majority of the time this is not the case. Models that do exist, in many cases were hand crafted, required many man-hours to develop and they are very brittle in the dynamic world in which we live. Data mining techniques have shown some promise in providing a set of solutions. In this paper we will provide the details for our motivation, theory and techniques which we have developed, as well as the results of a set of experiments.

This strategy can satisfy general users in extracting specific knowledge (e. g. diagnosis, treatment, health education, hospital administration, etc.). Wide application is one of the key promoters of a successful medical information system. Risk factors of heart disease can be identified by important variable selection techniques. Four techniques, Chi-square test, correlation analysis, stepwise discriminant analysis, and decision trees, were used in this study. One must compile the results of the different methods to deal with specific research questions in a logical way. It is expected that this approach may reduce the uncertainties obtained from a single method. When applying the important index derived from the four different method results to several applications, all results have been confirmed by current medical knowledge or otherwise provide meaningful information. The prime purpose of this study is not disease diagnosis, but to enable the general health practitioner (medical doctor, hospital administrator, etc.) to formulate their hypothesis.

With initial guidance from a domain user or domain expert, the BA algorithm is given one or more metrics to partition the entire dataset. The weighted rules are in the form of Boolean expressions. To augment the analysis of the rules produced, we applied a probabilistic interestingness measure (PIM) to order the generated rules based on event dependency, where events are combinations of primed and unprimed variables. Interpretation of the dependency rules generated on the clinical head trauma data resulted in a set of criteria that identified minor head trauma patients needing computed tomography (CT) scans. The BA criteria contained fewer variables than were found using recursive partitioning of Chi-square values (five variables versus seven variables, respectively). The BA five-variable criteria set was more sensitive but less specific than the seven-variable Chi-square criteria set. We believe that the BA method has broad applicability in the medical domain, and hope that this paper will stimulate other creative applications of the technique. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To develop electronic medical guidelines and to make them available for physicians using the Internet can further enhance the quality and efficiency of health care, especially with the simultaneous use of electronic health records. Objectives: This study aims to outline the needs for web-based systems that support the use of medical guidelines in practice; and to focus on the development of web-based electronic medical guidelines for treatment of arterial hypertension. Methods: The importance of electronic health record in cardiology for data acquisition, data storage and data mining is considered. The anonymized database of approximately 1800 hypertensive patients has been created to compare medical practice with guidelines and discover features of diseases that can help with their management. Using this database we evaluated several web-based electronic guidelines systems. Results: The 1999 WHO/ISH Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension were formalized and interpreted using the Guide-X methodology, using the Apollo system and web-based electronic guidelines. The web-based electronic guidelines were tested on the smaller anonymous recent data set of 840 hypertensive patients. Conclusions: An easy transfer of knowledge from medical guidelines to structured electronic guidelines opens new possibilities for easy reusability of medical knowledge by general practitioners and clinicians.

Therefore, this paper presents an "anytime" framework for mining very large databases which are shared by multi-users. Anytime mining has been designed to generate approximate results such that these results can be accessed at any time while the system is autonomously mining a database.

J	Nemati, HR; Barko, CD				Nemati, HR; Barko, CD			Enhancing enterprise decisions through organizational data mining	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Organizational Data Mining (ODM) is defined as leveraging data mining (DM) tools and technologies to enhance the decision-making process by transforming data into valuable and actionable knowledge to gain a strategic competitive advantage. Presently, the majority of ODM projects focus on customers and profitability, such as customer segmentation, time-dependence studies, customer retention and attrition management, risk forecasting, and profitability analysis (5). This article defines and elaborates on the purpose, utility and industry status of ODM and how organizations are benefiting from it through enhanced enterprise decision-making. To better understand the current status of this dynamic and evolving industry and the issues shaping it, a study was conducted. The study identifies current technical and business issues related to ODM projects and how they influence organizational decisions. ne results of the survey suggest that ODM can improve the quality and accuracy of decisions for any organization willing to make the investment.

The MGST description provides a systems theoretic image of a data mining system. The implementation indicates that the MGST can be another Unified Modeling Language (UML) of an information system. The MGST approach has an advantage over the conventional UML because the former uses the set theory as a description tool while the latter uses diagrams. The set theory is more precise, more operational and has a more descriptive capability than diagrams. The MGST is, therefore, desirable for development of an information system because it can be implemented easily with extProlog.

This distance in addition to providing information about the proximity of patterns should also obey some mathematical criteria in order to be applicable. Traditional distances are inadequate to access the differences between symbolic patterns. This work proposes the utilization of a statistically extracted distance measure for Generalized Radial Basis Function (GRBF) networks. The main properties of these networks are retained in the new metric space. Especially, their regularization potential can be realized with this type of distance. However, the examples of the training, set for applications involving symbolic patterns are not all of the same importance and reliability. Therefore, the construction of effective decision boundaries should consider the numerous exceptions to the general motifs of classification that are frequently encountered in data mining applications. The paper supports that heuristic Instance Based Learning (IBL) training approaches can uncover information within the uneven structure of the training set. This information is exploited for the estimation of an adequate subset of the training patterns serving as RBF centers and for the estimation of effective parameter settings for those centers. The IBL learning steps are applicable to both the traditional and the statistical distance metric spaces and improve significantly the performance in both cases, The obtained results with this two-level learning method are significantly better than the traditional nearest neighbour schemes in many data mining problems.

These preliminary results, using a simple, heterogeneous system of processors, existing freeware and an extremely low initial cost in both manpower and hardware dollars, motivate us to more ambitious work with considerably larger-scale computer earthquake simulations of southern California. The GEM computational problem, which is essentially a Monte Carlo simulation, is well suited to optimization on parallel computers and we outline how we are proceeding in implementing this new software architecture.

We develop an intelligent middleware that facilitates linear correlation discovery, the discovery of associations between attributes and attribute groups. This middleware integrates data management and data analysis tools to improve traditional data analysis in three perspectives: (1) identify appropriate linear correlation functions to perform based on the semantics of a data set; (2) execute appropriate functions contained in the data analysis packages; and (3) derive useful knowledge from data analysis. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Many algorithms have been developed for such task and they typically assume that the underlying associations hidden in the data are stable over time. However, in real world domains, it is possible that the data characteristics and hence the associations change significantly over time. Existing data mining algorithms have not taken the changes in associations into consideration and this can result in severe degradation of performance, especially when the discovered association rules are used for classification (prediction). Although the mining of changes in associations is an important problem because it is common that we need to predict the future based on the historical data in the past, existing data mining algorithms are not developed for this task. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy data mining technique to discover changes in association rules over time. Our approach mines fuzzy rules to represent the changes in association rules. Based on the discovered fuzzy rules, our approach is able to predict how the association rules will change in the future. The experimental results on a real-life database have shown that our approach is very effective in mining and predicting changes in association rules over time.

This problem is highly relevant in such a dynamic and heterogeneous environment as the Web. The approach we propose relies on the use of a classification mechanism based on document structure and on the use of data mining association rules to find out frequent structural patterns in data.

This paper presents the notion of temporal association rules (TARs), which is aimed to reflect relationships between data attributes with time dimensions. Primary attention is paid to TARS of the form X double right arrow Y(T > 0), where T is a time lag between the occurrence of X and the occurrence of Y. Subsequently, a mining algorithm is provided to discover such TARS with the experimental result revealing its computational advantage over that of the traditional algorithms.

In this paper, we use the framework of Bayesian networks to examine the problem of integrating the learning outputs for multiple overlapping datasets. In particular, we provide rules for extracting causal information about the true (unknown) Bayesian network from the previously learned (partial) Bayesian networks. We also provide the SLPR algorithm, which efficiently uses these previously learned Bayesian networks to guide learning of the full structure. A complexity analysis of the "worst-case" scenario for the SLPR algorithm reveals that the algorithm is always less complex than a comparable "reference" algorithm (though no absolute optimality proof is known). Although no "expected-case" analysis is given, the complexity analysis suggests that (given the currently available set of algorithms) one should always use the SLPR algorithm, regardless of the underlying generating structure. The results provided in this paper point to a wide range of open questions, which are briefly discussed.

One approach to obtaining this level of detail is to reconstruct brain volumes from serial electron microscopic sections. Current techniques allow the creation of relatively small ultrastructural volumes, but these contain an enormous wealth of data. Many different kinds of data, including neuron membrane structure, synaptic connectivity, organelle distributions, etc., can be extracted from a single database using this representation. The ultimate size of the ultrastructural database of the brain depends on the advancement of techniques for data creation as well as the development of informatics tools for ultrastructural data mining.
