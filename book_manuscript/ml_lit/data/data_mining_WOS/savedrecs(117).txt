The problem arises naturally in applications that need to collect large amounts of data from multiple concurrent sources, such as sensors, servers and network routers, and archive them over a long period of time for offline data mining. We present CAMPS, a general framework that addresses this problem by combining several novel techniques. First, it dynamically groups multiple signals together so that signals within each group are correlated and can be maximally compressed jointly. Second, it appropriately scales the amplitudes of different signals within a group and compresses them within the maximum allowed reconstruction error bound. Our schemes are polynomial time O(alpha, beta) approximation schemes, meaning that the maximum (L-infinity) error is at most alpha epsilon and it uses at most beta times the optimal memory. Finally, GAMPS maintains an index so that various queries can be issued directly on compressed data. Our experiments on several real-world sensor datasets show that CAMPS significantly reduces space without compromising the quality of search and query.

It is an important activity for data preprocessing used in software quality modeling and other data mining problems. Feature selection algorithms can be divided into two categories, feature ranking and feature subset selection. Feature ranking orders the features by a criterion and a user selects some of the features that are appropriate for a given scenario. Feature subset selection techniques search the space of possible feature subsets and evaluate the suitability of each. This paper investigates performance metric based feature ranking techniques by using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) learner with nine different performance metrics. The nine performance metrics include Overall Accuracy (OA), Default F-Measure (DFM), Default Geometric Mean (DGM), Default Arithmetic Mean (DAM), Area Under ROC (AUC), Area Under PRC (PRC), Best F-Measure (BFM), Best Geometric Mean (BGM) and Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM). The goal of the paper is to study the effect of the different performance metrics on the feature ranking results, which in turn influences the classification performance. We assessed the performance of the classification models constructed on those selected feature subsets through an empirical case study that was carried out on six data sets of real-world software systems. The results demonstrate that AUC, PRC, BFM, BGM and BAM as performance metrics for feature ranking outperformed the other performance metrics, OA, DFM, DGM and DAM, unanimously across all the data sets and therefore are recommended based on this study. In addition, the performances of the classification models were maintained or even improved when over 85 percent of the,features were eliminated from the original data sets.

Cloud computing has demonstrated great advantages in processing very large datasets. When considering taking advantage of the high performance data cloud to do data mining, there are different approaches to make an existing data mining algorithm parallelizable in a cloud computing environment. One concern is how to achieve better performance by making use of the data in a more intelligent way. In this paper, we describe two different approaches to parallelize the existing random decision tree mining algorithm, which we have built on the Sector/Sphere cloud computing environment. We compare the cost and accuracy between those two different implementations and analyze the result of this experimental study.

More accurately, depending oil the kind of attack it targets, ail NIDS can be oriented to detect misuses (by defining all possible attacks) or anomalies (by modelling legitimate behaviour and detecting those that do not fit on that model). Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this, we present here ESIDE-Depian, the first unified misuse and anomaly prevention system based on Bayesian Networks to analyse completely network packets, and the strategy to create a consistent knowledge model that integrates misuse and anomaly-based knowledge. The training process of the Bayesian network may become intractable very fast in some extreme situations; we present also a method to cope with this problem. Finally, we evaluate ESIDE-Depian against well-known and new attacks showing how it outperforms a well-established industrial NIDS.

Traditional methods of traversal patterns mining only considered unweighted traversals. The support measure in weighted cases no longer satisfies the anti-monotone property and previous algorithms cannot be applied. In this paper, a transformational model between EWDG (Edge-Weighted Directed Graph) and VWDG (Vertex-Weighted Directed Graph) is proposed. Based on the model, we explore the problem of mining interesting patterns-frequent patterns and closed frequent patterns form traversals on WDG and propose two algorithms respectively called WTFPMiner (Weighted Traversal Frequent Patterns Miner) and CWTFPMiner (Closed Weighted Traversal Frequent Patterns Miner). WTFPMiner devises a novel property between weighted patterns-scalable property, which is similar to the well-known downward closure property, to convert weighted pattern mining problem into corresponding pattern scalability decision problem, and finally exploits this property to mine the weighted frequent patterns efficiently from traversals on WDG. Based on an improved model of weighted support, algorithm CWTFPMiner adopts a divide-and-conquer paradigm in a pattern growth manner to mine closed weighted frequent patterns efficiently from the traversals on weighted directed graph. It incorporates the closure property with weight constrain to dramatically reduce search space and extracts succinct and lossless patterns from traversal transactions of WDG. Our performance study shows that the two algorithms are efficient and scalable for the problem of mining frequent patterns based on weighted directed graph traversals. Moreover, they can be applied in diversiform environments which can be modeled as a WDG.

Some algorithms and techniques were developed, taking into consideration the texture features of the iris image in the human eye. Nonetheless, such features, due to the fact that they are static, they are also susceptible to fraud. That is, a picture can replace the iris in an analysis. For that reason, this paper proposes a method for extracting the texture features of the iris during the pupil contraction and dilation, in addition to the dynamic contraction and dilation features themselves. Therefore, it was developed a new image acquisition system through NIR (Near Infra-Red) illumination, considering the Consensual Reflex of the eyes. The features are measured according to a dynamic illumination standard controlled by the software and are afterwards selected by means of data mining. Then it is possible to increase the safety in the biometric recognition devices of people through their iris, for only living irises can be utilized. The results show a significant precision index in determining such features, despite being inferior to the ones obtained by means of static methodology.

The valued tolerance relation method of handling missing attribute values was not yet experimentally compared with other methods. The main objective of this paper was to compare the quality of two methods handling missing attribute values, one of them was the valued tolerance method, the other method was the MLEM2 approach, using the same interpretation of missing attribute values but a different approach to computing approximations and rule induction. Both methods were compared using not only an error rate, a result of ten-fold cross validation, but also complexity of induced rule sets. Our conclusion is that neither of these two methods is better in terms of the error rate. However, the MLEM2 approach produces, in most cases, less complex rule sets than the valued tolerance method.

The class imbalance problem is pervasive and ubiquitous, causing trouble to a large segment of the data mining community. As the conventional machine learning algorithms have bad performance when they learn from imbalanced data sets, it is necessary to find solutions to machine learning on imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a novel Isomapbased hybrid re-sampling approach to improve the conventional SMOTE algorithm by incorporating the Isometric feature mapping algorithm (Isomap). Experiment results demonstrate that this hybrid re-sampling algorithm attains a performance superior to that of the re-sampling. It is clear that the Isomap method is an effective means to reduce the dimension of the re-sampling. This provides a new possible Solution for dealing with the IDS classification.

Classification based on association rules is one of the most effective classification method, whose accuracy is higher and discovered rules are easier to understand comparing with classical classification methods. However, current algorithms for classification based on association rules is single table oriented, which means they can only apply to the data stored in a single relational table. Directly applying these algorithms in multi-relational data environment will result in many problems. This paper proposes a novel algorithm MrCAR for classification based on association rules in multi-relational data environment. MrCAR mines relevant features in each table to predict the class label. Close itemsets technique and Tuple ID Propagation method are used to improve the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results show that MrCAR has higher accuracy and better understandability comparing with a typical existing multirelational classification algorithm.			guyingqin@ruc.edu.cn; hyliu@tsinghua.edu.cn; hejun@ruc.edu.cn; erichu2006@ruc.edu.cn; duyong@ruc.edu.cn					DEHASPE L, 1997, P 7 INT WORKSH IND L, P125; Dong G., 1999, P 2 INT C DISC SCI, P30; Fan Ming, 2007, DATA MINING CONCEPTS; Gouda K., 2003, P 9 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P326; HE J, 2007, J SOFTWARE, P2752; JENSEN VC, 2000, P PAC AS C KNOWL DIS, P49; Li W., 2001, P IEEE INT C DAT MIN, P369; Liu B, 1998, P 4 INT C KNOWL DISC, P80; MUGGLETON S, 1998, P 1 INT C DISC SCI, P326; Ng E.K.K., 2002, P 2002 IEEE INT C DA, P322; Nijssen S., 2001, P 17 INT JOINT C ART, P891; Pasquier N., 1999, P 7 INT C DAT THEOR, P398; Pei J., 2000, P ACM SIGMOD WORKSH, P21; WANG R, 2007, ICITM; XU L, 2006, J ZHEJIANG U ZHEJIAN, P216; Yin X, 2003, P SDM; Yin XX, 2004, PROC INT CONF DATA, P399; Zaki MJ, 2002, SIAM PROC S, P457; Zhou S., 2000, P 6 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P265, DOI 10.1145/347090.347147	19	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3817-4				2009							256	260		10.1109/WISM.2009.60		5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BNX99	WOS:000275860800052

This paper investigates the problem of real time clustering of sensory data in WSNs. The objective is to cluster the data collected by sensor nodes in real time according to data similarity in a d-dimensional sensory data space. To perform in-network data clustering efficiently a Hilbert Curves based mapping algorithm, HilbertMap, is proposed to convert a d-dimensional sensory data space into a two-dimensional area covered by a sensor network. Based on this mapping, a distributed algorithm for clustering sensory data, H-Cluster is proposed. It guarantees that the communications for sensory data clustering mostly occur among geographically nearby sensor nodes and sensory data clustering is accomplished in in-network manner Extensive simulation experiments were conducted using both real-world datasets and synthetic datasets to evaluate the algorithms. H-Cluster consistently achieves the lowest data loss rate, the highest energy efficiency, and the best clustering quality	[Guo, Longjiang; Ai, Chunyu] Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China	Guo, LJ (reprint author), Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China.	lguo@gsu.edu; chunyuai@cs.gsu.edu; wangxm@snnu.edu.cn; zc88@msstate.edu; yli@cs.gsu.edu					Agrawal R., 2000, SIGMOD; Ailamaki A, 2003, SIGMOD RECORD, V32, P47; BANDYOPADHYAY S, INFOCOM 2003; BLOOM BH, 1970, COMMUN ACM, V13, P422, DOI 10.1145/362686.362692; FALOUTSOS C, SIGMOD 1995; Giansante Carla, 2007, Vet Ital, V43, P507; Karp B., 2000, MOBICOM 2000; LAWDER J, 2000, BBKCS0001 U LOND BIR; MEKA A, EDBT 2006; YIN J, ICDM 2008; Younis Ossama, 2004, INFOCOM 2004	11	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-5737-3				2009							33	40				8	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BUK51	WOS:000289663200005

We desperately need knowledge. This knowledge is in most cases in the gathered data, but the extraction of it is a very time and resources consuming operation. In this paper we propose an improvement of the FP-Growth algorithm that focuses on applying a pattern-length constraint on the FP-Growth algorithm. This is, mining only frequent patterns with their length belonging in an interval selected by the user. The algorithm with this constraint applied can be used when only patterns with specific lengths are interesting for the user. The main advantage of running the algorithm with the length limitation instead of the classic FP-Growth algorithm is that the running time of the former is smaller, thus, the required information can be obtained in a shorter time.

However, in real-world embedded distributed systems, it can be impossible, impractical, or too costly to gather enough field test data to make these evaluations in a straight-forward manner using traditional system testing alone. Instead, we need a method of verifying requirements compliance that uses the evidence available while minimizing the chances of wrong or misleading conclusions. This paper introduces the novel Forensic System Verification (FSV) Method, which combines modeling, data mining, analytic extrapolation, and goal modeling. It augments human inferences with automated reasoning about requirement satisfaction and confidence propagation. The FSV Method is evaluated on a case study performed using data from a recent medium-scale field trial of a complex distributed embedded system.

Techniques based on data mining algorithms are useful but they tend to be too complex for casual users to work with effectively. Furthermore, these techniques don't allow the user to engage with the information using semantics meaningful to them. Semantically enriched and personalized data exploration is seen as an essential step to support such users. Moreover, by allowing these users to leverage and personalize the subjective insights and knowledge of experts, more relevant and useful information can be discovered and interesting correlations drawn. In order to support these domain specific explorations, a prototype architecture named SARA (Semantic Attribute Reconciliation Architecture) has been built, and its underlying methodology, implementation and initial evaluation are described within this paper.

A global ontology over the interests specified by the users of a social network is essential for accurate recommendations. We propose, evaluate and compare three approaches to engineering a hierarchical ontology over user interests. The proposed approaches make use of two popular knowledge bases, Wikipedia and Directory Mozilla, to extract interest definitions and/or relationships between interests. More precisely, the first; approach uses Wikipedia to find interest definitions, the latent semantic analysis technique to measure the similarity between interests based on their definitions, and an agglomerative clustering algorithm to group similar interests into higher level concepts. The second approach uses the Wikipedia Category Graph to extract relationships between interests, while the third approach uses Directory Mozilla to extract relationships between interests. Our results show that the third approach, although the simplest, is the most effective for building a hierarchy over user interests.

ER can be broadly classified into two tasks: expert finding and expert profiling. The expert finding task aims to identify a list of people who carry some certain knowledge specified by the input query [1, 3]. The expert profiling, on the other hand, focuses on identifying the area of expertise associated with a given person [2]. To construct an expert profile, two types of information which can be used to describe an expert are topical and social information. The topical information represents domain and degree of knowledge in which an expert possesses. The social information measures an association aspect among experts such as research project collaboration, publication co-authoring and program committee assignment. This paper describes our ongoing project to design and implement an expert retrieval system with the scope on researchers who work in Thailand. The first step is to build expert profiles for each researcher. To identify expertise in different research areas, we could use many different forms of evidence such as curriculum vitae, personal homepage or professional profiles from social networking website, e.g., Linked In. However, there are two main difficulties in using these information sources. The first is due to the distributed nature of the information sources. Gathering individual profiles from the public information source, i.e., the web, could be very tedious. An intelligent information extraction algorithm is required to understand different document templates. Also, the profile collection is most likely to be incomplete, since some researchers do not provide their profiles in public for privacy reason. The second problem is due to the inconsistency of terms used to describe the area of expertise, e.g., association, rule mining (hyponym) vs data mining (hypernym) or avian flu virus vs H5N1 (synonym). Although integrating information from multiple sources could be very helpful for providing more supported information, we leave this issue as our future work. In our current system prototype, we assume that the areas of expertise among researchers can be extracted from bibliographic databases. We use the Science Citation Index (SCI) database to provide the information for representing the expert profiles. From the SCI database, we queried and retrieved publications covering from the year 2001 to 2008 by specifying the affiliation equal to "Thailand". The results contain a set of approximately 23,000 publications. We downloaded and extracted four related fields including authors (denoted by AU), controlled terms (denoted by ID), keywords (denoted by DE) and subject category (denoted by SC). To build a researcher network, we consider two types of relationships: direct and indirect. The direct (or social) relationship is defined as the co-authoring degree between one researcher to others. The co-authoring degree between two researchers, co-authoring(A,B), can be calculated based on the co-occurrence frequency between A and B found in the field AU of 23,000 retrieved records. The indirect (or topical relationship is defined when two researchers have publications under the same topics. The topical degree between two researchers, topical(A,B), can be calculated based on the similarity measure between two sets of extracted keywords, keyword(A) and keyword (B), representing researcher A and B, respectively. The keyword set can be extracted from the fields ID, DE and SC. An author with high frequencies on particular keywords is considered an expert in the corresponding research topics.

In fact, some redundancy and irrelevant attributes reduce the performance of data mining, so the problem of feature subset selection becomes important in data mining domain. This paper presentes a new algorithm which is called discrete binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm to select the best feature subsets. The relativity of attributes is evaluated based on the idea of mutual information. Experiments using the new feature selection method as a preprocessing step for SVM, C&R Tree and RBF network are done. We find that the method is very effective to improve the correct classification rate on some datasets and the BDE algorithm is useful for feature subset selection.

Based on the concept of prediction proposed in the (n, p) algorithm, our method considers the data dependency in the given transactions to predict promising and non-promising candidate itemsets. Our method estimates for each level a different support threshold that is derived from a data dependency parameter and determines whether an item should be included in a promising candidate itemset directly. In this way, we maintain the efficiency of. finding large itemsets by reducing the number of scanning the input dataset and the number candidate items. Experimental results show our method has a better efficiency than the apriori and the (n, p) algorithms when the minimum support value is small. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The extraction of knowledge from database has been successfully applied in a number of advanced fields by data mining. However, little research has been done in the area of establishing the sizing systems of human body types, using fuzzy clustering based on data mining. The goal of this study was to establish the sizing systems of human body types from the anthropometric data of females, using novel fuzzy clustering based on data mining procedure. Certain advantages may be observed when the sizing systems are established, using fuzzy clustering based on data mining procedure. Body types could be accurately classified for garment production according the newly the sizing systems. The results of this study can provide an effective procedure of identifying the clusters for classifying human body type to establish the sizing systems for garment production.

The raw frog call samples are first filtered by noise removal, high frequency compensation, and discrete wavelet transform techniques in that order. An adaptive end-point detection segmentation algorithm is proposed to effectively separate the individual syllables from the noise. Eight features, including spectral centroid, signal bandwidth, spectral roll-off, threshold-crossing rate, delta spectrum magnitude, spectral flatness, average energy, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are extracted and serve as the input parameters of the classifier. Three well-known classifiers, the kth nearest neighboring, a backpropagation neural network, and a naive Bayes classifier, are employed in this work for comparison. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the outcome performance of the proposed work. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with the parameters of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients can achieve up to 93.81%. The effectiveness of the proposed frog call identifier is thus verified.

In recent years data stream emerges as a new data type in many applications. When processing data stream, the memory is fixed, new stream elements flow continuously. The stream data can not be paused or completely stored. We develop a LSP-tree data structure to store the discovered sequential patterns. The experiment, result, shows that our proposal is able to mine sequential patterns from stream data with rather low price.

Secondly, a T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy neural network which consists of 11 BP sub-networks is developed to model the combustion process characteristics. As the LOI measuring device does not work well and thermal efficiency is a calculation value which is dependent on other primary parameters especially those of coal quality which are hard to be measured accurately and timely, the data collected are unavoidably spoiled by noise seriously. Normal neural networks such as BP and RBF are not capable of dealing with such a noise case. Validation tests demonstrate that the proposed T-S fuzzy neural network, which synthesizes well the advantages both of neural network and fuzzy reasoning, is much friendly to data noise and can be chose as an applied data mining tool.

I this paper, we consider the use of Traffic Dispersion Graph (TDGs) to classify network traffic. Given a set of flows, a TDG is a graph with an edge between any two IP addresses that communicate; thus TDGs capture network-wide interactions. Using TDGs, we develop an application classification framework dubbed Graption (Graph-based classification). Our framework provides a systematic way to harness the power of network-wide behavior, flow-level characteristics, and data mining techniques. As a proof of concept, we instantiate our framework to detect P2P applications, and show that it can identify P2P traffic with recall and precision greater than 90% in backbone traces, which are particularly challenging for other methods.

In this paper, we extend the concept of DTI dealing with meaningful fuzzy labels in order to express human knowledge for mining fuzzy association rules. Meaningful fuzzy labels (using fuzzy sets) can be defined for each domain data. For example, fuzzy labels poor disease, moderate disease, and severe disease are defined to describe a condition/type of disease. We extend and propose a concept of fuzzy information gain to employ the highest information gain for splitting a node. In the process of generating fuzzy association rules, we propose some fuzzy measures to calculate their support, confidence and correlation. The designed application gives a significant contribution to assist decision maker for analyzing and anticipating disease epidemic in a certain area.

Outliers are defined as events that occur very infrequently. Detecting outliers before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences is very important for various real life applications such as in the field of fraud detection, network robustness analysis, and intrusion detection. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of three Outlier detection methods Extensible Markov Model (EMM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and LCS-Mine, where algorithm analysis shows the time complexity analysis and outlier detection accuracy. The experiments conducted with Ozone level Detection, IR video trajectories, and 1999 and 2000 DARPA DDoS datasets demonstrate that EMM outperforms both LOF and LSC-Mine in both time and outlier detection accuracy.

Also, data mining has been widely used to discover unknown knowledge from a large volume of data using various modeling techniques such as neural network, decision tree, regression analysis, etc. This paper proposes a Six Sigma methodology based on data mining for effectively and efficiently processing massive data in driving Six Sigma projects. The proposed methodology is applied in the hot stove system which is a major energy-consuming process in a Korean steel company for improvement of heat efficiency and reduction of energy consumption.

In this article we present a study on how some talent management problems can be solved using classification and prediction techniques in Data mining. By using this approach, the talent performance can be predicted by using past experience knowledge discovered from the existing database. In the experimental phase, we have used selected classification and prediction techniques to propose the appropriate techniques from our training dataset. An example is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested classification techniques using academician performance data. Thus, by using the experiments results, we suggest the potential classification techniques for academic talent forecasting.

The integration of such distributed data into a single data warehouse system is confronted with the well known problem of low data quality. In this paper we present an approach that facilitates a dynamic identification of spurious and error-prone data stored in a large data warehouse. The identification of data quality problems is based on data mining techniques, such as clustering, subspace clustering and classification. Furthermore, we present via a case study the applicability of our approach on real data. The experimental results show that our approach efficiently identifies data quality problems.

For different software maintenance organizations or personnel, there are different concerns on software maintainability. If any one of the factors affecting the maintainability has not been completely resolved, or been unqualified, it will be affected. Therefore, in the evaluation process of software maintainability, there are a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity, so it is reasonable and scientific to apply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for software maintainability fuzzy evaluation. The core of fuzzy evaluation is membership degree transformation. But the transformation methods should be questioned, because redundant data in index membership degree is also used to compute object membership degree, which is not useful for object classification. The new algorithm is: using data mining technology based on entropy to mine knowledge information about object classification hidden in every index, affirm the relationship of object classification and index membership, eliminate the redundant data in index membership for object classification by defining distinguishable weight and extract valid values to compute object membership. The new algorithm of membership degree transformation includes three calculation steps which can be summarized as "effective, comparison and composition", which is denoted as M(1,2,3). The paper applied the new algorithm in the fuzzy evaluation of software maintainability.

Comprehensibility enables human inspection and understanding of the model, making it possible to trace why individual predictions are made. Since most high-accuracy techniques produce opaque models, accuracy is, in practice, regularly sacrificed for comprehensibility. One frequently studied technique, often able to reduce this accuracy vs. comprehensibility tradeoff, is rule extraction, i.e., the activity where another, transparent, model is generated from the opaque. In this paper, it is argued that techniques producing transparent models, either directly from the dataset, or from an opaque model, could benefit from using an oracle guide. In the experiments, genetic programming is used to evolve decision trees, and a neural network ensemble is used as the oracle guide. More specifically, the datasets used by the genetic programming when evolving the decision trees, consist of several different combinations of the original training data and "oracle data", i.e., training or test data instances, together with corresponding predictions from the oracle. In total, seven different ways of combining regular training data with oracle data were evaluated, and the results, obtained on 26 UCI datasets, clearly show that the use of an oracle guide improved the performance. As a matter of fact, trees evolved using training data only had the worst test set accuracy of all setups evaluated. Furthermore, statistical tests show that two setups, both using the oracle guide, produced significantly more accurate trees, compared to the setup using training data only.

This approach is based on the growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM), which consists of a hierarchical architecture composed of growing self-organizing maps (SOMs). The SOMs have shown to be successful for the analysis of high-dimensional input data as in data mining applications. The hierarchical architecture of the GHSOM is more flexible than a single SOM in the adaptation process to input data, mirroring inherent hierarchical relations among input data. Image hierarchical segmentation can be achieved by using this neural network model, where the hierarchical structure of segmented regions is captured. In order to evaluate the performance of this segmentation method, an application for hierarchical background modeling in video sequences is provided. Therefore, foreground detection is achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising for applications where hierarchical segmentation is required.

Generally, clustering refers to the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar. Among clustering approaches, those methods based on probabilistic models have been extensively developed, such as Naive Bayes (NB) with a latent class (cluster identifier) found via in EM algorithm. Probabilistic Decision Graphs (PDGs) are a class of graphical models that can naturally encode some context specific independencies that cannot always be efficiently captured by other commonly used models. In this paper we propose to use a mixture of PDG models in cluster discovery, and an algorithm for automatic induction of the mixture and the models is introduced. The proposed approach was experimentally evaluated on both synthetic and real-world databases, and the presentation of the results includes a comparison with related techniques. The comparison demonstrates competitive performance of the mixture of PDG models with respect; to likelihood. Also, the mixture of PDG models have a tendency to use fewer models (clusters) to represent domains where other models use large amounts of clusters.

This study proposes a novel approach and its associated stream mining methods to monitor the cutting tool condition by taking advantage of this phenomenon. The chemical composition of the gases released during the cutting process can be used to monitor the tool condition very accurately that is not possible with present direct or indirect measurement techniques. The chemical compounds released and captured by an e-nose change as the tool wear progresses. This change can be made significant as appropriate doping material were identified and doped into the different layers of the tool inserts, thus allowing a well trained data mining system to accurately estimate the level of tool wear.

The main idea is to identify the most similar time series to a given query without necessarily searching over the whole database. Our method is based on partitioning the search space by applying the K-means algorithm on the data. Then, similarity search is performed hierarchically starting from the cluster that lies most closely to the query. This procedure aims at reaching the most similar series without searching all clusters. In this work, we propose to reduce the intrinsically high dimensionality of time series prior to clustering by applying a well known dimensionality reduction technique, namely, the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, for its simplicity and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on twelve real-world and synthetic datasets covering a wide range of applications.

Spatio-temporal data mining techniques were proposed in the literature for the extraction of patterns from spatio-temporal data. However, current techniques can only extract patterns of the finest time granularity, and therefore overlooks potential patterns available at coarser time granularities. In this work, we propose two techniques to allow mining at different time granularities. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques are indeed effective and efficient for mining periodic spatio-temporal patterns at different time granularities.

As a result those algorithms are not capable to produce efficient clusters as there is some effect of noise on location of cluster centroids. The task of outlier identification is to find small groups of data objects that are exceptional when compared with rest large amount of data. They are not required or acceptable while dividing a data-set into clusters, as clusters refer to the similar group of data and these outliers don't belong to any of the similar group. Yet they can be important in other applications. Through this paper we are trying to prove that efficient clusters can only be produced by identifying outliers and separating them from the data-set into one cluster before applying any clustering algorithm. In this paper a density based algorithm for outlier identification is proposed. Before applying any of the clustering algorithms; proposed algorithm is applied on the data-set to identify outliers and separate them from original data-set. Proposed algorithm is applied on fuzzy clustering algorithms (FCM, PCM and PFCM). Numerical examples and tests show that fuzzy algorithms after applying proposed algorithm gives better results when compared with the performance of fuzzy clustering algorithms without applying proposed technique.

ALH algorithm has recently shown extremely good results in classification, and it is adopted for solving regression tasks here. It is a local margin maximizing algorithm in the original, weighted, input space blending a Nearest Neighbors (NN) based approaches and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) ideas about the maximal margin. In performing such a task it uses only K closest points to the query data point. Results for four benchmarking regression data sets show superior performance to SVMs as well as to the other established regression methods.

This investigation is based on establishing reasons of this increasing trend from the perspective of new technologies being introduced by service sector organizations especially banks in this country. The research was based on lessons learnt in use of ATMs in other countries and evaluating the personality, benefit and behavioral responses of the customers through quantitative analysis based on a questionnaire covering all these attributes of customers. The results were analyzed using statistical tools. It was observed that customers preferred convenience of use of ATMs when the banks started converting the software to their national language as well as the availability of more number of ATMs in near vicinity of customers. The study confirmed that a huge potential market existed for foreign banks to open their branches in limited locations and connect these to all other ATMs networks and could reap the benefits of their businesses in over 160 Million people economy.

We study local pattern mining in the context of ProbLog, a probabilistic Prolog system, and introduce an approach for finding correlated patterns in the form of queries in such a Prolog system. The approach combines principles of inductive logic programming, data mining and statistical relational learning. Experiments on a challenging biological network mining task provide evidence for the interestingness of the approach.

Thus k-anonymity works on a set of quasi-identifiers (public sensitive attributes), whose possible availability and linking is anticipated from external dataset, and demands that the released dataset will contain at least k records for every possible quasi-identifier value. Another aspect of k is its capability of maintaining the truthfulness of the released data (unlike other existing methods). This is achieved by generalization, a primary technique in k-anonymity. Generalization consists of generalizing attribute values and substituting them with semantically consistent but less precise values. When the substituted value doesn't preserve semantic validity the technique is called suppression which is a private case of generalization. We present a hybrid approach called compensation which is based on suppression and swapping for achieving privacy. Since swapping decreases the truthfulness of attribute values there is a tradeoff between level of swapping (information truthfulness) and suppression (information loss) incorporated in our algorithm. We use k-anonymity to explore the issue of anonymity preservation. Since we do not use generalization, we do not need a priori knowledge of attribute semantics. We investigate data anonymization in the context of classification and use tree properties to satisfy k-anonymization. Our work improves previous approaches by increasing classification accuracy.

In this paper we present the first systematic solution to post-processing that is based on semantic web technologies. The framework input is constituted by PMML and description of background knowledge. Using the Topic Maps formalism; a generic Data Mining ontology and Association Rule Mining ontology were designed. Through combination of a content management system and a semantic knowledge base, the analyst can enter new pieces of information or interlink existing ones. The information is accessible either via semi-automatically authored textual analytical reports or via, semantic querying. A prototype implementation of the framework for generalized association rules is demonstrated on the PKDD'99 Financial Data Set.

While an extensive research has been carried out for discovering positive patterns, little has been offered for discovering patterns with negation. The main hindrance to the progress of such research is huge amount of frequent patterns with negation. which exceeds the number of frequent positive patterns by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we examine properties of derivable and non-derivable patterns, including those with negated items. In particular, we establish important relationships among patterns admitting negation that have the same canonical variant. By analogy to frequent non-derivable itemsets, which constitute a concise lossless representation NDR of frequent positive patterns, we introduce frequent non-derivable literal sets lossless representation NDRL of frequent positive patterns admitting negation. Then we use the derived properties of literal sets to offer a concise representation NDIR of frequent patterns admitting negation that is built only from positive non-derivable itemsets. The relationships between the three representations are identified. The transformation of the new representations into not less concise lossless closure representations is discussed.

The growing volume of spam mails annoys people and affects work efficiency significantly. Most previous researches focused on developing spam filtering algorithm, using statistics or data mining approach to develop precise spam rules. However, mail servers may generate new spam rules constantly and mail server will then carry a growing number of spam rules. The rules might be out-of-date or imprecise to classification as spam evolves continuously and hence applying such rules might cause misclassification. In addition, too many rules in mail server may affect the performance of mail filters. In this research, we propose an anti-spam approach combining both data mining and statistical test approach. We adopt data mining to generate spam rules and statistical test to evaluate the efficiency of them. By the efficiency of spam rules, only significant rules will be used to classify emails and the rest of rules can be eliminated then for performance improvement.

Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In IR a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy. An object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database. User queries are matched to objects stored in the database. Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images or videos. The documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates. Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query. In this paper we try to explain IR methods and asses them from two view points and finally propose a simple method for ranking terms and documents on IR and implement the method and check the result.

On the other hand, most of the sequence mining algorithms still generate an exponentially large number of sequential patterns when a minimum support is lowered. In this paper, a weighted closed sequential pattern mining algorithm called WCloSpan is proposed. WCloSpan generates fewer but important weighted sequential patterns in large databases. Our main approach is to push the weight constraints into the sequential pattern growth approach while maintaining the downward closure property. Furthermore, the problem of closed sequential pattern is transformed into closed itemset. Thus, pruning strategies of closed itemset can also be used to enhance the mining efficiency. Experimental results show that the algorithm is efficient and effective.

Data modification is one of the most important sanitation approaches. However, the exist modification methods either focus on hiding sensitive rules only, or take measures to reduce the impact on non-sensitive rules from the whole database while hiding sensitive rules. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm which hides sensitive rules from the side of non-sensitive rules. It classifies the sensitive transactions by their degree of conflict. For the special group of transactions, a victim-item must satisfy: 1, in the sensitive rules; 2, not in the non-sensitive rules. Our algorithm selects different victim-items in different transactions that contain the same rule, which makes sure that removing the victim-items in the special group of transactions has no influence to non-sensitive rules. The experimental results show that our algorithm for sanitizing transactional database can achieve better results compared with others algorithms such as Naive, MinFIA, MaxFIA and IGA.

In this paper, we will propose a feature selection algorithm based on similarity and extension matrix. Extension matrix is an important theory in learning from examples and it is originally designed to deal with discrete feature values. However, in the paper it is extended to cope with continuous values and designed as search strategy. The evaluation criterion for feature selection is based on the similarity between classes, which is obtained from the similarity between examples in different, classes using min-max learning rule. The algorithm is proved in theory and shown its higher performance than two other classic general algorithms over several real-world benchmark data sets and facial image sets with different poses and expressions for gender classification.

As the size of database increases, the computation time and the required memory increase severely. The difficulty of mining large database launched the research of designing parallel and distributed algorithms to solve the problem. Most of the past studies tried to parallelize the computation by dividing the database and distribute the divided database to other nodes for mining. This approach might leak data out and evidently is not suitable to be applied to sensitive domains like health-care. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining algorithm named FD-Mine that is able to efficiently utilize the nodes to discover frequent patterns in cloud computing environments with data privacy preserved. Through empirical evaluations on various simulation conditions, the proposed FD-Mine delivers excellent performance in terms of scalability and execution time.

These patterns have a direct correspondence to the type of relationship existing between the variables mapped onto the axes in question as well as a salient visual appearance. Parallel coordinates displays can therefore be used to visually investigate relationships between variables as well as investigating individual objects/lines. The problem with this approach is that, whereas each object is mapped in its entirety in a standard parallel coordinates display, only a small subset of the interrelations between variables is shown as the number of variables increase. To show all possible relations between variables multiple parallel coordinates displays are needed. In turn this means that each variable is duplicated several times, once per extra parallel coordinates display. To a viewer this increases the visual complexity and most probably, the mental load. To aid users we have devised a new configuration of the axes in multiple parallel coordinates displays. Through an experiment we have also started to investigate the usability of this new configuration and the results are promising.

The key factors which influence the performance of biological data mining approaches are the large- scale of biological data and the high similarities among patterns mined. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm named IRTM for mining frequent subtrees embedded in biological data. We also advance a string encoding method for representing the trees, and a scope- list for extending all substrings for frequency test.

Dependence maximization based supervised feature extraction (SDMFE) is an effective dimension reduction method proposed recently. A shortcoming of SDMFE is that it can only use labeled data. and does not work well when labeled data are limited. However, in many applications, it is a common case. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method, called Semi-Supervised Dependence Maximization Feature Extraction (SSDMFE), which can utilize Simultaneously both labeled and unlabeled data to perform feature extraction. The labeled data are used to maximize the dependence and the unlabeled data are used as regulations with respect to the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Experiments on several datasets are presented and the results demonstrate that SSDMFE achieves much higher classification accuracy than SDMFE when the amount of labeled data are limited.

Answers and Baidu Knows are attracting users, questions, and answers at an explosive rate, the truly urgent and important questions are increasingly getting lost in the crowd. That is, questions that require immediate responses are pushed out of the way by the trivial but more recently arriving questions. Unlike other questions in collaborative question answering (CQA) for which users might be willing to wait until good answers appear, urgent questions are likely to be of interest to the asker only if answered in the next few minutes or hours. For such questions, late responses are either not useful or are simply not applicable. Unfortunately, current collaborative question-answering systems do not distinguish urgent questions from the rest, and could thus be ineffective for urgent information needs. We explore text- and data-mining methods for automatically identifying urgent questions in the CQA setting. Our results indicate that modeling the question context (i.e., the particular forum/category where the question was posted) can increase classification accuracy compared to the text of the question alone.

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.

In this work we present a novel use of object hierarchies over traces of inter-object method calls, as an abstraction/refinement mechanism that enables user-guided, top-down or bottom-up mining of layered scenario-based specifications, broken down by hierarchies embedded in the system under investigation. We do this using data mining methods that provide statistically significant sound and complete results modulo user-defined thresholds, in the context of Damm and Harel's live sequence charts (LSC); a visual, modal, scenario-based, inter-object language. Thus, scalability, comprehensibility, and expressivity are all addressed. Our technical contribution includes a formal definition of hierarchical inter-object traces, and algorithms for 'zooming-out' and 'zooming-in', used to move between abstraction levels on the mined specifications. An evaluation of our approach based on several case studies shows promising results.

Contrast patterns, such as emerging patterns, have been shown to be powerful for building classifiers, but they rarely exist; in sparse data. Recently,. proposed disjunctive emerging patterns are highly expressive, and can potentially overcome this limitation. Simple contrast patterns only allow simple conjunctions, whereas disjunctive patterns additionally allow expressions of disjunctions. This paper investigates whether expressive contrasts are beneficial for classification. We adopt a statistical methodology for eliminating noisy patterns. Our experiment's identify circumstances where expressive patterns can improve over previous contrast: pattern based classifiers. We also present; souse guidelines for i) using expressive patterns based oil the nature of the given data, ii) flow to choose between the different types of contrast patterns for building a classifier.

This paper described a novel approach for multi-document update summarization. The best summary is defined to be the one which has the minimum information distance to the entire document set. The best update summary has the minimum conditional information distance to a document cluster given that a prior document cluster has already been read. Experiments on the DUC 2007 dataset(1) and the TAC 2008 dataset(2) have proved that our method closely correlates with the human summaries and outperforms other programs such as LexRank in many categories under the ROUGE evaluation criterion.

The K-associated network is capable of representing (dis)similarity relationships among data samples and data classes. Here, we describe the main properties of the K-associated network as well as the classification algorithm based on it. Experimental evaluation indicates that the model based on an optimal K-associated network captures topological structure of the training data leading to good results on the classification task particularly for noisy data.

Mining Cluster-based Mobile Sequential Patterns in Location-Based Service Environments	MDM: 2009 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE DATA MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Mobile Data Management	MAY 18-20, 2009	Taipei, TAIWAN	Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci		Location-based services; Cluster-based mobile sequential patterns; Mobility pattern mining; Data mining	COMMERCE	In recent years, a number of studies have been done on Location-Based Service (LBS) due to their wide range of potential applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining algorithm named Cluster-based Mobile Sequential Pattern Mine (CMSP-Mine) for efficiently discovering the Cluster-based Mobile Sequential Patterns (CMSPs) of users in LBS environments. In CMSP-Mine, we first propose a transaction similarity measurement named Location-Based Service Alignment (LBS-Alignment) to evaluate the similarity between two mobile transaction sequences. Then, we propose a transaction clustering algorithm named Cluster-Object based Smart Cluster Affinity Search Technique (CO-Smart-CAST) to form a user cluster model of the mobile transactions based on LBS-Alignment. Furthermore, we proposed the novel prediction strategy that utilizes the discovered CMSPs to precisely predict the next movement of mobile users. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on mining the mobile sequential patterns associated with moving path and user clusters in LBS environments. Finally, through a series of experiments, our proposed methods were shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and applicability under various system conditions.

Compared with traditional ISP networks, an IPTV distribution network (i) typically adopts a hierarchical instead of mesh-like structure, (ii) imposes more stringent requirements on both reliability and performance, (iii) has different distribution protocols (which make heavy use of IP multicast) and traffic patterns, and (iv) faces more serious scalability challenges in managing millions of network elements. These unique characteristics impose tremendous challenges in the effective management of IPTV network and service. In this paper, we focus on characterizing and troubleshooting performance issues in one of the largest IPTV networks in North America. We collect a large amount of measurement data from a wide range of sources, including device usage and error logs, user activity logs, video quality alarms, and customer trouble tickets. We develop a novel diagnosis tool called Giza that is specifically tailored to the enormous scale and hierarchical structure of the IPTV network. Giza applies multi-resolution data analysis to quickly detect and localize regions in the IPTV distribution hierarchy that are experiencing serious performance problems. Giza then uses several statistical data mining techniques to troubleshoot the identified problems and diagnose their root causes. Validation against operational experiences demonstrates the effectiveness of Giza in detecting important performance issues and identifying interesting dependencies. The methodology and algorithms in Giza promise to be of great use in IPTV network operations.

We also demonstrate our anomaly detector that was used to deal with tied matches between worm and benign trees. We analyzed the performance of each detector and also with their integration. Results show that our signature based detector can detect very high true positive. Meanwhile, the anomaly detector did not achieve high true positive. Both detectors, when used independently, suffer high false positive. However, when both detectors were integrated they maintained a high detection rate of true positive and minimized the false positive.

This is a challenging comparison for machines since humans accomplish the task outstandingly even on unknown words without any context. The goal of finding good machine-made models for stress assignment was set by applying new methods and by making use. of it known theory about rules for stress assignment in Slovene. The upgraded data mining methods outperformed expert-defined rules on practically all subtasks, thus showing that data mining can more than compete with humans when constructing formal knowledge about stress assignment is concerned. Unfortunately, compared to humans directly, the data mining methods still failed to achieve as good results as humans on assigning stress to unknown words.

In most cases, the seemingly crisp granulation of a taxonomy disguises the fact that categories are based on loosely defined concepts which are better modelled by allowing graded membership. Fuzzy categories may also arise when integrating information from multiple sources which do not conform to precisely the same taxonomy definitions. Knowledge of relations between categories can be summarised by association rules. In this paper, we outline a new method to calculate fuzzy confidences for association rules between fuzzy categories from different hierarchies. We illustrate with examples drawn from a system that integrates information from web-based sources.

This is due mainly to two factors: firstly, the great value of forecasting for many human activities; secondly, due to the opportunism created by the various technological advances that are directly related to this concrete research field, like the evolution of computation and the improvement in measurement systems. This paper describes several techniques belonging to the paradigm of artificial intelligence which try to make a short-term forecast of rainfalls (24 hours) over very spatially localized regions. The objective is to compare four different data-mining [1] methods for making a rainfall forecast [7], [10] for the next day using the data from a single weather station measurement.

However, relatively little attention has been paid to data mining for large distribution sets. Given n distributions of multiple categories and a query distribution Q, we want to find similar clouds (i.e., distributions), to discover patterns, rules and outlier clouds. For example, consider the numerical case of sales of items, where, for each item sold, we record the unit price and quantity; then, each customer is represented as a distribution of 2-d points (one for each item he/she bought). We want to find similar users, e.g., for market segmentation, anomaly/fraud detection. We propose to address this problem and present D-Search, which includes fast and effective algorithms for similarity search in large distribution datasets. Our main contributions are (I) approximate KL divergence, which can speed up cloud-similarity computations, (2) multi-step sequential scan, which efficiently prunes a significant number of search candidates and leads to a direct reduction in the search cost. We also introduce an extended version of D-Search : (3) time-series distribution mining, which finds similar subsequences in time-series distribution datasets. Extensive experiments on real multi-dimensional datasets show that our solution achieves up to 2,300 faster wall-clock time over the naive implementation while it does not sacrifice accuracy.

However, its acceleration in high dimensional space is a difficult problem. For solving this problem, approximate NN search algorithms have been investigated. Especially, LSH is getting highlighted recently, because it has a clear relationship between relative error ratio and the computational complexity. However, the p-stable LSH computes hash values independent of the data distributions, and hence, sometimes the search fails or consumes considerably long time. For solving this problem, we propose Principal Component Hashing (PCH), which exploits the distribution of the stored data. Through experiments, we confirmed that PCH is faster than ANN and LSH at the same accuracy.

Data mining, already widely applied to extract frequent correlations of values from both structured and semi-structured datasets, is the appropriate field for knowledge elicitation. In this work we describe an approach to extract Tree-based association rules from XML documents. Such rules provide approximate, intensional information on both the structure and the content of XML documents, and can be stored in XML format to be queried later on. A prototype system demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

Naive Bayes Text Classification with Positive Features Selected by Statistical Method	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING 2009 (ICAC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Computing	DEC 13-15, 2009	Chennai, INDIA					Text Classification is enduring to be one of the most researched problems due to continuously-increasing amount of electronic documents and digital data. Naive Bayes is an effective and a simple classifier for data mining tasks, but does not show much satisfactory results in automatic text classification problems. In this paper, the performance of Naive Bayes classifier is analyzed by training the classifier with only the positive features selected by CHIR, a statistics based method as input. Feature selection is the most important preprocessing step that improves the efficiency and accuracy of text classification algorithms by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from the training corpus. Experiments were conducted for randomly selected training sets and the performance of the classifier with words as features was analyzed. The proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy compared to other native methods for the 20Newsgroup benchmark.	[Meena, M.

The goal is to automatically classify proteins sequences according to their families. This task goes through the extraction of a set of descriptors that we present to the supervised learning algorithms. There are many types of descriptors used in the literature. The most popular one is (lie n-grain. It corresponds to a series of characters of n-length. The standard approach of the n-grams consists in setting first the parameter n, extracting the corresponding n-grams descriptors, and in working with this value during the whole data mining process. In this paper, we propose an hierarchical approach to the n-grams construction. The goal is to obtain descriptors of varying length for a better characterization of the protein families. This approach tries to answer to the domain knowledge of the biologists. The patterns, which characterize the proteins' family, have most of the time a various length. Our idea is to transpose the frequent itemsets extraction principle, mainly used for the association rule mining, ill the n-grams extraction for protein classification context. The experimentation shows that the new approach is consistent with the biological reality zinc] has the same accuracy of the standard approach.

This algorithm works on both static and dynamically increasing databases, and thereby takes full advantage of their applicability of the module.

Exploring Early Classification Strategies of Streaming Data with Delayed Attributes	NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, PT 1, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2009)	DEC 01-05, 2009	Bangkok, THAILAND	Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly, Int Neural Network Soc, Japanese Neural Network Soc, European Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc	King Mongluts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Informat Technol	Data mining; Streaming data; On-line classification; Missing attributes		In contrast to traditional machine learning algorithms, where all data are available in batch mode, the new paradigm of streaming data poses additional difficulties, since data samples arrive in a sequence and many hard decisions have to be made on-line. The problem addressed here consists of classifying streaming data which not only are unlabeled, but also have a number 1 of attributes arriving after some time delay T. In this context, the main issues are what to do when the unlabeled incomplete samples and, later on, their missing attributes arrive; when and how to classify these incoming samples; and when and how to update the training set. Three different strategies (for l = 1 and constant T) are explored and evaluated in terms of the accumulated classification error. The results reveal that the proposed on-line strategies, despite their simplicity, may outperform classifiers using only the original, labeled-and-complete samples as a fixed training set. In other words, learning is possible by properly tapping into the unlabeled, incomplete samples, and their delayed attributes. The many research issues identified include a better understanding of the link between the inherent properties of the data set and the design of the most suitable on-line classification strategy.

Linear feature transformation methods have been widely applied to extract class-relevant information to improve kNN classification, which is very limited in many applications. Kernels have also been used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods fail to scale to large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable non-linear feature mapping method based on a deep neural network pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines for improving kNN classification in a large-margin framework, which we call DNet-kNN. DNet-kNN can be used for both classification and for supervised dimensionality reduction. The experimental results on two benchmark handwritten digit datasets and one newsgroup text dataset show that DNet-kNN has much better performance than large-margin kNN using a linear mapping and kNN based on a deep autoencoder pretrained with Restricted Boltzmann Machines.

In data warehouses, users exploit data hypercubes (i.e., multi-way tables) mainly through online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques to extract useful information from data for decision support purposes. Many topics have attracted researchers in the area of data warehousing: data warehouse design and multidimensional modeling, efficient cube materialization (pre-computation), physical data organization, query optimization and approximation, discovery-driven data exploration as well as cube compression and mining. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to apply or adapt data mining approaches and advanced statistical analysis techniques for extracting knowledge (e.g., outliers, clusters, rules, closed n-sets) from multidimensional data. Such approaches or techniques cover (but are not limited to) FCA, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, log-linear modeling, and non-negative multiway array factorization. Since data cubes are generally large and highly dimensional, and since cells contain consolidated (e.g., mean value), multidimensional and temporal data, such facts lead to challenging research issues in mining data cubes. In this presentation, we will give an overview of related work and show how FCA theory (with possible extensions) can be used to extract valuable and actionable knowledge from data warehouses.

In our method, which we call data synchronization, phase oscillators carrying multivariate data in their natural and updated rhythms achieve partial synchronizations. Their common rhythms are interpreted as the template vectors representing the general features of the data set. In this study, we discuss the link of data synchronization to the self-organizing map algorithm as a popular method for data mining and show through numerical experiments how our method can overcome the disadvantages of the self-organizing map algorithm in that unintentional selections of inappropriate reference vectors lead to false feature patterns.

Structured Database Standardization Framework for Data Mining of Semiconductor Manufacturing Data	2009 1ST ASIA SYMPOSIUM ON QUALITY ELECTRONIC DESIGN			English	Proceedings Paper	1st Asia Symposium on Quality Elecronic Design	JUL 15-16, 2009	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA					Semiconductor manufacturing is a very complex and sophisticated process and semiconductor manufacturing data are generally huge. In order to perform knowledge discovery from these huge sets of data, data has to be reduced in dimensions by only selecting certain fields which are of value towards a particular research. Most research is geared towards data mining and less importance is generally given to stages before data mining, namely problem definition, selection addition, preprocessing and data cleaning and transformation. This is undesirable because ad-hoc approaches to standardize the data during these initial stages tend to be inaccurate, any will affect the integrity of data mining performed in later stages. This paper proposes a structured data standardization framework which effectively breaks down huge semiconductor data of high dimensions into smaller values in order to perform knowledge discovery. The framework was effectively applied on two devices as a case study and the resulting processed data was successfully used for yield mining and defect clustering purposes.			aach3@student.monash.edu					CHEN WC, 2004, IEEE SEMI ADV SEM MA; Fayyad U, 1996, COMMUN ACM, V39, P24, DOI 10.1145/240455.240463; FAYYAD U, 1997, 9 INT C SCI STAT DAT; OOI MPL, 2009, IEEE SEMI ADV SEM MA, P1; TONG SR, 2007, 2007 3 INT C WIR COM, P5377	5	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-4951-4				2009							374	379				6	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BMU51	WOS:000273597000074

In this paper to overcome the uncertainty, a two-level clustering algorithm based on SOM which employs the rough set theory is proposed. The two-level stage Rough SOM (first using SOM to produce the prototypes that are then clustered in the second stage) is found to perform well and more accurate compared with the proposed crisp clustering method (Incremental SOM) and reduces the errors.			mehsan3@siswa.utm.my; mohdnoor@utm.my					ASHARAF S, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN, P515; CAN F, 1993, ACM T INFORM SYST, V11, P143, DOI 10.1145/130226.134466; Gray R.

In this paper to overcome the uncertainty, an optimized clustering algorithm based on SOM which employs the rough set theory and the Simulated Annealing as a general technique for optimization problems is proposed The optimized two-level stage SA-Rough SOM (Simulated Annealing Rough Self Organizing Map) (first using SOM to produce the prototypes that are then clustered in the second stage based on the combination of rough set and simulated annealing) is found to perform well and more accurate compared with the crisp clustering methods (i.e. Incremental SOM) and reduces the errors.			mehsan3@siswa.utm.my; mohdnoor@utm.my					Asharaf S, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V27, P515, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2005.09.018; Gray R.

Managing the Absence of Items in Fuzzy Association Mining	PROCEEDINGS OF THE JOINT 2009 INTERNATIONAL FUZZY SYSTEMS ASSOCIATION WORLD CONGRESS AND 2009 EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF FUZZY LOGIC AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	Joint International-Fuzzy-Systems-Association World Congress/European-Society-Fuzzy-Logic-and-Technology Conference	JUL 20-24, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc, European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol		Absence of items; fuzzy association rules; restriction levels	RULES	One of the most well-known and extended data mining techniques is that of association rule mining, a helpful tool to discover relations between items present in sets of transactions. Nevertheless, in some other scenarios, another interesting issue is that of considering not only the possible relations involving presence of items, but the absence of them. The problem gets more complex when it is necessary to represent also imprecision and/or uncertainty in the information. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to obtain fuzzy association rules involving absent items. Additionally, our proposal is based on restriction level sets, a recent representation of imprecision that extends that of fuzzy sets, and introduces some new operators, covering some misleading results obtained from usual fuzzy operators as, for example, negation. In our methodology, we define new measures of interest and accuracy for fuzzy association rules as RL-numbers, as well as we propose a new way of summarizing the resulting set of fuzzy association rules, distributed in restriction levels.

An Internet forum is a Web application for publishing user-generated content under the form of a discussion. Discussions considering particular subjects are called topics or threads. Internet forums are sometimes called Web forums. discussion boards, message boards, discussion groups, or bulletin boards. The most important feature of Internet forums is their social aspect. Many Forums are active for a long period of time and attract a group of dedicated users, who build a tight social community around a forum. With great abundance of forums devoted to every possible aspect of human activity, such as politics, religion, sports, technology, entertainment, economy, fashion, and many more, users are able to find a forum that perfectly suits their needs and interests. In this paper we present a data mining model for social role discovery and attribution in Internet forum data.

They are of interest in their own right, and are also used as inputs in several higher-level data mining algorithms including classification, clustering, rule-discovery and summarization. In spite of extensive research in recent years, finding exact time series motifs in massive databases is an open problem. Previous efforts either found approximate motifs or considered relatively small data sets residing in main memory. In this work, we describe for the first time a disk-aware algorithm to find exact time series motifs in multi-gigabyte databases which contain on the order of tens of millions of time series. We have evaluated our algorithm on datasets from diverse areas including medicine, anthropology, computer networking and image processing and show that we can find interesting and meaningful motifs in datasets that are many orders of magnitude larger than anything considered before.

However, most data mining algorithms assume either continuous or categorical attributes, but not both. In high dimensional data, phenomena due to the "curse of dimensionality" pose additional challenges. Usually, due to locally varying relevance of attributes, patterns do not show across the full set, of attributes. In this paper we propose HSM, which defines a new pattern model for heterogeneous high dimensional data. It allows data mining ill arbitrary subsets of the attributes that are relevant for the respective patterns. Based on this model we propose an efficient algorithm, which is aware of the heterogeneity of the attributes. We extend all indexing structure for continuous attributes such that HSM indexing adapts to different attribute types. In our experiments we show that HSM efficiently mines patterns in arbitrary subspaces of heterogeneous high dimensional data.

It is often applied to the huge data in order to make a partition based on their similarity. Initially, it used for Information Retrieval in order to improve the precision and recall from query. It is very easy to cluster with small data attributes which contains of important items. Furthermore, document clustering is very useful in retrieve information application in order to reduce the consuming time and get high precision and recall. Therefore, we propose to integrate the information retrieval method and document clustering as concept space approach. The method is known as Latent Semantic Index (LSI) approach which used Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) or Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The aim of this method is to reduce the matrix dimension by finding the pattern in document collection with refers to concurrent of the terms. Each method is implemented to weight of term-document in vector space model (VSM) for document clustering using fuzzy c-means algorithm. Besides reduction of term-document matrix, this research also uses the cosine similarity measurement as replacement of Euclidean distance to involve in fuzzy c-means. And as a result, the performance of the proposed method is better than the existing method with f-measure around 0.91 and entropy around 0.51.

This method has a good effect on a company's business. E-commerce companies such as Amazon and Netflix have successfully used recommender systems to increase sales and improve customer loyalty. However, these systems generally require ratings for the movies, music, etc. It is usually difficult or expensive to obtain such ratings data comparison with transaction data. Therefore, we need a high quality recommender system that uses only historical purchasing data, without ratings. This paper discusses the effectiveness of a graph-partitioning method based recommender system. In numerical computational experiments, we applied our method to the purchasing data for CDs, and compared our results with those obtained by a traditional method. This showed that, our method is more practical for business.

It allows agents to perform autonomous behavior with respect to its own goals and cooperation with other agents. We focus on computational agents that encapsulate various methods of computational intelligence, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and similar methods. The goal of these agents is typically to solve a data mining problem characterized by a data set together with problem description. The architecture is based on the vertically-layered and belief-desire-intention architectures. Several experiments with computational agents were conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the architecture.

These methods specifically exploit the statistical dependencies among instances in order to improve classification accuracy. However there has been little focus on how these same dependencies affect our ability to draw accurate conclusions about the performance of the models. More specifically, the complex link structure and attribute dependencies in network data violate the assumptions of many conventional statistical tests and make it difficult to use these tests to assess the models in an unbiased manner In this work, we examine the task of within-network classification and the question of whether two algorithms will learn models which will result in significantly different levels of petformance. We show that the commonly-used form of evaluation (paired t-test on overlapping network samples) can result in an unacceptable level of Type I error Furthermore we show that Type I error increases as (I) the correlation among instances increases and (2) the size of the evaluation set increases (i.e., the proportion of labeled nodes in the network decreases). We propose a method for network cross-validation then combined with paired t-tests produces more acceptable levels of Type I error while still providing reasonable levels of statistical power (i.e., Type II error).

Bayesian networks are widely used in many fields ranging from data mining to computational biology. Exact inference of Bayesian networks takes O(n(2) . 2(n)) time plus the cost of O(n(2) . 2(n)) evaluations of an application-specific scoring function. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for exact Bayesian inference that is work-optimal and communication-efficient. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by an implementation on the IBM Blue Gene/L, with experimental results that exhibit near perfect scaling.

The main characteristic is its knowledge representation. Antecedent fuzzy sets of each fuzzy if-then rule linguistically represent a fuzzy region in the pattern space. When a user's main concern is knowledge extraction rather than classifier design, we have to consider two conflicting objectives: accuracy maximization and interpretability maximization. The number of correctly classified training patterns is often used for accuracy measure. On the other hand, interpretability is very subjective and hardly defined without the user's involvement. In this paper, we incorporate user's preference information into multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. We propose a preference function composed of satisfaction level functions on six criteria: average confidence, average coverage, the number of used attributes, the maximum number of used granularities, classification accuracy, and the number of rules. Since it is hard to directly define each satisfaction level function beforehand, it is interactively modified by the user during the evolution. The preference function is handled as one of objective functions in multiobjective genetic fuzzy rule selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined through a case study for knowledge extraction from the Pima Indian Diabetes data.

A graph mining technique called Chunkingless Graph-Based Induction (Cl-GBI) can find such discriminative subgraphs from graph structured data. But, it sometimes happens that Cl-GBI cannot extract subgraphs that are good enough to characterize the given data due to its time and space complexities. Thus, to improve its efficiency, we propose pruning methods based on the upper-bound of information gain that is used as a criterion for discriminability of subgraphs in Cl-GBI. The upper-bound of information gain of a subgraph is the maximal one that its super graph can achieve. By comparing the upper-bound of each subgraph with the best information gain at the moment, Cl-GBI can exclude unfruitful subgraphs from its search space. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the pruning methods on a real world and artificial datasets.

However, a problem was pointed out that STSC always generates moderate sinusoidal patterns independently of the input. To address this problem, we theoretically explain and empirically confirm the similarity between STSC and moving average. The present analysis is consistent with, and simpler than, one of the most important analyses of STSC. We also question the pattern extraction in the time domain and discuss another solution.

It is very rare to occur trouble condition in the plants. And it is hard to construct an experimental power generation plant for collecting the trouble condition data. Because its cost is too high. In this situation, we have to find trouble condition sign. In this paper, we consider that the rise inclination of special unusual condition. data gives trouble condition sign.

The key ideas are to use data mining techniques to discover consistent and useful patterns of system features that describe program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features to compute (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. The paper also discusses the current level of computer security development in Tanzania with particular interest in IDS application with the fact that approach is easy to implement with less complexity to computer systems architecture, less dependence on operating environment (as compared with other security-based systems) and ability to detect abuse of user privileges easily. The findings are geared towards developing security infrastructure and providing ICT services.			george.oreku@gmail.com; fred.mtenzi@comp.dit.ie					Botta D, 2007, P S US PRIV SEC SOUP, P100, DOI 10.1145/1280680.1280693; Charmaz K, 2006, CONSTRUCTING GROUNDE; Fetterman David M., 1998, ETHNOGRAPHY STEP STE; JIUHUA Z, 2008, 1 INT WORKSH VOL, P402, DOI 10.1109/WKDD.2008.12; Kandogan E, 2005, SECURITY USABILITY D, P357; Sandelowski M, 2000, RES NURS HEALTH, V23, P334, DOI 10.1002/1098-240X(200008)23:4<334::AID-NUR9>3.0.CO;2-G; Wu X., 2007, TOP 10 ALGORITHMS DA; YIN X, 2008, SCALABLE MINING LINK, V10; Yu JX, 2004, P 30 INT C VER LARG, P204, DOI 10.1016/B978-012088469-8/50021-8	9	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3929-4				2009							696	701		10.1109/DASC.2009.56		6	Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BOM80	WOS:000277026000120

The CPM learns from similarities between terrorist attacks and their crime attributes then puts them in appropriate clusters. Solved and unsolved attacks are gathered in the same - all linked to each other - "umbrella" clusters; then CPM classifies all related terrorist events which are expected to belong to one single terrorist group. The developed model is applied to a real crime dataset, which includes solved and unsolved terrorist attacks and crimes in Turkey between 1970 and 2005. CPM predictions produced significant precision value for big terrorist groups and reasonable recall values for small terrorist groups.

As the data become heterogeneous and large-scale, single kernel methods become insufficient to classify nonlinear data. The finite combinations of kernels are limited up to a finite choice. In order to overcome this discrepancy, we propose a novel method of "infinite" kernel combinations for learning problems with the help of infinite and semi-infinite programming regarding all elements in kernel space. Looking at all infinitesimally fine convex combinations of the kernels from the infinite kernel set, the margin is maximized subject to an infinite number of constraints with a compact index set and an additional (Riemann-Stieltjes) integral constraint due to the combinations. After a parametrization in the space of probability measures, it becomes semi-infinite. We analyze the regularity conditions which satisfy the Reduction Ansatz and discuss the type of distribution functions within the structure of the constraints and our bi-level optimization problem.

Recently, data mining techniques have gained importance in providing the valuable information which in turn can help to enhance the decision on identifying the intrusions (attacks),In this paper; we evaluate the performance of various rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and Decision Table using ensemble approach in order to build an efficient network intrusion detection system. We use KDDCup'99, intrusion detection benchmark dataset (which is a part of DARPA evaluation program) for our experimentation. It can be observed from the results that the proposed approach is accurate in detecting network intrusions, provides low false positive rate, simple, reliable and faster in building an efficient network intrusion system.

Most previous studies focused on binary-valued transactions, however the data in real-world applications usually consists Of quantitative values. In the last few years, many researchers have proposed Evolutionary Algorithms for mining interesting association rules from quantitative data. In this paper, we present a preliminary study on the evolutionary extraction of quantitative association rules. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of this approach.

Though many techniques for visual modelling of data warehouses from the static point of view have been devised, only few attempts have been made to model the data flows involved in a data warehousing process. Besides, each attempt was mainly aimed at a specific application, such as ETL, OLAP, what-if analysis, data mining. Data flows are typically very complex in this domain; for this reason, we argue, designers would greatly benefit from a technique for uniformly modelling data warehousing flows for all applications. In this paper, we propose an integrated visual modelling technique for data cubes and data flows. This technique is based on UML profiling; its feasibility is evaluated by means of a prototype implementation.

Cyber crime is classified into cyber terror and general cyber crime, and those two classes are connected with each other. The investigation of cyber terror requires high technology, system environment and experts, and general cyber crime is connected with general crime by evidence from digital data and cyber space. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine relational crime types and collect evidence. Therefore, we considered the classifications of cyber crime, the collection of evidence in cyber space and the application of laws to cyber crime. In order to efficiently investigate cyber crime, it is necessary to integrate those concepts for each cyber crime-case. Thus, we constructed a cyber forensics domain ontology for criminal investigation in cyber space, according to the categories of cyber crime, laws, evidence and information of criminals. This ontology can be used in the process of investigating of cyber crime-cases, and for data mining of cyber crime; classification, clustering, association and detection of crime types, crime cases, evidences and criminals.

STUDY OF THE ROBUSTNESS OF A META-ALGORITHM FOR THE ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS IN RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NEURAL NETWORKS DESIGN	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						RBFN; meta-algorithm; evolutionary algorithm; parameter estimation	RBF	Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) have shown their capability to be used in classification problems, and therefore many data mining algorithms have been developed to configure RBFNs. These algorithms need to be given a suitable set of parameters for every problem they face, thus methods to automatically search the values of those parameters are required. This paper shows the robustness of a meta algorithm developed to automatically establish the parameters needed to design RBFNs. Results show that, this new method can be, effectively used, not only to obtain good models, but also to find a stable set of parameters, available to be used oil many different problems.

Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a "first-principles" approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable. Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse "don't care" transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by HP and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach.

While application scientists have been able to readily gather multi-neuronal datasets, analysis capabilities have lagged behind, due to both lack of powerful algorithms and inaccessibility to powerful hardware platforms. The advent of GPU architectures such as Nvidia's GTX 280 offers a cost-effective option to bring these capabilities to the neuroscientist's desktop. Rather than port existing algorithms onto this architecture, we advocate the need for algorithm transformation, i.e., rethinking the design of the algorithm in a way that need not necessarily mirror its serial implementation strictly. We present a novel implementation of a frequent episode discovery algorithm by revisiting "in-the-large" issues such as problem decomposition as well as "in-the-small" issues such as data layouts and memory access patterns. This is non-trivial because frequent episode discovery does not lend itself to GPU-friendly data-parallel mapping strategies.

We focus in this paper on temporal models representable as excitatory networks where all connections are stimulative, rather than inhibitive. Through this emphasis on excitatory networks, we show how they can be learned by creating bridges to frequent episode mining. Specifically, we show that frequent episodes help identify nodes with high mutual information relationships and which can be summarized into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we show how excitatory networks can be inferred from both mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real neuroscience datasets.

Recently, AdaBoost has become popular among machine learning community thanks to its promising results across a variety of applications. However, training AdaBoost on large datasets is a major problem, especially when the dimensionality of the data is very high. This paper discusses the effect of high dimensionality on the training process of AdaBoost. Two preprocessing options to reduce dimensionality, namely the principal component analysis and random projection are briefly examined. Random projection subject to a probabilistic length preserving transformation is explored further as a computationally light preprocessing step. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training process for handling high dimensional large datasets.

J	Pazouki, E; Rahmati, M				Pazouki, Ehsan; Rahmati, Mohammad			A novel multimedia data mining framework for information extraction of a soccer video stream	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Multimedia data mining; soccer video analysis; information extraction; player tracking	TRACKING	A video stream is usually massive in terms of data content with abundant information. In the past, extracting explicit semantic information from a video stream; i.e. object detection, object tracking and information extraction; has been extensively investigated. However, little work has been devoted on the problem of discovering global or implicit information from huge video streams. In this paper, a framework has been presented for extracting information for a specified player from soccer video broadcast by data mining techniques. Concepts and information which exist in a soccer video broadcast are useful for team coaches. But, due to various reasons; i.e. wide field of view of a video stream, huge data, existence of great number of important objects in the play field of a soccer match and the occurrence of number of important events, manual extraction of information from soccer video broadcast is difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, a set of techniques is presented that automatically extract some useful information of a player, i.e. velocity and traversed distance, from a soccer video broadcast. Processing of video sequence under change of lighting conditions, fast camera movement and player's occlusion is a challenging task. Our proposed framework comprise of 3 stages, player segmentation, player tracking and information extraction. All three stages must be robust under various challenges. The performance of our proposed system has been evaluated using a variety of soccer video broadcast having different characteristics in term of lighting conditions. The experiments showed that the efficiency of our system is satisfactory.

An Improved Method for Privacy Preserving Data Mining	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference	MAR 06-07, 2009	Patiala, INDIA	IEEE		anonymity; fuzzy method; personalized privacy; privacy preservation; Quasi- identifiers		In the light of developments in technology to analyze personal data, public concerns regarding privacy are rising. Often a data holder, such as a hospital or bank needs to share person specific records in such a way that the identities of the individuals who are the subjects of data cannot be determined. The generalization techniques such as K-anonymous, L-diverse and t- closeness were given as solutions to solve the problem of privacy breach, at the cost of information loss. Also, a very few papers dealt with personalized generalization. But, all these methods were developed to solve the external linkage problem resulting in sensitive attribute disclosure. It is very easy to prevent sensitive attribute disclosure by simply not publishing quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes together. But the only reason to publish generalized quasi identifiers and sensitive attributes together is to support data mining tasks that consider both types of attributes in the database. Our goal in this paper is to eliminate the privacy breach (how much an adversary learn from the published data) and increase utility (accuracy of data mining task) of a released database. This is achieved by transforming a part of quasi-identifier and personalizing the sensitive attribute values. Our experiment conducted on the datasets from the UCI machine repository demonstrates that there is incremental gain in data mining utility while preserving the privacy to a great extend.

As a widely adopted solution, hadoop partitions and distributes the large datasets into chunks across multiple nodes in clusters to process in parallel. For a single cluster node, typically there are several concurrently running applications, sharing and competing system CPU, memory, disk and network bandwidth. The competition will cause unfairness for some jobs and extend their response time. Particularly, some jobs have to be cancelled and rescheduled because of resource starvation. In this paper, we present a solution to reduce resource challenge. The XConveyer, as one of key component, is designed based on kernel-level virtualization facilities, to isolate Hadoop jobs and to guarantee their resource share. Built on XConveyer, Hadoop can enforce scheduling polities down to Operating System, that more fine-granular control can be achieved. The evaluation shows the XConveyer can encapsulate Hadoop jobs executed in isolated containers and guarantee strict control their system resources usages.

Finally, based on the web services collected from online service repositories, we conduct extensive experiments to study the performance of our implementation.

RST is adopted in the first phase with the aim to eliminate the insignificant features and prepared the reduce features to the next phase. In the second phase, the reduced features are optimized using the new evolutionary computation method, DPSO. The optimum features from this two methods were mined using Support Vector Machine Classifier with the optimum RBF's kernel parameters. These methods have greatly reduced the features and achieved higher classification accuracy across the selected datasets compared to full features and RST alone. The results also demonstrate that the integration of RST and DPSO is capable of searching the optimal features for protein classification and applicable to different classification problem.

Defect prediction promises to indicate these defect-prone modules. Constructing effective defect prediction models in an industrial setting involves the decision from what data source the defect predictors should be derived. In this paper we compare defect prediction results based on three different data sources of a large industrial software system to answer the question what repositories to mine. In addition, we investigate whether a combination of different data sources improves the prediction results. The findings indicate that predictors derived from static code and design analysis provide slightly yet still significant better results than predictors derived from version control, while a combination of all data sources showed no further improvement.

Inspite of their great: success; boosting algorithms still suffer from a few open-ended problems that require closer investigation. The efficiency of any such ensemble technique significantly relies on the choice of the weak learners and the form of the loss function. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-resolution approach for choosing the weak learners during additive modeling. Our method applies insights front multi-resolution analysis and chooses the optimal learners at multiple resolutions during different, iterations of the boosting algorithms. We demonstrate the advantages of easing this novel framework for classification tasks and show results on different real-world datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. Though demonstrated specifically in the context of boosting algorithms; our framework cart be easily accommodated in general additive modeling techniques.

In this framework, the class distribution is not uniform and the separability between the classes is often difficult. From the available techniques in the Machine Learning field, we focus on the use of Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems, as they provide an interpret-able model For the end user by means of linguistic variables. The aim of this work is to increase the performance of fuzzy modeling by adding a higher degree of knowledge by means of the use of Interval-valued Fuzzy Sets. Furthermore, we will contextualize the Interval-valued Fuzzy Sets with a post-processing genetic tuning of the amplitude of their upper bounds in order to enhance the global behaviour of this methodology.

The classification of large data sets is an important problem in data mining. Most data mining algorithms cannot be applied to complex object databases unless it is converted into a single flat table. Much valuable information especially the linkages between objects could be lost by conversion of such databases into a single table. As object-oriented data models embody rich data structures and semantics in the construction of complex databases, such as complex data objects, class hierarchies, property inheritance and methods, etc. So it is important to extend the area of study from relational database systems to object-oriented database systems and investigate the mechanisms for knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases[7,22]. This paper presents a brief review of some of the significant researches available in the literature for object-oriented data mining.

In this paper, we investigate how different pre-processing decisions and different network forces such as selection and influence affect the modeling of dynamic networks. We also present empirical justification for some of the modeling assumptions made in dynamic network analysis (e.g., first-order Markovian assumption) and develop metrics to measure the alignment between links and attributes under different strategies of using the historical network data. We also demonstrate the effect of attribute drift, that is, the importance of individual attributes in forming links change over time.

As these repositories independently, it is difficult for users to have a clear picture of the kind of contents they give access to. Metadata can be used to automatically extract a characterization of these resources by using machine learning techniques. This paper presents an exploratory study carried out in the contents of four public repositories that uses clustering and association rule mining algorithms to extract characterizations of repository contents. The results of the analysis include potential relationships between different attributes of learning objects that may be useful to gain an understanding of the kind of resources available and eventually develop search mechanisms that consider repository descriptions as a criteria in federated search.

A research area within utility based data mining known as high utility mining is aimed at finding itemsets that interpose high utility. The well known efficient algorithm for mining high utility itemsets from large transaction databases is the UMining algorithm. We present here a novel algorithm Fast Utility Mining (FUM) which finds all high utility itemsets within the given utility constraint threshold. it is faster and simpler than the original UMining algorithm. The experimental evaluation on transaction datasets showed that our algorithm executes faster than UMining algorithm and exceptionally faster when more itemsets are identified as high utility itemsets and when the number of distinct items in the database increases. We have also suggested a novel method of generating different types of itemsets such as High Utility and High Frequency itemsets (HUHF), High Utility and Low Frequency itemsets (HULF), Low Utility and High Frequency itemsets (LUHF) and Low Utility and Low Frequency itemsets (LULF) using a combination of FUM and Fast Utility Frequent mining (FUFM) algorithms.

Due to its limitation of finding novel attacks, we propose a hybrid model based on improved fuzzy and data mining techniques, which can detect both misuse and anomaly attacks. The aim of our research is to reduce the amount of data retained for processing i.e., attribute selection process and also to improve the detection rate of the existing IDS using data mining technique. We then use improved Kuok fuzzy data mining algorithm, which in turn a modified version of APRIORI algorithm, for implementing fuzzy rules, which allows us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We applied fuzzy inference engine using mamdani inference mechanism with three variable inputs for faster decision making. The proposed model has been tested and benchmarked against DARPA 1999 data set for its efficiency and also tested against the "live" networking environment inside the campus and the results has been discussed.

A data-mining approach for assessing consistency between multiple representations in spatial databases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Inconsistency; Integration; Metadata; Multiple representation; Spatial data matching	KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; DATA INTEGRATION; DATA SETS; INFORMATION; ONTOLOGIES; SYSTEMS; SCHEMAS	When different spatial databases are combined, an important issue is the identification of inconsistencies between data. Quite often, representations of the same geographical entities in databases are different and reflect different points of view. In order to fully take advantage of these differences when object instances are associated, a key issue is to determine whether the differences are normal, i.e. explained by the database specifications, or if they are due to erroneous or outdated data in one database. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach to partially automate the consistency assessment between multiple representations of data. The inconsistency detection is viewed as a knowledge-acquisition problem, the source of knowledge being the data. The consistency assessment is carried out by applying a proposed method called MECO. This method is itself parameterized by some domain knowledge obtained from a second method called MACO. MACO supports two approaches (direct or indirect) to perform the knowledge acquisition using data-mining techniques. In particular, a supervised learning approach is defined to automate the knowledge acquisition so as to drastically reduce the human-domain expert's work. Thanks to this approach, the knowledge-acquisition process is sped up and less expert-dependent. Training examples are obtained automatically upon completion of the spatial data matching. Knowledge extraction from data following this bottom-up approach is particularly useful, since the database specifications are generally complex, difficult to analyse, and manually encoded. Such a data-driven process also sheds some light on the gap between textual specifications and those actually used to produce the data. The methodology is illustrated and experimentally validated by comparing geometrical representations and attribute values of different vector spatial databases. The advantages and limits of such partially automatic approaches are discussed, and some future works are suggested.

To show the effectiveness of the framework, we applied the framework to analyze moving patterns of taxis based on the real-life location history data accumulated from the Taxi Telematics system developed in Jeju, Korea. The analysis aims at obtaining value-added information necessary to provide empty taxis with location recommendation services for the efficient operations of taxis. The proposed framework provides the flow chart which would have a quick look around the overall analysis process and help quickly deal with the same or similar analysis, while saving the temporal and economic costs. Data mining tool used in the framework is Enterprise Miner (E-Miner) in SAS which is one of the most widely used statistics packages and can effectively address huge amounts of log data. Especially, we perform the refined analysis by means of doing repeatedly the well-known k-means clustering method under various spatial or temporal conditions. The paper proposes the refined data mining process 1) extracting the interested dataset about meaningful information driven from the previous cluster results, 2) performing again the detailed clustering with the extracted dataset, and 3) finally extracting the value-added information such as the good pick-up spots or 4) returning the feedback. As a result, the spatiotemporal pattern analysis within the each refined clustering method makes it possible to recommend that the empty taxis go to the nearby cluster location with a high pick-up frequency statistically, resulting in the reduction of empty taxi ratio.

Most important tools in the text mining context are list of stop words and list of synonyms. The size and richness of the lists mentioned depend on the structure of the language used in the text to be mined. English, for example, is an "easy" language for search technologies, because with a couple of exceptions, the stem of the word is not conjugated and terms are formed using several words instead of creating compounds. This requires special attention to definitions when processing morphologically rich languages like Finnish. This chapter introduces the need and realisation of refining the source data for a successful data mining process based onto the results achieved from first mining round.

It can be used to show how the elements of a system interact with each other. It has a complex and varied behavior whose behavior is completely specified in terms of a local relation. Represented as a uniform grid, the time advances in discrete steps and the laws are expressed in a small lockup table through which at each step each cell computes its new state from that of its neighbors. With Data Mining deal with process of clustering and classification of large amounts of data and getting new knowledge from the data this paper introduce a new cellular automata classifier model. The practical experiments showed that our model run about twice times faster than the old model with high accuracy as we will see through this paper.

The issues of data quality are discussed. The main focus is set on feature selection and its influence on classification results. Feature selection, or discovery of an optimal data set is a process of removing features from the data set that are not useful in decision making, and leaving the most useful ones. The influence of feature selection is analyzed for different classification algorithms. They are applied on two different (in constitution) data sets to solve three problems of medical domain. Presented results show that there is no universal algorithm, whitch could help solving any problem, as well as each data set has its own optimal (sub)set suitable for the classification algorithm. Methodological recommendations to reach possibly optimal solution are given to perform clinical decision Support.

We propose an attack on the privacy of the published sanitized data that simply fuses outputs of multiple data miners that are applied to the sanitized data. That attack is practical and does not require any background or additional information. We use a number of experiments to show scenarios where an adversary can combine outputs of multiple miners using a simple fusion strategy to increase their success chance of breaching privacy of individuals whose data is stored in the database. The fusion attack provides a powerful method of breaching privacy in the form of partial disclosure, for both anonymized and perturbed data. It also provides an effective way of approximating predictions of the best miner (a miner that provides the best results among all considered miners) when this miner cannot be determined.

Man-made systems, such as air traffic control, employ known rules to control its operations. Known rules can be used to predict patterns, or used as a method of control. Natural systems, such insect ecologies, implement unknown rules. Unknown rules could provide much insight into how a system works, or alternatively how to further understand the interactions within a system. Swarm systems are a form of biological grouping within the natural world, these include bee and ants, but can be expanded as far as human groups. Discovery of rules from a swarm could provide a means to understanding the interactions and rules within the group. This would provide great value with respect to providing the rules employed and the roles within the group. This paper presents a framework for this task, with the presentation of the issues surrounding it, and some of the early results gathered from the mining process.

The metrics defined for evaluating these rules can be exploited to score relationships between attributes in Bayesian network learning. In this paper, we propose two novel methods for learning Bayesian networks from data that are based on the K2 learning algorithm and that improve it by exploiting parameters normally defined for association and correlation rules. In particular, we propose the algorithms K2-Lift and K2-X(2), that exploit the lift metric and the X(2) metric respectively. We compare K2-Lift, K2-X(2) with K2 on artificial data and on three test Bayesian networks. The experiments show that both our algorithms improve K2 with respect to the quality of the learned network. Moreover, a comparison of K2-Lift and K2-X(2) with a genetic algorithm approach on two benchmark networks show superior results on one network and comparable results on the other.

Several pitfalls should be avoided in the study such as a use of many parameters and a lack of systematic evaluation in the presence of noise. Compression-based measures have advantages in this respect as they are typically parameter-free and robust to noise.

However, such accumulation is yet to be accompanied by the development of a mocap search engine. In addition to the difficulty in processing mocap search, this phenomenon is also due to the problems in displaying mocap as search results, one of which is determining the camera position, orientation, and distance in displaying mocap. In this paper, we specify camera orientation and distance as constraints to determine camera positions by using available training data which are given as inputs into data mining techniques. In addition, we also discuss a method to select representative frames of mocap, thus allowing for the display of mocap search results as a list of sets of selected mocap frames. Finally, we employ a number of data mining techniques along with a simple method to determine the camera position which yields the widest projection area of a virtual face consisting hands and feet joints into the camera plane, and compare the results to each other.

Every user on the Internet is able to own his or her blog space as a platform to publish personal thoughts, ideas, comments or works. Information can thus be propagated and shared in a much easier way and this has led to the development and evolution of user communities in the blogosphere. In this work, the phenomenon of information diffusion is studied through the observation of evolving social relationships among bloggers. Specifically, it is noted that a social network can be formed with bloggers and corresponding subscription relationships. Moreover, the subscription of a blogger to another blog site may reflect that the distance among relevant bloggers is shortened due to information diffusion. Consequently, we devise in this work a new data mining capability, i.e., the shortcut patterns, and a proper approach to identify such patterns. Empirical studies show that the proposed scheme is feasible in various applications, including viral marketing and personalized recommendation.

Web Services are based on Service Oriented Architecture which enable application-to-application communication over the internet and easy accessibility to heterogeneous applications and devices. As web services proliferate and become more sophisticated and interdependent, the issues regarding their publication and discovery become of utmost importance. This paper proposes design of A Discovery cum Publishing Engine for web service discovery with refined searching mechanism which uses service rating techniques for efficient and effective web service discovery within optimum response time. We have used Data Mining Techniques to narrow down the search space in UBRs. Further the proposed engine has an ability to publish or search web service across multiple UBRs. In addition to this an extended design of service registry is proposed to store service rating data along with the service information. The Engine publishes the web services in UBR by following a classification scheme and performs a validation test on discovered web services. Service reviews and rating have been utilized to help a user for selection of appropriate service.

It factorizes a non-negative input matrix V into two non-negative matrix factors V = WH such that W describes "clusters" of the datasets. Analyzing genotypes, social networks, or images, it can be beneficial to ensure V to contain meaningful "cluster centroids", i.e., to restrict W to be convex combinations of data points. But how can we run this convex NMF in the wild, i.e., given millions of data points? Triggered by the simple observation that each data point is a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we propose to restrict W further to be vertices of the convex hull. The benefits of this convex-hull NMF approach are twofold. First, the expected size of the convex hull of, for example, n random Gaussian points in the plane is Omega(root log n), i.e., the candidate set typically grows much slower than the data set. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow one to compute candidate vertices efficiently. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex NMF for large data sets both in terms of speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we show that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world data sets, in our case consisting of 1.6 million images respectively 150 million votes on World of Warcraft (R) guilds.

One approach to deal with this problem is to apply a, generalized linear model with a link function and solve it by calculating the maximum likelihood estimate. But, if the link function is nonlinear, maximizing the likelihood will face with difficulties.

This technique provides a new platform for different data providers to flexibly integrate their expertise and deliver highly customizable services to their customers. Nonetheless, combining data from different sources could potentially reveal person-specific sensitive information. In this paper we study and resolve a real-life privacy problem in a data mashup application for the financial industry in Sweden. Therefore we propose a service-oriented architecture for privacy-preserving data mashup together with a multiparty protocol to securely integrate private data from different data providers, whereas the integrated data still retains the essential information for supporting general data exploration or a specific data mining task, such as classification analysis. Experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed method is effective for simultaneously preserving both privacy and information usefulness.

In our previous work, we have considered the problem of mining association rules with ontological information (called ontological association rules) and devised two efficient algorithms, called AROC and AROS, for discovering ontological associations that exploit not only classification but also composition relationship between items. The real world, however, is not static. Data mining practitioners usually are confronted with a dynamic environment. New transactions are continually added into the database over time, and the ontology of items is evolved accordingly. Furthermore, the work of discovering interesting association rules is an iterative process the analysts need to repeatedly adjust the constraint of minimum support and/or minimum confidence to discover real informative rules. Under these circumstances, how to dynamically discover association rules efficiently is a crucial issue. In this regard, we proposed a unified algorithm, called MIFO, which can handle the maintenance of discovered frequent patterns taking account of all evolving factors: new transactions updating in databases, ontology evolution and minimum support refinement. Empirical evaluation showed that MIFO is significantly faster than running our previous algorithms AROC and AROS from scratch.			clark.tseng@msa.hinet.net; wylin@nuk.edu.tw					Agrawal R., 1994, P 20 INT C VER LARG, P487; Cheung D., 1996, P 2 INT C KNOWL DISC, P307; Cheung DW, 1996, PROC INT CONF DATA, P106, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.1996.492094; Cheung DW, 1997, P 5 INT C DAT SYST A, P185; CHIEN BC, 2007, INT J ADV COMPUTATIO, V11, P423; Fayyad U, 1996, COMMUN ACM, V39, P27, DOI 10.1145/240455.240464; Han J, 2000, P 2000 ACM SIGMOD IN, p1 12, DOI 10.1145/342009.335372; Han J, 1995, P 21 INT C VER LARG, P420; Hong T.P., 2001, INTELL DATA ANAL, P111; JEA KF, 2003, P JOINT C AI FUZZ SY; Lin WY, 2006, J INF SCI, V32, P238, DOI 10.1177/0165551506064364; Ma Y., 1999, P 5 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P337, DOI 10.1145/312129.312274; NG KK, 1999, P INT S DAT APPL NON, P84; Sarda N.

One of the key issues in clustering is the specification of appropriate number of clusters, which is not obvious in many practical situations. In this paper we provide all extension of G-means algorithm which automatically learns the number of clusters present in the data and avoids over estimation of the number of clusters. Experimental evaluation on simulated and remotely sensed image data, shows the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Robust Technique for Segmentation and Counting of Trees from Remotely Sensed Data	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference	MAR 06-07, 2009	Patiala, INDIA	IEEE		Blob Extraction; Image Processing; Pattern Recognition; Remotely Sensed Imagery; Segmentation	CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY	Advanced data mining technologies along with the large quantities of Remotely Sensed Imagery, provide a data mining opportunity with high potential for useful results. Extracting interesting patterns and rules from data sets composed of images and associated ground data are typically used in order to detect the distribution of vegetation, soil classes, built-up areas, roads and water bodies such as rivers, lakes etc. The availability of new high spatial resolution satellite sensors permits people having large amounts of detailed digital imaging of rural environment. In this paper an approach towards the automatic segmentation of the satellite image into distinct regions and further to extract tree count from the vegetative area is presented. Counting trees in specific geographical areas is a very complicated process. Now a days manual counting is done by the forest department, both in agricultural as well as forest regions. Image segmentation is a very important technique in image processing. However, it is a very difficult task and there is no single unified approach for all types of images In this paper, image processing techniques have been employed for automatic segmentation of the satellite image and extraction of the trees from the segmented image.

However, there are many open questions still waiting for a theoretical and practical treatment, e.g., the problem of determining the true number of clusters has not been satisfactorily solved. In the current paper, this problem is addressed by the cluster stability approach. For several possible numbers of clusters we estimate the stability of partitions obtained from clustering of samples. Partitions are considered consistent if their clusters are stable. Clusters validity is measured as the total number of edges, in the clusters' minimal spanning trees, connecting points from different samples. Actually, we use the Friedman and Rafsky two sample test statistic. The homogeneity hypothesis, of well mingled samples within the clusters, leads to asymptotic normal distribution of the considered statistic. Resting upon this fact, the standard score of the mentioned edges quantity is set, and the partition quality is represented by the worst cluster corresponding to the minimal standard score value. It is natural to expect that the true number of clusters can be characterized by the empirical distribution having the shortest left tail. The proposed methodology sequentially creates the described value distribution and estimates its left-asymmetry.

Privacy preserving data mining has become increasingly popular because it allows sharing of privacy-sensitive data for analysis purposes. So people have become increasingly unwilling to share their data, frequently resulting in individuals either refusing to share their data or providing incorrect data. In turn, such problems in data collection can affect the success of data mining, which relies on sufficient amounts of accurate data in order to produce meaningful results. In recent years, the wide availability of personal data has made the problem of privacy preserving data mining an important one. A number of methods have recently been proposed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. This paper intends to reiterate several privacy preserving data mining technologies clearly and then proceeds to analyze the merits and shortcomings of these technologies.

J	Wang, J; Zheng, X; Liu, YB; Shi, CH				Wang Jie; Zheng Xiao; Liu Yabin; Shi Chenghui			Intrusion Prevention in Depth System Research Based on Data Mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								This article proposes a data mining based intrusion prevention in depth system model to manage the huge amounts of unreliable and uncontrollable security events, which are generated by the extensive utilization of heterogeneous security devices in computer networks. A method of combining online detection and offline data mining is made use of as the core of the model. On the other hand, the work process of the system can be compartmentalized into two phases: online examination through pattern matching and offline training through data mining. By the online real-time data examination, the data are captured through the protocol analyzer at first, and then passed through the processor of regular rule set and parameters based detection engine. After corresponding processing to the data, the system can decide if the data should be stored and forwarded or an alarm management operation should be stimulated. By the offline data mining, the data preprocess module pretreats the data from various kinds of invasion and appraisal, and combines the mined knowledge to data that come from the compound detection engine and the policy making engine. The regular rule set is then updated and optimized through the new knowledge acquired by the offline data mining phase. The phases of online examination and offline data mining are executed alternatively and/or synchronously according to requirements of achieving optimal performance of the system. In our UPNSM, we unify the rule and the policy together to form the policy by the classified rule set and the human-computer interface and distribute policy to examination engines. This method provides our platform a better assistance to carry on various kinds of nimble effective operation. In fact, the model is a united network security management platform used to analyze the network and host data from different layers: the kernel layer, the concentration layer, and the access layer. Through enhancing the capture speed of the network data package, the proposed model can evidently improve the efficiency of traditional IPS for detection network intrusion. This verity can be demonstrated by simulation and experiment results. Thus, the proposed intrusion prevention in depth system model can be used for defense in real-time and defense in depth.

C4.5 decision tree classification method is used to build an effective decision free for intrusion detection, then convert the decision tree into rules and save them into the knowledge base of intrusion detection system. These rules are used to judge whether the new network behavior is normal or abnormal. Experiments show that: the detection accuracy rate of intrusion detection algorithm based on C4.5 decision tree is over 90%, and the process if constructing rules is easy to understand, so it is in effective method for intrusion detection.

However, standard data mining toolkits per se do not allow the usage of computing clusters. The success of MapReduce for analyzing large data has raised a general interest in applying this model to other, data intensive applications. Unfortunately current research has not lead to an integration of GUI based data mining toolkits with distributed file system based MapReduce systems. This paper defines novel principles for modeling and design of the user interface, the storage model and the computational model necessary for the integration of such systems. Additionally, it introduces a novel system architecture for interactive GUI based data mining of large data on clusters based on MapReduce that overcomes the limitations of data mining toolkits. As an empirical demonstration we show an implementation based on Weka and Hadoop.

In this paper, we present a novel multivariate discretization method for finding association patterns based on clustering and genetic algorithm. This method consists of two steps. Firstly we adopt a density-based clustering technique to identify the regions that possibly hide the interesting patterns from data space. Confined to the data in these regions, we then develop a genetic algorithm to simultaneously discretize multi-attributes according to entropy criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with the experiment on a real data set.

Note that a traffic behavior in the same tune usually reflects similar patterns (referring to the temporal feature); and nearby road segments have the similar traffic behaviors (referring to the spatial feature). By exploring the temporal and spatial features, more GPS data points are retrieved. In light of these GPS data retrieved, we exploit the weighted moving average approach to estimate traffic status on road networks. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

The work presented in this paper elaborates on defining data mining tasks in terms of fine-grained composable operators instead of coarse-grained black box algorithms. Data mining tasks in the knowledge discovery process typically need one relational table as input and data preprocessing and integration beforehand. The possible combination of different kind of operators (relational, data mining and data preprocessing operators) represents a novel holistic view on the knowledge discovery process. Initially, as described in this paper, for the low-level execution phase but yielding the potential for rich optimization similar to relational query optimization. We argue that such macro-optimization embracing the overall KDD process leads to improved performance instead of focusing on just a small part of it via micro-optimization.

To overcome these disadvantages, this study presents an efficient and simple classifier based on the cerebellar model articulation controller NN (CMAC NN), which has the advantages of very fast learning, reasonable generalization ability and robust noise resistance. The performance of the proposed CMAC NN classifier is measured using PROBEN1 benchmark data sets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for diabetes and glass, each of which include, respectively, three permutations of the available patterns. Numerical results show that the proposed CMAC NN classifier was efficient for tested data sets. Therefore, the CMAC NN classifier can be considered as a data mining tool to classification.

The SCOPE compiler can optimize a query plan if it knows certain dataflow relations between the input and output tables, such as column independence, column equality, or that a column's values are non-null. This paper presents an automated analysis for inferring such relations from implementations of SCOPE table processing methods. Since most table processing methods are written as .NET iterators, our analysis must accurately deal with the resulting state-machine implementing such iterators. Other complications addressed are naming and estimating column numbers, aliasing and escaping, and the inference of universally quantified loop invariants. We prototyped the analysis as Scooby, a static analyzer for .NET iterators. Scooby is able to discover useful properties for typical SCOPE programs automatically and efficiently.

This paper presents our solution to PAKDD 2009 data mining competition as a case study of the credit scoring problem. Following a brief description of the data mining task, several challenges confronted in the task such as imbalanced dataset, missing values and data transformation are discussed. After series of preliminary experiments, logistic regression and AdaBoost were shown as the resulting classifiers on this particular problem. Furthermore, an ensemble of the two classifiers was created in order to achieve even better performance. The final result shows that our solution is effective and efficient with an AUC value of 0.6535, which was the fifth best result among more than 100 competitive teams.

The growing interest in the study of behavior mining has been credited to the availability of a large amount of individual behavioral data. Some objects containing common behavioral patterns in the dataset are dramatically different from other individual objects and show their peculiarities. It is very important for behavior analysis to mine these peculiar objects' groups as this has great potential in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been explored before. In this paper, we identify this interesting and practical problem of behavior mining: mining peculiarity groups and defining a measurement of the degree of peculiarity. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we present a set-value-oriented day-by-day behavioral data expression mode considering that daily behaviors with respect to an object should be recorded as a set of behaviors, and devise a peculiarity group mining algorithm in view of the set-value-oriented data expression which cannot be very well handled by existing methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is practical and efficient using real datasets.

The application domain is gossip about celebrities in the music world. The agent can inform herself and update the acquired knowledge by observing the web. Fans of musicians can ask for gossip information about stars, bands or people and groups related to them. This agent is built on top of information extraction, web mining, question answering and dialogue system technologies. The minimally supervised machine learning method for relation extraction gives the agent the capability to learn and update knowledge constantly from the web. The extracted relations are structured and linked with each other. Data mining is applied to the learned data to induce the social network among the artists and related people. The knowledge-intensive question answering technology enhanced by domain-specific inference and active memory allows the agent to have vivid and interactive conversations with users by utilizing natural language processing. Users can freely formulate their questions within the gossip data domain and access the answers in different ways: textual response, graph-based visualization of the related concepts and speech output.

It is not only a significant work in supply chain management but also a complex decision making problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. Research results indicate that the supplier selection process appears to satisfy different evaluation criteria and business model in deciding the success of the supply chain. Supplier selection problem related to organization strategy and it needs more critical analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines expert domain knowledge with Apriori algorithm of data mining to discover the pattern of supplier under the methodology of Domain-Driven Data Mining (D M). Apriori algorithm of data mining with the help of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set Theory (IFST) is employed during the process of mining. The overall patterns obtained help in deciding the final selection of suppliers. Finally, AHP is used to efficiently tackle both quantitative and qualitative decision factors involved in ranking of suppliers with the help of pattern achieved. An example searching for pattern of supplier is used to demonstrate the effective implementation procedure of proposed method. The proposed method can provide the guidelines for the decision makers to effectively select their suppliers in the current competitive business scenario.

It can be used for detecting the small amount of deviated data. In this article, we use "Leave One Out" procedure to check each individual point the "with or without" effect on the variation of principal directions. Based on this idea, an over-sampling principal component analysis outlier detection method is proposed for emphasizing the influence of an abnormal instance (or an outlier). Except for identifying the suspicious outliers, we also design an on-line anomaly detection to detect the new arriving anomaly. In addition, we also study the quick updating of the principal directions for the effective computation and satisfying the on-line detecting demand. Numerical experiments show that our proposed method is effective in computation time and anomaly detection.

Frequent itemsets mining is one of the foundational problems in data mining, which is to discover the set of products that purchased frequently together by customers from a transaction database. However, there may be a large number of patterns generated from database, and many of them are redundant. Frequent closed itemset is a well-known condensed representation of frequent itemset, and it provides complete information of frequent itemsets. Extensive studies have been proposed for mining frequent closed itemsets from transaction database, but most of them do not take streaming data into consideration. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for maintaining frequent closed itemsets over data streams. Whenever a transaction is added to database, our approach incrementally updates the information of closed itemsets and outputs updated frequent closed itemsets based on user-specified thresholds. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous studies.

In this paper, we present a concept of active memory operations which is an on-chip network transaction that operates based on the microcode provided by the software designer. Utilizing the active memory operation, we can replace multiple transactions of memory accesses over the on-chip network and related local processing element computation with a smaller number of high-level transactions and near-memory computation. We implemented a processor called active memory processor which is located near the memory and executes the active memory operations. In our case studies, we applied the concept to three real-world applications (parallelized JPEG, FFT, and text indexing for data mining) running on a 36-tile architecture with 32 cores and 4 memories and found that the programmable transaction approach can improve performance by 34.3% to 618% at the cost of additional design effort.

Learning Patterns in the Dynamics of Biological Networks	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Dynamic Network Analysis; Graph Mining; Biological Network; Graph Rewriting Rule	DISCOVERY; KNOWLEDGE	Our dynamic graph-based relational mining approach has been developed to learn structural patterns in biological networks as they change over time. The analysis of dynamic networks is important not only to understand life at the system-level, but also to discover novel patterns in other structural data. Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook dynamic features of biological networks, because they are focused on only static graphs. Our approach analyzes a sequence of graphs and discovers rules that capture the changes that occur between pairs of graphs in the sequence. These rules represent the graph rewrite rules that the first graph must go through to be isomorphic to the second graph. Then, our approach feeds the graph rewrite rules into a machine learning system that learns general transformation rules describing the types of changes that occur for a class of dynamic biological networks. The discovered graph-rewriting rules show how biological networks change over time, and the transformation rules show the repeated patterns in the structural changes. In this paper, we apply our approach to biological networks to evaluate our approach and to understand how the biosystems change over time. We evaluate our results using coverage and prediction metrics, and compare to biological literature.

The implementation of e-commerce provides conditions for KM of enterprises. This article suggests using data mining (DM) as a technique to support knowledge management in e-commerce. We discuss the process of knowledge management in e-commerce and present a reference model. A general architecture of collecting and mining data out of an e-commerce platform is designed to facilitate user discovering valuable knowledge. We detail the four functional modules, namely data collection, data preprocessing, pattern discovery, and knowledge analysis of the integrated architecture. Finally, some challenges in the process of implementing KM using data mining are summarized.

Most existing methods treat anomalies as inconsistencies and spend the majority amount of time on modeling normal instances. A recently proposed, sampling-based approach may substantially boost the efficiency in anomaly detection but may also lead to weaker accuracy and robustness. In this study, we propose a two-stage approach to find anomalies in complex datasets with high accuracy as well as low time complexity and space cost. Instead of analyzing normal instances, our algorithm first employs an efficient deterministic space partition algorithm to eliminate obvious normal instances and generates a small set of anomaly candidates with a single scan of the dataset. It then checks each candidate with density-based multiple criteria to determine the final results. This two-stage framework also detects anomalies of different notions. Our experiments show that this new approach finds anomalies successfully in different conditions and ensures a good balance of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.

FD is a class of integrity constraints that have gained fundamental importance in relational database design. MAR is a class of patterns which has been studied rigorously in data mining. We employ MAR to mine the interesting rules from XML Databases. The mined interesting rules are considered as candidate FDs whose all confidence itemsets are 100%. To prune the weak rules, we pay attention to support and correlation itemsets. The final strong rules are used to generate an Object-Role Model conceptual schema diagram.

The total logistics cost and facility establishment cost are the main objectives of the location selection procedure. With the increasing size of this problem in today's applications, the aspects of efficiency and scalability have developed into major challenges. In this paper, we study the use of spatial clustering methods to solve this problem and propose two new algorithms. The new algorithms determine the optimal locations of the new facilities plus their optimal total count during the search process. We have conducted many experiments for empirical comparative study on the application of several spatial clustering algorithms for optimal facility establishment. The benchmarks are conducted with both real world and synthetic data sets. The results reveal advantages of the proposed algorithms and confirm that these algorithms have better performance in terms of efficiency and objectives in the field-based services. Hence, the higher scalability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms make them suitable solutions for the problem of optimal facility establishment with large databases.

Its main objective is to transfer knowledge across domains, tasks and distributions that are similar but not the same. Currently, almost all of the transfer learning methods are designed to deal with the traditional single instance learning problems. However, in many real-world applications, such as drug design, Localized Content Based Image Retrieval (LCBIR), Text Categorization, we have to deal with multiple instance problems, where training patterns are given as bags and each bag consists of some instances. This paper formulates a novel Multiple Instance Transfer Learning (MITL) problem and suggests a method to solve it. An extensive set of empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method against several existed ones.

It can be incorporated into many data mining algorithms, Such as outlier detection, clustering, and k-NN classification. Privacy-preserving distributed k-NN is developed to address the issue while preserving the participants' privacy. Several two-party privacy-preserving k-NN mining protocols on horizontally partitioned data had been proposed, but they fail to deal with the privacy issue when the number of the participating parties is greater than two. This paper proposes a set of protocols that can address the privacy issue when there are more than two participants.

The goals of visualization in data mining are exploration, confirmation and presentation of the clustering results. However, the most of visual techniques developed for cluster analysis are primarily focused on cluster presentation rather than cluster exploration. Several techniques have been proposed to explore cluster information by visualization, but most of them depend heavily on the individual user's experience. Inevitably, this incurs subjectivity and randomness in the clustering process. In this paper, we employ the statistical features of datasets as predictions to estimate the number of clusters by a visual technique called HOV(3). This approach mitigates the problem of the randomness and subjectivity of the user during the process of cluster exploration by other visual techniques. As a result, our approach provides an effective visual method for cluster exploration.

It has been studied by many data mining researchers. The issue is that data mining algorithms often generate too many patterns, which make it very hard for the user to find those truly useful ones. Over the years many techniques have been proposed. However, few have made it to real-life applications. At the end of 2005, we built a data mining system for Motorola (called Opportunity Map) to enable the user to explore the space of a large number of rules in order to find actionable knowledge. The approach is based on the concept of rule cubes and operations on rule cubes. A rule cube is similar to a data cube, but stores rules. Since its deployment, some issues have also been identified during the regular use of the system in Motorola. One of the key issues is that although the operations on rule cubes are flexible, each operation is primitive and has to be initiated by the user. Finding a piece of actionable knowledge typically involves many operations and intense visual inspections, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. From interactions with our users, we identified a generic problem that is crucial for finding actionable knowledge. The problem involves extensive comparison of sub-populations and identification of the cause of their differences. This paper first defines the problem and then proposes an effective method to solve the problem automatically. To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported study of this problem. The new method has been added to the Opportunity Map system and is now in daily use in Motorola.

However, it possible limitation of MCLP is that it generates unexplainable black-box models which can only tell us results without reasons. To overcome this shortage, ill this paper, we propose a Knowledge Mining strategy which mines from black-box MCLP models to get explainable and understandable knowledge. Different from the traditional Data Mining strategy which focuses on mining knowledge from data, this Knowledge Mining strategy provides a new vision of mining knowledge from black-box models, which can be taken as a special topic of "Intelligent Knowledge Management".

This paper considers latest developments in Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a machine learning approach, as one way to classifying documents on the Web. The most recent development is called a Probability Mapping Graph Self-Organizing Map (PMGraphSOM), and is an extension of an earlier GraphSOM approach; this encodes undirected and cyclic graphs in a scalable fashion. This paper illustrates empirically the advantages of the PMGraphSOM versus the original GraphSOM model in a data mining application involving graph structured information. It will be shown that the performances achieved can exceed the current state-of-the art techniques on a given benchmark problem.

Negative association rules become a focus in the field of data mining. Negative association rules are useful in market-basket analysis to identify products that conflict with each other or products that complement each other. The negative association rules often consist in the infrequent items. The negative rules mining is associated with weight, an algorithm is proposed to resolve the above problem in this paper. The experiment proves that the number of the negative association rules from the infrequent items is larger than those from the frequent.

This makes the "manual" adjustment of domain ontologies for this area hardly feasible, so that there is a need for automatic or semi-automatic techniques to update such knowledge bases. Several data mining techniques have been applied to different collections of job offers from this field to test and exemplify the feasibility of this approach. The results are encouraging and will be used to support decisions in professional development.	[Ziebarth, Sabrina; Malzahn, Nils; Hoppe, H.

Capturing association among items in a database	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Association; Data mining; Measure of association		Measuring association among variables is an important step for finding solutions to many data mining problems. An existing metric might not be effective to serve as a measure of association among a set of items in a database. In this paper, we propose two measures of association, A(1) and A(2). We introduce the notion of associative itemset in a database. We express the proposed measures in terms of supports of itemsets. In addition, we provide theoretical foundations of our work. We present experimental results on both real and synthetic databases to show the effectiveness of A(2). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The design concept of the system is to use an agent community to deal with the activities of knowledge management effectively, that is, knowledge sharing, knowledge classification, knowledge creation, and knowledge recovery. The features of this system are: collecting the surfing habits of each user and finding hidden patterns of departments to recommend articles by data mining; classifying the knowledge articles in accordance with departments and therefore rapidly finding out suitable documents for users; providing personal service through personal profiles; creating new knowledge documents by discussing among users; accepting and reclassifying improperly classified articles found by users; taking the abilities of collaboration, independence and automation of agents to help users use and improve the effects of HDIA_KMS. The PASSI methodology is adopted to analyze and design the system, and agents protocols follow the FIPA specifications.			yhchang@mail.stut.edu.tw; M9390219@webmail.stut.edu.tw					Agresti WW, 2000, ADV COMPUT, V53, P171; CHEN J, 2005, P INT C ENG MAN C, P381; Chen TY, 2002, EUR J OPER RES, V137, P145, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00137-0; Davenport TH, 1998, SLOAN MANAGE REV, V39, P43; DEAN R, PERSONALIZING YOUR W; Hu YC, 2004, INFORM SCIENCES, V159, P69, DOI 10.1016/S0020-0225(03)00190-7; LI ST, 2003, P 12 INT WORLD WID W, P20; NONAKA I, 1994, ORGAN SCI, V5, P14, DOI 10.1287/orsc.5.1.14; Roda C, 2003, INTERACT COMPUT, V15, P57, DOI 10.1016/S0953-5438(02)00029-2; Tzeng GH, 1998, EUR J OPER RES, V110, P342, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(97)00246-4; VANRIJSBERGEN CJ, 1974, INFORM RETRIEVAL; Wakefield RL, 2005, INFORM MANAGE-AMSTER, V42, P935, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2004.10.002; WIIG K, 1999, COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLE; Yu P.L., 1990, FORMING WINNING STRA; Zhu QM, 2006, ADV ENG INFORM, V20, P31, DOI 10.1016/j.aei.2005.08.001; LOTUS NOTES; MOSS2007	17	1	1	WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD	SINGAPORE	5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE	0218-1940		INT J SOFTW ENG KNOW	Int.

S-MOUNTAIN METHOD FOR OBTAINING FOCUS POINTS FROM DATA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aggregation; data mining; t-norm operators; similarity	CONNECTIVES	We introduce a variation of the Mountain Method called the S-Mountain Method, an algorithm for finding focus points from data points based on the similarity of a focus point with the data points. An important aspect of this algorithm is the association of energy levels with the data points and the reduction of these energy levels as we discover focus points. The rate of reduction of the energy level at a data point is related to its similarity with the recently discovered focus point. We provide a general form for this reduction operation using the t-norm operators. We show how this S-Mountain algorithm can be used to discover focus elements that are granular objects such as fuzzy subsets. Finally we extend the S-Mountain method to environments where our similarities are drawn from an ordinal scale. Here we discuss the interesting question of comparing objects consisting of collections of ordinal values.

APPLYING ASSOCIATION MINING TO CHANGE PROPAGATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Maintenance; change propagation; association-rule mining; concept drift; Linux; FreeBSD; Apache HTTP Server	GUIDE SOFTWARE CHANGES; VERSION HISTORIES	A software system evolves as changes are made to accommodate new features and repair defects. Software components are frequently interdependent, so changes made to one component can result in changes having to be made to other components to ensure that the system remains consistent; this is called change propagation. Accurate detection of change propagation is essential for software maintenance, which can be aided by accurate prediction of change propagation. In this paper, we study change propagation in three leading open-sources of software products: Linux, FreeBSD, and Apache HTTP Server. We use association rules-based data-mining techniques to detect change-propagation rules from the product version history. These rules are evaluated with respect to different training data sets and different test data sets. We discuss the applicability of using association-rule mining for change propagation, and several related issues. We find that a challenging issue in association-rule mining, concept drift, exists in software systems. Concept drift complicates the task of change-propagation prediction and requires special approaches, different from currently-used techniques for predicting change propagation.

The main goat of the analysis is to separate each magnetic resonance image in meaningful clusters, highlighting zones which are more probably related with the cancer evolution. Such non-invasive analysis serves to address novel cancer treatments, resulting in a less destabilizing and more effective type of therapy than the chemotherapy-based ones. The advancements brought by Visual MRI are two: first, it is an integration of effective information visualization (IV) techniques into a clustering framework, which separates each MRI image in a set of informative clusters; the second improvement relies in the clustering framework itself, which is derived from a recently re-discovered non-parametric grouping strategy, i.e., the mean shift. Methodology: The proposed methodology merges visualization methods and data mining techniques, providing a computational framework that allows the physician to move effectively from the MRI image to the images displaying the derived parameter space. An unsupervised non-parametric clustering algorithm, derived from the mean shift paradigm, and called MRI-mean shift, is the novel data mining technique proposed here. The main underlying idea of such approach is that the parameter space is regarded as an empirical probability density function to estimate: the possible separate modes and their attraction basins represent separated clusters. The mean shift algorithm needs sensibility threshold values to be set, which could Lead to highly different segmentation results. Usually, these values are set by hands. Here, with the MRI-mean shift algorithm, we propose a strategy based on a structured optimality criterion which faces effectively this issue, resulting in a completely unsupervised clustering framework. A linked brushing visualization technique is then used for representing clusters on the parameter space and on the MRI image, where physicians can observe further anatomical details. In order to allow the physician to easily use all the analysis and visualization tools, a visual interface has been designed and implemented, resulting in a computational framework susceptible of evaluation and testing by physicians. Results: Visual MRI has been adopted by physicians in a real clinical research setting. To describe the main features of the system, some examples of usage on real cases are shown, following step by step all the actions scientists can do on an MRI image. To assess the contribution of Visual MRI given to the research setting, a validation of the clustering results in a medical sense has been carried out. Conclusions: From a general point of view, the two main objectives reached in this paper are: (1) merging information visualization and data mining approaches to support clinical research and (2) proposing an effective and fully automated clustering technique. More particularly, a new application for MRI data analysis, named Visual MRI, is proposed, aiming at improving the support of medical researchers in the context of cancer therapy; moreover, a non-parametric technique for cluster analysis, named MRI-mean shift, has been drawn. The results show the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Commercial data mining software and sales data from a market research firm are used to create a predictive model of market success in the video game industry. A procedure is then described for transforming the classification trees into a decision-analytic model that can be solved to produce a value-maximizing game development policy. The video game example shows how the compact predictive models created by data mining algorithms can help to make decision-analytic feedforward control feasible, even for large, complex problems. However, the example also highlights the bounds placed on the practicality of the approach due to combinatorial explosions in the number of contingencies that have to be modeled. We show, for example, how the "option value" of sequels creates complexity that is effectively impossible to address using conventional decision analysis tools.

This is a capital issue not only in financial problems, but in many Data Mining domains. Constructive Induction methods help to overcome this problem by mapping the original representation into a new one, where prediction becomes easier. In this work we present GPPE: a GP-based method that projects data from an original data space into another one where data approaches linear behavior (linear separability or linear regression). Also, GPPE is able to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by recombining related attributes and discarding irrelevant ones. We have applied GPPE to two financial domains: Bankruptcy prediction and IPO Underpricing prediction. In both cases GPPE automatically generated a new data representation that obtained competitive prediction rates and drastically reduced the dimensionality of the problem.

J	Hong, TP; Dong, JS; Lin, WY				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Dong, Jun-Song; Lin, Wen Yang			A Modified Three-Phased Object-Oriented Mining Approach for Association Rules	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; object-oriented transaction; inter-class association rule; intra-class association rule; inter-intra association rule		Recently, the object concept has been very popular and used in a variety of applications, especially for complex data description. In this paper, we propose an approach to find from objects three kinds of knowledge: inter-class association rules, intra-class association rules and inter-intra association rules. There are three phases in the algorithm, with each for a kind of knowledge. The results from the previous phase can be used to prune candidates in the current phase. The candidates generated will thus become much fewer than those without pruning. Besides, the approach can be easily modified to stop at an intermediate phase if only the desired kind of knowledge is to be obtained. An example is also given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

J	Shan, MK; Chiang, MF; Kuo, FF				Shan, Man-Kwan; Chiang, Meng-Fen; Kuo, Fang-Fei			Relevance feedback for category search in music retrieval based on semantic concept learning	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						category search; music retrieval; relevance feedback; semantic concept learning	IMAGE RETRIEVAL	Traditional content-based music retrieval systems retrieve a specific music object which is similar to what a user has requested. However, the need exists for the development of category search for the retrieval of a specific category of music objects which share a common semantic concept. The concept of category search in content-based music retrieval is subjective and dynamic. Therefore, this paper investigates a relevance feedback mechanism for category search of polyphonic symbolic music based on semantic concept learning. For the consideration of both global and local properties of music objects, a segment-based music object modeling approach is presented. Furthermore, in order to discover the user semantic concept in terms of discriminative features of discriminative segments, a concept learning mechanism based on data mining techniques is proposed to find the discriminative characteristics between relevant and irrelevant objects. Moreover, three strategies, the Most-Positive, the Most-Informative, and the Hybrid, to return music objects concerning user relevance judgments are investigated. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed relevance feedback mechanism. Experimental results show that, for a database of 215 polyphonic music objects, 60% average precision can be achieved through the use of the proposed relevance feedback mechanism.

For such applications, the curse of high dimensionality tends to be a major obstacle in the development of efficient search methods. This paper addresses the problem of designing an efficient algorithm for high-dimensional nearest neighbor search using a priority queue. The proposed algorithm is based on a simple linear search algorithm and eliminates unnecessary arithmetic operations from distance computations between multidimensional vectors. Moreover, we propose two techniques, a dimensional sorting method and a PCA-based method, to accelerate multidimensional search. Experimental results indicate that our scheme scales well even lor a very large number of dimensions. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Georgieva, T				Georgieva, Tsvetanka			Discovering branching and fractional dependencies in databases	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data dependencies; data mining; dependency discovery	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; VIEWS	The discovery of dependencies between attributes in databases is an important problem in data mining, and can be applied to facilitate future decision-making. In the present paper some properties of the branching dependencies are examined. We define a minimal branching dependency and we propose an algorithm for finding all minimal branching dependencies between a given set of attributes and a given attribute in a relation of a database. Our examination of the branching dependencies is motivated by their application in a database storing realized sales of products. For example, finding out that arbitrary p products have totally attracted at most q new users can prove to be crucial in supporting the decision making. In addition, we also consider the fractional and the fractional branching dependencies. Some properties of these dependencies are examined. An algorithm for finding all fractional dependencies between a given set of attributes and a given attribute in a database relation is proposed. We examine the general case of an arbitrary relation, as well as a particular case where the problem of discovering the fractional dependencies is considerably simplified. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhong, S; Yang, ZQ				Zhong, Sheng; Yang, Zhiqiang			Guided perturbation: towards private and accurate mining	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article								There have been two methods for privacy-preserving data mining: the perturbation approach and the cryptographic approach. The perturbation approach is typically very efficient, but it suffers from a tradeoff between accuracy and privacy. In contrast, the cryptographic approach usually maintains accuracy, but it is more expensive in computation and communication overhead. We propose a novel perturbation method, called guided perturbation. Specifically, we focus on a central problem of privacy-preserving data mining-the secure scalar product problem of vertically partitioned data, and give a solution based on guided perturbation, with good, provable privacy guarantee. Our solution achieves accuracy comparable to the cryptographic solutions, while keeping the efficiency of perturbation solutions. Our experimental results show that it can be more than one hundred times faster than a typical cryptographic solution.

J	Huang, KY; Chang, CH; Lin, KZ				Huang, Kuo-Yu; Chang, Chia-Hui; Lin, Kuo-Zui			Efficient discovery of frequent continuities by projected window list technology	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; frequent continuity; inter-transaction pattern; pattern growth; candidate-free enumeration	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES; PERIODIC PATTERNS; GENERATION	Mining frequent patterns is a fundamental problem in data mining research. A continuity is a kind of causal relationship which describes a definite temporal factor with exact position between the records. Since continuities break the boundaries of records, the number of potential patterns will increase drastically. An alternative approach is to mine compressed or closed frequent continuities (CFC). Mining CFCs has the same power as mining the complete set of frequent patterns, while substantially reducing redundant rules to be generated and increasing the effectiveness of mining. In this paper, we propose a method called projected window list (PWL) technology for the mining of frequent continuities. We present a series of frequent continuity mining algorithms, including PROWL+, COCOA and ClosedPROWL. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm is more efficient than previously works.

Using selective, short-term memory to improve resilience against DDoS exhaustion attacks	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						DDoS attack; data mining; clustering; network security; botnet		Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks originating from botnets can quickly bring normally effective web services to a screeching halt. This paper presents SESRAA (selective short-term randomized acceptance algorithms), an adaptive scheme for maintaining web service despite the presence of multifaceted attacks in a noisy environment. In contrast to existing solutions that rely upon 'clean' training data, we presume that a live web service environment makes finding such training data difficult if not impossible. SESRAA functions much like a battlefield surgeon's triage: focusing on quickly and efficiently salvaging good connections with the realization that the chaotic nature of the live environment implicitly limits the accuracy of such detections. SESRAA employs an adaptive k-means clustering approach using short-term extraction and limited centroid evolution to defend the legitimate connections in a mixed attack environment. We present the SESRAA approach and evaluate its performance through experimental studies in a diverse attack environment. The results show significant improvements against a wide variety of DDoS configurations and input traffic patterns. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In hiding association rules, current approaches require hidden rules or patterns to be given in advance. In addition, for Apriori algorithm based techniques [Verykios, V., Elmagarmid, A., Bertino, E., Saygin, Y., & Dasseni, E. (2004). Association rules hiding. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 16(4) 434-447], multiple scanning of the entire database is required. For direct sanitization of itemsets from transaction techniques [Oliveira, S., & Zaiane, O. (2003). An efficient on-scan sanitization for improving the balance between privacy and knowledge discovery. Technical report TR 03-15, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Canada], one scanning of each window in the database is processed independently. However, the accumulated information among windows is not considered. In this work, we propose an efficient one database scanning sanitization algorithm to sanitize informative association rules. For a given predicting item, an informative association rule set [Li, Jiuyong, Shen, Hong, & Topor, Rodney. (2001). Mining the smallest association rule set for predictions, In Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE international conference on data mining (pp. 361-368)] is the smallest association rule set that makes the same prediction as the entire association rule set by confidence priority. A new data structure called pattern-inversion tree is proposed to store related information so that only one scan of database is required. The pre-process of finding these informative association rules can be integrated into the sanitization process. Numerical experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is more efficient than previous algorithms with similar side effects. Running time complexity of the algorithm is presented and compared to similar algorithm with better complexity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, JX; Li, ZH; Liu, GM				Yu, Jeffrey Xu; Li, Zhiheng; Liu, Guimei			A data mining proxy approach for efficient frequent itemset mining	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article								Data mining has attracted a lot of research efforts during the past decade. However, little work has been reported on the efficiency of supporting a large number of users who issue different data mining queries periodically when there are new needs and when data is updated. Our work is motivated by the fact that the pattern-growth method is one of the most efficient methods for frequent pattern mining which constructs an initial tree and mines frequent patterns on top of the tree. In this paper, we present a data mining proxy approach that can reduce the I/O costs to construct an initial tree by utilizing the trees that have already been resident in memory. The tree we construct is the smallest for a given data mining query. In addition, our proxy approach can also reduce CPU cost in mining patterns, because the cost of mining relies on the sizes of trees. The focus of the work is to construct an initial tree efficiently. We propose three tree operations to construct a tree. With a unique coding scheme, we can efficiently project subtrees from on-disk trees or in-memory trees. Our performance study indicated that the data mining proxy significantly reduces the I/O cost to construct trees and CPU cost to mine patterns over the trees constructed.

Multidimensional databases are designed to store information on measures (also known as indicators) regarding a set of dimensions. One important issue in this framework is the identification of homogeneous areas in data cubes, which allows users to summarize and visualize the data through the main trends they contain. In our previous work, we have proposed a levelwise approach to mine homogeneous areas of the data, called blocks that can be interpreted, for instance, as If product is Chocolate and month is between January and March and city is London or Pat-is, then the number of sales is 5. However, in this work, the information provided by the hierarchies defined over the dimensions is not taken into account. In this paper, we consider the case where measure values are discretized using a fuzzy partition, and we extend our method so as to mine multiple-level fuzzy blocks, that is, blocks that are defined using hierarchies and that characterize fuzzy measure values. Moreover, in order to avoid redundancies in the output set of blocks, only the most specific ones (according to hierarchies) are computed. We show that our algorithms are linear in the size of the cube, thus providing an efficient method for summarizing data cubes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Aggarwal, CC; Yu, PS				Aggarwal, Charu C.; Yu, Philip S.			A framework for condensation-based anonymization of string data	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						privacy; strings; condensation		In recent years, privacy preserving data mining has become an important problem because of the large amount of personal data which is tracked by many business applications. An important method for privacy preserving data mining is the method of condensation. This method is often used in the case of multi-dimensional data in which pseudo-data is generated to mask the true values of the records. However, these methods are not easily applicable to the case of string data, since they require the use of multi-dimensional statistics in order to generate the pseudo-data. String data are especially important in the privacy preserving data-mining domain because most DNA and biological data are coded as strings. In this article, we will discuss a new method for privacy preserving mining of string data with the use of simple template-based models. The template-based model turns out to be effective in practice, and preserves important statistical characteristics of the strings such as intra-record distances. We will explore the behavior in the context of a classification application, and show that the accuracy of the application is not affected significantly by the anonymization process.

J	Ganascia, JG				Ganascia, Jean-Gabriel			Reconstructing True Wrong Inductions	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								There have been many erroneousprescientific and commonsense inductions. We want to understand why people believe in wrong theories. My hypothesis is that mistaken inductions are due not only to the lack or facts, but also to the poor description of existing facts and to implicit knowledge that is transmitted socially. This article presents several experiments the aim of which is to validate this hypothesis by using machine-learning and data-mining techniques to simulate the way people build erroneous theories from observations.

Such a training dataset is usually very large since there are many events to track. This is particularly the case in a WLAN where the number of devices communicating with the WLAN can be large and with ad hoc connectivity. The large size of the unlabeled training dataset creates a problem for the domain expert who is asked to label the records toward creating a training dataset. We present an effective approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as an entity to label records as one of four classes: Red (definite intrusion), Yellow(possibly intrusion), Blue (probably normal), and Green (definite normal). Subsequently, an ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a large real-world WLAN. In addition, ensemble classifier based intrusion detection models built using the labeled training dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the labeling process with good generalization accuracy over multiple test datasets.

We introduce a definition of AD based on the concept of association rule, by means of suitable definitions of the concepts of item and transaction. This definition allow us to measure both the accuracy and support of an AD. We provide an interpretation of the new measures based on the complexity of the theory (set of rules) that describes the dependence, and we employ this interpretation to compare the new measures with existing ones. A methodology to adapt existing association rule mining algorithms to the task of discovering ADs is introduced. The adapted algorithms obtain the set of ADs that hold in a relation with accuracy and support greater than user-defined thresholds. The experiments we have performed show that our approach performs reasonably well over large databases with real-world data.

A signature-based indexing method for efficient content-based retrieval of relative temporal patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						content-based data mining queries; organizing temporal patterns; signature-based indexing methods	ASSOCIATION RULES; PERFORMANCE; FILES; TREE	A number of algorithms have been proposed for the discovery of temporal patterns. However, since the number of generated patterns can be large, selecting which patterns to analyze can be nontrivial. There is thus a need for algorithms and tools that can assist in the selection of discovered patterns so that subsequent analysis can be performed in an efficient and, ideally, interactive manner. In this paper, we propose a signature-based indexing method to optimize the storage and retrieval of a large collection of relative temporal patterns.

J	Shin, SJ; Lee, WS				Shin, Se Jung; Lee, Won Suk			On-line generation association rules over data streams	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data streams; data mining; association rules; prefix-tree lattice		5In order to efficiently trace the changes of association rules over an online data stream, this paper proposes a method of generating association rules directly over the changing set of currently frequent itemsets. While all of the currently frequent itemsets in an online data stream are monitored by the estDec method, all the association rules of every frequent itemset in the prefix tree of the estDec method are generated by the proposed method in this paper. For this purpose, a traversal stack is introduced to efficiently enumerate all association rules in the prefix tree. This online implementation can avoid the drawbacks of the conventional two-step approach. In addition, the prefix tree itself can be utilized as an index structure for finding the current support of the antecedent of an association rule. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sudkamp, T				Sudkamp, Thomas			Refinement of temporal constraints in fuzzy associations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						temporal association rules; data mining; temporal relevance; rule refinement; fuzzy sets	REPRESENTATION; RULES	The objectives of hypothesis refinement in knowledge discovery are to produce rules that more accurately model the underlying data while maintaining rule interpretability. In this paper we introduce two refinement strategies for association rules with fuzzy temporal constraints. Disjunctive generalization produces more general rules by merging adjacent constraints within a partition of the window of temporal relevance. Temporal specification uses linguistic hedges to reduce the duration of a constraint to better model the distribution of examples. Both types of refinement produce rules expressible using the linguistic terms of the original rules.

J	Joshi, S; Jermaine, C				Joshi, Shantanu; Jermaine, Christopher			Materialized sample views for database approximation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						indexing methods; query processing; sampling		We consider the problem of creating a sample view of a database table. A sample view is an indexed materialized view that permits efficient sampling from an arbitrary range query over the view. Such "sample views" are very useful in applications that require random samples from a database: Approximate query processing, online aggregation, data mining, and randomized algorithms are a few examples. Our core technical contribution is a new file organization called the Appendability, Combinability, and Exponentiality (ACE) Tree that is suitable for organizing and indexing a sample view. One of the most important aspects of the ACE Tree is that it supports online random sampling from the view. That is, at all times, the set of records returned by the ACE Tree constitutes a statistically random sample of the database records satisfying the relational selection predicate over the view. Our paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the utility of the ACE Tree.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM				Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			Post-pruning in regression tree induction: An integrated approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						regression tree; decision tree; post-pruning; data mining; performance measures; multi-objective programming; mixed integer programming; analytic hierarchy process	DECISION TREES; RULE INDUCTION; MODELS; PREDICTION; VECTORS	The regression tree (RT) induction process has two major phases: the growth phase and the pruning phase. The pruning phase aims to generalize the RT that was generated in the growth phase by generating a subtree that avoids over-fitting to the training data. Most post-pruning methods essentially address post-pruning as if it were a single objective problem (i.e., maximize validation accuracy), and address the issue of simplicity (in terms of the number of leaves) only in the case of a tie. However, it is well known that apart from accuracy there are other performance measures (e.g., stability, simplicity) that are important for evaluating DT quality. In this paper we present an integrated approach to post-pruning phase that simultaneously accommodates multiple performance measures that are important for evaluating RT quality, and obtains the optimal subtree based on user provided preference and value function information.

One encounters a not-so-perfect database from which data is missing, and the results obtained from such a database may provide biased or misleading solutions. Therefore, imputing missing data to a database has been regarded as one of the major steps in data mining. The present research used different methods of data mining to construct imputative models in accordance with different types of missing data. When the missing data is continuous, regression models and Neural Networks are used to build imputative models. For the categorical missing data, the logistic regression model, neural network, C5.0 and CART are employed to construct imputative models. The results showed that the regression model was found to provide the best estimate of continuous missing data; but for categorical missing data, the C5.0 model proved the best method.

To support data mining post-processing, which is one of important procedures in a data mining process, at least 40 indices are proposed to find out valuable knowledge. However, their behavior have never been clearly articulated. Therefore, we carried out a correlation analysis between each objective rule evaluation indices. In this analysis, we calculated average values of each index using bootstrap method on 32 classification rule sets learned with information gain ratio. Then, we found the following relationships based on the correlation coefficient values: similar pairs, discrepant pairs, and independent indices. With regarding to this result, we discuss about relative functional relationships between each group of objective indices.

However, since their behaviors have never been elucidated, domain experts are required to spend their time to understanding the meanings of each index in a given data mining result. In this paper, we present an analysis of the behavior of objective rule evaluation indices on classification rule sets by principle component analysis (PCA). Therefore, we carried out a PCA to a dataset consisting of the 39 objective rule evaluation indices. In order to obtain the dataset, we calculated the average values of the bootstrap method on 32 classification rule sets learned by information gain ratio. Then, we identified the seven functional groups of the objective indices based on the PCA. Using this result, we discuss a rule evaluation interface for use by human experts.

Although, EMADS is not restricted to one data mining task, the study described here, for the sake of brevity, concentrates on agent based Association Rule Mining (ARM), in particular what we refer to as frequent set meta mining (or Meta ARM). A full description of our proposed Meta ARM model is presented where we describe the concept of Meta ARM and go on to describe and analyse a number of potential solutions in the context of EMADS. Experimental results are considered in terms of: the number of data sources, the number of records in the data sets and the number of attributes represented.

However learning from such datasets can be difficult as they are often drawn from different domains, i.e., not identically distributed or differ in class or feature sets. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning the class structures of related domains in an unsupervised manner. Its setting generalizes that of information filtering and novelty defection applications which addresses both known and unknown classes. We propose a co-clustering framework for estimating and adapting the class structures of two related domains, enabling the analyses of shared and unique classes. We define an objective function using interaction information to take account of the divergence between the corresponding clusters of respective domains. We present an iterative algorithm which alternates object and feature clustering and converges to a local minimum of the objective function. We present empirical results using text benchmarks, comparing the proposed algorithm and combinations of conventional approaches in problems of partitioning documents and detecting unknown topics.

Users are afraid of misuse of this data and discovered knowledge. Thus several methods of preserving privacy classification have been proposed in literature. One of these methods enables miners to use continuous and nominal attributes simultaneously in classification. Reconstruction of probability distribution is an important task in privacy preserving classification for both nominal and continuous attributes which were distorted with the randomization-based technique and are stored in centralized database. We present the new algorithm - EQ -for reconstruction of probability distribution of nominal attributes, which outperforms former algorithm especially for high privacy levels. Effectiveness of the new solution (information loss in reconstruction of probability distribution of nominal attributes and accuracy of classification) has been tested and presented in this paper	Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci, Warsaw, Poland	Andruszkiewicz, P (reprint author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci, Nowowiejska 15-19, Warsaw, Poland.

Expert systems are considered one of the well know techniques for knowledge management and can be aid in solving problems in specific domain. Case-based reasoning has been successfully used for managing knowledge of implicit time. Data mining is a new methodology for searching and discover hidden pattern in very huge data bases. On the other hand, an effective protection of our environment is largely dependent on the quality of the available information used to make an appropriate decision. Recently, a new discipline called Environmental Informatics integrates environmental science with computer science is emerging. This paper discusses the role of AI technologies; namely, expert systems and data mining, in environmental KMS.

Mining@home: Public resource computing for distributed data mining	FROM GRIDS TO SERVICE AND PERVASIVE COMPUTING			English	Proceedings Paper	10th CoreGRID Symposium 2008	AUG 25-26, 2008	Canary Isl, SPAIN			public resource computing; desktop grids; data mining; closed frequent itemsets; peer-to-peer computing	NETWORKS	Several kinds of scientific and commercial applications require the execution of a large number of independent tasks. One highly successful and low cost mechanism for acquiring the necessary compute power for these applications is the"public-resource computing", or"desktop Grid" paradigm, which exploits the computational power of private computers. So far, this paradigm has not been applied to data mining applications for two main reasons. First, it is not. trivial to decompose a data mining algorithm into truly independent sub-tasks. Second, the large volume of data involved makes it difficult to handle the communication costs of a parallel paradigm. In this paper, we focus on one of the main data mining problem: the extraction of closed frequent itemsets from transactional databases. We show that is possible to decompose this problem into independent tasks, which however need to share a large volume of data. We thus introduce a data-intensive computing network, which adopts a P2P topology based oil super peers with caching capabilities, aiming to support the dissemination of large amounts of information. Finally, we evaluate the execution of our data mining job on such network.

The combination of these, called composite episodes, has attracted far less attention in literature, however. The main reason is that the well-known frequent pattern explosion is far worse for composite episodes than it is for item sets or episodes. Yet, there are many applications where composite episodes are required, e.g., in developmental biology were sequences containing gene activity sets over time are analyzed. This paper introduces an effective algorithm for the discovery of a small, descriptive set of composite episodes. It builds on our earlier work employing MDL for finding such sets for item sets and episodes. This combination yields an optimization problem. For the best results the components descriptive power has to be balanced. Again, this problem is solved using MDL.

To illustrate these methods we draw on data from two ITSs for math instruction.

The effected main areas are highway surveillance systems, access cards, transport payments, RFID passports and product tracking systems. Tagged products can be tracked in an appropriately equipped warehouse with the help of the installed RFID readers. The movement of the customers can be followed because of a tag attached to the shopping cart or the products stored in it. In this paper, assuming such an environment, it has been examined how relevant information can be retrieved with the help of data mining methods from the collected, RFID-related data.

A large number of databases have been developed in order to help scientists to design new materials. Databases of experimental results can be used to learn prediction models of each property. Data mining methods, can be applied on such databases to discover empirical rules and predict properties. In this paper we propose a method for discovering new orders of the chemical elements. This reorganization of the chemical elements can be used to improved prediction accuracy of classification methods and to enhance similarities between elements. A genetic algorithm is used to find a satisfying solution according to several evaluation criteria through a Pareto-based multi-objective approach. We carried out several experiments of prediction of compound formation (ternary chalcopyrite compounds A BX2, where X is either S, Se or Te). The first results showed that distance-based evaluation seems promising, as it has been possible to discover groups of similar elements regarding the task.

A large part of the factors which influence the success of a data mining problem reside in the quality of the data used Feature selection represents one of the tools which can refine a dataset before presenting it to a learning scheme. This paper analyzes a wrapper approach for feature selection, with the purpose of boosting the classification accuracy. A wrapper is viewed as a 3-tuple consisting of a generation procedure, an evaluation function and a validation procedure & Experimental evaluations have been performed for several combinations of the three components. The results have shown that feature selection improves the classification accuracy and speeds up the training process. Moreover, two robust combinations are proposed: one that constantly achieves highest accuracy, and one which significantly boosts the initial accuracy of the inducer.

The method uses the 'divide and conquer' strategy. Using competitive learning the feature space is divided into subregions where the classifiers are constructed. The structure of the ensemble starts from a single member and new members are being added during the training. The growth of the ensemble is self determined until the ensemble reaches the desired accuracy. The overall response of the ensemble to an input pattern is represented by the output of a winning member for the particular pattern. The method is generic, i.e. it is not bound to a specific type of classifier and it is suitable for parallel implementation. It is possible to use the method for data mining. A basic wide margin linear classifier is used in the experiments here. Experimental results achieved on artificial and real world data are presented and compared to the results of Gaussian SVM. Parallel implementation of the method is described.

The aim of this work is to build a new RFID-based autonomous system to follow individuals spatio-temporal activity, which is not currently available, and to develop new tools for automatic data mining. We study here how to transform these data to obtain knowledge about the division of labor and intra-colonial cooperation and conflict in an ant colony by developing a new unsupervised learning data mining method (DS2L-SOM : Density-based Simultaneous Two-Level - Self Organizing Map) to find homogeneous clusters (i.e., sets of individual witch share a distinctive behavior). This method is very fast and efficient and it also allows a very useful visualization of results.

It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which can be computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t(3)) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features and t = min(m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(<= n) is the average number of non-zero features in each sample. Extensive experimental results on four real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

There are several fuzzy association rule mining techniques that can work on spatio-temporal data. Their ability to mine fuzzy association rules has to be compared on a realistic scenario. Besides the performance criteria, other criteria that can express the quality of an association rule discovered shall be specified. In this paper, fuzzy association rule mining is performed with spatio-temporal data cubes and Apriori algorithm. A real life application is developed to compare data cubes and Apriori algorithm according to the following criteria: interpretability, precision, utility, novelty, direct-to-the-point, performance and visualization, which are defined within the scope of this paper.

The proposed algorithm calculates the densities of an object and its neighbors and constructs the similar density series(SDS) in the neighborhood of the object. Based on the SDS, the proposed algorithm computes the average series cost(ASC) of the object and the DSNOF of the object can he obtained according to the ASC of the object and those of the neighbors of the object. The experiments are performed on the synthetic and the real datasets. The experiments results verify that the proposed algorithm not only can detect outlier more effectively and but also do not increase the time and the space complexities.

In this paper, we develop and evaluate a method that utilizes both the visual features and the semantic information to extract informative blocks. We first partition a web page into semantic blocks using vision-based page segmentation. The visual and the semantic information got by LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) are extracted to form the feature-vector of the block. Second we manually annotate informative or uninformative labels to the blocks. The labeled blocks are used as training dataset to train a classification model. Then the informative blocks can be extracted through the model. Our experiments show that the proposed EIBA (Extract Informative Block Arithmetic) is able to dramatically improve the results in near-duplicate detection and classification tasks.

This raises the problem of how to represent, organize, aggregate, and make available such data so as to have it become meaningful and usable knowledge, facilitating the design and development of agents, and enabling them to acquire high-degrees of context awareness at limited efforts. In this paper, we identify the key software engineering challenges introduced by the need of accessing and exploiting huge amount of heterogeneous contextual information. Following, we survey the relevant proposals in the area of context-aware pervasive computing, data mining and granular computing discussing their potentials and limitations. On these bases, we propose the W4 model for contextual data and show how it can represent an effective model to enable flexible general-purpose management of contextual knowledge, to facilitate agents in achieving high degrees of context-awareness and, overall, to facilitate the design and development of complex multiagent systems.

The clinical context is that of Neonatal Intensive Care, an acute care environment distinguished by multi-dimensional and high-frequency data. Six key trends are identified and classified into the following categories: (1) data; (2) results; (3) integration; and (4) knowledge base. These trends form the basis of next-generation knowledge discovery in data systems, which must address challenges associated with supporting multi-dimensional and real-world clinical data, as well as null hypothesis testing. Architectural drivers for frameworks that support data mining and temporal abstraction include: process-level integration (i.e. workflow order); synthesized knowledge bases for temporal abstraction which combine knowledge derived from both data mining and domain experts; and system-level integration.

The implicit underlying technique is to search for association rules which indicate that executing a particular source line will cause the whole execution to fail. This technique, however, has limitations. In this article, we first propose to consider more expressive association rules where several lines imply failure. We then propose to use Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to analyze the resulting numerous rules in order to improve the readability of the information contained in the rules. The main contribution of this article is to show that applying two data mining techniques, association rules and FCA, produces better results than existing fault localization techniques.

The aim of this paper consists in trying to discover whether removal of irrelevant and redundant information improves the performance of neural network training results. The present study will describe a new method of training the neural networks, namely, training neural networks using input data features. For selecting the features, we used a filtering technique (borrowed from data mining) which consists in selecting the best features from a training set. The technique is made up of two components: a feature evaluation technique and a search algorithm for selecting the best features. When applied as a data preprocessing step for one common neural network training algorithms, the best data results obtained from this network are favorably comparable to a classical neural network training algorithms. Nevertheless, the first one requires less computation.

Feature Selection from Protein Primary Sequence Database using Enhanced QuickReduct Fuzzy-Rough Set	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRANULAR COMPUTING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing	AUG 26-28, 2008	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		Feature Selection; Protein primary sequence database; QuickReduct; Fuzzy-Rough Set		Feature extraction and Feature selection have become an apparent need in many Bioinformatics applications In this paper, the features are extracted from protein primary single sequence database, based on amino acid composition and k-mer patterns or k-tuples and then feature selection is carried out from the extracted features. Since the Rough QuickReduct is not yet applied for protein sequence data set, the Enhanced QuickReduct Feature Selection (EQRFS) algorithm using Fuzzy-Rough set is proposed. Rough Sets theory deals with uncertainty and vagueness of an information system m Data Mining Fuzzy-Rough based feature selection provides a means by which discrete or real-valued noisy data or a mixture of both can be effectively reduced. The experiments are carried out on protein primary single sequence data sets which are derived from PDB on SCOP classification, based on the structural class predictions such as all alpha, all beta, all alpha+beta and all alpha/beta	Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Sivakasi 626124, India	Chandran, CP (reprint author), Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Sivakasi 626124, India.	cpchandran@gmail.com					CAO YF, 2006, BMC BIOINFORMATICS; CHOUCHOULAS A, 2001, APPL ARTIFICIAL INTE, V15; Dubois D., 1992, PUTTING ROUGH SETS F, P203; HU X, 2004, FUNDAMENTA INFORM, P1; Jensen R., 2005, COMBINING ROUGH FUZZ; PAWLAK Z, 1982, INT J COMPUT INF SCI, V11, P341, DOI 10.1007/BF01001956; Pawlak Z., 1991, ROUGH SETS THEORETIC; Thangavel K., 2006, AIML J, V6; YANG WY, COMP STUDY FEATURE E	9	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-2512-9				2008							111	114		10.1109/GRC.2008.4664758		4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BIY98	WOS:000263829500034	
J	Chang, YI; Shen, JH; Chen, TI				Chang, Ye-In; Shen, Jun-Hong; Chen, Tsu-I			A data mining-based method for the incremental update of supporting personalized information filtering	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Computer Symposium (ICS 2006)	2006	Taipei, TAIWAN			data mining; incremental update; information filtering; personalization; profile	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS	Information filtering is an area of research that develops tools for discriminating between relevant and irrelevant information. Users first give descriptions about what they need, i.e., user profiles represented by a set of keywords, to start the services. A profile index is built on these profiles. Then, the Web page will be recommended to the users whose profiles belong to the filtered results. Therefore, a critical issue of the information filtering service is how to index the user profiles for an efficient matching process. Among previous proposed methods, Wu and Chen's graph-based index method can expect to minimize the storage space. However, when the users often change their interests, the index structure of Wu and Chen's method needs to be reconstructed, resulting in the high update cost. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data mining-based method for the incremental update of the index structure, the updatabte tree, to reduce the update cost. In fact, each keyword could have a weight representing the degree of importance to a user. We apply this feature to distinguish between long-term and short-term interests. By making use of the property that the short-term interest has a higher probability to be changed than the long-term one, our proposed method can locally update the short-term interest, resulting in the low update cost. According to our experimental results, our method really can reduce the update cost as needed by Wu and Chen's method.

To fulfill this effort, i(+)DiaKAW has been developed to provide a novel dynamic on-line decision tree learning scheme i(+)Learning (intelligent and incremental learning) methodology that is able to incrementally incorporate the new incoming data with an existing decision tree without relearning the entire tree from scratch. i(+)Learning strategy makes up for the traditional incremental decision tree learning algorithms by concerning the new available features in addition to the new coming instances. Such theory is a new attempt and is designed specifically for bridging the current gaps. The empirical results demonstrate a comparison of performance of various classification algorithms on several real-life datasets from UCI repository.

The evaluation process might take a lot of time, especially when the database to be scanned could not totally fed into main memory. In this paper, an enhanced approach, called the Cluster-based Genetic-Fuzzy mining approach for items with Multiple Minimum Supports (CGFMMS), is thus proposed to speed up the evaluation process and keep nearly the same quality of solutions as the previous one.

In the proposed framework, the domain boundaries predicated by ProDom database are used to provide a better measurement in calculating the sequence similarity. In addition, we use an unsupervised clustering algorithm as the kernel that includes a hierarchical clustering in the first phase to pre-cluster the protein sequences, and a partitioning clustering in the second phase to refine the clustering results. More specifically, we perform the agglomerative hierarchical clustering on protein sequences in the first phase to obtain the initial clustering results for the subsequent partitioning clustering, and then, a profile Hidden Markove Model (HMM) is built for each cluster to represent the centroid of a cluster. In the second phase, the HMMs based k-means clustering is then performed to refine the cluster results as protein families. The experimental results show our model is effective and efficient in clustering protein families.

Here we describe an effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data mining tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.

This technology promises to monitor the whole genome on a single chip so that researchers can have a better picture of the interactions among thousands of genes at the same time. It becomes a challenge to extract information from the large amount of data through data mining. One important application of gene expression microarray data is cancer classification. However, gene expression data collected for cancer classification usually has the property of the number of genes far exceeding the number of samples. Work in such a high dimensional space is extremely difficult. Previous researches have used two-stage classification method to deal with the gene expression data. Such approaches select genes to reduce problem dimension in the first stage and classify tumors in the second stage. In the study, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is introduced to select genes relevant to cancers first, then the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) neural network and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for cancer classification. Experimental results show that selecting genes by using ACO algorithm can improve the accuracy of BP and SVM classifiers. The optimal number of genes selected for cancer classification should be set according to both the microarray dataset and gene selection methods.			ymchiang@isu.edu.tw; hueimin@mail.njtc.edu.tw; m9420007@stmail.isu.edu.tw					Albrecht A, 2003, ARTIF INTELL MED, V28, P75, DOI 10.1016/S0933-3657(03)00036-8; Antoniadis A, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P563, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg062; Cho SB, 2003, INT J SOFTW ENG KNOW, V13, P593, DOI 10.1142/S0218194003001469; Dorigo M, 1996, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V26, P29, DOI 10.1109/3477.484436; Dorigo M, 2000, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V16, P851, DOI 10.1016/S0167-739X(00)00042-X; DUDOIT S, 2002, J AM STAT ASSOC, V97, P1; Furey TS, 2000, BIOINFORMATICS, V16, P906, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.10.906; Huang D, 2005, IEEE T CIRCUITS-I, V52, P1909, DOI 10.1109/TCSI.2005.852013; Keedwell E, 2005, INTELLIGENT BIOINFORMATICS: THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES TO BIOINFORMATICS PROBLEMS, P1, DOI 10.1002/0470015721; Lee KE, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P90, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/19.1.90; Li LP, 2001, BIOINFORMATICS, V17, P1131, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/17.12.1131; Nguyen DV, 2002, BIOINFORMATICS, V18, P39, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.39; Simek K, 2004, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V17, P417, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2004.04.015; Thomas JG, 2001, GENOME RES, V11, P1227, DOI 10.1101/gr.165101; Torkkola K, 2001, INFORM SCIENCES, V139, P79, DOI 10.1016/S0020-0255(01)00158-X; Wang Y, 2005, COMPUT BIOL CHEM, V29, P37, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.11.001; Weston J, 2001, ADV NEUR IN, V13, P668	17	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-2095-7				2008							4001	4006				6	Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics	Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics	BII01	WOS:000259604902168

An important part Of this process that is often overlooked is the user's comprehension of the classifier and the results it produces. Associative classifiers begin to address this issue by using sets of simple rules to classify items. However the size of these rule sets can be an obstacle to understandability. In this work, we present an interactive visualization system that allows the user to visualize various aspects of the classifier's decision process. This system shows the rules that are relevant to the classification of an item, the ways in which the item's characteristics relate to these rules, and connections between the item and the classifier's training data set. The system also contains a speculation component, which allows the user to modify rules within the classifier, and see the impact of these changes. Thus, this component allows the user to contribute domain expertise to the classification process, consequently improving the accuracy of the classifier.

Extracting interesting knowledge from raw data, or data mining in a broader sense, has become an indispensable task. Nevertheless, data collected from complex phenomena represent often the integrated result of several interrelated variables, whereas these variables are less precisely defined. The basic principle of data mining is to distinguish which variable is related to which and how the variables are related. In many situations, the digitized information is gathered and stored as a data matrix. It is often the case, or so assumed, that the exogenous variables depend on the endogenous variables in a linear relationship. Retrieving "useful" information therefore can often be characterized as finding "suitable" matrix factorization. This paper offers a synopsis from this prospect on how linear algebra techniques can help to carry out the task of data mining. Examples from factor analysis, cluster analysis, latent semantic indexing and link analysis are used to demonstrate how matrix factorization helps to uncover hidden connection and do things fast. Low rank matrix approximation plays a fundamental role in cleaning the data and compressing the data. Other types of constraints, such as nonnegativity, will also be briefly discussed.

Consequently, evaluating current customers to keep high value customers and enhance their lifetime value becomes a critical factor to decide the success or failure of a business. This study applies data from customer and transaction databases of a department store, based on RFM model to do clustering analysis to recognize high value customer groups for cross-selling promotions. Study findings show that clustering analysis can locate high value customers, and appropriate target marketing can enhance their lifetime value effectively. The implication for marketer is that leveraging techniques of data mining can make the most from data of customers and transactions databases, to create sustainable competitive advantages.

A user that submits a workload consisting of tens of thousands of jobs to a grid of thousands of processors has a good chance of receiving thousands of error messages as a result. How can one begin to reason about such problems? We propose that data mining techniques can be employed to classes failures according to the properties of the jobs and machines involved. We demonstrate this technique through several case studies on real workloads consisting of tens of thousands of jobs. We apply the same techniques to a year's worth of data on a 3000 CPU production grid and use it to gain a high level understanding of the system behavior.

As the data grows without limit at a rapid rate, it is hard to track the new changes of frequent itemsets over data streams. W propose an efficient one-pass algorithm in sliding windows over data streams with an error bound guarantee. This algorithm does not need to refer to obsolete transactions when they are removed from the sliding window. It exploits a compact data structure to maintain potentially frequent itemsets so that it can output recent frequent itemsets at any time. Flexible queries for continuous transactions in the sliding window can be answered with an error bound guarantee.

In order to facilitate their application in different areas, ranging from protein to protein interaction in bioinformatics to text mining in computational linguistics research, a modular and general mining framework is needed. The major constraint to the generalization process concerns the feature design for the description of relational data. In this paper, we present a machine learning framework for the automatic mining of relations, where the target objects are structurally organized in a tree. Object types are generalized by means of the use of roles, whereas the relation properties are described by means of the underlying tree structure. The latter is encoded in the learning algorithm thanks to kernel methods for structured data, which represent structures in terms of their all possible subparts. This approach can be applied to any kind of data disregarding their very nature. Experiments with Support Vector Machines on two text mining datasets for relation extraction, i.e. the PropBank and FrameNet corpora, show both that our approach is general, and that it reaches state-of-the-art accuracy.

The framework builds on the hierarchical event schema as a cogitative construct for the understanding of dynamic phenomena and on the granularity tree as a hierarchical ontological construct for spatiotemporal phenomena. The construction of event schemas (and granularity trees) is carried out using scale-space analysis from which the interval tree, a hierarchical decomposition of the data is derived. We show that the interval tree fulfills the Axioms and conditions of both time granularity and granularity trees, and expand the granularity tree construct to support temporal order constraints. Once hierarchical decomposition is derived, the data mining problem is transformed to an ordered tree matching problem.

Clustering technique has been proven to be an effective approach for data-gathering in wireless sensor networks. However, these data are characteristic of being heavily noisy, exhibiting temporal and spatial correlation. Data mining is a process in which a wide spectrum of data analysis methods is used. In order to extract useful information from such data, in this paper, we propose a novel cluster formation algorithm, which is called ACE-C algorithm according to mining sensor nodes. Compared to the ILP algorithm, the proposed algorithm increase the cluster head election mechanism, and the simulation results show that ACE-CILP algorithm achieves its intention of consuming less energy, equalizing the energy consumption of all the nodes, as well as extending the network lifetime perfectly.

The aim of the proposed approach is to choose ail optimal Subset of input features using genetic algorithm by eliminating, features with little or no predictive information and increase the comprehensibility of resulting HFLANN. Using the functionally expanded selected features, HFLANN overcomes the non-linearity nature of problems, which is commonly encountered in single layer neural networks. All extensive simulation studies has been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of this method over to its rival functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network.

This kind of coloring is useful to decompose any system into communities, where each community contains a vertex adjacent to all the other communities. This kind of organization can provide improving in many fields, especially in the data clustering. In this paper we propose a new self-stabilizing algorithm for finding a b-coloring of arbitrary undirected connected graphs.

While the setting of First Order Logic (FOL) is the most suitable one to model the multirelational data of real and complex domains, on the other hand it puts the question of the computational complexity of the knowledge induction that represents a challenge for multi-relational data mining algorithms. Indeed, the complexity of most real domains, in which a lot of relationships are required to model the objects involved, calls for both an efficient and effective search method for exploring the space of candidate solutions and a deduction procedure assessing the validity of the discovered knowledge. A way of tackling the complexity of such domains is to use a method that reformulates a multi-relational learning task into an attribute-value one. In this paper we propose an approximate reasoning technique that decreases the complexity of a relational problem changing both the language and the inference operation used for the deduction. The complexity of the FOL language is decreased by means of a stochastic propositionalization method, while the NP-completeness of the deduction is tackled using an approximate query evaluation. The induction is performed with an anytime algorithm, implemented by a population based method, able to efficiently extract knowledge from structured data in form of complete FOL definitions. The validity of the proposed technique has been proved making an empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset.	[Di Mauro, Nicola; Basile, Teresa M.

So it is difficult for human users or intrusion response systems to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. To solve this problem different intrusion scenario detection methods are proposed. In this paper a data mining method is used to find the attack scenarios. Firstly redundancy alerts are checked and deleted, then attack scenario patterns are mined by using the associate-rule algorithms which is an improved Apriori algorithm. These mined scenario patterns are used to rind attack scenarios. In (his paper 1999 DARPA intrusion detection scenario specific datasets are used as the experimental data and the corresponding results are shown. Compared with current scenario detection methods which depend on human knowledge to define attack scenarios, our methods use data mining method to find the scenarios automatically. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.

While most of the earlier clustering algorithms focused on numerical data, real-world problems and data mining applications frequently involve categorical data. Here, we propose a new clustering algorithm for categorical data that is based on the frequency of attribute value combinations. Our algorithm finds all the combinations of attribute values in a record, which represent a subset of all the attribute values, and then groups the records using the frequency of these combinations. As our algorithm considers all the subsets of attribute values in a record, records in a cluster have not only similar attribute value sets but also strongly associated attribute values. We evaluated our algorithm with real and synthetic data sets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Data contains rich information about the machine, and acquiring knowledge from it or data mining in other words is considered as an effective way solving this problem. An algorithm based on rough set and genetic algorithm for feature reduction is proposed in this paper. Minimal assemble of necessary features i.e. reduct is computed, from which diagnosis rules can be generated. On the base of the rules discovered, an expert system for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is presented. It is a production rule-based expert system developed on CLIPS, and realized together with VC++ programming and SQL SERVER database. To validate the diagnosis system, an experiment is carried out in rotor test-bed and further improvement is pointed out.

The two techniques that are combined to address this problem correspond to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Data Mining Clustering application. The criterion used to group the machines in cells is based on the minimization of inter-cell movements. A maximum cell size is imposed and the number of cell is parameterizable. Some published exact results have been used as benchmarks to assess the proposed algorithm. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find the optimal solutions on almost all instances with low variability and stability.

Many distance measures have been proposed as an alternative to the Euclidean Distance in the Nearest Neighbor Classifier. To verify the assumption that the combination of various similarity measures may produce a more accurate classifier, we have proposed an algorithm to combine several measures based on weights. We have carried out a set of experiments to verify the hypothesis that the new algorithm is better than the classical ones. Our results show an improvement over the well-established Nearest-Neighbor with DTW (Dynamic Time Warping), but in general, they were obtained combining few measures in each problem used in the experimental evaluation.

X, where X contains source signals for each experiment, A contains source-sensor mixing coefficients, and both A and X are unknown. We assume that the only a-priori information available is that A must have zeros at certain positions; this constrains the source-sensor network connectivity pattern. In general, different AX factorizations approximate a given Y equally well, so a fundamental question is how the connectivity restricts the solution space. We present a combinatorial characterization of uniqueness up to diagonal scaling, called structural identifiability of the model, using the concept of structural rank from combinatorial matrix theory. Next, we define an optimization problem that arises in the need for efficient experimental design: to minimize the number of sensors while maintaining structural identifiability. We prove its NP-hardness and present a mixed integer linear programming framework with two cutting-plane approaches. Finally, we experimentally compare these approaches on simulated instances of various sizes.

A frequently performed step in microarray analytics is the clustering of co-expressed genes by their GO bioprocesses. Biological deductions are then made from the visual representation of the cluster pattern. Thus far, the question of how different representations of GO-annotated clusters affect biological interpretation and usability has not been investigated. In this paper, we evaluated two representations of GO-annotated clusters of co-expressed genes. Using a published cDNA microarray dataset, we tested the effect of each representation on biological interpretation. We also reported the results of the user evaluation conducted with bench biologists from different areas of expertise. Our study suggests that the bipartite graph may be more suitable for microarray analytics.	[Fung, David C.

In this work, we propose a web search personalization methodology by coupling data mining techniques with the underlying semantics of the web content. To this purpose, we exploit reference ontologies that emerge from web catalogs (such as ODP), which can scale to the growth of the web. Our methodology uses ontologies to provide the semantic profiling of users' interests based on the implicit logging of their behavior and the on-the-fly semantic analysis and annotation of the web results summaries.

Finding a knowledge model may require to join all the data sources and to run a machine learning algorithm on the joint set. We present an alternative based on a Multi Agent System (MAS): an agent mines one data source in order to extract a local theory (knowledge model) and then merges it with the previous MAS theory using a knowledge fusion technique. This way, we obtain a global theory that summarizes the distributed knowledge without spending resources and time in joining data sources. The results show that, as a result of knowledge fusion, the accuracy of initial theories is improved as well as the accuracy of the monolithic solution.	[Gaya, Maria Cruz; Giraldez, J.

Multi-relational Data Mining for Tetratricopeptide Repeats (TPR)-Like Superfamily Members in Leishmania spp.: Acting-by-Connecting Proteins	PATTERN RECOGNITION IN BIOINFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN BIOINFORMATICS		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics	OCT 15-17, 2008	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IAPR		Multi-relational data raining; hidden Markov models; Viterbi algorithm; tetratricopeptide repeat motif; Leishmania proteins	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; TPR; SEQUENCES; MOTIF; DATABASES; FAMILY; HELIX	The multi-relational data mining (MRDM) approach looks for patterns that involve multiple tables from a relational database made of complex/structured objects whose normalized representation does require multiple tables. We have applied MRDM methods (relational association rule discovery and probabilistic relational models) with hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Viterbi algorithm (VA) to mine tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), pentatricopeptide (PPR) and half-a-TPR (HAT) in genomes of pathogenic protozoa Leishmania. TPR is a protein-protein interaction module and TPR-containing proteins (TPRPs) act as scaffolds for the assembly of different multiprotein complexes. Our aim is to build a great panel of the TPR-like superfamily of Leishmania. Distributed relational state representations for complex stochastic processes were applied to identification, clustering and classification of Leishmania genes and we were able to detect putative 104 TPRPs, 36 PPRPs and 08 HATPs, comprising the TPR-like superfamily. We have also compared currently available resources (Pfam, SMART, SUPERFAMILY and TPRpred) with our approach (MRDM/HMM/VA).	[Girao, Karen T.; Oliveira, Fatima C. E.; Farias, Kaio M.; Maia, Italo M.

A parallelization framework for exact knowledge hiding in transactional databases	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IFIP TC 11/ 23RD INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	23rd International Information Security Conference held at the 20th World Computer Congress	SEP 07-10, 2008	Milano, ITALY	IFIP TC 11		exact knowledge hiding; parallelization; constraints satisfaction problems; binary integer programming	ASSOCIATION RULES	The hiding of sensitive knowledge, mined from transactional databases, is one of the primary goals of privacy preserving data mining. The increased storage capabilities of modern databases and the necessity for hiding solutions of superior quality, paved the way for parallelization of the hiding process. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for decomposition and parallel solving of a category of hiding algorithms, known as exact. Exact algorithms hide the sensitive knowledge without any critical compromises, such as the blocking of non-sensitive patterns or the appearance of infrequent itemsets, among the frequent ones, in the sanitized outcome. The proposed framework substantially improves the size of the problems that the exact algorithms can efficiently handle, by significantly reducing their runtime. Furthermore, the generality of the framework makes it appropriate for any hiding algorithm that leads to a constraint satisfaction problem involving linear constraints of binary variables. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on handling a large variety of hiding problem instances.

While the existing grid and web-service frameworks allow interoperability and flexible resource utilization, achieving efficiency and scalability remains a critical challenge. Similarly, the existing grid and web-service frameworks do not provide transparency in accessing and processing data from grid-based data servers. We present design and evaluation of a system that supports a high-level interface for developing data mining and scientific data processing grid-services and targets data residing on SRB servers. Results of our evaluation using two data mining and one scientific data processing applications show two important observations. First, each of applications we evaluated demonstrated good scalability with respect to dataset size, as well as changing numbers of both data host and compute nodes. Second, there Is only a small overhead associated with deploying our middleware-based applications using MPICH-G2 and Globus. This overhead varied between 14% and 22% and is primarily because of a larger memory footprint. Thus, overall, our work shows that it is feasible to develop and deploy scalable and efficient grid-services that process data from remote servers.

This can be important in the context of data mining, in order to obtain the best predictions from the data on a limited cost budget. We define a parsimonious linear regression objective criterion that jointly minimizes prediction error and feature cost. We modify least angle regression algorithms commonly used for sparse linear regression to produce the ParLiR algorithm, which not only provides an efficient and parsimonious solution as we demonstrate empirically, but it also provides formal guarantees that we prove theoretically	[Goetschalckx, Robby; Driessens, Kurt] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium	Goetschalckx, R (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium.

A router that does not respond to a traceroute query is referred to as an anonymous router and is represented by a '*' in the traceroute output. ling Anonymous router resolution refers to the task of identifying the occurrences of '*' that belong to the same router in the underlying network. This task is an important step in building traceroute-based topology maps and obtaining an optimum solution is shown to he NP-complete. In this paper, we use a novel technique from graph data mining field to build an efficient solution. The results of our experiments oil both synthetic and genuine topologies show a significant improvement in accuracy and effectiveness over the existing approaches.

There are mainly two kinds of ways for knowledge discovery: the one is to get specialized knowledge from experts in this fields, the second is to provide automated analysis solutions from database. But there are few studies that focus on the knowledge discovery combing specialized knowledge with automatic knowledge analysis. In this paper, rough set methodology is extended with a heuristic research algorithm. This algorithm, based on the discernibility matrices, integrates the frequency and significance of the attributes and the contribution rate of the rules to subjective judgment. This algorithm can find out the attributes with relative high subjective values. It is especially of importance to controllable system, where the value can be affected by the subjective judgment. And this algorithm is applied in the empirical studies in information security management.

The usual approach is to select a subset of patients based on such variables and analyze the images associated with those patients. In this paper we apply data mining techniques to take the opposite approach: We start with the images and explain the differences and commonalities in terms of the other variables. In the first step, we cluster PET scans of patients to form groups sharing similar features in brain metabolism. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time ever that clustering is applied to whole PET scans. In the second step, we explain the clusters by relating them to non-image variables. To do so, we employ RSD, an algorithm for relational subgroup discovery, with the cluster membership of patients as target variable, Our results enable interesting interpretations of differences in brain metabolism in terms of demographic and clinical variables. The approach was implemented and tested on an exceptionally large pre-existing data collection of patients with different types of dementia. It comprises 10 GB of image data from 454 PET scans, and 42 variables from psychological and demographical data organized in 11 relations of a relational database. We believe that explaining medical images in terms of other variables (patient records, demographic information, etc.) is a challenging new and rewarding area for data mining research.

Therefore, data transformation to ensure privacy preservation is needed. Meanwhile, the transformed data must have quality to be used in the intended data mining task, i.e. the impact on the data quality with regard to the data mining task must be minimized. However, the data transformation problem to preserve the data privacy while minimizing the impact has been proven as, an NP-hard. In this paper, we address the problem of maintaining the data quality in the scenarios which the transformed data will be used to build associative classification models. We propose a novel heuristic algorithm to preserve the privacy and maintain the data quality. Our heuristic is guided by the classification correction rate (CCR) of the given datasets. Our proposed algorithm is validated by experiments. From the experiments, the results show that the proposed algorithm is not only efficient, but also highly effective.

An intelligent image analysis system is proposed to discover knowledge from video collections. The system is applied to synthetic image sequences containing motions of a predator and prey behaving according to a set of rules.

However, few works have been done on applying ACS to data mining. This paper proposes an ACS-based algorithm to extract membership functions in fuzzy data mining. The membership functions are first encoded into binary bits and then fed into the ACS to search for the optimal set of membership functions. An example is given to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments are also made to show the performance of the proposed approach.

A number of algorithms have been proposed in both data mining, and machine learning area. These algorithms are usually Used ill sin-le table environment. where data are stored in one relational table or one flat file. They are not suitable for multi-relational environment, where data are stored in multiple tables joined each other by semantic relationships. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel approach called FARS to do both feature and relation Selection for efficient multi-relational classification. By this approach, we not only extend traditional feature selection method to selects relevant features from multi-relations, but also develop a new method to reconstruct the multi-relational database schema and get rid of irrelevant tables to further improve classification performance. Results of experiments conducted on several real databases show that FARS can effectively choose a small set of relevant features, enhancing the classification efficiency significantly and improving prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid recommender system from a perspective of considering learner community structures to collaborative filtering. In our approach, multiple types of information are explored and exploited, including learners and learning items and learner social information. Leveraging the types of information, we apply multiple techniques from data mining, including multi-relational data mining and graph data mining, to explicitly discovery learner community structures, which in turn are used in collaborative filtering. Our experiments suggest that our approach provides improved accurate recommendations than other approaches.

One of the techniques in QA is to predict the product quality based on the product features. However, traditional QA techniques have faced some drawbacks such as heavily depending on the collection and analysis of data and frequently dealing with uncertainty processing. In order to improve the effectiveness during a QA process, a hybrid approach incorporated with data mining techniques such as rough set theory (RST), fuzzy logic (FL) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. Based on an empirical case study, the proposed solution approach provides great promise in QA.

Although meaningful and convenient, Euclidean distance has weaknesses. These include providing an over simplified representation of spatial dependence, being limited to certain spatial pattern and symmetrical relationships, being unable to account for cross-class dependencies, and unable to work with categorical especially multinomial data. This paper introduces Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as an attractive approach to uncovering hidden spatial patterns. The HMM assumes that a hidden state (factor or process) generates observable symbols (indicators). This doubly embedded stochastic approach uncovers hidden states based on observed symbol sequences using two integrated sets of probabilities, transition probability and emission probability. As an alternative to Euclidean distance based approaches, the HMM measures spatial dependency by transition probabilities and cross-class correlation better capturing geographic context. HMM works with data of any measurement scale and dimension. To demonstrate the method, we assume urban spatial structure as a hidden spatial factor underlying single family housing unit prices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, we then use the HMM to uncover four hidden spatial states from home sale prices.

In this paper, non linear transformations are applied to the original feature space in order to produce Euclidean 3D spaces preserving the similarity structure of the samples, which are represented with Virtual Reality (VR) techniques. By using these new spaces, it is visualized how certain features (i.e. position, pressure and torque) contain more meaningful information that can characterize a biometric profile when virtually signing.

There are large numbers of time series in the field of automatic control. Usually time series data is massive. Sometimes, it is inefficient or impractical to mine the original time series data directly. So time series should be represented on higher level. Piecewise Linear Representation is perhaps the most frequently used representation with lower dimensions of index structure and the faster speed of calculation. But PLR needs a parameter k given by users and to make certain k is not easy for the users. We put forward an algorithm of error restricted piecewise linear representation based on special points that can give the number of fitting lines automatically according to a given error e. And it has lower time complexity than other error restricted algorithm, such as sliding windows, Bottom-Up, Top-Down. According to experiments our algorithm leads to less fitting error and better performance than other algorithms. So it would be more efficient in the real application of control fields.

Until now there are many parallel algorithms to mine association rules, this paper emphatically analyses existing parallel mining algorithms' realization skill and defects. On the basis, a new data structure, called FP-Forest. is designed with a multi-trees structure to store data. At the same time, a new parallel mining model is proposed according to the property of FP-Forest, which combines the advantage of data-parallel method and task-parallel method. First, database is reasonably divided to data processing nodes by core processor, and FP-Forest structure is built on data processing nodes for each sub-database. Secondly, core node perform a one-tune synchronization merging for each FP-Forest, and every MFP-Tree on FP-Forest is dynamical assigned to corresponding mining node as sub-task by task-parallel technique. Furthermore, a fast parallel mining algorithm, namely FDPM, is presented to mine association riles according to above model, which mining process adopts frequent growth method basing on deepth-first searching strategy. From experimentation on real data sets, the algorithm has greatly enhanced association rules mining efficiency.

In this paper, we present a combined classification algorithm based on C4.5 and NB, simply C4.5-NB. In C4.5-NB, the class probability estimates of C4.5 and NB are weighted according to their classification accuracy on the training data. We experimentally tested C4.5-NB in Weka system using the whole 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compared it with C4.5 and NB. The experimental results show that C4.5-NB significantly outperforms C4.5 and NB in terms of classification accuracy. Besides, we also observe the ranking performance of C4.5-NB in terms of AUC (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). Fortunately, C4.5-NB also significantly outperforms C4.5 and NB.

Such data call be pre-processed to obtain trajectories which are sequences of spatio-temporal data points belonging to a. moving object. Recently, advanced data mining techniques have been developed for extracting patterns from moving object trajectories to enable applications such as city traffic planning, identification of evacuation routes, trend detection, and many more. However, when special care is not taken, trajectories of individuals may also pose serious privacy risks even after they are de-identified or mapped into other forms. In this paper, we show that an uuknown private trajectory call be reconstructed from knowledge of its properties released for data mining, which at first glance may not seem to pose any privacy threats. In particular, we propose a. technique to demonstrate how private trajectories can be re-constructed from knowledge of their distances to a bounded set of known trajectories. Experiments performed on real data sets show that the number of known samples is surprisingly smaller than the actual theoretical bounds.

A key issue is to extract and make use of significant features hidden behind the chronological and structural dependencies found in these sequences. Almost all existing algorithms designed to perform this task are based on the matching of patterns in chronological order, but such sequences often have similar structural features in chronologically different positions. In this paper we propose SCS, a novel method for measuring the similarity between categorical sequences, based on an original pattern matching scheme that makes it possible to capture chronological and non-chronological dependencies. SCS captures significant patterns that represent the natural structure of sequences, and reduces the influence of those representing noise. It constitutes an effective approach for measuring the similarity of data such as biological sequences, natural language texts and financial transactions.

Once obtained, the list of association rules extractable from a given dataset is compared in order to evaluate their importance level. The measures commonly used to assess the strength of all association rule are the indexes of support, confidence, and the lift. Relative Linkage Disequilibrium (RLD) was originally proposed as an approach to analyse both quantitatively and graphically general two way contingency tables. RLD can be considered an adaptation of the lift measure with the advantage that it presents more effectively the deviation of the support of the whole rule from the support expected tinder independence given the supports of the LHS (A) and the RHS (B). RLD can be interpreted graphically using a simplex representation leading to powerful graphical display of association relationships. Moreover the statistical properties of RLD are known so that confirmatory statistical tests of significance or basic confidence intervals can be applied. This paper will present the properties of RLD ill the context of association rules and provide several application examples to demonstrate it's practical advantages.

Individual signal complexes in CFAEs reflect electrical activity of electrophysiologic substrate at given time. To identify CFAEs sites, we developed algorithm based on wavelet transform allowing automated feature extraction from Source signals. Signals were ranked by three experts into four classes. We compiled a, representative data set of 113 instances with extracted features as inputs and average of expert ranking as the output. In this paper, we present results of our CAME data mining algorithm, that. was used to (a) predict average ranking of experts, (b) classify into three classes. The performance of the GAME algorithm was compared to well known data mining techniques using robust ten times tenfold cross validation. Results indicate that wavelet signal decomposition could carry high level of predictive information about the state of electrophysiologic substrate and that the GAME algorithm outperforms other data mining techniques (such as decision trees, linear regression, neural networks, Support Vector Machines, etc.) in both prediction and classification accuracy.

J	Korfiatis, G; Paliouras, G				Korfiatis, Georgios; Paliouras, Georgios			Modeling web navigation using grammatical inference	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								In this article, a method that models user navigation on the web, as opposed to a single website, is presented, aiming to assist the user by recommending pages. User modeling is done through data mining of web usage logs, resulting in aggregate, rather than personal models. The proposed approach extends grammatical inference methods by introducing an extra merging criterion, which examines the semantic similarity of automaton states. The experimental results showed that the method does indeed facilitate the modeling of web navigation, which was not possible with the existing web usage mining methods. However, a content-based recommendation model is shown to still outperform the proposed method, which suggests that the knowledge of the navigation sequence does not contribute to the recommendation process. This is due to the thematic cohesion of navigation sessions, in comparison to the large thematic diversity of web usage data. Among three variants of the proposed method, the one based on Blue Fringe, that examines a larger space of possible merges, performs better.

J	Kovalerchuk, B; Vityaev, E				Kovalerchuk, Boris; Vityaev, Evgenii			Symbolic methodology for numeric data mining	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; KDD; relational data mining; numerical data; first order logic; probabilistic first order logic rules; stock market; image processing; edge detection		Currently statistical and artificial neural network methods dominate in data mining applications. Alternative relational (symbolic) data mining methods have shown their effectiveness in robotics, drug design, and other areas. Neural networks and decision tree methods have serious limitations in capturing relations that may have a variety of forms. Learning systems based on symbolic first-order logic (FOL) representations capture relations naturally. The learned regularities are understandable directly in domain terms that help to build a domain theory. This paper describes relational data mining methodology and develops it further for numeric data such as financial and spatial data. This includes (1) comparing the attribute-value representation with the relational representation, (2) defining a new concept of joint relational representations, (3) a process of their use, and the Discovery algorithm. This methodology handles uniformly the numerical and interval forecasting tasks as well as classification tasks. It is shown that Relational Data Mining (RDM) can handle multiple constrains, initial rules and background knowledge very naturally to reduce the search space in contrast with attribute-based data mining. Theoretical concepts are illustrated with examples from financial and image processing domains.

This greedy method is fast but can fail for certain classification problems. As an alternative a global approach based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be applied. We developed Global Decision Tree (GDT) system, which learns a tree structure and tests in one run of the EA. Specialized genetic operators are used, which allow the system to exchange parts of trees, generate new sub-trees, prune existing ones as well as change the node type and the tests. The system is able to induce univariate, oblique and mixed decision trees. In the paper, we investigate how the GDT system can profit from a, parallelization on a compute cluster. Both parallel implementation and distributed version of the induction are considered and significant speedups are obtained. Preliminary experimental results show that at least for certain problems the distributed version of the GDT system is more accurate than its panmictic predecessor.

The cost of this representation depend only on the number of reference time series rather than on the length of the time series. In this demonstration, we present a Java toolkit which is able to perform several data mining tasks based on this novel time series representation. In particular, this framework allows the user to explore the properties of our novel approach in comparison to other state-of-the-art compression methods. The results are visually presented in a very concise way so that the user can easily identify important settings of the model-based time series representation.

We describe the architecture of a distributed data mining system in which genetic programming agents create a large amount of structurally different models which are stored in a model database. A search engine for models that is connected to this database allows interactive exploration and analysis of models, and composition of simple models to hierarchical models. The search engine is the crucial component of the system in the sense that it supports knowledge discovery and paves the way for the goal of finding interesting hidden causal relations.

Our choice of closed patterns as a user preference representation is based on both theoretical and practical considerations supported by Formal Concept Analysis. We simulated interaction with a calendar application using 16 months of real data from a user's calendar to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of suggestions, in order to determine the best data mining and solution generation techniques from a range of available methods. The best performing data mining method was then compared with decision tree learning, the best machine learning algorithm in this domain. The results show that our data mining method based on closed patterns converges faster than decision tree learning, whilst generating only consistent solutions. Thus closed pattern mining is a better technique for generating appointment attributes in the calendar domain.

Inferring graph grammars by detecting overlap in frequent subgraphs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						grammar induction; graph grammars; graph mining; multi-relational data mining		In this paper we study the inference of node and edge replacement graph grammars. We search for frequent subgraphs and then check for an overlap among the instances of the subgraphs in the input graph. If the subgraphs overlap by one node, we propose a node replacement graph grammar production. If the subgraphs overlap by two nodes or two nodes and an edge, we propose an edge replacement graph grammar production. We can also infer a hierarchy of productions by compressing portions of a graph described by a production and then inferring new productions on the compressed graph. We validate the approach in experiments where we generate graphs from known grammars and measure how well the approach infers the original grammar from the generated graph. We show graph grammars found in biological molecules, biological networks, and analyze learning curves of the algorithm.

Finding frequent itemsets is computationally the most expensive step in association rule discovery and therefore it has attracted significant research attention. In this paper, we present a more efficient approach for mining complete sets of frequent itemsets. It is a modification of FP-tree. The contribution of this approach is to count the frequent 2-itemsets and to form a graphical structure which extracts all possible frequent itemsets in the database. We present performance comparisons for our algorithm against FP-growth algorithm.	[Kumar, A. V.

Many existing techniques, like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), offer solutions for comparing two whole time series. Often, however, the important thing is to analyse certain regions, known as events, rather than the whole times series. This applies to domains like the stock market, seismography or medicine. In this paper, we propose a method for comparing two time series by analysing the events present in the two. The proposed method is applied to time series generated by stabilometric and posturographic systems within a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings.

Particularly, the algorithms of discovering frequent user's behavior patterns in the mobile agent system have been studied extensively in recent years. The key feature in most of these algorithms is that they use a location log dataset with user's requested services. In this case, some problems occur because they do not consider that mobile user's behavior patterns are dynamically variable as time passes. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining method based on temporal mobile access patterns that can efficiently discover mobile user's behavior patterns. An advantage of our method compactly stores user's behavior patterns according to location log dataset and requested services in memory. Thus, even the information datasets require large shared memory when they store, our approach still provides faster access and consume less memory than existing techniques.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to study a special episode rule, named serial episode rule with a time lag in an environment of multiple data streams. This rule can be widely used in different applications, such as traffic monitoring over multiple car passing streams in highways. Mining serial episode rules over the data stream environment is a challenge due to the high data arrival rates and the infinite length of the data streams. In this paper, we propose two methods considering different criteria on space utilization and precision to solve the problem by using a prefix tree to summarize the data streams and then traversing the prefix tree to generate the rules.

The Leurre.com Project: Collecting Internet Threats Information using a Worldwide Distributed Honeynet	WISTDCS 2008: WOMBAT WORKSHOP ON INFORMATION SECURITY THREATS DATA COLLECTION AND SHARING			English	Proceedings Paper	7th Workshop on Information Security Threats Data Collection and Sharing	APR 21-22, 2008	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	European Commiss, WOMBAT Project				This paper aims at presenting in some depth the Leurre.com project and its data collection infrastructure. Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd [24] to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen [151 technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By, doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.

This approach provides detailed insight into processor performance, power consumption and complexity. However, only configurations in a subspace can be simulated in practice due to long simulation time and limited resource, leading to suboptimal conclusions which might not be applied in a larger design space. In this paper, we propose an automated performance prediction approach which employs state-of-the-art techniques from experiment design, machine learning and data mining. Our method not only produces highly accurate estimations for unsampled points in the design space, but also provides interpretation tools that help investigators to understand performance bottlenecks. According to our experiments, by sampling only 0.02% of the full design space with about 15 millions points, the median percentage errors, based on 5000 independent test points, range from 0.32% to 3.12% in 12 benchmarks. Even for the worst-case performance, the percentage errors are within 7% for 10 out of 12 benchmarks. In addition, the proposed model can also help architects to find important design parameters and performance bottlenecks.

Recently, there has been much interest in mining streaming data. Because streaming data is large and no limited, it is unpractical that passing the entire data over more than one time. A one pass online algorithm is necessary. One of the most successful algorithms for mining data streams is VFDT(Very Fast Decision Tree). we extend the VFDT system to EVFDT(Efficient-VFDT) in two directions: (1)We present Uneven Interval Numerical Pruning (shortly UINP) approach for efficiently processing numerical attributes. (2)We use naive Bayes classifiers associated with the node to process the samples to detect the outlying samples and reduce the scale of the trees. From the experimental comparison, the two techniques significantly improve the efficiency and the accuracy of decision tree construction on streaming data.

To make more people can use data mining systems conveniently; data mining system based on Case Based Reasoning was put forward in the paper. In this system, cases were organized under fuzzy quotient space model instead of traditional case index tree. Quotient space theory can divide orient universe into different grain size world, when retrieving case, it doesn't need to compare with all the cases in case base like index tree, which can improve retrieval efficiency and accurate rate. Experiment indicates the average effect was improved by 51.81 percent; it will become higher if the case base becomes bigger.

Closed frequent itemsets is the condensed representation of frequent itemsets thus spend less memory, so it is much suitable for stream mining. But on the other hand, when the minimum support is much lower, the size of closed frequent itemsets turns larger, which makes the performance reduced a lot. In this paper, we introduce a threshold to approximately mine closed frequent itemsets with a limited error tolerance. A new algorithm named ACFIM is proposed based on the introduction of the distance conception to mine the sliding window of stream, in which more data are pruned and more computation time are saved, so it much raise the performance in running time and memory comparing to the state-of-art closed frequent itemsets mining methods. Our experimental results over real-life datasets show that ACFIM is effective and efficient.

This paper presents some data mining methods to generate the language variables on which fuzzy control rules' generation depends. These methods are incremental fuzzy clustering algorithm in a batch mode, data weight associated with scale of samples control, divisional threshold value control. These methods can achieve the targets as follows: (1) update the rule base dynamically: (2) limit the samples' infinite growth and adjust controlled model dynamically by real-time information; (3) control the object exactly and quickly.

Two stream of previous work has dealt with the discovery of association rules over multiple relations: prolog databases and datalog queries. The MRI Iceberg-cubes mining method introduces a new perspective. However, it does not take the cyclic join paths into account, therefore, in this paper, we will introduce an algorithm, Extended-MRI-cube, which is based on the MRI-Cube algorithm, to handle the cyclic join path situation. Experiments show it is more applicable and effective than the previous one.

At present, there are many researchers who focus on analyzing learner roles based on collaborative learning activities. But most Of them subjectively presume the diversity of learners' roles in advance and then verify it based on the statistics of interaction data. In contrast, this paper adopts the data mining technology to explore learners' roles in collaborative learning. Referring to the typical process of data mining, this paper proposes a framework of role analysis based on Data Mining which data preparation and learner discourse pattern mining are depicted. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to show the mining process and finding as well as discussion on the mining results.

In distributed storage systems, prefetching for metadata files is critical for the overall system performance. In this paper, an Affinity-based Metadata Prefetching (AMP) scheme is proposed for metadata servers in large-scale distributed storage systems to provide aggressive metadata prefetching. Through mining useful information about metadata accesses from past history, AMP can discover metadata file affinities accurately and intelligently for prefetching. Compared with LRU and some of the latest file prefetching algorithms such as Nexus and C-Miner, our trace-driven simulations show that AMP can improve buffer cache hit rates by up to 12%, 4.5% and 4% respectively, while reduce the average response time by up to 60%, 12% and 8%, respectively.

In order to maximally capture common information between trees, we consider the problem of computing all common embedded subtrees, and advocate using the number/count of all common embedded subtrees as a measure of similarity. This problem is not trivial due to the inherent complexity of trees and the ensued large search space. The problem is theoretically analyzed and an effective algorithm for counting all common embedded subtrees is presented. Experimental evaluation shows that the all common embedded subtree similarity is very competitive against tree edit distance, in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.

Practically, the essence of the Information technology application on education is that Learning is the essential and the technology is the auxiliary. That is, on education, the information technology just acts as a method or a tool in the process of learning. As the IT gets more mature, the e-learning becomes more popular. If the e-learning can effectively exploit the techniques of Data-mining, it will make user-learning more efficient. Thus, in this project, we not only continue the e-learning activity-based material recommendation system construction, but also design the self-evaluation system supporting with semantic search for an adaptive learning platform. In this paper, we mainly propose the ontology-based self-evaluation system with material recommendation system for providing a better learning platform. In the item bank construction, we will invite some domain experts to assist the collection and creation of examination questions and classification. We believe such self-directed learning system will be good for the improvement on the efficiency of the e-learning and will be beneficial to get more achievements on learning for learners.

Generally, human error is the only cause to be blamed. However, approaching roadside environment that drivers confronted with right before crash occurrence is actually critical to crash occurrence. In this study, environmental factors critical to intersection crashes occurrence were identified via negative binomial regression and artificial neural networks. With these factors, data mining was then applied to Find the rule for judging intersections safety. The 3,441 crashes occurred at 102 intersections in Taichung, Taiwan during 1999 similar to 2004 were collected. Numbers of crashes in specific approaching direction combinations were then modeled. It was found that geometry of approaching roadways was indeed critical. Total 47 safety rules generated from Gini decision tree can serve as a tool for safety evaluation of intersections. Finally, although no single factor can induce crashes alone, road width seems to be a crucial factor for intersection-related crash occurrence.

While a conventional decision rule expresses the trivial equality relations between attributes and values from the same or different objects, inequality rules express the non-equivalent relationships between attributes and values. The problem of mining inequality rules is formulated as a process of mining equality rules from a compensatory decision table. In order to mine high-order inequality rules, one can transform the original decision table to a high-order compensatory decision table, in which each new entity is a pair of objects. Any standard data-mining algorithm can then be used. We theoretically analyze the complexity of proposed models based on their meta-level representation in cognitive informatics. Mining inequalities in decision table makes a complementary feature of a rule induction system, which may result in generating a small number of short rules for domains where attributes have large number of values, and when majority of them are correlated with the same decision class.

Data classification is an important task of data mining, which has been at the center of research interest in recent years. The research of this paper is on classification. Starting from fuzzy KNN classification method, based on the idea of cluster before classification, a method-KNN method based on cluster before classification - is proposed. Paper executes particular and extensive experiments, which include two parts: validating the influence the parameters have on new method and comparing the expansibility of the new classification method and fuzzy KNN method with the increasing of the dataset size and the number of attributes. The experimental results show the benefits of new method when dealing with larger datasets. Finally, the proposed method is applied to data preprocessing. Executing the classification on vector map datasets about vegetation, the vegetation style can be obtained, so data preprocessing is completed; we also display the classification results using the software of geography information system such as ArcGIS.

Limited by the basic theory of data mining, the sample size cannot be too small. However, it is difficult to collect enough data in some applications. Sometimes, strict requirement for sample collection lead to the generation of many small sample sets with similar characteristics. If the constraint for data collection is relaxed, the similar samples may be combined into a large sample set. The process of combining small samples is essentially a process of clustering, since both processes involve grouping data based on similarity. A new clustering algorithm, which is independent of the similarity, is presented in this paper. With this algorithm, 1516 samples of flights records are reduced to 4 large sample sets. The experiments show that the combining is helpful for determining the probability distribution of the samples, which is useful for flight delay early warning system.

Feature selection aims to pre-select a relatively small number of attributes, thus speeding up further processing and (hopefully) eliminating data that have minimal or no discriminatory power. Often, feature selection is done on the basis of the straightforward statistical correlation, discarding features that have the lowest correlation with the target class(es). However, when these correlation values tend to be rather low for all features (common in many datasets of importance), the basis for pre-selection of any specific set of features is undermined, and straightforward feature selection may do more harm than good. We confirm this by investigating the performance of five feature selection strategies on several datasets with varying overall correlation values, finding that statistical correlation is never the best choice for poorly correlated data. The most reliable methods among those tested are either no feature selection, or Evolutionary Algorithm feature selection.

Different from traditional Internet services, search involves myriad offline computations to analyze data at a very large scale, and an infrastructure for "scale" experiments is often required to evaluate the effectiveness of newly invented algorithms in a simulated "real" environment. In this talk, I will first review a variety of new trends in computational economies on the Internet in which search and online advertising have become the driving forces in building underlying computing infrastructure. Then, I will introduce current efforts at Microsoft Research Asia on building this new infrastructure. I will also discuss how these efforts are influencing the design of next-generation search engines from an architecture stand-point. Some advanced search technologies based on the use of this infrastructure and deeper data mining on the Web will also be demonstrated.									0	1	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-540-78848-5	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2008	4976						9	9				1	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BHP82	WOS:000255194500002

The ever increasing volumes of data in different applications forces clustering algorithms to cope with it. DBSCAN is a well-known algorithm for density-based clustering. It is both effective so it can detect arbitrary shaped clusters of dense regions and efficient especially in existence of spatial indexes to perform the neighborhood queries efficiently. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm GriDBSCAN to enhance the performance of DBSCAN using grid partitioning and merging, yielding a high performance with the advantage of high degree of parallelism. We verified the correctness of the algorithm theoretically and experimentally, studied the performance theoretically and using experiments on both real and synthetic data It proved to run much faster than original DBSCAN. We compared the algorithm with a similar algorithm, Enhanced DBSCAN, which is also an enhancement to DBSCAN using partitioning. Experiments showed the new algorithm's superiority in performance and degree of parallelism.

Flow-based Identification of Botnet Traffic by Mining Multiple Log Files	DFMA 2008: FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED FRAMEWORKS & APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Distributed Frameworks and Applications	OCT 21-22, 2008	Penang, MALAYSIA		Univ Sains Malaysia	Malware; botnet; intrusion detection; data mining		Botnet detection and disruption has been a major research topic in recent years. One effective technique for botnet detection is to identify Command and Control (C&C) traffic, which is sent from a C&C center to infected hosts (bots) to control the bots. If this traffic van be detected. both the C&C center and the bots it controls can be detected and the botnet can be. disrupted. We propose a multiple log-file based temporal correlation technique for detecting C&C traffic. Our main assumption is that hots respond much faster Than humans. By temporally correlating two host-based log files, we are able to detect this property and thereby detect hot activity in a host machine. In our experiments we apply this technique to log files produced by tcpdump and exedump, which record all incoming and outgoing network packets, and the start times of application executions at the host machine, respectively. We apply data mining to extract relevant features from these log files and detect C&C traffic. Our experimental results validate our assumption and show better overall performance when compared to other recently published techniques.

Students who used HLH very frequently had the lowest learning rate; their learning was also shallow. They attempted very difficult problems compared to other groups but only solved very easy problems, suggesting that they were usually situated well beyond their Zone of Proximal Development. They also abandoned a large number of problems without solving them. IvIanual inspection of the logs showed erratic problem solving behaviour, suggesting a "guess and copy" strategy. The group of students who used HLH very infrequently seemed to contain two distinct sub-groups: students with high expertise, and students with very low expertise who still did not use HLH. Learning rates were highest for students who used moderate HLIL Students with lower usage of HLH solved the most difficult problems comparatively, without the use of HLH, and had high learning rates, suggesting the ITS is most beneficial for this group of students.

The data were analyzed by data mining software, i.e. "ICONS Miner" (Koden Industry Co., Ltd.). The significant "If-then rules" were extracted from the decision tree between bacteria detection on blood samples and patients' treatments, such as lactobacillus therapy, antibiotics, various catheters, etc. The chi-square test, odds ratio and logistic regression were applied in order to analyze the effect of lactobacillus therapy to bacteria detection. From odds ratio of lactobacillus absence to lactobacillus presence, bacteria detection risk of lactobacillus absence was about 2 (95%CI: 1.57-2.99). The significant "If-then rules", chi-square test, odds ratio and logistic regression showed that lactobacillus therapy might be the significant factor for prevention of blood stream infection. Our study suggests that lactobacillus therapy may be effective in reducing the risk of blood stream infection. Data mining is useful for extracting background risk factors of blood stream infection from our clinical database.

Data are delivered for both static: (fixed) and mobile (embarked) sensors, generating large and complex spatio-temporal series. Research efforts ill handling these data range front pattern matching and data mining techniques (for forecasting and trend analysis) to work oil database: queries (e.g., to construct scenarios). Work on embarked sensors also considers issues on trajectories and moving objects. This paper presents a new kind of framework to manage static sensor data. Our work is based on combining research oil analytical methods to process sensor data, and database procedures to query these data. The first component is geared towards supporting pattern matching, whereas the second deals with spatio-temporal database issues. This allows distinct granularities and modalities of analysis of sensor data ill space and time. This work was conducted within a project that uses real data, with test conducted on 1000 sensors, duriag 3 years, in a large French city.

Reduced Polynomial Neural Swarm Net for Classification Task in Data Mining	2008 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			SYSTEMS	In this paper, we proposed a reduced polynomial neural swarm net (RPNSN) for the task of classification. Classification task is one of the most studied tasks of data mining. In solving classification task of data mining, the classical algorithm such as Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) takes large computation time because the network grows over the training period (i.e. the partial descriptions (PDs) in each layer grows in successive generations). Unlike PNN our proposed network needs to generate the partial description for a single layer. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to select a relevant set of PDs as well as features, which are then fed to the output layer of our proposed net which contain only one neuron. The selection mechanism used here is a kind of wrapper approach. Performance of this model is compared with the results obtained from PNN.

A Data Mining Approach for Predicting Reliable Path for Congestion Free Routing Using Self-motivated Neural Network	SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NETWORKING AND PARALLEL/DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Software Engineering Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	AUG 06-08, 2008	Phuket, THAILAND	Int Assoc Comp & Informat Sci, IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, UniNet, Thailand Convent & Exhibit Bureau				Congestion in computer networks is a significant problem due to the growth of networks and increased link speeds. Now it is common to see internet gateway drops 10% of the incoming packets because of local buffer overflows. An optimal solution for this problem is Predicting congestion free path(s) by learning the dynamic characteristics of networks and its topology. The factors that influence the prediction of such path(s) have the characteristics viz., dynamic, non-linear, incertitude, etc., which make traditional data mining approach, like neural prediction have to process a large amount of convoluted data. In this paper, we proposed prediction model rather than mathematical model for finding congestion free path(s). We introduced a self-motivated learning in the training phase of an improved functional link feed-forward neural network for predicting reliable path that offer congestion free path(s).	[Mohan, B.

Semantic clustering of the World Bank data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; semantics assignment; feature selection; fuzzy clustering; cluster validity		World Development Indicators (WDI) published annually by the World Bank provide comparative socio-economic data for state economies. Several countries show common trends in their development. But to understand these trends in the development process, an appropriate interpretation of the intrinsic similarities has to be found. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to assigning an adequate semantics to clusters formed by fuzzy c-means clustering. Despite of the ability to identify unique characteristics for the found clusters, the introduced fuzzy c-landmarks show a great potential for dimension reduction and for simplified data set descriptions. Experiments performed so far confirm efficient processing for this kind of exploratory data analysis.

This paper proposes a novel approach to solution based on ARTMAP-IC - a general-purpose neural network system for supervised learning and recognition. For a popular dataset, with proper preprocessing steps, the model outperforms similar techniques and provides prediction accuracy equal to the best one obtained by a backpropagation MLPs. An advantage of the proposed model over the MLPs is the short online learning, fast adaptation to novel patterns and scalability.

Learning systems tend to be biased towards the majority class and thus have poor performance in classifying the minority class instances. This paper analyzes the imbalance problem in accuracy-based learning classifier system XCS. XCS has shown excellent performance on some data mining tasks, but as other classifiers, it also performs poorly on imbalance data problems. We analyze XCS's behavior on various imbalance levels and propose an appropriate parameter tuning to improve performance of the system. Particularly, XCS is adapted to eliminate over-general classifiers(1) and protect accurate classifiers of minority class. Experimental results in Boolean function problems show that. with proposal adaptations, XCS is robust to class imbalance.

With the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the ageing population the amount of paper-work is more than ever before. In the US, a hospital admission of one patient generates an estimate of 60 pieces of paper. The federal governments of various countries have passed policies and initiatives that focus on introducing information systems into the health care sector. Technology will immensely reduce the cost of managing patients and even reduce the risks of mis-diagnosing and prescribing incorrect medications to patients. This paper primarily focuses on introducing the concept of ontology based warehouse modelling and managing ecology of human body for disease and drug prescription management. Disorders of the human body and factors such as the patient's age, living and working conditions, familial and genetic influences can be simulated into Metadata in a warehousing environment. In this environment, various relationships are identified and described between these factors and the diseases. Secondly, we also introduce ontological representation of the various human body systems such as the digestive, musculoskeletal and nervous system in disease processes. Although this is an extensive and complex knowledge domain, the work in this paper is one of the first to attempt to introduce the use of ontology based data warehousing and data mining conceptually. We also aim at implementing and applying this research in practice.

Most of the evolutionary algorithms propose biological paradigms, and concepts of natural selection, mutation and reproduction. Nevertheless other paradigms exist which can be adopted in the creation of evolutionary algorithms. Many problems involve not structured environments which can be solved from the perspective of cultural paradigms and, which offer plenty of category models where one does not know the possible solutions of a problem, a common situation in real life. The intention of the present work is to apply the computational properties of cultural technology, in this case to corroborate by means of data mining and, to propose the solution of a specific problem, adapted from the literature about society modelling. In addition, we analyze the voting behavior and ratings of judges in a popular song contest held every year in Europe. The dataset makes it possible to analyze the determinants of success, and gives a rare opportunity to run a direct test of vote trading from logrolling. We show that they are rather driven by linguistic and cultural proximities between singers and voting countries. With this information it is possible to predict the score of a new country, redistributed the assigned votes for a lot of the participants, this paper tries to explain this social behaviour.

We propose a novel method to find infinitely many kernel combinations for learning problems with the help of infinite and semi-infinite optimization regarding all elements in kernel space. This will provide to study variations of combinations of kernels when considering heterogeneous data in real-world applications. Looking at all infinitesimally fine convex combinations of the kernels from the infinite kernel set, the margin is maximized subject to an infinite number of constraints with a compact index set and an additional (Riemann-Stieltjes) integral constraint due to the combinations. After a parametrisation in the space of probability measures it becomes semi-infinite. We analyze the conditions which satisfy the Reduction Ansatz and discuss the type of distribution functions of the kernel coefficients within the structure of the constraints and our bilevel optimization problem.

A New GHSOM Model Applied to Network Security	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS - ICANN 2008, PT I	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Arificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2008)	SEP 03-06, 2008	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				ANOMALY DETECTION	The self-organizing map (SOM) have shown to be successful for the analysis of high-dimensional input data as in data mining applications such as network security. However, the static architecture and the lack of representation of Hierarchieal relations are its main drawbacks. The growing hierarchieal SOM (GHSOM) address these limitations of the Som. The GHSOM is an artificial neural network model with hicrarchieal architecture composed of independent growing SOMs. One limitation of these neural networks is that they just take into account numerical data, even though symbolic data can be present in many real life problems. In this paper a new GHSOM model with a new metic incorporing both numerical and symbolic data is proposed. This new GHSOM model is propposed for detecting network intrusions. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors the IP packets flowing over the network to capture intrusions or anomalies. One of the techniques used for anomaly detection is building statical models using metrics derived from observation of the user's actions. Randomly selected subsets that contains both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark are used for training the proposed GHSOM. Experimental results are provided and compared to other hierarchieal neural networks.	[Palomo, E. J.; Dominguez, E.; Luque, R.

In this paper, and Intrusion Detection System based on a competitive learning neural network is presented. Most of the related works use the self-organizing map (SOM) to implement an IDS. However, the competitive neural network has less complexity and it is faster than the SOM, achieving similar results. In order to improve these results, we have used a repulsion method among neurons to avoid overlapping. Moreover, we have taken into account the presence of quantitative data in the input data, and they have been pre-processed appropriately to be supplied to the neural network. Therefore, the current metric based on Euclidean distance to compare two vectors can be used. The experimental results were obtained by applying the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark data set, which contains a great variety of simulated networks attacks. Comparison with other related works is provided.

Mining association rules in medical images is an important part in domain-specific application image mining because there are several technical aspects which make this problem challenging. In this paper, we firstly incorporate the domain knowledge into the ROI extraction algorithm and ROI clustering algorithm, then we extend the concept of association rule based on ROI and image in medical images, and propose two algorithms to discover frequent item-sets and mine interesting association rules from medical images. Some interesting results are obtained by our program and we believe many of the problems we come across are likely to appear in other domains.

For this reason, understanding web data is a decisive task to assure the success of a website. In that sense, data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to automatically discover the structure, contents and usage of a site. This research aims at proving the usefulness of a set of Information Visualisation techniques in order to analyse web data, using a Visual Web Mining tool that allows the combination, coordination and exploration of visualisations to get insight on web data.

HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among processors using a hash function, like the hash join in relational databases. HPA effectively utilizes the whole memory space of all the processors, hence it works well for large scale data mining in a parallel and distributed environment. The optimization technique of dynamic data allocation is discussed for the execution of this application. This technique is applied in a parallel and distributed environment. Writing parallel data mining algorithms in a distributed environment is a non-trivial task. The main purpose of the proposed method is to meet certain challenges associated with parallel and distributed data mining such as i) minimizing I/O ii) Increasing processing speed iii) Communication cost.

Currently, the strong focus of most DM-researchers is still only on technology-oriented topics. Commonly the DM research has several stakeholders, the major of which can be divided into internal and external ones each having their own point of view, and which are at least partly conflicting. The most important internal groups of stakeholders are the DM research community and academics in other disciplines. The most important external stakeholder groups are managers and domain experts who have their own utility-based interests to DM and DM research results. In this paper we discuss these practice-oriented points of view towards DM research and suggest broader discussions inside the DM research community about who should do that kind of research. We bring in the discussion several topics developed in the information systems (IS) discipline and show some similarities between IS and DM systems. DM systems have also their own peculiarities and we conclude that researchers who take into account human and organisational aspects related to DM systems need to have also some understanding about DM. This makes us suggest that the research area inside the DM community should be made broader than the current heavily technology-oriented one.

In recent years, the application of data mining techniques, such as classification and clustering, in financial risk detection has drawn interest from academic researchers and industry practitioners. The performance of classification methods varied with different datasets. No single method has been found to be superior over others for all datasets. The goal of this paper is to provide comparative analysis of the ability of a selection of popular classification methods to predict financial risk. The outcome of this study can help financial institutions select appropriate classifiers for their specific tasks.

The models, expressed as fuzzy rule bases, take a number of popular technical indicators on day t as inputs and produce a trading signal for day t + 1 based on a dataset of past observations of which actions would have been most profitable. The approach has been applied to trading several financial instruments (large-cap stocks and indices), in order to study the horizontal, i.e., cross-market, generalization capabilities of the models.

The proposed approach in this paper consists of three stages: (i) data preprocessing: noise or outlier is removed and the continuous attribute-valued features are transformed to discrete values, (ii) cluster analysis: k-means clustering is used to create load pattern classes and the representative load profiles for each class and (iii) classification: we evaluated several supervised learning methods in order to select a suitable prediction method. According to the proposed methodology, power load measured from AMR (automatic meter reading) system, as well as customer indexes, were used as inputs for clustering. The output of clustering was the classification of representative load profiles (or classes). In order to evaluate the result of forecasting load patterns, the several classification methods were applied on a set of high voltage customers of the Korea power system and derived class labels from clustering and other features are used as input to produce classifiers. Lastly, the result of our experiments was presented.

This paper compare several statistical methods with new method for feature ranking derived from data mining process. This method ranks features depending on percentage of child units that survived the selection process. A child unit is a processing element transforming the parent input features to the output. After training, units are interconnected in the feedforward hybrid neural network called GAME. The selection process is realized by means of niching genetic algorithm, where units connected to least significant features starve and fade from population. Parameters of new FR, algorithm are investigated and comparison among different methods is presented oil well known real world and artificial data sets.

Anomaly detection a roach is important in order to detect new attacks. Outlier detection scheme is one of the most successful anomaly detection approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel outlier detection scheme based on cost-distribution to detect anomaly behavior in network intrusion detection. We evaluate the capability of this new approach with the data set from KDD Cup 1999 data mining competition. The results indicate that the cost-distribution based scheme outperforms current outlier anomaly detection approaches in the capability to detect attacks and low false alarm rate.

We investigate effects of memory bandwidth and fluctuations of run times of loosely synchronized threads. We give results on message latency and bandwidth for two processor multicore systems based on AMD and Intel architectures with a total of four and eight cores. We compare our C# results with C using MPICH2 and Nemesis and Java with both mpiJava and MPJ Express.

The density-based method LOF is widely used in application. However, selecting MinPts is non-trivial, and LOF is very sensitive to its parameters MinPts. In this paper, we propose a new outlier detection method based on Voronoi diagram, which we called Voronoi based Outlier Detection (VOD). The proposed method measures the outlier factor automatically by Voronoi neighborhoods without parameter, which provides highly-accurate outlier detection and reduces the time complexity from O(n(2)) to O(nlogn).

Matrix factorisation techniques for endpoint detection in plasma etching	2008 IEEE/SEMI ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CONFERENCE	ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP - PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference	MAY 05-07, 2008	Cambridge, MA	IEEE, SEMI				Advanced data mining techniques such as variable selection through matrix factorization have been intensively applied in the last ten years in the area of plasma-etch point detection using optimal emission spectroscopy (OES). OES data sets are enormous, consisting of measurements of over 2000 wavelength recorded at sample rates of 1-3 Hertz, and consequently, these techniques are needed in order to generate compact representations of the relevant process characteristics. To date, the main technique employed in this regard has been PCA (Principal Components Analysis), a matrix factorisation technique which generates linear combinations of the original variables that best capture the information in the data (in terms of variance explained). Recently, an alternative matrix factorisation technique, Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) [1], has been gaining increasing attention in the fields of image feature extraction and blind source separation due to its tendency to yield sparse representations of data. The aim of this work is to introduce Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation to the semiconductor research community and to provide a comparison with PCA in order to highlight its properties.

An escalated approach to ant colony clustering algorithm for intrusion detection system	DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND NETWORKING, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking	JAN 05-08, 2008	Kolkata, INDIA			intrusion detection; data mining; multiple-level decision tree; ant colony clustering		Intrusion detection systems are increasingly a key part of systems defense. Various approaches to intrusion detection are currently being used, but they are relatively ineffective. Constructing and maintaining a misuse detection system is very labor-intensive since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized, and the corresponding rules and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded. Thus data mining can be used to case this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which rely on labeled training data and applies an Ant colony clustering algorithm for mixed data. The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously "unseen" attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. From this work, it is observed that significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate.	[Rajeswari, L.

This will increase the efficiency of electricity generation and distribution while maintaining sufficient security of operation. This paper proposes method for Short Term Load Forecasting using data mining technique. The data provided by utility of Malaysia were analyzed to see its behavior or load pattern in a day during weekday and weekend in Peninsular Malaysia. By considering day-type in a week, five model of SARIMA (Time Series approach) have been created using Minitab. The forecasting is held based on the similar repeating trend of patterns from historical load data. The half hourly load data for six weeks had been plotted according to day-type to forecast the load demand for a day ahead. The MAPEs (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) obtained were ranging from 1.07% to 3.26%. Hence this modeling had improved the accuracy of forecasting rather than using only one model for all day in a week.

In this paper, two extensions to recent angle based multi-dimensional scaling techniques are presented. The first approach concerns the preprocessing of the data with the objective to lower the error of the subsequent mapping. The second aims at improving differentiability of angle based mappings by augmenting the target space by one additional dimension. Experimental results demonstrate the gain of efficiency in terms of layout quality and computational complexity.								Chalmers M., 1996, Proceedings. Visualization '96 (IEEE Cat.

Identifying the recent knowledge can provide valuable information for the analysis of the data stream. In this paper, we proposed an one-pass data stream mining algorithm to mine the recent frequent itemsets in data streams with a sliding window basing on transactions. To reduce the cost of time and memory needed to slide the windows, each items is denoted a bit-sequence representations. Basing on Apriori property, this kind of representations can find frequent items in data streams efficiently. We named this method MRFI-SW (Mining Recent Frequent Itemsets by Sliding Window) algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm not only attains highly accurate mining result, but also consumes less memory than existing algorithms for mining frequent itemsets over recent data streams.

As a step in data mining, however, clustering encounters the problem of large amount of data to be processed. This article offers a solution for categorical clustering algorithms when working with high volumes of data by means of a method that summarizes the database. This is done using a structure called CM-tree. In order to test our method, the K-Modes and Click clustering algorithms were used with several databases. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed summarization method improves execution time, without losing clustering quality.

A review of current methodology at the strategic level of the KM/KDD domains indicates that there exists no general formal framework which can be adopted in new applications, or new application areas. There are no established procedures for the domain expert to express their prior knowledge, understanding and aims in a way which can be linked to KDD/DMM processes and subsequent deployment of discovered knowledge. It is suggested that the sequential life-cycle project-management approach of CRISP-DM needs to be complemented by a dynamic interactive view of a conceptual data/information/knowledge hierarchy in the KM context. It is also suggested that a graphical/visual knowledge representation framework needs to be developed as the basis of a knowledge and discovery and communication framework (KDCF). A review of the limitations in DM methodology at the technical/technological level leads to the conclusion that there is no coherent DM methodology to guide the choice of models and their evaluation, that the DM discipline is fractionated, and that the fundamental search and sampling paradigms have been insufficiently utilized in DM development. It is proposed that development of linked data and model ontologies, together with a DM-epistemology, and associated with full exploitation of search and sampling could lead to improved cohesion and efficacy of the DM discipline.

In this paper, we have combined the use of Self Organizing Maps with Gaussian Mixture Models, in order to enable situation awareness by detecting deviations from normal behavior in an unsupervised way. Initial results show that simple anomalies can be detected using this approach.

The objects included in the study are transgenic mice which suffer from cardiac arrhythmias and their wild-type siblings. For all these mice long-time ECG recordings are available. The RR interval length are utilised to deduce statistical features on short-time heartbeat. patterns. We demonstrate that these features are biologically relevant to classify the heartbeat patterns by a K-means clustering approach. Additionally, an extension of K-means is proposed, which consider user-defined constraints. The result of constraint-based clustering methods enable significant mid- and long-time analysis studies.

The only metric that had existed so far to determine the best algorithm for solving all ATSP instance is based on the number of cities: nevertheless, it is not sufficiently adequate for discriminating the best algorithm for solving an ATSP instance, thus the necessity for devising a flew metric through the use of data-mining techniques.

However, those databases are usually considered as a whole and hence, itemsets are extracted over the entire set of records. Our claim is that possible periods, hidden within the structure of the data and containing compact itemsets, may exist. These periods, as well as the itemsets they contain, might not be found by traditional data mining methods due to their very weak support. Furthermore, these periods might be lost depending on an arbitrary division of the data. The goal of our work is to find itemsets that are frequent over a specific period but would not be extracted by traditional methods since their support is very low over the whole dataset. In this paper we introduce the definition of solid itemsets, which represent a coherent and compact behavior over a specific period, and we propose SIM, an algorithm for their extraction. This work may find many applications in sensitive domains such as fraud or intrusion detection.

Since privacy-preserving data mining should be taken into consideration, several secure multi-party computation protocols have been presented based on this technique. Entropy and Gini Index are two protocols which compute Information-Gain at each step when producing a decision tree. The Gini Index, however, has been less studied in privacy-preserving data mining protocols. In this paper, we show how Gini can be used in privacy-preserving ID3 algorithms to create decision tree classifications in such a way that involved parties can jointly compute the gain value of each normal attribute without revealing their own private information to each other, while the database is horizontally partitioned over two or more parties. Three secure multiparty sub-protocols are presented to evaluate the intermediate computations. The communication overhead has been kept reasonably low to make the whole protocol efficient and practical.

In their preliminary form these data don't offer a performance knowledge discovery. Intelligent data mining framework applied over historical acquired data is used to extract hidden information directly from the SCADA system's database records. This paper presents a data mining and visualization experiment performed on a real data and results achieved in the experiment. The decision trees algorithm is used in order to find patterns in historical data and to establish a data mining flow.

During the life cycle of a bridge structure, the service conditions should be evaluated on a regular basis in order to assure the necessary levels of strength and durability. Taking into account (i) the social-economic importance of bridges' use, (ii) the necessary safety assurance and (iii) the high costs of any physical intervention, there is a need for continuous online bridge monitoring, for investment and use optimization. Recently, smart structures, which combine remote sensors (which send a stream of time series data) with intelligent information systems for real-time decision support through embedded Data Mining (DM) models, have been proposed to handle this task. Indeed, the application, of DM techniques to analyse civil engineering data has gained an increasing interest in recent years, due to intrinsic characteristics such as the ability to deal with nonlinear relationships. In this study, Artificial Neural Networks have been used to predict the following ratios: global efficiency, structural adequacy and safety, serviceability, essentiality for public use, and special reductions, using a ratio-based framework, and data collected during inspections of bridges in the north of Portugal. In particular, the global efficiency ratio is very useful to identify intervention priorities and to schedule the repair, strengthening and rehabilitation needs. The obtained results are encouraging and the most accurate model for global efficiency presents a low error (Root Mean Squared Error of 0.149). This approach opens room for the development of intelligent decision support systems for Bridge Management Systems. These systems are being recognized as a good way to systematize all the management process and to minimize the ratio cost/benefit during the bridge lifetime.	[Santos, M.

While data sampling has received the bulk of the attention from the research community, our results show that boosting often results in better classification performance than even the best data sampling techniques. In this work, we compare the performance of data sampling and boosting on ten datasets from various application domains using two commonly used learners. In addition, we propose the use of both data sampling and boosting in an attempt to combine the strengths of these techniques and achieve even better classification performance.

Statistical analysis of a term frequency captures the importance of the term within a document only. However, two terms can have the same frequency in their documents, but one term contributes more to the meaning of its sentences than the other term. Thus, the underlying model should indicate terms that capture the semantics of text, In this case the model can capture terms that, present the concepts of the sentence, which leads to discover the topic of the document. A new concept-based model that analyzes terms on the sentence and levels rather than the traditional analysis of document only is introduced. The concept-based model can effectively discriminate between non-important terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the concepts that represent the sentence meaning. A set of experiments, using the proposed concept-based model on different datasets in text categorization is conducted. The experiments demonstrate the comparison between traditional weighting and the concept-based weighting, enhances the quality of Categorization quality of sets of documents substantially.

Vapnik's Support Vector Machine, as well as various applications. However, using optimization techniques to deal with data separation and data analysis goes back to more than forty years ago. Since 1998, the authors and their colleagues extended such a research idea into classification via multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria quadratic programming (MQLP). The purpose of the paper is to share our research results and promote the research interests in the community of computational sciences. These methods are different from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. In this paper, starting from the basics of Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (MCLP), we further discuss penalized MCLP Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP), Multiple Criteria Fuzzy Linear Programming, Multi-Group Multiple Criteria Mathematical Programming, as well as regression method by Multiple Criteria Linear Programming. A brief summary of applications of Multiple Criteria Mathematical Programming is also provided.

It describes the use of business intelligence (BI) tools, coupled with data warehouse to employ data mining technology to provide accurate and up-to-date information for better inventory management decisions. The methodology is designed to provide out-of-stock forecasts at the store/product level. The first phase of the modelling process consists of clustering stores in the supply chain based upon aggregate sales patterns. After quality store-cluster models have been constructed, these clusters are used to more accurately make out-of-stock predictions at the store/product level using the decision trees and neural network mining algorithms. The methods for evaluation and accuracy measurement are described. Also, the specialized front-end BI web portal that offers integrated reporting, web analytics, personalization, customization and collaboration is described.

Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods need to scan the database many times. In this study, STMFP algorithm based on improved FP-tree is presented for sequential pattern mining. By improving the FP-tree structure, every node of the tree can store a set of items instead of one item. After scanning the sequential database once time, the tree can store all the sequences. In addition, a novel mining method, combining nodes from leaf to root which helps mining sequential patterns, is proposed. The cost of mining pattern sequence is divided into two parts. One is to construct STMFP Tree. The cost of this part associates with the size of sequential database. Another one is to find random assembled nodes from leaf to root in every path of STMFP tree. Because the maximal length of path is bounded by the maximal length of one transaction, and there are exiting common nodes which help reduce the number of leaf nodes, so the cost of this part must be much less than the size of the database. Compared with other methods which need to scan the sequential database many times, the cost Of our method must be less than two passes of the database. Through the whole mining process, it only needs scan the database once time.

In this paper, we leverage GPS data in a series of scenic photos and propose the personalized scenic itinerary recommendation system. Our system provides personalized suggestion of a sequence of following visiting spots when each user takes the photo of the current scenic spot. The recommendation is based on the data mining techniques to extract and differentiate the preferences of various users.

However, tensor data, i.e., multidimensional arrays, are actually natural representations of a large amount of real data, in data mining, computer vision, and many other applications. Aiming at breaking the huge gap between vectors and tensors in conventional statistical tasks, e.g., automatic model selection, this paper proposes a decoupled probabilistic algorithm, named Bayesian tensor analysis (BTA). BTA automatically selects a suitable model for tensor data, as demonstrated by empirical studies.

The distributed file system is the central component for storing data infrastructure. There have been many projects focused on network computing that have designed and implemented distributed file systems with a variety of architectures and functionalities. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy for describing distributed file system architectures and use this taxonomy to survey existing distributed file system implementations in very large-scale network computing systems such as Grids, Search Engines, etc. We use the taxonomy and the survey results to identify architectural approaches that have not been fully explored in the distributed file system research.

In this paper, we propose a C-Support Vector Classification Filter (C-SVCF) to identify and remove the misclassified instances (outliers) in breast cancer survivability samples collected from Srinagarind hospital in Thailand, to improve the accuracy of the prediction models, Only instances that are correctly classified by the filter are passed to the learning algorithm. Performance of the proposed technique is measured with accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), as well as compared with several popular ensemble filter approaches including AdaBoost, Bagging and ensemble of SVM with AdaBoost and Bagging filters. Our empirical results indicate that C-SVCF is an effective method for identifying misclassified outliers. This approach significantly benefits ongoing research of developing accurate and robust prediction models for breast cancer survivability.

These techniques aim at finding the illegal activities of professional identity fraudsters based on knowledge discovered from their own histories. We also raise some problems of applied data mining in crime control and criminal suppression. It is known that detecting crime from data analysis can be difficult because daily activities of criminal generate large amounts of data and stem from various formats. In addition, the quality of data analysis depends greatly on background knowledge of analyst. A criminal can range from civil infractions such as illegal driving to terrorism mass murder such as the 9/11 attacks, therefore it is difficult to model the perfect algorithm to cover all of them. Finally, this paper proposes a guideline to overcome the problem.

The need to develop a search engine based architectural model for people to search through the Web. Broad web search engines as well as many more specialized search tools rely on web crawlers to acquire large collections of pages for indexing and analysis. The crawler is an important module of a web search engine. The quality of a crawler directly affects the searching quality of such web search engines. Such a web crawler may interact with millions of hosts over a period of weeks or months, and thus issues of robustness, flexibility, and manageability are of major importance. Given some URLs, the crawler should retrieve the web pages of those URLs, parse the HTML files, add new URLs into its queue and go back to the first phase of this cycle. The crawler also can retrieve some other information from the HTML files as it is parsing them to get the new URLs. In this paper, we describe the design of a web crawler that uses PageRank algorithm for distributed searches and can be run on a network of workstations. The crawler scales to several hundred pages per second, is resilient against system crashes and other events, and can be adapted to various crawling applications. We present web mining architecture of the system and describe efficient techniques for achieving high performance.

One important issue in OTSNs is the energy saving strategy for object tracking and most existing solutions are based on statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a data mining-based approach for energy-efficient object tracking in OTSNs. First, a data mining methodology named RM-Mine is proposed for discovering the region-based movement patterns of moving objects in an OTSN. Moreover, we also propose the corresponding prediction strategies for tracking objects in energy-efficient way. Through empirical evaluations on various simulation conditions, RM-Mine and the proposed prediction strategies are shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of scalability, accuracy and energy efficiency.

Most of the prior research is usually focused on a specific domain such as movies or books, and recommendation alrogithms using similarities between users and/or similarities between products usually performs reasonably well. However, when the domain isn't as specific, recommendation becomes much more difficult, because the data could be too sparse to find similar users or similar products based on purchasing history alone. To solve this problem, we propose using social network data, along with rating history to enhance product recommendations. This paper exploits the state of art collaborative filtering algorithm and social net based recommendation algorithm for the task of open domain recommendation. We show that when a social network can be applied, it is a strong indicator of user preference for product recommendations. However, the high precision is achieved at the cost of recall. Although the sparseness of the data may suggest that the social network is not always applicable, we present a solution to utilize the network in those cases.

It is suggested to use means of rough sets theory and decision trees to generalize the information stored in real databases. Noise models are presented, and a noise effect on the operation of generalization algorithms using the methods of building decision trees is developed. The algorithm for unknown values reconstruction in learning samples subjected to the noise effect based on the nearest neighbour method is proposed. The results of program modeling are brought out.

Relational methodology for data mining and knowledge discovery	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; KDD; relational data mining; probabilistic reasoning; empirical theories; theories discovery; law-like rules; requirement of maximum specificity		Knowledge discovery and data mining methods have been successful in many domains. However, their abilities to build or discover a domain theory remain unclear. This is largely due to the fact that many fundamental KDD&DM methodological questions are still unexplored such as (1) the nature of the information contained in input data relative to the domain theory, and (2) the nature of the knowledge that these methods discover. The goal of this paper is to clarify methodological questions of KDD&DM methods. This is done by using the concept of Relational Data Mining (RDM), representative measurement theory, an ontology of a subject domain, a many-sorted empirical system (algebraic structure in the first-order logic), and an ontology of a KDD&DM method. The paper concludes with a review of our RDM approach and 'Discovery' system built on this methodology that can analyze any hypotheses represented in the first-order logic and use any input by representing it in many-sorted empirical system.

In this paper, a semi-supervised kernel-based fuzzy C-means algorithm called PCKFCM is proposed which incorporates both semi-supervised learning technique and the kernel method into traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm. The clustering is achieved by minimizing a carefully designed objective function. A kernel-based fuzzy term defined by the violation of constraints is included. The proposed PCKFCM is compared with other clustering techniques on benchmark and the experimental results convince that effective use of constraints improves the performance of kernel-based clustering. As for the effect of key parameter selection and the non-linear capability, it outperforms a similar semi-supervised fuzzy clustering approach Pairwise Constrained Competitive Agglomeration (PCCA).

The former refers to sanitizing the raw data itself before performing mining. The latter refers to preventing the mining output (model/pattern) from malicious pattern-based inference attacks. The preservation of input privacy does not necessarily lead to that of output privacy. This work studies the problem of protecting output privacy in the context of frequent pattern mining over data streams. After exposing the privacy breaches existing in current stream mining systems, we propose Butterfly, a light-weighted countermeasure that can effectively eliminate these breaches without explicitly detecting them, meanwhile minimizing the loss of the output accuracy. We further optimize the basic scheme by taking account of two types of semantic constraints, aiming at maximally preserving utility-related semantics while maintaining the hard privacy and accuracy guarantee. We conduct extensive experiments over real-life datasets to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Our contribution is a novel algorithm based on a deferred data structure. Despite its simplicity, our approach is up to 4 times faster and uses about half the memory compared to the best-known algorithm of Fischer et al. Applications in various string domains, e.g. natural language, DNA or protein sequences, demonstrate the improvement of our algorithm.

The ACGT GridR service is extended by a component that uses a set of preprocessor-like directives to organize and distribute calculations. The use of parallelization directives as special R comments provides users with the potential to accelerate lengthy calculations with changes to preexisting code. The GridR service and its extension are developed as components of the ACGT platform, one aim of which is to facilitate the data mining of clinical trials involving large datasets. In A CGT, GridR scripts are executed in the framework of a specifically developed workflow environment, which is also briefly outlined in the present article.

In this paper the potential of parametric images from FDG-PET studies to aid the classification of dementia using data mining techniques was investigated. Scalar, joint, histogram and voxel-level features were used in the investigation with principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The logistic regression model and the additive logistic regression model were applied in the classification. The results show that cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption (CMRGlc) was efficient in the classification of dementia and data mining using voxel-level features with PCA and the logistic regression model method achieving the best classification.

For example, the identification of models describing the nitric oxides (NO(x)) emissions of diesel engines has been investigated intensively, very promising results were obtained using GP. In the standard GP process, all model structures (as well as parameter settings) of models are created during an evolutionary process; populations of models' are evolved using the genetic operators crossover, mutation and selection.

Most available systems for fingerprint identification use the minutiae matching for identification. The performance of minutiae extraction algorithms relies heavily on the quality of the fingerprint image because the minutiae-based approach is very sensitive to noise or image-quality degradation. Poor-quality images result in spurious and missing features which degrades the performance of the identification system. So if the quality of the image can be examined first, the image with very poor quality can be rejected. The useful information can be combined into the procedure of post-processing and matching scheme to improve the identification process. Therefore it is desirable to design a classification scheme which is able to examine the quality of a fingerprint image before it is processed by the fingerprint identification systems. Decision-tree is one of the well-known data mining methods that are used in classification problems because of its fast and effective features. In this paper a new classifier based on decision tree theory for classification of fingerprint image quality is proposed. This new classifier has many advantages in solving the fingerprint quality classification problem. It can generate the rules with almost all of the original information from the classifier even after all of the original fingerprint images are lost. It means it will be not necessary to save all the original fingerprint images because the classifier can combine the rules with the new coming data to build a more precise classifier with more information to classify the fingerprint image quality. And the new classifier can give weight to different fingerprint images if they come from the sensors with different importance. The advantages of the new classifier make the fingerprint image classification system very powerful and feasible. The proposed method has a very good performance which is proved by the experiments.

The main problem is that from non-sensitive data, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information, fact or even patterns that-are not supposed to be disclosed. In order to focusing on privacy preserving association rule mining, the simplistic solution to address the problem of privacy is presented The solution is to implement a filter after the mining phase to weed out or hide the restricted discovered association rules. Before implementing the algorithms, the data structure Of database and sensitive association rule mining set have been analyzed to build the more effective model. This new algorithm can be used to balance privacy preserving and knowledge discovery in association rule mining.

Dengue virus is transmitted to humans mainly by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. It has been observed that there are significantly more Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes present in tropical areas than in other climate areas. As such, it is commonly believed that the tropical climate suits the life-cycle of the mosquito. Thus, studying the correlation between the climatic factors and trend of dengue cases is helpful in conceptualising a more effective pre-emptive control measure towards dengue outbreak. In this paper, we proposed to use Wavelet transformation for data pre-processing before employing a Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based Genetic Algorithm to select the most important features. After which, regression based on SVM is used to perform forecasting of the model. The analytical result drawn from this model based on dengue data in Singapore shows improvement in prediction performance of dengue cases ahead. This can help the health control agency to improve its strategic planning for disease control to combat dengue outbreak. The experimental result arising from this model also suggests strong correlation between the monsoon seasonality and dengue virus transmission. It also confirms with previous work that mean temperature and monthly seasonality have minimal contribution to the outbreak.

ESnap[16] improved the performance, resource consumption and reliability compared with traditional LVM snapshot implementation. But it still has some problems: (i) high memory consumptions caused by snapshot metadata, (ii) not support writable snapshot. A novel optimization of Esnap called ESnapII, which alleviates all the above four difficulties is proposed in this paper. In detail, a global metadata cache shared by all snapshots belongs to the same VG is proposed to reduce the memory consumption; Future more, a writing mechanism is presented for both dependent and independent snapshot. Experiment results show that ESnapII has higher performance and lower resource utilization rate than previous work..

However, while most researches in CRM mainly focus on data mining, relatively few research papers on detailed architectures for analytical CRM systems have been published. In this paper, a practical process driven architecture of building analytical CRM systems is proposed. This architecture is based on the typical CRM analysis process and integrates with multilevel secure (MLS) data model to ensure the efficiency and timeliness of provision of right information to the right users. Furthermore, through a case study of a real-world analytical CRM implementation project in the bank industry, an analytical CRM solution using the proposed architecture has been developed and received approvable ratings from our client, which demonstrates the feasibility of this architecture.

In this paper, based on the recent literature on Dirichlet processes, we have developed two different and specific models as solutions to this problem: DPChain and HDP-EVO. Both models substantially advance the literature on evolutionary clustering in the sense that not only the), both perform better than the existing literature, but more importantly they are capable of automatically learning the cluster numbers and structures during the evolution.

By the definition and application of secure multiparty computation protocols based on semi-honest model, we realized the preserving of the privacy information. We utilized data mining algorithm based on privacy-preserving spatial local outlier factor (PPSLOF) to solve the mining of the spatial outlier, and used the resident linear list in memory and improved R*-tree index to decrease the communication amount, reduce the number of the input/output (I/O), and improve the retrieval velocity, so the algorithm efficiency is improved The theory analysis shows that privacy preserving spatial outlier mining algorithm can efficiently preserve the privacy data, and efficiently mine spatial outliers.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of enabling multiple parties to perform model selection on their distributed data in a privacy-preserving fashion without revealing their data to each other. We specifically study cross validation, a standard method of model selection, in the setting in which two parties hold a vertically partitioned database. For a specific kind of vertical partitioning, we show how the participants can carry out privacy-preserving cross validation in order to select among a number of candidate models without revealing their data to each other.

The objective is to alleviate the shortcomings of the existing techniques for data mining by taking advantage of nonlinear filtering to handle non-Gaussian and non-stationary multiplicative noise and uncertainties. New concepts have been developed toward characterization of the data features and behavior interpretation of the underlying processes to evaluate their performance. In particular, the techniques of wavelet transform, Hilbert-Huang transform, and symbolic encoding are investigated to explore their effectiveness and relative simplicity to interpret and implement data mining tasks.

Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples that need to be analyzed is constantly increasing on a daily basis. An automatic and robust tool to analyze and classify the file samples is the need of the hour. In this paper, resting on the analysis of Windows API execution sequences called by PE files, we use associative classification and post-processing techniques for malware detection. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our malware detection method outperform popular anti-virus scanners such as Norton AntiVirus and Dr. Web, as well as previous data mining based detection systems which employed Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree techniques. In particular, the post-processing techniques we adopt can greatly reduce the number of generated rules which make it easy for the human analysts to identify the useful ones.

Today, there exist many clustering techniques. The most important characteristic of a clustering technique is the shape of the cluster it can find. In this paper, we propose a method that is capable to find arbitrary shaped clusters and uses simple geometric constructs, Circlusters. Circlusters are different radius sectored circles. Circlusters can be used to create many hybrid approaches in mixture with density based or partitioning based methods. We also proposed two new clustering methods that are capable to find complex clusters in O(n), where n is the size of the data set. Both of the methods are two phase. In the first phase, circlusters are mined to approximate the shape of the data set. In the second phase, connected circlusters are found to mine the final clusters using different approaches.

In this paper, we propose a novel molecular fragment mining approach that incorporates interactive user assistance to speed up and increase the success rates in traditional fragment mining processes. The proposed approach visualizes 3D molecular data in 2D form that can be easily interpreted by a human expert who evaluates and filters the 2D molecular images manually. The proposed approach differs from others in literature as it does not search substructures including specific atoms like graph mining methods do. Instead, user assisted approach highlights significant substructures with specific properties and topologies graphically. Initial experiments indicate that by the use of user assisted approach, active and inactive fragments of compounds are quickly determined for drug design with high success rates.

Multisensory information is processed, fused, fed and mapped to a 2-D cortex in a near-optimal information preserving manner. Data projection and visualization, inspired by this mechanism, are playing an increasingly important role in many computational applications such as cluster analysis, classification, data mining, knowledge management and retrieval, decision support, marketing, image processing and analysis. Such tasks involving either visual and spatial analysis or reduction of features or volume of the data are essential in many fields from biology, neuroscience, decision support, to management science. The topic has recently attracted a great deal of attention. There have been considerable advances in methodology and techniques for extracting nonlinear manifold as to reduce data dimensionality and a number of novel methods have been proposed from statistics, geometry theory and adaptive neural networks. Typical approaches include multidimensional scaling, nonlinear PCA and principal curve/surface. This paper provides an overview on this challenging and emerging topic. It discusses various recent methods such as self-organizing maps, kernel PCA, principal manifold, isomap, local linear embedding, Laplacian eigenmap and spectral clustering, and many of them can be seen as a combined, adaptive learning framework.

One of the most important challenges for data mining is quickly and correctly finding the relationship between data. The Apriori algorithm is the most popular technique in association rules mining; however, when applying this method, a database has to be scanned many times and many candidate itemsets are generated. Parallel computing is an effective strategy for accelerating the mining process. In this paper, the Weighted Distributed Parallel Apriori algorithm (WDPA) is presented as a solution to this problem. In the proposed method, metadata are stored in TID forms, thus only a single scan to the database is needed. The TID counts are also taken into consideration, and therefore better load-balancing as well as reducing idle time for processors can be achieved According to the experimental results, WDPA outperforms other algorithms while having lower minimum support.

We present a case study comparing three such methods on the same data set, logged by Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor from usage by 174 children in grades 2-4 (typically 710 years) over the course of the 2005-2006 school year. The Reading Tutor chooses randomly between two different types of reading practice. In assisted oral reading, the child reads aloud and the tutor helps. In "Word Swap," the tutor reads aloud and the child identifies misread words. One method we use here to evaluate reading practice is conventional analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where the outcome is performance on the same words when encountered again later. The second method is learning decomposition, which estimates the impact of each practice type as a parameter in an exponential learning curve. The third method is knowledge tracing, which estimates the impact of practice as a probability in a dynamic Bayes net. The comparison shows qualitative agreement among the three methods, which is evidence for their validity.

In this paper, we propose an advanced Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) with GA mutation for SCOC In the process of doing so, we first use HPSO to get obstructed distance, and. then we developed a novel HPKSCOC based on HPSO and K-Medoids to cluster spatial data with obstacles constraints. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, which performs better than Improved K-Medoids SCOC (IKSCOC) in terms of quantization error and has higher constringency speed than Genetic K-Medoids SCOC (GKSCOC).

In this paper, we propose an advanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) method for SCOC. In the process of doing so, we first developed a novel spatial obstructed distance using PSO-DV(Particle Swarm Optimization with Differentially perturbed Velocity) based on grid model to obtain obstructed distance, which is named PDGSOD, and then we presented a new PDKSCOC based on PSO-DV and K-Medoids to cluster spatial data with obstacles constraints. The experimental results show that PDGSOD is effective, and PDKSCOC can not only give attention to higher local constringency speed and stronger global optimum search, but also get down to the obstacles constraints and practicalities of spatial clustering; and it performs better than Improved K-Medoids SCOC (IKSCOC) in terms of quantization error and has higher constringency speed than Genetic K-Medoids SCOC (GKSCOC).

Without presetting a default threshold, the OMA algorithm achieves its efficiency and threshold-flexibility by calculating item-sets' counts. It is unnecessary and independent of the default threshold and can flexibly adapt to any user's input threshold. In addition, we propose Cluster-Based Association Rule Algorithm (CARA) creates cluster tables to aid discovery of large item sets. It only requires a single scan of the database, followed by contrasts with the partial cluster tables. It not only prunes considerable amounts of data reducing the time needed to perform data scans and requiring less contrast, but also ensures the correctness of the mined results. By using the CARA algorithm to create cluster tables in advance, each CPU can be utilized to process a cluster table; thus large item sets can be immediately mined even when the database is very large.

This new model consists of two components, namely, topic filtering and pattern taxonomy mining. The aim of using topic filtering is to quickly filter out irrelevant information based on the user profiles. The aim of applying pattern taxonomy mining techniques is to rationalize the data relevance on the reduced data set. Our experiments on Reuters RCV1(Reuters Corpus Volume 1) data collection show that more effective and efficient information access has been achieved by combining the strength of information filtering and data mining method.

However, current data mining metadata lacks precise semantic due to their description with natural language and graphs, so the automatic consistency checking upon them has not been resolved well. In this paper, a formal logic DLRDM in the description logic family is proposed. Subsequently, a formal reasoning method based on DLRDM is designed to automatically check the consistency of data mining metadata. With the description logic DLRDM, formalization upon the metamodel and metadata of data mining is analyzed in detail. The reasoning engine Racer is applied into the method to check the consistency upon the data mining metadata. Results on the RacerPro reasoning system indicate the method is encouraging.

They contain a great deal of incomplete, imprecise, and unqualified information. These issues result in unacceptable Web source quality. Evaluating and selecting high quality Web source/information is a key for the success of Web-based applications. In this paper, Web quality is modeled by using a Web quality model, WebQM. Fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) is applied to evaluate and screen Web sources for advanced Web applications, such as data warehousing, OLAP, and data mining. In addition, an expert-average group evaluation strategy is combined with FTOPSIS to obtain more objective and more precise results. To illustrate our evaluation process, an example is discussed.

With the emergence of time series data mining, traditional snapshot-based privacy issues need to be extended to be multi-dimensional with the addition of time dimension. We find current techniques to preserve privacy in data mining are not effective in preserving time-domain privacy. We present data flow separation attack on privacy in time series data mining, which is based on blind source separation techniques from statistical signal processing. Our experiments with real data show that this attack is effective. By combining the data flow separation method and the frequency matching method, an attacker can identify data sources and compromise time-domain privacy. We propose possible countermeasures to the data flow separation attack in the paper.

The basic function of LooM quantitatively evaluates the anonymity level of a person who discloses his/her data, and controls the personal-data disclosure according to the level. LooM uses a normalized entropy value for quantifying the anonymity. In this version of the LooM, the disclosure control is accomplished by adding two new functions. One is an abstracting-function that generates abstractions (or summaries) from the raw personal data to reduce the danger that the malicious third party might identify the person who discloses his/her personal data to the party. The other function is a unique-value-masking function that hides the unique personal data in the database. These functions enhance the disclosure control mechanism of LooM. We evaluate the functions using simulation data and questionnaire data. Then, we confirm the effectiveness of the functions. Finally, we show a prototype of a crime-information-sharing service to confirm the feasibility of these functions.

Decision support for university enrollment management: Implementation and experience	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision support system; enrollment management; data mining; organizational learning	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; YIELD MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM SUCCESS; EXPERT-SYSTEMS; ADMISSIONS; SCIENCE; IMPACT	Enrollment management is a process critical to many universities that rely on tuition for a significant portion of their operating budgets. This study describes how the development and implementation of a system to support decisions in the enrollment process allowed for increased responsiveness and real-time management as well as substantially increased institutional knowledge of the process itself. This, in turn, led to dramatic improvements in both operational performance and in the attainment of strategic admission objectives. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Graphical I-DDQ signatures reduce defect level and yield loss	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS			English	Article						I-DDQ testing; current noise; current signatures; data mining; pattern recognition		We propose a new I-DDQ testing signature, the graphical I-DDQ signature. We discovered that noise, in the entire set of current measurements for a chip, is a vastly superior feature for classifying chips as good or bad, compared to present methods. The measured I-DDQ current as a function of vectors is defined here as the signature. We examine the shape of the waveform defined by the total set of the I-DDQ measurements, to extract the number of bands that all of the current measurements cluster into, the width and separation of the bands and current glitches or noise among all I-DDQ measurements. We examined the I-DDQ signatures of all SEMATECH experiment chips that were classified as good or bad by a combination of functional, delay, and scan voltage tests. A single I-DDQ threshold, whether absolute or differential, cannot separate good/bad chips reliably. Good chip signatures contain discrete levels (or bands) of varying widths and separations. A faulty chip almost always displays noise and glitches in the band structure. The graphical I-DDQ classifier shows very high accuracy for SEMATECH test data with a test escape rate of 5.97%, compared with 7.5% for the single threshold method, 7.6% for current differences and 7.5 % for the Delta I-DDQ method. The graphical I-DDQ method had a 1.2% test overkill, compared with 2.3% for the single threshold method, 6.1 % for current differences and 7.0% for Delta I-DDQ.

Toward exploratory test-instance-centered diagnosis in high-dimensional classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						classification; visual data mining; interactive exploration	DECISION TREES; CONSTRUCTION	High-dimensional data is a difficult case for most subspace-based classification methods because of the large number of combinations of dimensions, which have discriminatory power. This is because there are an exponential number of combinations of dimensions that could decide the correct class instance, and this combination could vary with data locality and test instance. Therefore, most summarized models such as decision trees and rule-based systems only aim to have a global summary of the data, which is used for classification. Because of this incompleteness, a particular classification model may be more or less suited to individual test instances. Furthermore, it may not provide sufficient insight into the most representative characteristics of a particular test instance. This is undesirable for many classification applications in which the diagnostic reasoning behind the classification of a test instance is as important as the classification process itself. In an interactive application, a user may find it more valuable to develop a diagnostic decision support method, which can reveal significant classification behaviors of exemplar records. Such an approach has the additional advantage of being able to optimize the decision process for the individual record in order to design more effective classification methods. In this paper, we propose the Subspace Decision Path (SD-Path) method, which provides the user with the ability to interactively explore a small number of nodes of a hierarchical decision process so that the most significant classification characteristics for a given test instance are revealed. In addition, the SD-Path method can provide enormous interpretability by constructing views of the data in which the different classes are clearly separated out. Even in difficult cases where the classification behavior of the test instance is ambiguous, the SD-Path method provides a diagnostic understanding of the characteristics, which results in this ambiguity. Therefore, this method combines the abilities of the human and the computer in creating an effective diagnostic tool for instance-centered high-dimensional classification.

J	Huang, CM; Hong, TP; Horng, SJ				Huang, Cheng-Ming; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Horng, Shi-Jinn			Mining knowledge from object-oriented instances	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						association rule; data mining; object transaction; object-oriented mining		Data mining is the process of extracting desirable knowledge or interesting patterns from existing databases for specific purposes. Recently, the object concept has been very popular and used in a variety of applications, especially for complex data description. This paper thus proposes a new data-mining algorithm for extracting interesting knowledge from transactions stored as object data. Each item itself is thought of as a class, and each item purchased in a transaction is thought of as an instance. Instances with the same class (item name) may have different attribute values since they may appear in different transactions. The proposed algorithm is divided into two main phases, one for intra-object association rules, and the other for inter-object association rules. Two apriori-like procedures are adopted to find the two kinds of rules. The first phase finds out the association relation within the same kind of objects. Each large item-set found in this phase can be thought of as a composite item used in phase 2. The second phase then finds the relationship among different kinds of objects. Both the intra-object and inter-object association rules can thus be easily derived by the proposed algorithm at the same time. Experiments are also made to show the effect of the proposed algorithm.

An information-theoretic approach to inference attacks on random data perturbation and a related privacy measure	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						data mining; data perturbation; information-theoretic security; noisy channel; privacy; statistical database security	SECURITY	Random data perturbation (RDP) has been in use for several years in statistical databases and public surveys as a means of providing privacy to individuals while collecting information on groups, and has recently gained popularity as a privacy technique in data mining. This correspondence provides an information-theoretic framework for all inference attacks on RDP. The framework is used to demonstrate the existence of a tight asymptotic lower bound on the number of queries required per bit of entropy for all inference attacks with zero asymptotic error and bounded average power in the query sequence. A privacy measure based on security against inference attacks is proposed.

J	Li, YC; Yeh, JS; Chang, CC				Li, Yu-Chiang; Yeh, Jieh-Shan; Chang, Chin-Chen			MICF: An effective sanitization algorithm for hiding sensitive patterns on data mining	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						data mining; association rule; privacy-preserving; sensitive rule hiding	ASSOCIATION RULES	Data mining mechanisms have widely been applied in various businesses and manufacturing companies across many industry sectors. Sharing data or sharing mined rules has become a trend among business partnerships, as it is perceived to be a mutually benefit way of increasing productivity for all parties involved. Nevertheless, this has also increased the risk of unexpected information leaks when releasing data. To conceal restrictive itemsets (patterns) contained in the source database, a sanitization process transforms the source database into a released database that the counterpart cannot extract sensitive rules from. The transformed result also conceals non-restrictive information as an unwanted event, called a side effect or the "misses cost". The problem of finding an optimal sanitization method, which conceals all restrictive itemsets but minimizes the misses cost, is NP-hard. To address this challenging problem, this study proposes the maximum item conflict first (MICF) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, has a low sanitization rate, and can generally achieve a significantly lower misses cost than those achieved by the MinFIA, MaxFIA, IGA and Algo2b methods in several real and artificial datasets.

J	Zhang, XH; Chou, PL; Dong, GH				Zhang, Xiuzhen; Chou, Pauline Lienhua; Dong, Guozhu			Efficient computation of iceberg cubes by bounding aggregate functions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; data cube; pruning; data warehouses		The iceberg cubing problem is to compute the multidimensional group-by partitions that satisfy given aggregation constraints. Pruning unproductive computation for iceberg cubing when nonantimonotone constraints are present is a great challenge because the aggregate functions do not increase or decrease monotonically along the subset relationship between partitions. In this paper, we propose a novel bound prune cubing (BP-Cubing) approach for iceberg cubing with nonantimonotone aggregation constraints. Given a cube over n dimensions, an aggregate for any group-by partition can be computed from aggregates for the most specific n-dimensional partitions (MSPs). The largest and smallest aggregate values computed this way become the bounds for all partitions in the cube. We provide efficient methods to compute tight bounds for base aggregate functions and, more interestingly, arithmetic expressions thereof, from bounds of aggregates over the MSPs. Our methods produce tighter bounds than those obtained by previous approaches. We present iceberg cubing algorithms that combine bounding with efficient aggregation strategies. Our experiments on real-world and artificial benchmark data sets demonstrate that BP-Cubing algorithms achieve more effective pruning and are several times faster than state-of-the-art iceberg cubing algorithms and that BP-Cubing achieves the best performance with the top-down cubing approach.

As these systems start to incorporate hundreds, even thousands, of sensors, managing and presenting the information from these sensors is becoming an increasingly difficult task. This paper explores the use of conversation exchange dynamics (CED) to integrate and display sensor information from multiple nodes. We present an experimental setup consisting of multiple sensors reporting individual findings to a central server for aggregated analysis. Different scenarios of network attacks and intrusions were planned to investigate the effectiveness of the distributed system. The network attacks were taken from the M.I.T. Lincoln Lab 1999 Data Sets. The distributed system was subjected to different combinations of network attacks in various parts of the network. The results were then analyzed to understand the behavior of the distributed system in response to the different attacks. In general, the distributed system detected all attacks under each scenario. Some surprising observations also indicated attack responses occurring in unanticipated scenarios. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This algorithm partitions the data sets into several clusters and at the same time fits a multivariate regression model to each cluster. This framework allows one to incorporate both multivariate regression models for numerical variables (supervised learning methods) and k-mode clustering algorithms for categorical variables (unsupervised learning methods). The estimates of regression models and k-mode parameters can be obtained simultaneously by minimizing a function which is the weighted SLIM of the least-square errors in the multivariate regression models and the dissimilarity measures among the categorical variables. Both synthetic and real data sets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamic range-based distance measure for microarray expressions and a fast gene-ordering algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						bioinformatics; clustering; combinatorial optimization; data mining; dynamic range; evolutionary algorithm; gene expression; ordering; self-organizing map (SOM); soft computing	PATTERNS	This investigation deals with a new distance measure for genes using their microarray expressions and a new algorithm for fast gene ordering without clustering. This distance measure is called "Maxrange distance," where the distance between two genes corresponding to a particular type of experiment is computed using a normalization factor, which is dependent on the dynamic range of the gene expression values of that experiment. The new gene-ordering method called "Minimal Neighbor" is based on the concept of nearest neighbor heuristic involving O(n(2)) time complexity. The superiority of this distance measure and the comparability of the ordering algorithm have been extensively established on widely studied microarray data sets by performing statistical tests. An interesting application of this ordering algorithm is also demonstrated for finding useful groups of genes within clusters obtained from a nonhierarchical clustering method like the self-organizing map.

It presents the dataset in network diagram with representative events and their relationships. The data analyst reads its relationships, and supposes scenarios from them. This is conceptually very simple process, but it becomes more difficult when the diagram becomes complex. In this paper, to overcome this difficulty, we develop the pre-process to generate simple network KeyGraph and the scenario supposing process which repeats our pre-process, generation of KeyGraph and supposing scenarios.

Exploiting idle cycles to execute data mining applications on clusters of PCs	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Software Components at Work held in Conjunction with International Conference on Software Engineering	MAY, 2005	St Louis, MO			parallel and distributed data mining; commodity clusters; load sharing		In this paper we present and evaluate Inhambu, a distributed object-oriented system that supports the execution of data mining applications on clusters of PCs and workstations. This system provides a resource management layer, built on the top of Java/RMI, that supports the execution of the data mining tool called Weka. We evaluate the performance of Inhambu by means of several experiments in homogeneous, heterogeneous and non-dedicated clusters. The obtained results are compared with those achieved by a similar system named Weka-Parallel. Inhambu outperforms its counterpart for coarse grain applications, mainly for heterogeneous and non-dedicated clusters. Also, our system provides additional advantages such as application checkpointing, support for dynamic aggregation of hosts to the cluster, automatic restarting of failed tasks, and a more effective usage of the cluster. Therefore, Inhambu is a promising tool for efficiently executing real-world data mining applications.

J	Chuang, KT; Lin, KP; Chen, MS				Chuang, Kun-Ta; Lin, Keng-Pei; Chen, Ming-Syan			Quality-aware sampling and its applications in incremental data mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						sequential sampling; incremental data mining		We explore in this paper a novel sampling algorithm, referred to as algorithm PAS (standing for Proportion Approximation Sampling), to generate a high-quality online sample with the desired sample rate. The sampling quality refers to the consistency between the population proportion and the sample proportion of each categorical value in the database. Note that the state-of-the-art sampling algorithm to preserve the sampling quality has to examine the population proportion of each categorical value in a pilot sample a priori and is thus not applicable to incremental mining applications. To remedy this, algorithm PAS adaptively determines the inclusion probability of each incoming tuple in such a way that the sampling quality can be sequentially preserved while also guaranteeing the sample rate close to the user specified one. Importantly, PAS not only guarantees the proportion consistency of each categorical value but also excellently preserves the proportion consistency of multivariate statistics, which will be significantly beneficial to various data mining applications. For better execution efficiency, we further devise an algorithm, called algorithm EQAS (standing for Efficient Quality-Aware Sampling), which integrates PAS and random sampling to provide the flexibility of striking a compromise between the sampling quality and the sampling efficiency. As validated in experimental results on real and synthetic data, algorithm PAS can stably provide high-quality samples with corresponding computational overhead, whereas algorithm EQAS can flexibly generate samples with the desired balance between sampling quality and sampling efficiency. In addition, while applying the sample generated by algorithms PAS and EQAS to incremental mining applications, a significant efficiency improvement can be obtained without compromising the resulting precision, showing the prominent advantage of both proposed algorithms to be the quality-aware sampling means for incremental mining applications.
