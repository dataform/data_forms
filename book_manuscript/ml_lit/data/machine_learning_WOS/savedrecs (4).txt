In this work, we present an intelligent machine vision system able to learn autonomously individual objects present in real environment. This system relies on salient object detection. In its design, we were inspired by early processing stages of human visual system. In this context we suggest a novel fast algorithm for visually salient object detection, robust to real-world illumination conditions. Then we use it to extract salient objects which can be efficiently used for training the machine learning-based object detection and recognition unit of the proposed system. We provide results of our salient object detection algorithm on MSRA Salient Object Database benchmark comparing its quality with other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed system has been implemented on a humanoid robot, increasing its autonomy in learning and interaction with humans. We report and discuss the obtained results, validating the proposed concepts.

Antiprotozoan lead discovery by aligning dry and wet screening: Prediction, synthesis, and biological assay of novel quinoxalinones	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						In silico study; TOMOCOMD-CARDD software; Non-stochastic and stochastic linear indices; Classification model; Machine learning-based QSAR; Antiprotozoan database; In vitro assay; Antimalarial; Antitrypanosomal; Antitoxoplasma; Antitrichomonas; Leishmanicide; Cytotoxicity	NONSTOCHASTIC QUADRATIC FINGERPRINTS; ATOM ADJACENCY MATRIX; IN-SILICO DISCOVERY; ANTIMALARIAL COMPOUNDS; ANTITRYPANOSOMAL COMPOUNDS; CYTOSTATIC ACTIVITY; TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; LINEAR INDEXES; QSAR MODELS	Protozoan parasites have been one of the most significant public health problems for centuries and several human infections caused by them have massive global impact. Most of the current drugs used to treat these illnesses have been used for decades and have many limitations such as the emergence of drug resistance, severe side-effects, low-to-medium drug efficacy, administration routes, cost, etc. These drugs have been largely neglected as models for drug development because they are majorly used in countries with limited resources and as a consequence with scarce marketing possibilities. Nowadays, there is a pressing need to identify and develop new drug-based antiprotozoan therapies. In an effort to overcome this problem, the main purpose of this study is to develop a QSARs-based ensemble classifier for antiprotozoan drug-like entities from a heterogeneous compounds collection. Here, we use some of the TOMO-COMD-CARDD molecular descriptors and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to derive individual linear classification functions in order to discriminate between antiprotozoan and non-antiprotozoan compounds as a way to enable the computational screening of virtual combinatorial datasets and/or drugs already approved. Firstly, we construct a wide-spectrum benchmark database comprising of 680 organic chemicals with great structural variability (254 of them antiprotozoan agents and 426 to drugs having other clinical uses). This series of compounds was processed by a k-means cluster analysis in order to design training and predicting sets. In total, seven discriminant functions were obtained, by using the whole set of atom-based linear indices. All the LDA-based QSAR models show accuracies above 85% in the training set and values of Matthews correlation coefficients (C) vary from 0.70 to 0.86. The external validation set shows rather-good global classifications of around 80% (92.05% for best equation). Later, we developed a multi-agent QSAR classification system, in which the individual QSAR outputs are the inputs of the aforementioned fusion approach. Finally, the fusion model was used for the identification of a novel generation of lead-like antiprotozoan compounds by using ligand-based virtual screening of 'available' small molecules (with synthetic feasibility) in our 'in-house' library. A new molecular subsystem (quinoxalinones) was then theoretically selected as a promising lead series, and its derivatives subsequently synthesized, structurally characterized, and experimentally assayed by using in vitro screening that took into consideration a battery of five parasite-based assays. The chemicals 11(12) and 16 are the most active (hits) against apicomplexa (sporozoa) and mastigophora (flagellata) subphylum parasites, respectively. Both compounds depicted good activity in every protozoan in vitro panel and they did not show unspecific cytotoxicity on the host cells. The described technical framework seems to be a promising QSAR-classifier tool for the molecular discovery and development of novel classes of broad-antiprotozoan-spectrum drugs, which may meet the dual challenges posed by drug-resistant parasites and the rapid progression of protozoan illnesses.

This trend continues to rise in recent years, as evidenced by the increasing number of published papers in this topic and several published survey papers addressing different aspects of research issues. Essentially, these survey articles were mainly from cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging perspectives, although computational challenges were briefly discussed. To complement existing survey articles, this paper focuses on the survey of the variety of image analysis methodologies, such as neuroimage registration, fMRI signal analysis, ROI (regions of interest) selection, machine learning algorithms, reproducibility analysis, structural and functional connectivity, and natural image analysis, which were employed in previous brain encoding/decoding research works. This paper also provides discussions of potential limitations of those image analysis methodologies and possible future improvements. It is hoped that extensive discussions of image analysis issues could contribute to the advancements of the increasingly important brain encoding/decoding field.

To avoid subjectivity in diagnosis, we propose an ontology driven decision support method which is an automated procedure for diagnosing MCI through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this approach, we encode specialized MRI knowledge into an ontology and construct a rule set using machine learning algorithms. Then we apply these two parts in conjunction with reasoning engine to automatically distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). The rule set is trained by MRI data of 187 MCI patients and 177 normal controls selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using C4.5 algorithm. By using a 10-fold cross validation, we prove that the performance of C4.5 with 80.2% sensitivity is better than other algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian network (BN) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, and C4.5 is suitable for the construction of reasoning rules. Meanwhile, the evaluation results suggest that our approach would be useful to assist physicians efficiently in real clinical diagnosis for the disease of MCI. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The proposed scheme consists of two stages: the preprocessor and the predictor. In the preprocessor stage, the mega-trend diffusion (MTD) technique is employed to increase the samples of the minority class, thereby balancing the dataset. In the predictor stage, machine-learning approaches of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are used to develop hybrid MTD-SVM and MTD-KNN prediction models. MTD-SVM model has provided the best values of accuracy, G-mean and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 96.71%, 96.70% and 71.98% for cancer/non-cancer dataset, breast/non-breast cancer dataset and colon/non-colon cancer dataset, respectively. We found that hybrid MTD-SVM is the best with respect to prediction performance and computational cost. MTD-KNN model has achieved moderately better prediction as compared to hybrid MTD-NB (Naive Bayes) but at the expense of higher computing cost. MTD-KNN model is faster than MTD-RF (random forest) but its prediction is not better than MTD-RF. To the best of our knowledge, the reported results are the best results, so far, for these datasets. The proposed scheme indicates that the developed models can be used as a tool for the prediction of cancer. This scheme may be useful for study of any sequential information such as protein sequence or any nucleic acid sequence. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

People with PD's (PWP) may have difficulty in walking, talking or completing other simple tasks. Variety of medications is available to treat PD. Recently, researchers have found that voice signals recorded from the PWP is becoming a useful tool to differentiate them from healthy controls. Several dysphonia features, feature reduction/selection techniques and classification algorithms were proposed by researchers in the literature to detect PD. In this paper, hybrid intelligent system is proposed which includes feature pre-processing using Model-based clustering (Gaussian mixture model), feature reduction/selection using principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), sequential forward selection (SFS) and sequential backward selection (SBS), and classification using three supervised classifiers such as least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and general regression neural network (GRNN). PD dataset was used from University of California-Irvine (UCI) machine learning database. The strength of the proposed method has been evaluated through several performance measures. The experimental results show that the combination of feature pre-processing, feature reduction/selection methods and classification gives a maximum classification accuracy of 100% for the Parkinson's dataset.

J	Pei, DL; Li, ZG; Ji, RR; Sun, FC				Pei, Deli; Li, Zhenguo; Ji, Rongrong; Sun, Fuchun			Efficient semantic image segmentation with multi-class ranking prior	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						Computer vision; Machine learning; Semantic segmentation; Structural SVMs	SHIFT	Semantic image segmentation is of fundamental importance in a wide variety of computer vision tasks, such as scene understanding, robot navigation and image retrieval, which aims to simultaneously decompose an image into semantically consistent regions. Most of existing works addressed it as structured prediction problem by combining contextual information with low-level cues based on conditional random fields (CRFs), which are often learned by heuristic search based on maximum likelihood estimation. In this paper, we use maximum margin based structural support vector machine (S-SVM) model to combine multiple levels of cues to attenuate the ambiguity of appearance similarity and propose a novel multi-class ranking based global constraint to confine the object classes to be considered when labeling regions within an image. Compared with existing global cues, our method is more balanced between expressive power for heterogeneous regions and the efficiency of searching exponential space of possible label combinations. We then introduce inter-class co-occurrence statistics as pairwise constraints and combine them with the prediction from local and global cues based on S-SVMs framework. This enables the joint inference of labeling within an image for better consistency. We evaluate our algorithm on two challenging datasets which are widely used for semantic segmentation evaluation: MSRC-21 dataset and Stanford Background dataset and experimental results show that we obtain high competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, despite that our model is much simpler and efficient.

We give a formulation of a random walk in a directed hypergraph that serves as a basis to a semi-supervised image segmentation procedure that is configured as a machine learning problem, where a few sample pixels are used to estimate the labels of the unlabeled ones. A directed hypergraph model is proposed to represent the image content, and the directed random walk formulation allows to compute a transition matrix that can be exploited in a simple iterative semi-supervised segmentation process. Experiments over the Microsoft GrabCut dataset have achieved results that demonstrated the relevance of introducing directionality in hypergraphs for computer vision problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In adjunction to primary imaging of such vascular plaques using coronary angiography or alternatively magnetic resonance imaging, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is used predominantly for diagnosis and reporting of their vulnerability. In addition to plaque burden estimation, necrosis detection is an important aspect in reporting of IVUS. Since necrotic regions generally appear as hypoechic, with speckle appearance in these regions resembling true shadows or severe signal dropout regions, it contributes to variability in diagnosis. This dilemma in clinical assessment of necrosis imaged with IVUS is addressed in this work. In our approach, fidelity of the backscattered ultrasonic signal received by the imaging transducer is initially estimated. This is followed by identification of true necrosis using statistical physics of ultrasonic backscattering. A random forest machine learning framework is used for the purpose of learning the parameter space defining ultrasonic backscattering distributions related to necrotic regions and discriminating it from non-necrotic shadows. Evidence of hunting down true necrosis in shadows of intravascular ultrasound is presented with ex vivo experiments along with cross-validation using ground truth obtained from histology. Nevertheless, in some rare cases necrosis is marginally overestimated, primarily on account of non-reliable statistics estimation. This limitation is due to sparse spatial sampling between neighboring scan-lines at location far from the transducer. We suggest considering the geometrical location of detected necrosis together with estimated signal confidence during clinical decision making in view of such limitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytoplankton biodiversity was expressed as richness, evenness and dominance indices and abiotic parameters included temperature, salinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphates. Prediction was based on three machine learning techniques: model trees, multilayer perceptron and instance based learning. To optimize diversity prediction, indices were calculated on a large number of phytoplankton field assemblages, but also on corresponding noise-free simulated assemblages. Biodiversity was most accurately predicted by the instance based learning algorithm and the efficiency was doubled with simulated assemblages. Based on the optimal algorithm, indices, and dataset, a software package was developed for phytoplankton diversity prediction for Eastern Mediterranean waters. The proposed methodology can be adapted to any group of organisms in marine and terrestrial ecosystems whereas important applications are the integration of community structure in ecological models and in assessments of global change scenarios.

When multiple objectives are involved in decision making or machine learning, a crucial step is to determine the weights of individual objectives to the system-level performance. Determining the weights of multiobjectives is an evaluation process, and it has been often treated as an optimization problem. However, our preliminary investigation has shown that existing methodologies in dealing with the weights of multiobjectives have some obvious limitations in the sense that the determination of weights is tackled as a single optimization problem, a result based on such an optimization is incomprehensive, and it can even be unreliable when the information about multiple objectives is incomplete such as an incompleteness caused by poor data. The constraints of weights are also discussed. Variable weights are natural in decision-making processes. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a systematic methodology in determining variable weights of multiobjectives. The roles of weights in an original multiobjective decision-making or machine-learning problem are analyzed, and the weights are determined with the aid of a modular neural network. The inconsistency issue of weights is particularly discussed.

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.

J	Meng, HY; Bianchi-Berthouze, N				Meng, Hongying; Bianchi-Berthouze, Nadia			Affective State Level Recognition in Naturalistic Facial and Vocal Expressions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Affective computing; continuous emotion recognition; dimensional model of affect; HMM; machine learning; naturalistic affective expressions	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; AUTOMATIC-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; EXPERIENCE; SEQUENCES; SPEECH; AUDIO; PAIN; FACE	Naturalistic affective expressions change at a rate much slower than the typical rate at which video or audio is recorded. This increases the probability that consecutive recorded instants of expressions represent the same affective content. In this paper, we exploit such a relationship to improve the recognition performance of continuous naturalistic affective expressions. Using datasets of naturalistic affective expressions (AVEC 2011 audio and video dataset, PAINFUL video dataset) continuously labeled over time and over different dimensions, we analyze the transitions between levels of those dimensions (e.g., transitions in pain intensity level). We use an information theory approach to show that the transitions occur very slowly and hence suggest modeling them as first-order Markov models. The dimension levels are considered to be the hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Their discrete transition and emission matrices are trained by using the labels provided with the training set. The recognition problem is converted into a best path-finding problem to obtain the best hidden states sequence in HMMs. This is a key difference from previous use of HMMs as classifiers. Modeling of the transitions between dimension levels is integrated in a multistage approach, where the first level performs a mapping between the affective expression features and a soft decision value (e.g., an affective dimension level), and further classification stages are modeled as HMMs that refine that mapping by taking into account the temporal relationships between the output decision labels. The experimental results for each of the unimodal datasets show overall performance to be significantly above that of a standard classification system that does not take into account temporal relationships. In particular, the results on the AVEC 2011 audio dataset outperform all other systems presented at the international competition.

Traditional sampling approaches generally rely on random resampling from a given dataset. However, these approaches do not take into consideration additional information, such as sample quality and usefulness. We recently proposed a data sampling technique, called sample subset optimization (SSO). The SSO technique relies on a cross-validation procedure for identifying and selecting the most useful samples as subsets. In this paper, we describe the application of SSO techniques to imbalanced and ensemble learning problems, respectively. For imbalanced learning, the SSO technique is employed as an under-sampling technique for identifying a subset of highly discriminative samples in the majority class. In ensemble learning, the SSO technique is utilized as a generic ensemble technique where multiple optimized subsets of samples from each class are selected for building an ensemble classifier. We demonstrate the utilities and advantages of the proposed techniques on a variety of bioinformatics applications where class imbalance, small sample size, and noisy data are prevalent.

MLF uses basic concepts of the fuzzy min-max (FMM) method in a multi-level structure to classify patterns. This method uses separate classifiers with smaller hyperboxes in different levels to classify the samples that are located in overlapping regions. The final output of the network is formed by combining the outputs of these classifiers. MLF is capable of learning nonlinear boundaries with a single pass through the data. According to the obtained results, the MLF method, compared to the other FMM networks, has the highest performance and the lowest sensitivity to maximum size of the hyperbox parameter (theta), with a training accuracy of 100% in most cases.

ALP casts the identification of the Pareto front into a supervised machine learning task. This approach enables an analytical model of the Pareto front to be built. The computational effort in generating the supervised information is reduced by an active learning strategy. In particular, the model is learned from a set of informative training objective vectors. The training objective vectors are approximated Pareto-optimal vectors obtained by solving different scalarized problem instances. The experimental results show that ALP achieves an accurate Pareto front approximation with a lower computational effort than state-of-the-art estimation of distribution algorithms and widely known genetic techniques.

Such a scheme has two major challenges: 1) how to retrieve the similar facial images that truly match the query, and 2) how to exploit the noisy labels of the top similar facial images, which may be incorrect or incomplete due to the nature of web images. In this paper, we propose an effective Weak Label Regularized Local Coordinate Coding (WLRLCC) technique, which exploits the principle of local coordinate coding by learning sparse features, and employs the idea of graph-based weak label regularization to enhance the weak labels of the similar facial images. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the WLRLCC problem. Moreover, an effective sparse reconstruction scheme is developed to perform the face annotation task. We conduct extensive empirical studies on several web facial image databases to evaluate the proposed WLRLCC algorithm from different aspects. The experimental results validate its efficacy. We share the two constructed databases "WDB" (714,454 images of 6,025 people) and "ADB" (126,070 images of 1,200 people) with the public. To further improve the efficiency and scalability, we also propose an offline approximation scheme (AWLRLCC) which generally maintains comparable results but significantly reduces the annotation time.

Methods and Materials: We investigated a support vector machine (SVM) for predicting TCP in a cohort of 399 patients treated at 13 German and Austrian institutions. Among 7 potential input features for the SVM we selected those most important on the basis of forward feature selection, thereby evaluating classifier performance by using 10-fold cross-validation and computing the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The final SVM classifier was built by repeating the feature selection 10 times with different splitting of the data for cross-validation and finally choosing only those features that were selected at least 5 out of 10 times. It was compared with a multivariate logistic model that was built by forward feature selection. Results: Local failure occurred in 12% of patients. Biologically effective dose (BED) at the isocenter (BEDISO) was the strongest predictor of TCP in the logistic model and also the most frequently selected input feature for the SVM. A bivariate logistic function of BEDISO and the pulmonary function indicator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) yielded the best description of the data but resulted in a significantly smaller AUC than the final SVM classifier with the input features BEDISO, age, baseline Karnofsky index, and FEV1 (0.696 +/- 0.040 vs 0.789 +/- 0.001, P < .03). The final SVM resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 67.0% +/- 0.5% and 78.7% +/- 0.3%, respectively. Conclusions: These results confirm that machine learning techniques like SVMs can be successfully applied to predict treatment outcome after SBRT. Improvements over traditional TCP modeling are expected through a nonlinear combination of multiple features, eventually helping in the task of personalized treatment planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Recognizing human movement activity types is extremely useful for fall detection for elderly people. Wireless sensor network technology enables human motion data from wearable wireless sensor devices be transmitted for remote processing. This paper studies methods to process the human motion data received from wearable wireless sensor devices for detecting different types of human movement activities such as sitting, standing, lying, fall, running, and walking. Machine learning methods K Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm are used to classify the activities from the data acquired from sensors based on sample data. As there are a large amount of real-time raw data received from sensors and there are noises associated with these data, feature construction and reduction are used to preprocess these raw sensor data obtained from accelerometers embedded in wireless sensing motes for learning and processing. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is used for constructing the enriched features. The enriched features are then integrated with machine learning algorithms for movement detection. The testing data are collected from five adults. Experimental results show that our methods can achieve promising performance on human movement recognition and fall detection.

J	Florez-Lopez, R; Ramon-Jeronimo, JM				Florez-Lopez, Raquel; Manuel Ramon-Jeronimo, Juan			Modelling credit risk with scarce default data: on the suitability of cooperative bootstrapped strategies for small low-default portfolios	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						risk; credit scoring; small data sets; cooperative models; class imbalance; specification error	CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS; DATA SETS; CLASSIFIERS	Credit risk models are commonly based on large internal data sets to produce reliable estimates of the probability of default (PD) that should be validated with time. However, in the real world, a substantial portion of the exposures is included in low-default portfolios (LDPs) in which the number of defaulted loans is usually much lower than the number of non-default observations. Modelling of these imbalanced data sets is particularly problematic with small portfolios in which the absence of information increases the specification error. Sovereigns, banks, or specialised retail exposures are recent examples of post-crisis portfolios with insufficient data for PD estimates, which require specific tools for risk quantification and validation. This paper explores the suitability of cooperative strategies for managing such scarce LDPs. In addition to the use of statistical and machine-learning classifiers, this paper explores the suitability of cooperative models and bootstrapping strategies for default prediction and multi-grade PD setting using two real-world credit consumer data sets. The performance is assessed in terms of out-of-sample and out-of-time discriminatory power, PD calibration, and stability. The results indicate that combinational approaches based on correlation-adjusted strategies are promising techniques for managing sparse LDPs and providing accurate and well-calibrated credit risk estimates.

However, it also provides a suitable space for malicious activities, so security is crucial in this virtual environment. The network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is a popular tool to counter attacks against computer networks. This valuable tool can be realized using machine learning methods and intrusion datasets. Traditional datasets are usually packet-based in which all network packets are analyzed for intrusion detection in a time-consuming process. On the other hand, the recent spread of 1-10-Gbps-technologies have clearly pointed out that scalability is a growing problem. In this way, flow-based solutions can help to solve the problem by reduction of data and processing time, opening the way to high-speed detection on large infrastructures. Besides, NIDS should be capable of detecting new malicious activities. Artificial neural network-based NIDSs can detect unseen attacks, so a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural classifier is used in this study to distinguish benign and malicious traffic in a flow-based NIDS. In this way, a modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA), as a modern heuristic technique, is employed to optimize the interconnection weights of the neural anomaly detector. The proposed scheme is trained using an enhanced version of the first labeled flow-based dataset for intrusion detection introduced in 2009. In addition, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and traditional error back-propagation (EBP) algorithm are employed to train MLP, so performance comparison becomes possible. The experimental results based on the actual network data show that the MGSA-optimized neural anomaly detector is effective for monitoring abnormal traffic flows in the gigabytes traffic environment, and the accuracy is about 97.8 %.

Less attention is paid to classifying the rich. The Center for Global Development created the Commitment to Development Index in 2003, which ranks countries according to their contribution to the reduction of poverty in developing countries. Since its first report, "Ranking the rich, the Index has been quite successful. However, it has also been subject to multiple criticisms. This paper proposes the use of an ordinal classification to rate, not rank, the performance of rich countries. An ordinal classification, where an ordinal scale labels the examples, can help discovering the level of each country's commitment to development, automatically and independently from others' performances. It could stimulate both advocacy from civil society and the determination of more coherent public policies in rich countries for poorer ones.The methodology used is Artificial Neural Networks, a common machine learning tool for successfully solving classification problems. Experiments yield robust results, showing better outcomes than other alternative ordinal classifiers, opening the possibility of developing a classification technique which could overcome the limitations of the current ranking technique.

However, use of large number of features in training data can affect the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. The objective of this paper is to represent a novel feature elimination (FE) based ensembles learning method which is an extension to an existing machine learning environment. Here the standard 12 lead ECG signal recordings data have been used in order to diagnose arrhythmia by classifying it into normal and abnormal subjects. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it reduces the size of feature space by way of using various feature elimination methods. The decisions obtained from these methods have been coalesced to form a fused data. Thus the idea behind this work is to discover a reduced feature space so that a classifier built using this tiny data set would perform no worse than a classifier built from the original data set. Random subspace based ensembles classifier is used with PART tree as base classifier. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated on the UCI ECG signal data. Here, the classification performance has been evaluated using measures such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, relative absolute error, F-measure, classification accuracy, receiver operating characteristics and area under curve. In this way, the proposed novel approach has provided an attractive performance in terms of overall classification accuracy of 91.11 % on unseen test data set. From this work, it is shown that this approach performs well on the ensembles size of 15 and 20.

The ability to predict the chances of crystallization from the amino-acid sequence of the protein can, at least partly, address this problem by allowing a crystallographer to select homologs that are more likely to succeed and/or to modify the sequence of the target to avoid features that are detrimental to successful crystallization. In 2007, the now widely used XtalPred algorithm [Slabinski et al. (2007), Protein Sci. 16, 2472-2482] was developed. XtalPred classifies proteins into five 'crystallization classes' based on a simple statistical analysis of the physicochemical features of a protein. Here, towards the same goal, advanced machine-learning methods are applied and, in addition, the predictive potential of additional protein features such as predicted surface ruggedness, hydrophobicity, side-chain entropy of surface residues and amino-acid composition of the predicted protein surface are tested. The new XtalPred-RF (random forest) achieves significant improvement of the prediction of crystallization success over the original XtalPred. To illustrate this, XtalPred-RF was tested by revisiting target selection from 271 Pfam families targeted by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG) in PSI-2, and it was estimated that the number of targets entered into the protein-production and crystallization pipeline could have been reduced by 30% without lowering the number of families for which the first structures were solved. The prediction improvement depends on the subset of targets used as a testing set and reaches 100% (i.e. twofold) for the top class of predicted targets.

The new methodology, which is computationally less costly because a smaller number of binary classification problems have to be resolved, was validated using UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets. Results point to the improved performance of the proposed model compared to approaches based on the one-versus-one and directed acyclic graph techniques.

We show that this leads naturally to a recursive definition of hyper-heuristics and to a division of responsibility that is suggestive of a blackboard architecture, in which individual heuristics annotate a shared workspace with information that may also be exploited by other heuristics. Such a framework invites consideration of the kind of relaxations of the domain barrier that can be achieved without loss of generality. We give a concrete example of this architecture with an application to the 3-SAT domain that significantly improves on a related token-ring hyper-heuristic.

PITA is a PLP algorithm for computing the probability of queries, which exploits tabling, answer subsumption and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). PITA does not impose any restriction on the programs. Other algorithms, such as PRISM, reduce computation time by imposing restrictions on the program, namely that subgoals are independent and that clause bodies are mutually exclusive. Another assumption that simplifies inference is that clause bodies are independent. In this paper, we present the algorithms PITA(IND,IND) and PITA(OPT). PITA(IND,IND) assumes that subgoals and clause bodies are independent. PITA(OPT) instead first checks whether these assumptions hold for subprograms and subgoals: if they do, PITA(OPT) uses a simplified calculation, otherwise it resorts to BDDs. Experiments on a number of benchmark datasets show that PITA(IND,IND) is the fastest on datasets respecting the assumptions, while PITA(OPT) is a good option when nothing is known about a dataset.

At the same time, most of the recent pattern recognition problems involve highly complex datasets with a large number of possible explanatory variables. For many reasons, this abundance of variables significantly harms classification or recognition tasks. There are efficiency issues, too, because the speed of many classification algorithms is largely improved when the complexity of the data is reduced. One of the approaches to address problems that have too many features or instances is feature or instance selection, respectively. Although most methods address instance and feature selection separately, both problems are interwoven, and benefits are expected from facing these two tasks jointly. This paper proposes a new memetic algorithm for dealing with many instances and many features simultaneously by performing joint instance and feature selection. The proposed method performs four different local search procedures with the aim of obtaining the most relevant subsets of instances and features to perform an accurate classification. A new fitness function is also proposed that enforces instance selection but avoids putting too much pressure on removing features. We prove experimentally that this fitness function improves the results in terms of testing error. Regarding the scalability of the method, an extension of the stratification approach is developed for simultaneous instance and feature selection. This extension allows the application of the proposed algorithm to large datasets. An extensive comparison using 55 medium to large datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository shows the usefulness of our method. Additionally, the method is applied to 30 large problems, with very good results. The accuracy of the method for class-imbalanced problems in a set of 40 datasets is shown. The usefulness of the method is also tested using decision trees and support vector machines as classification methods.

Are you bleeding? Validation of a machine-learning algorithm for determination of blood volume status: application to remote triage	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						triage algorithm; lower body negative pressure; exercise; central hypovolemia	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; COMBAT CASUALTY CARE; TRAUMA PATIENTS; CENTRAL HYPOVOLEMIA; STROKE VOLUME; HEMORRHAGE; MORTALITY; PRESSURE; DEATH; HEMODYNAMICS	Due to limited remote triage monitoring capabilities, combat medics cannot currently distinguish bleeding soldiers from those engaged in combat unless they have physical access to them. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-level physiological signals can be used to develop a machine-learning algorithm for tracking changes in central blood volume that will subsequently distinguish central hypovolemia from physical activity. Twenty-four subjects underwent central hypovolemia via lower body negative pressure (LBNP), and a supine-cycle exercise protocol. Exercise workloads were determined by matching heart rate responses from each LBNP level. Heart rate and stroke volume (SV) were measured via Finometer. ECG, heat flux, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and two-axis acceleration were obtained from an armband (SenseWear Pro2) and used to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict changes in SV as an index of central blood volume under both conditions. The algorithm SV was retrospectively compared against Finometer SV. A model was developed to determine whether unknown data points could be correctly classified into these two conditions using leave-one-out cross-validation. Algorithm vs. Finometer SV values were strongly correlated for LBNP in individual subjects (mean r = 0.92; range 0.75-0.98), but only moderately correlated for exercise (mean r = 0.50; range -0.23-0.87). From the first level of LBNP/exercise, the machine-learning algorithm was able to distinguish between LBNP and exercise with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all >= 90%). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm developed from low-level physiological signals could reliably distinguish central hypovolemia from exercise, indicating that this device could provide battlefield remote triage capabilities.

J	Berk, R; Bleich, J				Berk, Richard; Bleich, Justin			Forecasts of Violence to Inform Sentencing Decisions	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article						Sentencing; Forecasting; Machine learning; Classification trees	MULTIPLE-MODELS APPROACH; RISK-ASSESSMENT; TREES	Recent legislation in Pennsylvania mandates that forecasts of "future dangerousness" be provided to judges when sentences are given. Similar requirements already exist in other jurisdictions. Research has shown that machine learning can lead to usefully accurate forecasts of criminal behavior in such setting. But there are settings in which there is insufficient IT infrastructure to support machine learning. The intent of this paper is provide a prototype procedure for making forecasts of future dangerousness that could be used to inform sentencing decisions when machine learning is not practical. We consider how classification trees can be improved so that they may provide an acceptable second choice. We apply an version of classifications trees available in R, with some technical enhancements to improve tree stability. Our approach is illustrated with real data that could be used to inform sentencing decisions. Modest sized trees grown from large samples can forecast well and in a stable fashion, especially if the small fraction of indecisive classifications are found and accounted for in a systematic manner. But machine learning is still to be preferred when practical. Our enhanced version of classifications trees may well provide a viable alternative to machine learning when machine learning is beyond local IT capabilities.

A review of approaches to identifying patient phenotype cohorts using electronic health records	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Review						Review; Electronic Health Records; Cohort Identification; Phenotyping	X-RAY REPORTS; MEDICAL-RECORDS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; HEART-FAILURE; DECISION-MAKING; CANCER-RISK; EHR DATA; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Objective To summarize literature describing approaches aimed at automatically identifying patients with a common phenotype. Materials and methods We performed a review of studies describing systems or reporting techniques developed for identifying cohorts of patients with specific phenotypes. Every full text article published in (1) Journal of American Medical Informatics Association, (2) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, (3) Proceedings of the Annual American Medical Informatics Association Symposium, and (4) Proceedings of Clinical Research Informatics Conference within the past 3years was assessed for inclusion in the review. Only articles using automated techniques were included. Results Ninety-seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Forty-six used natural language processing (NLP)-based techniques, 24 described rule-based systems, 41 used statistical analyses, data mining, or machine learning techniques, while 22 described hybrid systems. Nine articles described the architecture of large-scale systems developed for determining cohort eligibility of patients. Discussion We observe that there is a rise in the number of studies associated with cohort identification using electronic medical records. Statistical analyses or machine learning, followed by NLP techniques, are gaining popularity over the years in comparison with rule-based systems. Conclusions There are a variety of approaches for classifying patients into a particular phenotype. Different techniques and data sources are used, and good performance is reported on datasets at respective institutions. However, no system makes comprehensive use of electronic medical records addressing all of their known weaknesses.

We focus on automated ICD9 code assignment from discharge summary content and methods for evaluating such assignments. Methods We study ICD9 diagnosis codes and discharge summaries from the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) repository. We experiment with two coding approaches: one that treats each ICD9 code independently of each other (flat classifier), and one that leverages the hierarchical nature of ICD9 codes into its modeling (hierarchy-based classifier). We propose novel evaluation metrics, which reflect the distances among gold-standard and predicted codes and their locations in the ICD9 tree. Experimental setup, code for modeling, and evaluation scripts are made available to the research community. Results The hierarchy-based classifier outperforms the flat classifier with F-measures of 39.5% and 27.6%, respectively, when trained on 20533 documents and tested on 2282 documents. While recall is improved at the expense of precision, our novel evaluation metrics show a more refined assessment: for instance, the hierarchy-based classifier identifies the correct sub-tree of gold-standard codes more often than the flat classifier. Error analysis reveals that gold-standard codes are not perfect, and as such the recall and precision are likely underestimated. Conclusions Hierarchy-based classification yields better ICD9 coding than flat classification for MIMIC patients. Automated ICD9 coding is an example of a task for which data and tools can be shared and for which the research community can work together to build on shared models and advance the state of the art.

Materials and methods Electronic health records of 741 adult patients at the University of California Davis Health System who met at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were used to associate patients' vital signs, white blood cell count (WBC), with sepsis occurrence and mortality. Generative and discriminative classification (naive Bayes, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models) were used to integrate heterogeneous patient data and form a predictive tool for the inference of lactate level and mortality risk. Results An accuracy of 0.99 and discriminability of 1.00 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for lactate level prediction was obtained when the vital signs and WBC measurements were analysed in a 24h time bin. An accuracy of 0.73 and discriminability of 0.73 AUC for mortality prediction in patients with sepsis was achieved with only three features: median of lactate levels, mean arterial pressure, and median absolute deviation of the respiratory rate. Discussion This study introduces a new scheme for the prediction of lactate levels and mortality risk from patient vital signs and WBC. Accurate prediction of both these variables can drive the appropriate response by clinical staff and thus may have important implications for patient health and treatment outcome. Conclusions Effective predictions of lactate levels and mortality risk can be provided with a few clinical variables when the temporal aspect and variability of patient data are considered.

Design The data used in this study are from 299 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit in the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt and evaluated for late-onset sepsis. Gold standard diagnostic labels (sepsis negative, culture positive sepsis, culture negative/clinical sepsis) were assigned based on all the laboratory, clinical and microbiology data available in EMR. Only data that were available up to 12h after phlebotomy for blood culture testing were used to build predictive models using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Measurement We compared sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sepsis treatment of physicians with the predictions of models generated by ML algorithms. Results The treatment sensitivity of all the nine ML algorithms and specificity of eight out of the nine ML algorithms tested exceeded that of the physician when culture-negative sepsis was included. When culture-negative sepsis was excluded both sensitivity and specificity exceeded that of the physician for all the ML algorithms. The top three predictive variables were the hematocrit or packed cell volume, chorioamnionitis and respiratory rate. Conclusions Predictive models developed from off-the-shelf and EMR data using ML algorithms exceeded the treatment sensitivity and treatment specificity of clinicians. A prospective study is warranted to assess the clinical utility of the ML algorithms in improving the accuracy of antibiotic use in the management of neonatal sepsis.

SOMz: photometric redshift PDFs with self-organizing maps and random atlas	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; surveys; galaxies: distances and redshifts; galaxies: statistics	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; RANDOM FORESTS; LEGACY SURVEY; CLASSIFICATION; GALAXIES; CONSTRAINTS; TELESCOPE; TREES; SDSS	In this paper, we explore the applicability of the unsupervised machine learning technique of self-organizing maps (SOM) to estimate galaxy photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). This technique takes a spectroscopic training set, and maps the photometric attributes, but not the redshifts, to a two-dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space. The key feature of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set, revealing correlations between the attributes that are not easily identified. We test three different 2D topological mapping: rectangular, hexagonal and spherical, by using data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey. We also explore different implementations and boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas, where a large number of different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust photometric redshift PDF. We also introduced a new metric, the I-score, which efficiently incorporates different metrics, making it easier to compare different results (from different parameters or different photometric redshift codes). We find that by using a spherical topology mapping we obtain a better representation of the underlying multidimensional topology, which provides more accurate results that are comparable to other, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our results illustrate that unsupervised approaches have great potential for many astronomical problems, and in particular for the computation of photometric redshifts.

Prediction of individual season of birth using MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Support vector machine; Seasonal biology; Neural development; IXI database; Pattern recognition; Grey matter morphology	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MORNINGNESS-EVENINGNESS PREFERENCE; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; RECEPTOR GENE; HUMAN ADULTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ABNORMALITIES	Previous research suggests statistical associations between season of birth (SOB) with prevalence of neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, personality traits such as novelty and sensation seeking, and suicidal behavior. These effects are thought to be mediated by seasonal differences in perinatal photoperiod, which was recently shown to imprint circadian clock neurons and behavior in rodents. However, it is unknown whether SOB is associated with any measurable differences in the normal human adult brain, and whether individual SOB can be deduced based on phenotype. Here I show that SOB predicts morphological differences in brain structure, and that MRI scans carry spatially distributed information allowing significantly above chance prediction of an individual's SOB. Using an open source database of over 550 structural brain scans, Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis showed a significant SOB effect in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) in males (p = 0.009, FWE whole-brain corrected), with greater gray matter volumes in fall and winter births. A cosinor analysis revealed a significant annual periodicity in the left STG gray matter volume (Zero Amplitude Test: p < 5 x 10(-7)), with a peak towards the end of December and a nadir towards the end of June, suggesting that perinatal photoperiod accounts for this SOB effect. Whole-brain VBM maps were used as input features to multivariate machine-learning based analyses to classify SOB. Significantly greater than chance prediction was achieved in females (overall accuracy 35%, p < 0.001), but not in males (overall accuracy 26%, p = 0.45). Pairwise binary classification in females revealed that the highest discrimination was obtained for winter vs. summer classification (peak area under the ROC curve = 0.71, p < 0.0005). Discriminating regions included fusiform and middle temporal gyms, inferior and superior parietal lobe, cerebellum, and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Results indicate that SOB is detectable with MRI, imply that SOB exerts effects on the developing human brain that persist through adulthood, and suggest that neuroimaging may be a valuable intermediate phenotype in bridging the gap between SOB and personality and neurobehavioral disorders.

This principle, termed as the anatomical distance function (ADF), refers to the presence of an inverse relationship between anatomical distance and connectivity. A crucial developmental feature that occurs in normal adolescence is the weakening of ADF, which is characterized by a selective strengthening of long-distance connections. Schizophrenia is associated with widespread dysconnectivity that is linked to aberrant cortical development. Methods: We studied the ADF in adults with schizophrenia (n 28), their age-matched siblings (n 28), and healthy controls (n 60). We investigated the proportional abnormalities in the long-range connections involving interhemispheric, subcortical, frontal, and salience network regions and localized the connections showing most significant changes in schizophrenia. The groups were discriminated on the basis of short- and long-range connectivity using a machine-learning algorithm. Results: Both patients and their siblings showed abnormally pronounced ADF. This was associated with a disproportionate reduction in the number of long-range connections, affecting the subcortical, interhemispheric, and the salience network connections. The abnormalities in long-range connections had superior ability to accurately identify group membership. Conclusions: A crucial organizing principle of the brain architecture that becomes apparent during normal adolescence is disturbed in schizophrenia. While siblings show some evidence of compensating for this deficit, patients lack putative compensatory changes. Age-related shift in ADF provides an explanatory framework for the developmental emergence of widespread dysconnectivity that is influenced by genetic risk in schizophrenia.

Assessment of railway vibrations using an efficient scoping model	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						High speed rail vibration; Environmental impact assessment; ScopeRail; High speed train; ABAQUS; Initial vibration assessment; High-speed ground transportation; Railway track dynamics; Scoping assessment; Free field	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ELASTIC-WAVES; SOIL; PREDICTION; TRENCHES	Vibration assessments are required for new railroad lines to determine the effect of vibrations on local communities. Low accuracy assessments can significantly increase future project costs in the form of further detailed assessment or unexpected vibration abatement measures. This paper presents a new, high accuracy, initial assessment prediction tool for high speed lines. A key advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of including the effect of soil conditions in its calculation. This is novel because current scoping models ignore soil conditions, despite such characteristics being the most dominant factor in vibration propagation. The model also has zero run times thus allowing for the rapid assessment of vibration levels across rail networks. First, the development of the new tool is outlined. It is founded upon using a fully validated three dimensional finite element model to generate synthetic vibration records for a wide range of soil types. These records are analysed using a machine learning approach to map relationships between soil conditions, train speed and vibration levels. Its performance is tested through the prediction of two independent international vibration metrics on four European high speed lines and it is found to have high prediction accuracy. A key benefit from this increased prediction accuracy is that it potentially reduces the volume of detailed vibration analyses required for a new high speed train line. This avoids costly in-depth studies in the form of field experiments or large numerical models. Therefore the use of the new tool can result in cost savings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional signal processing techniques (time-domain analysis and short-time Fourier transform) combined with Gaussian discriminant analysis were proposed to characterize damage in composite plates in this study. Composite coupons of different layup configurations with surfaced mounted arrays of piezoelectric actuators and sensors were subjected to cyclic loading to induce matrix micro-cracking and delamination. Sensor data as well as X-ray images were acquired through the coupon's life. These experimental data were used to train a classifier as well as test the performance and robustness of the learned model. Classification performance was measured via 75-25 holdout and leave-one-sample-out cross-validation. Results show that the proposed method has a misclassification rate of 21%, with high precision and recall values, and it is sensitive to layup configuration.

We use a confocal infrared laser scanning optical microscope to collect multimodal images through the backside of the IC. Individual modes correspond to passive reflectivity measurements or active measurements, such as light-induced voltage alteration. The modes are registered and stored in a multidimensional data cube. We apply a machine learning algorithm using a binary representation to identify a variety of data structures from transistors to entire logic cells. Because of the compact representation, objects can be detected rapidly. We show that by increasing the number of imaging modes used to develop the descriptor, we can significantly increase recognition accuracy. The approach allows recognition of poorly resolved components, whose primary distinguishing features are below traditional optical resolution limits, and is general enough to be applied to multiple design processes. We believe this represents a significant step toward a fully non-invasive IC reverse engineering system.

This ability can be used to generate a solution to a particularly intractable problem, given that enough data are available to train and subsequently evaluate an algorithm on. Since MS-based proteomics has no shortage of complex problems, and since publicly available data are becoming available in ever growing amounts, machine learning is fast becoming a very popular tool in the field. We here therefore present an overview of the different applications of machine learning in proteomics that together cover nearly the entire wet- and dry-lab workflow, and that address key bottlenecks in experiment planning and design, as well as in data processing and analysis.

J	Riggelsen, C; Ohrnberger, M				Riggelsen, Carsten; Ohrnberger, Matthias			A Machine Learning Approach for Improving the Detection Capabilities at 3C Seismic Stations	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							INTELLIGENT MONITORING-SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; MAGNITUDE; PHASE	We apply and evaluate a recent machine learning method for the automatic classification of seismic waveforms. The method relies on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) and supervised learning to improve the detection capabilities at 3C seismic stations. A time-frequency decomposition provides the basis for the required signal characteristics we need in order to derive the features defining typical "signal" and "noise" patterns. Each pattern class is modeled by a DBN, specifying the interrelationships of the derived features in the time-frequency plane. Subsequently, the models are trained using previously labeled segments of seismic data. The DBN models can now be compared against in order to determine the likelihood of new incoming seismic waveform segments to be either signal or noise. As the noise characteristics of seismic stations varies smoothly in time (seasonal variation as well as anthropogenic influence), we accommodate in our approach for a continuous adaptation of the DBN model that is associated with the noise class. Given the difficulty for obtaining a golden standard for real data (ground truth) the proof of concept and evaluation is shown by conducting experiments based on 3C seismic data from the International Monitoring Stations, BOSA and LPAZ.

J	Reiss, A; Stricker, D				Reiss, Attila; Stricker, Didier			Aerobic activity monitoring: towards a long-term approach	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY			English	Article						Physical activity monitoring; Activity recognition; Intensity estimation of physical activity; Wearable computing; Machine learning	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WEARABLE SENSORS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; MOBILE PHONES; ACCELEROMETER; SPORTS; ADULTS; HEALTH	With recent progress in wearable sensing, it becomes reasonable for individuals to wear different sensors all day, and thus, global activity monitoring is establishing. The goals in global activity monitoring systems are among others to tell the type of activity that was performed, the duration and the intensity. With the information obtained this way, the individual's daily routine can be described in detail. One of the strong motivations to achieve these goals comes from healthcare: To be able to tell if individuals were performing enough physical activity to maintain or even promote their health. This work focuses on the monitoring of aerobic activities and targets two main goals: To estimate the intensity of activities, and to identify basic/recommended physical activities and postures. For these purposes, a dataset with 8 subjects and 14 different activities was recorded, including the basic activities and postures, but also examples of household (ironing, vacuum cleaning), sports (playing soccer, rope jumping), and everyday activities (ascending and descending stairs). Data from 3 accelerometers-placed on lower arm, chest, and foot-and a heart rate monitor were analyzed. This paper presents the entire data processing chain, analyses and compares different classification techniques, concerning also their feasibility for portable online activity monitoring applications. Results are presented with different combinations of the sensors. For the intensity estimation task, using the sensor setup composed of the chest accelerometer and the HR-monitor is considered the most efficient, achieving a performance of 94.37 %. The overall performance on the activity recognition task, using all available sensors, is 90.65 % with boosted decision trees-the classifier achieving the best classification results within this work.

With regard to these types of natural occurrences, recent global events have attracted the attention of experts in various fields, such as civil engineering, environmental engineering and information management. These experts have developed several techniques to study the various factors of debris flow. The ADABOOST and rough set theory (RST) are two emerging methods with regard to classification and rule provision. The ADABOOST, an adaptive boosting machine learning algorithm, uses very little memory during computation and can obtain robust classification results. RST is able to deal with uncertainties and vague information in generating rules for decision makers. Thus, this study develops an ADARST model which uses the unique strengths of the ADABOOST and RST in classification and rule generation and applies the proposed ADARST to analyze debris flow. Specifically, data from previous studies were obtained and used for the purposes of this study. Experimental results have shown that the proposed ADARST model is able to generate better results than those in previous investigations in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, the designed ADARST model can provide rules including forward and backward reasoning ways for decision makers. Therefore, the proposed ADARST model is shown to be an effective methodology with which to analyze debris flow.

J	Zhang, J; Lockhart, TE; Soangra, R				Zhang, Jian; Lockhart, Thurmon E.; Soangra, Rahul			Classifying Lower Extremity Muscle Fatigue During Walking Using Machine Learning and Inertial Sensors	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fatigue; Gait; Falls; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Jerk cost	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT; JOINT RECEPTORS; POSITION SENSE; KNEE; GAIT; CLASSIFICATION; LOCOMOTION; STABILITY; FALLS	Fatigue in lower extremity musculature is associated with decline in postural stability, motor performance and alters normal walking patterns in human subjects. Automated recognition of lower extremity muscle fatigue condition may be advantageous in early detection of fall and injury risks. Supervised machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) have been previously used for classifying healthy and pathological gait patterns and also for separating old and young gait patterns. In this study we explore the classification potential of SVM in recognition of gait patterns utilizing an inertial measurement unit associated with lower extremity muscular fatigue. Both kinematic and kinetic gait patterns of 17 participants (29 +/- 11 years) were recorded and analyzed in normal and fatigued state of walking. Lower extremities were fatigued by performance of a squatting exercise until the participants reached 60% of their baseline maximal voluntary exertion level. Feature selection methods were used to classify fatigue and no-fatigue conditions based on temporal and frequency information of the signals. Additionally, influences of three different kernel schemes (i.e., linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) were investigated for SVM classification. The results indicated that lower extremity muscle fatigue condition influenced gait and loading responses. In terms of the SVM classification results, an accuracy of 96% was reached in distinguishing the two gait patterns (fatigue and no-fatigue) within the same subject using the kinematic, time and frequency domain features. It is also found that linear kernel and RBF kernel were equally good to identify intra-individual fatigue characteristics. These results suggest that intrasubject fatigue classification using gait patterns from an inertial sensor holds considerable potential in identifying "at-risk'' gait due to muscle fatigue.

J	Evangelou, M; Dudbridge, F; Wernisch, L				Evangelou, Marina; Dudbridge, Frank; Wernisch, Lorenz			Two novel pathway analysis methods based on a hierarchical model	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; LASSO	Motivation: Over the past few years several pathway analysis methods have been proposed for exploring and enhancing the analysis of genome-wide association data. Hierarchical models have been advocated as a way to integrate SNP and pathway effects in the same model, but their computational complexity has prevented them being applied on a genome-wide scale to date. Methods: We present two novel methods for identifying associated pathways. In the proposed hierarchical model, the SNP effects are analytically integrated out of the analysis, allowing computationally tractable model fitting to genome-wide data. The first method uses Bayes factors for calculating the effect of the pathways, whereas the second method uses a machine learning algorithm and adaptive lasso for finding a sparse solution of associated pathways. Results: The performance of the proposed methods was explored on both simulated and real data. The results of the simulation study showed that the methods outperformed some well-established association methods: the commonly used Fisher's method for combining P-values and also the recently published BGSA. The methods were applied to two genome-wide association study datasets that aimed to find the genetic structure of platelet function and body mass index, respectively. The results of the analyses replicated the results of previously published pathway analysis of these phenotypes but also identified novel pathways that are potentially involved.

ATHENA: the analysis tool for heritable and environmental network associations	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GRAMMATICAL EVOLUTION; GENOME; CYTOTOXICITY; DISCOVERY; EPISTASIS; LOCI	Motivation: Advancements in high-throughput technology have allowed researchers to examine the genetic etiology of complex human traits in a robust fashion. Although genome-wide association studies have identified many novel variants associated with hundreds of traits, a large proportion of the estimated trait heritability remains unexplained. One hypothesis is that the commonly used statistical techniques and study designs are not robust to the complex etiology that may underlie these human traits. This etiology could include nonlinear gene x gene or gene x environment interactions. Additionally, other levels of biological regulation may play a large role in trait variability. Results: To address the need for computational tools that can explore enormous datasets to detect complex susceptibility models, we have developed a software package called the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA). ATHENA combines various variable filtering methods with machine learning techniques to analyze high-throughput categorical (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms) and quantitative (i.e. gene expression levels) predictor variables to generate multivariable models that predict either a categorical (i.e. disease status) or quantitative (i.e. cholesterol levels) outcomes. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the utility of ATHENA using simulated and biological datasets that consist of both single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression variables to identify complex prediction models. Importantly, this method is flexible and can be expanded to include other types of high-throughput data (i.e. RNA-seq data and biomarker measurements).

This method provides a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects according to a set of variables without geometric projections, transformed axes or principal components. The algorithm exploits a memory-type mechanism inherent in a certain class of discrete dynamical systems collectively referred to as the chaos game that are closely related to iterative function systems. The goal of the algorithm was to create a human readable representation of high dimensional patient data that was capable of detecting unrevealed subclusters of patients from within anticipated classifications. This provides a mechanism to further pursue a more personalized exploration of pathology when used with medical data. For clustering and classification protocols, the dynamical system portion of the algorithm is designed to come after some feature selection filter and before some model evaluation (e. g. clustering accuracy) protocol. In the version given here, a univariate features selection step is performed (in practice more complex feature selection methods are used), a discrete dynamical system is driven by this reduced set of variables (which results in a set of 2D cluster models), these models are evaluated for their accuracy (according to a userdefined binary classification) and finally a visual representation of the top classification models are returned. Thus, in addition to the visualization component, this methodology can be used for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning as the top performing models are returned in the protocol we describe here. Results: Butterfly, the algorithm we introduce and provide working code for, uses a discrete dynamical system to classify high dimensional data and provide a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects. We report results on three datasets (two in the article; one in the appendix) including a public lung cancer dataset that comes along with the included Butterfly R package. In the included R script, a univariate feature selection method is used for the dimension reduction step, but in the future we wish to use a more powerful multivariate feature reduction method based on neural networks (Kriesel, 2007).

While much focus has been paid to pulmonary tuberculosis, EPTB has received scant attention. Moreover, EPTB is viewed as one wastebasket diagnosis, as "the other" which is not pulmonary. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients treated for EPTB in the state of Texas between January 2000 and December 2005, who had no pulmonary disease. Clinical and epidemiological factors were abstracted from electronic records of the Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis. The long-term outcome, which is death by December 2011, was established using the Social Security Administration Death Master File database. Survival in EPTB patients was compared to those with latent tuberculosis, as well as between different types of EPTB, using Cox proportional hazard models. A hybrid of the machine learning method of classification and regression tree analyses and standard regression models was used to identify high-order interactions and clinical factors predictive of long-term all-cause mortality. Results: Four hundred and thirty eight patients met study criteria; the median study follow-up period for the cohort was 7.8 (inter-quartile range 6.0-10.1) years. The overall all-cause mortality rate was 0.025 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.021-0.030) per 100 person-year of follow-up. The significant predictors of poor long-term outcome were age (hazard ratio [HR] for each year of age-at-diagnosis was 1.05 [Cl: 1.04-1.06], treatment duration, type of EPTB and HIV-infection (HR = 2.16; Cl: 1.22, 3.83). Mortality in genitourinary tuberculosis was no different from latent tuberculosis, while meningitis had the poorest long-term outcome of 46.2%. Compared to meningitis the HR for death was 0.50 (Cl: 0.27-0.91) for lymphatic disease, 0.42 (Cl: 0.21-0.81) for bone/joint disease, and 0.59 (Cl: 0.27-1.31) for peritonitis. The relationship between mortality and therapy duration for each type of EPTB was a unique "V" shaped curve, with the lowest mortality observed at different therapy durations for each, beyond which mortality increased. Conclusions: EPTB is comprised of several different diseases with different outcomes and durations of therapy. The "V" shaped relationship between therapy duration and outcome leads to the hypothesis that longer duration of therapy may lead to higher patient mortality.

Typically, conventional statistical methods are used for the development of outcome prediction models and risk scores. However, these analyses carry inherent properties limiting their ability to cope with large data sets with multiple variables and samples. Machine learning (ML), a field stemming from artificial intelligence, is part of a wider approach for data analysis termed data mining (DM). It enables prediction in complex data scenarios, familiar to practitioners and researchers. Technological and commercial applications are all around us, gradually entering clinical research. In the following review, we would like to expose hematologists and stem cell transplanters to the concepts, clinical applications, strengths and limitations of such methods and discuss current research in HSCT. The aim of this review is to encourage utilization of the ML and DM techniques in the field of HSCT, including prediction of transplantation outcome and donor selection.

Prediction of type 2 diabetes using a combination of anthropometric measures remains a controversial issue. This study aims to predict the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) status that is used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a combination of various measures among Korean adults. A total of 4870 subjects (2955 females and 1915 males) participated in this study. Based on 37 anthropometric measures, we compared predictions of FPG status using individual versus combined measures using two machine-learning algorithms. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the predictions by logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier based on the combination of measures were 0.741 and 0.739 in females, respectively, and were 0.687 and 0.686 in males, respectively. Our results indicate that prediction of FPG status using a combination of anthropometric measures was superior to individual measures alone in both females and males. We show that using balanced data of normal and high FPG groups can improve the prediction and reduce the intrinsic bias of the model toward the majority class.

Presented here is an overview of a prototype automated ingestion detection (AID) process implemented in a health monitoring system (HMS). The automated detection of ingestion supports personal record keeping which is essential during obesity management. Personal record keeping allows the care provider to monitor the therapeutic progress of a patient. The AID-HMS determines the levels of ingestion activity from sounds captured by an external throat microphone. Features are extracted from the sound recording and presented to machine learning classifiers, where a simple voting procedure is employed to determine instances of ingestion. Using a dataset acquired from seven individuals consisting of consumption of liquid and solid, speech, and miscellaneous sounds, >94% of ingestion sounds are correctly identified with false positive rates around 9% based on 10-fold cross validation. The detected levels of ingestion activity are transmitted and stored on a remote web server, where information is displayed through a web application operating in a web browser. This information allows remote users (health provider) determine meal lengths and levels of ingestion activity during the meal. The AID-HMS also provides a basis for automated reinforcement for the patient.

J	Lian, CQ; Xu, X; Zuo, L; Huang, ZH				Lian, Chuanqiang; Xu, Xin; Zuo, Lei; Huang, Zhenhua			Adaptive critic design with graph Laplacian for online learning control of nonlinear systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						manifold learning; reinforcement learning; adaptive critic designs; learning control; graph Laplacian	POWER-SYSTEM; FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; POLICY ITERATION; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHMS	In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) have been widely studied in the community of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As an important class of RL and ADP methods, adaptive critic designs (ACDs) with function approximation have been studied to realize online learning control of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, how to construct efficient feature representations for approximating value functions or policies is still a difficult problem. In this paper, ACDs with graph Laplacian (GL) are proposed by integrating manifold learning methods into feature representations of ACDs. An online learning control algorithm called graph Laplacian dual heuristic programming (GL-DHP) is presented, and its performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the nonlinear approximation ability of feature representation with GL, the GL-DHP method has much better performance than previous DHP methods with manually designed neural networks.

Application of Statistical Models to the Prediction of Seasonal Rainfall Anomalies over the Sahel	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Forecast verification/skill; Statistical forecasting; Rainfall; Seasonal forecasting; Neural networks; Principal components analysis	WEST-AFRICAN MONSOON; REGRESSION TREES; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; 20TH-CENTURY; FORECAST; PACIFIC; OCEANS	Rainfall in the Sahel region of Africa is prone to large interannual variability, and it has exhibited a recent multidecadal drying trend. The well-documented social impacts of this variability have motivated numerous efforts at seasonal precipitation prediction, many of which employ statistical techniques that forecast Sahelian precipitation as a function of large-scale indices of surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies, sea surface temperature (SST), surface pressure, and other variables. These statistical models have demonstrated some skill, but nearly all have adopted conventional statistical modeling techniques-most commonly generalized linear models-to associate predictor fields with precipitation anomalies. Here, the results of an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithm applied to predict summertime (July-September) Sahel rainfall anomalies using indices of springtime (April-June) SST and SAT anomalies for the period 1900-2011 are presented. Principal component analysis was used to remove multicollinearity between predictor variables. Predictive accuracy was assessed using repeated k-fold random holdout and leave-one-out cross-validation methods. It was found that the ANN achieved predictive accuracy superior to that of eight alternative statistical methods tested in this study, and it was also superior to that of previously published predictive models of summertime Sahel precipitation. Analysis of partial dependence plots indicates that ANN skill is derived primarily from the ability to capture nonlinear influences that multiple major modes of large-scale variability have on Sahelian precipitation. These results point to the value of ANN techniques for seasonal precipitation prediction in the Sahel.

Accordingly, the development of rapid and accurate assays for the diagnosis of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) will be critical. We developed and applied a genome-based machine-learning approach for discrimination between VISA and vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) using 25 whole-genome sequences. The resulting machine-learning model, based on 14 gene parameters, including 3 molecular typing markers and 11 genes implicated in reduced vancomycin susceptibility, is able to unambiguously distinguish between the VISA and VSSA isolates analyzed here despite the fact that they do not form evolutionarily distinct groups. As such, the model is able to discriminate based on specific genomic markers of antibiotic susceptibility rather than overall sequence relatedness. Subsequent evaluation of the model using leave-one-out validation yielded a classification accuracy of 84%. The machine-learning approach described here provides a generalized framework for the application of genome sequence analysis to the classification of bacteria that differ with respect to clinically relevant phenotypes and should be particularly useful in defining the genomic features that underlie antibiotic resistance.

However, docking tools often fail to predict how a ligand (the smaller molecule, such as a substrate or drug candidate) binds to a receptor (the accepting part of a protein). We present here the HarmonyDOCK, a novel method for assessing the docking software accuracy, and creating the scoring function which would determine consensus protein-ligand pose among those generated by available docking programs. Conformations for few hundred protein-ligand complexes with known three-dimensional structure were predicted on a benchmark set by set of different docking programs. On the basis of the derived ranking, the point of reference and the lower score limit were determined for subsequent investigations. The focus of the methodology is on the top-ranked poses, with the assumption being that the conformation of the docked molecules is the most accurate. We found out that some docking programs perform considerably better than the others, yet in all cases the proper selection of decoys, namely HarmonyDOCK, is needed for successful docking procedure.

Patients and Methods: Ninety-six age-matched normal and 96 perimetric glaucoma participants were included in this observational, cross-sectional study. Or-logic, support vector machine, relevance vector machine, and linear discrimination function were used to analyze the performances of combined TD-OCT diagnostic variables. Results: The area under the receiver-operating curve (AROC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and to compare the diagnostic performance of single and combined anatomic variables. The best RNFL thickness variables were the inferior (AROC=0.900), overall (AROC=0.892), and superior quadrants (AROC=0.850). The best optic disc variables were horizontal integrated rim width (AROC=0.909), vertical integrated rim area (AROC=0.908), and cup/disc vertical ratio (AROC=0.890). All macular retinal thickness variables had AROCs of 0.829 or less. Combining the top 3 RNFL and optic disc variables in optimizing glaucoma diagnosis, support vector machine had the highest AROC, 0.954, followed by or-logic (AROC=0.946), linear discrimination function (AROC=0.946), and relevance vector machine (AROC=0.943). All combination diagnostic variables had significantly larger AROCs than any single diagnostic variable. There are no significant differences among the combination diagnostic indices. Conclusions: With TD-OCT, RNFL and optic disc variables had better diagnostic accuracy than macular retinal variables. Combining top RNFL and optic disc variables significantly improved diagnostic performance. Clinically, or-logic classification was the most practical analytical tool with sufficient accuracy to diagnose early glaucoma.

Progress in computational toxicology is now reviewed. Methods: A literature review was performed on computational models for hepatotoxicity (e. g. for drug-induced liver injury (DILI)), cardiotoxicity, renal toxicity and genotoxicity. In addition various publications have been highlighted that use machine learning methods. Several computational toxicology model datasets from past publications were used to compare Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning methods. Results: The increasing amounts of data for defined toxicology endpoints have enabled machine learning models that have been increasingly used for predictions. It is shown that across many different models Bayesian and SVM perform similarly based on cross validation data. Discussion: Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade in both model development and availability of larger scale or 'big data' models. The future efforts in toxicology data generation will likely provide us with hundreds of thousands of compounds that are readily accessible for machine learning models. These models will cover relevant chemistry space for pharmaceutical, consumer product and environmental applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, SW; Zhang, TH; Zhang, JN; Huang, YF				Zhang, Shao-Wu; Zhang, Ting-He; Zhang, Jun-Nan; Huang, Yufei			Prediction of Signal Peptide Cleavage Sites with SubsiteCoupled and Template Matching Fusion Algorithm	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Signal peptide cleavage site; Subsite-coupled; Template matching; Fusion; Variable width scaled window	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; PROTEIN SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; GENERAL-FORM; WEB-SERVER; SORTING SIGNALS; SEQUENCE; TOPOLOGY; ATTRIBUTES; LOCATION; WINDOW	Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides (SP) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for SP cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting SP cleavage sites called Signal-CTF that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-CTF consists of three distinct elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared with Signal-3L and SignalP 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 4-12%, 10-25% higher than that of Signal-3L for human, animal and eukaryote, and SignalP 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos's paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-CTF is 12.5%, 25% higher than that of PRED-SIGNAL and SignalP 4.0, respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-CTF can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than SignalP, Phobius, Philius, SPOCTOPUS, Signal-CF and Signal-3L. These results show that Signal-CTF is more accurate and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.

Compost samples representative of five different compost facilities were scanned by DRS, and the raw reflectance spectra were preprocessed using seven spectral transformations for predicting compost FDA-HR with six multivariate algorithms. Although principal component analysis for all spectral pretreatments satisfactorily identified the clusters by compost types, it could not separate different FDA contents. Furthermore, the artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (residual prediction deviation = 3.2, validation r(2) = 0.91 and RMSE = 13.38 mu g g(-1)h(-1)) outperformed other multivariate models to capture the highly non-linear relationships between compost enzymatic activity and VisNIR reflectance spectra after Savitzky-Golay first derivative pretreatment. This work demonstrates the efficiency of VisNIR DRS for predicting compost enzymatic as well as microbial activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chakraborty, Somsubhra; Ali, Md.

Automated detection of defects can provide a valuable tool for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and consistency of condition data, while reducing the time and cost of the inspection process. This paper presents an efficient pattern recognition algorithm to support automated detection and classification of pipe defects in images obtained from conventional CCTV inspection videos. The algorithm employs the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM) to identify pipe defects. The algorithm involves two main steps: (1) image segmentation to extract suspicious regions of interest (ROI) that represent candidate defect areas; and (2) classification of the ROI using SVM classifier that was trained using sets of HOG features extracted from positive and negative examples of the defect. Proposed algorithm is applied to the problem of detecting tree root intrusions. The performance of linear and radial basis function SVM classifiers evaluated. The algorithm was tested on a set of actual CCTV videos obtained from the cities of Regina and Calgary in Canada. Experimental results demonstrated the viability and robustness of the algorithm.

Design of highly efficient and specific siRNAs has become a challenging issue in applications of RNAi. Here, we present a detailed survey on the state-of-the-art siRNAs design, focusing on several key issues with the current in silico RNAi studies, including: (i) inconsistencies among the proposed guidelines for siRNAs design and the incomplete list of siRNAs features, (ii) improper integration of the heterogeneous cross-platform siRNAs data, (iii) inadequate consideration of the binding specificity of the target mRNAs and (iv) reduction in the 'off-target' effect in siRNAs design. With these considerations, the popular in silico siRNAs design rules are reexamined and several inconsistent viewpoints toward siRNAs feature identifications are clarified. In addition, novel computational models for siRNAs design using state-of-art machine learning techniques are discussed, which focus on heterogeneous data integration, joint feature selection and customized siRNAs screening toward highly specific targets. We believe that addressing such issues in siRNA study will provide new clues for further improved design of more efficient and specific siRNAs in RNAi.

Gamification: A Machine-Learning Perspective	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND AI IN GAMES			English	Article						Gamification; machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); pattern recognition		DeepQA is a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) question-and-answer system that responds across a breadth of structured and unstructured data, from hundreds of analytics that are combined with over 50 models, trained through machine learning. After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000. Such initial extreme class imbalance during domain gamification poses a big challenge for the Watson machine-learning pipelines. The combination of ingested corpus sets, question-and-answer pairs, configuration settings, and NLP algorithms contribute toward the challenging data state. We propose several data engineering techniques, such as answer key vetting and expansion, source ingestion, oversampling classes, and question set modifications to increase the computed true labels. In addition, algorithm engineering, such as an implementation of the Newton-Raphson logistic regression with a regularization term, relaxes the constraints of class imbalance during training adaptation. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that data and algorithm engineering are complementary and indispensable to overcome the challenges in this first Watson gamification for real-world business problems.

Recently, with the growing amount of information and the emergence of new technologies that deal with many sources of information, more precise and efficient parsing techniques are required. The most relevant theory to multi-document relationship, Cross-document Structure Theory (CST), has been used for parsing purposes before, though the results had not been satisfactory. CST has received many critics because of its subjectivity, which may lead to low annotation agreement and, consequently, to poor parsing performance. In this work, we propose a refinement of the original CST, which consists in (i) formalizing the relationship definitions, (ii) pruning and combining some relations based on their meaning, and (iii) organizing the relations in a hierarchical structure. The hypothesis for this refinement is that it will lead to better agreement in the annotation and consequently to better parsing results. For this aim, it was built an annotated corpus according to this refinement and it was observed an improvement in the annotation agreement. Based on this corpus, a parser was developed using machine learning techniques and hand-crafted rules. Specifically, hierarchical techniques were used to capture the hierarchical organization of the relations according to the proposed refinement of CST. These two approaches were used to identify the relations among texts spans and to generate multi-document annotation structure. Results outperformed other CST parsers, showing the adequacy of the proposed refinement in the theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Over the past two decades, numerous innovative ideas and effective processing approaches had been proposed and developed, e.g. various normalization techniques, intrinsic feature extractions and representation schemes, machine learning methods and recognition mechanisms etc. Those approaches based on different principles had been shown possessing varying degrees of effectiveness in different aspects. It is expected that the techniques of information fusion with integrating the advantages of existing methods will boost the recognition performance. This paper deals with developing effective approaches for face recognition using information fusion techniques based on integrating multiple cues. The multiple stage integrating techniques dedicated to localization of landmark points and pose estimation were presented. The precise data of localization of landmarks and pose estimation provide the essential geometry basics for further processing. A face recognition classifier scheme with integration of multiple feature representation and multiple block region scores is also proposed. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can reduce equal error rate EER significantly, compared with using single feature and single block representations. The proposed approach had been shown possessing the best performance in participating MCFR2011 competition.

Model Selection Using Database Characteristics: Developing a Classification Tree for Longitudinal Incidence Data	MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						model selection; machine learning; data science; business intelligence; hidden Markov models; classification tree; random forest; posterior predictive model checking; hierarchical Bayesian methods; forecasting	HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; DISTRIBUTIONS; LIKELIHOOD	When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the "winning model" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the "legwork" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e. g., the "back-and-forth" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e. g., the inclusion of an "off" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general "recipe" for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework).

Photometric selection of quasars in large astronomical data sets with a fast and accurate machine learning algorithm	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: statistical; catalogues; quasars: general	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; DATA RELEASE; TARGET SELECTION; IDENTIFICATION; REDSHIFTS; GALAXIES; OBJECT; SDSS	Future astronomical surveys will produce data on similar to 10(8) objects per night. In order to characterize and classify these sources, we will require algorithms that scale linearly with the size of the data, that can be easily parallelized and where the speedup of the parallel algorithm will be linear in the number of processing cores. In this paper, we present such an algorithm and apply it to the question of colour selection of quasars. We use non-parametric Bayesian classification and a binning algorithm implemented with hash tables (BASH tables). We show that this algorithm's run time scales linearly with the number of test set objects and is independent of the number of training set objects. We also show that it has the same classification accuracy as other algorithms. For current data set sizes, it is up to three orders of magnitude faster than commonly used naive kernel-density-estimation techniques and it is estimated to be about eight times faster than the current fastest algorithm using dual kd-trees for kernel density estimation. The BASH table algorithm scales linearly with the size of the test set data only, and so for future larger data sets, it will be even faster compared to other algorithms which all depend on the size of the test set and the size of the training set. Since it uses linear data structures, it is easier to parallelize compared to tree-based algorithms and its speedup is linear in the number of cores unlike tree-based algorithms whose speedup plateaus after a certain number of cores. Moreover, due to the use of hash tables to implement the binning, the memory usage is very small. While our analysis is for the specific problem of selection of quasars, the ideas are general and the BASH table algorithm can be applied to any density-estimation problem involving sparse high-dimensional data sets. Since sparse high-dimensional data sets are a common type of scientific data set, this method has the potential to be useful in a broad range of machine-learning applications in astrophysics.

Among these techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) present good results for example in Pascal Voc challenge 2011 [8], particularly when they are associated with a kernel function [28, 35]. However, nowadays image categorization task is very challenging owing to the sizes of benchmark datasets and the number of categories to be classified. In such a context, lot of effort has to be put in the design of the kernel functions and underlying semantic features. In the following of the paper we call semantic features the features describing the (semantic) content of an image. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn an effective kernel function using the Boosting paradigm to linearly combine weak kernels. We then use a SVM with this kernel to categorize image databases. More specifically, this method create embedding functions to map images in a Hilbert space where they are better classified. Furthermore, our algorithm benefits from boosting process to learn this kernel with a complexity linear with the size of the training set. Experiments are carried out on popular benchmarks and databases to show the properties and behavior of the proposed method. On the PASCAL VOC2006 database, we compare our method to simple early fusion, and on the Oxford Flowers databases we show that our method outperforms the best Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) techniques of the literature.

Bionic Autonomic Nervous Systems for Self-Defense against DoS, Spyware, Malware, Virus, and Fishing	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Security; Autonomic computing; artificial intelligence; machine learning; self-defense	DDOS ATTACKS	Computing systems and networks become increasingly large and complex with a variety of compromises and vulnerabilities. The network security and privacy are of great concern today, where self-defense against different kinds of attacks in an autonomous and holistic manner is a challenging topic. To address this problem, we developed an innovative technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS). The BANS is analogous to biological nervous system, which consists of basic modules like cyber axon, cyber neuron, peripheral nerve and central nerve. We also presented an innovative self-defense mechanism which utilizes the Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Entropy Awareness, etc. Equipped with the BANS, computer and network systems can intelligently self-defend against both known and unknown compromises/attacks including denial of services (DoS), spyware, malware, and virus. BANS also enabled multiple computers to collaboratively fight against some distributed intelligent attacks like DDoS. We have implemented the BANS in practice.

We divided the time period of 1997-2011 into two periods; 1997-2004 and 2005-2011 to investigate the robustness of results pre- and post-IFRS implementation. To determine the relative importance of factors as the predictors of firm value, first, a number of classification models are developed; then, the information fusion based sensitivity analysis is applied to these classification models to identify the ranked order of the independent variables. Among the independent variables, multinationality was found to determine firm value only moderately. In addition to multinationality, other financial characteristics such as firm size (as measured by natural logarithm of assets), leverage, liquidity, and profitability were consistently found to be affecting firm value.

Despite its importance, most studies of feature selection are restricted to batch learning. Unlike traditional batch learning methods, online learning represents a promising family of efficient and scalable machine learning algorithms for large-scale applications. Most existing studies of online learning require accessing all the attributes/features of training instances. Such a classical setting is not always appropriate for real-world applications when data instances are of high dimensionality or it is expensive to acquire the full set of attributes/features. To address this limitation, we investigate the problem of online feature selection (OFS) in which an online learner is only allowed to maintain a classifier involved only a small and fixed number of features. The key challenge of online feature selection is how to make accurate prediction for an instance using a small number of active features. This is in contrast to the classical setup of online learning where all the features can be used for prediction. We attempt to tackle this challenge by studying sparsity regularization and truncation techniques. Specifically, this article addresses two different tasks of online feature selection: 1) learning with full input, where an learner is allowed to access all the features to decide the subset of active features, and 2) learning with partial input, where only a limited number of features is allowed to be accessed for each instance by the learner. We present novel algorithms to solve each of the two problems and give their performance analysis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for online feature selection on several public data sets, and demonstrate their applications to real-world problems including image classification in computer vision and microarray gene expression analysis in bioinformatics. The encouraging results of our experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed techniques.	[Wang, Jialei; Zhao, Peilin; Hoi, Steven C.

J	Liu, RF; Wallqvist, A				Liu, Ruifeng; Wallqvist, Anders			Merging Applicability Domains for in Silico Assessment of Chemical Mutagenicity	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							DESCRIPTORS; SIMILARITY; QSAR; FINGERPRINTS; GENOTOXICITY; PREDICTION; QSPR; SET	Using a benchmark Ames mutagenicity data set, we evaluated the performance of molecular fingerprints as descriptors for developing quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models and defining applicability domains with two machine-learning methods: random forest (RF) and variable nearest neighbor (v-NN). The two methods focus on complementary aspects of chemical mutagenicity and use different characteristics of the molecular fingerprints to achieve high levels of prediction accuracies. Thus, while RF flags mutagenic compounds using the presence or absence of small molecular fragments akin to structural alerts, the v-NN method uses molecular structural similarity as measured by fingerprint-based Tanimoto distances between molecules. We showed that the extended connectivity fingerprints could intuitively be used to define and quantify an applicability domain for either method. The importance of using applicability domains in QSAR modeling cannot be understated; compounds that are outside the applicability domain do not have any close representative in the training set, and therefore, we cannot make reliable predictions. Using either approach, we developed highly robust models that rival the performance of a state-of-the-art proprietary software package. Importantly, based on the complementary approach used by the methods, we showed that by combining the model predictions we raised the applicability domain from roughly 80% to 90%. These results indicated that the proposed QSAR protocol constituted a highly robust chemical mutagenicity prediction model.

Uniting Cheminformatics and Chemical Theory To Predict the Intrinsic Aqueous Solubility of Crystalline Druglike Molecules	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							IN-SILICO PREDICTION; CAMBRIDGE STRUCTURAL DATABASE; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; FREE-ENERGY; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; CROSS-VALIDATION; RANDOM FOREST; SOLVATION; MODELS; CHEMISTRY	We present four models of solution free-energy prediction for druglike molecules utilizing cheminformatics descriptors and theoretically calculated thermodynamic values. We make predictions of solution free energy using physics-based theory alone and using machine learning/quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) models. We also develop machine learning models where the theoretical energies and cheminformatics descriptors are used as combined input. These models are used to predict solvation free energy. While direct theoretical calculation does not give accurate results in this approach, machine learning is able to give predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of similar to 1.1 log S units in a 10-fold cross-validation for our Drug-Like-Solubility 100 (DLS-100) dataset of 100 druglike molecules. We find that a model built using energy terms from our theoretical methodology as descriptors is marginally less predictive than one built on Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) descriptors. Combining both sets of descriptors allows a further but very modest improvement in the predictions. However, in some cases, this is a statistically significant enhancement. These results suggest that there is little complementarity between the chemical information provided by these two sets of descriptors, despite their different sources and methods of calculation. Our machine learning models are also able to predict the well-known Solubility Challenge dataset with an RMSE value of 0.9-1.0 log S units.

Does a More Precise Chemical Description of Protein-Ligand Complexes Lead to More Accurate Prediction of Binding Affinity?	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							EMPIRICAL SCORING FUNCTION; MOLECULAR DOCKING; DRUG DISCOVERY; LONG; RECOGNITION; VALIDATION; DATABASE; NNSCORE; SET	Predicting the binding affinities of large sets of diverse molecules against a range of macromolecular targets is an extremely challenging task. The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for exploiting and analyzing the outputs of docking, which is in turn an important tool in problems such as structure-based drug design. Classical scoring functions assume a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that describe an experimentally determined or modeled structure of a protein ligand complex and its binding affinity. The inherent problem of this approach is in the difficulty of explicitly modeling the various contributions of intermolecular interactions to binding affinity. New scoring functions based on machine-learning regression models, which are able to exploit effectively much larger amounts of experimental data and circumvent the need for a predetermined functional form, have already been shown to outperform a broad range of state-of-the-art scoring functions in a widely used benchmark. Here, we investigate the impact of the chemical description of the complex on the predictive power of the resulting scoring function using a systematic battery of numerical experiments. The latter resulted in the most accurate scoring function to date on the benchmark. Strikingly, we also found that a more precise chemical description of the protein ligand complex does not generally lead to a more accurate prediction of binding affinity. We discuss four factors that may contribute to this result: modeling assumptions, codependence of representation and regression, data restricted to the bound state, and conformational heterogeneity in data.

Identifying different chip levels, especially for incipient chip is a challenge work in gear fault analysis. In order to classify the different gear chip levels automatically and accurately, this paper developed a fast and accurate method. In this method, features which are specially designed for gear damage detection are extracted based on a revised time synchronous averaging algorithm to character the gear conditions. Then, a modified Levenberg-Marquardt training back propagation neural network is utilized to identify the gear chip levels. In this modified neural network, damping factor and dynamic momentum are optimized simultaneously. Fisher iris data which is the machine learning public data is used to validate the performance of the improved neural network. Gear chip fault experiments were conducted and vibration signals were captured under different loads and motor speeds. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to identify the gear chip levels. The classification results of public data and gear chip fault experiment data both demonstrated that the improved neural network gets a better performance in accuracy and speed compared to the neural networks which are trained by El-Alfy's and Norgaard's Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method is more suitable for on-line condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Unfortunately, to be implemented, this kind of testing method often incurs very high costs (expensive instruments, long test time ...). A common approach, in the literature, is the so-called indirect/alternate test strategy. This strategy consists in deriving targeted specifications from low-cost Indirect Measurements (IMs). During the industrial test phase, the estimation of regular specifications using IMs is based on a correlation model that has been built previously, during a training phase. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is limited, mainly because of a lack of confidence in the accuracy of estimations made by the correlation model. A solution to increase the confidence in the estimation of specifications using the indirect approach is to implement redundancy in the prediction phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that the redundancy implementation brings more than identifying rare misjudged circuits from a high-correlated model. Indeed redundancy massively increases the accuracy despite of the lack of accurate models that have been assumed in previous implementations of redundant indirect testing. This approach is illustrated on a real case study for which we have experimental measurements on a set of 10,000 devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, maximum likelihood and prediction error methods represent the mainstream approaches to identification of linear dynamic systems, with a long history of theoretical and algorithmic contributions. Parallel to this, in the machine learning community alternative techniques have been developed. Until recently, there has been little contact between these two worlds. The first aim of this survey is to make accessible to the control community the key mathematical tools and concepts as well as the computational aspects underpinning these learning techniques. In particular, we focus on kernel-based regularization and its connections with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Bayesian estimation of Gaussian processes. The second aim is to demonstrate that learning techniques tailored to the specific features of dynamic systems may outperform conventional parametric approaches for identification of stable linear systems.

Sumon; Rahman, Ashfaqur; McCulloch, John			Predicting shellfish farm closures using time series classification for aquaculture decision support	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Time series classification; Prediction; Machine learning; Aquaculture decision support	DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; PCA	Closing a shellfish farm due to pollutants usually after high rainfall and hence high river flow is an important activity for health authorities and aquaculture industries. Towards this problem, a novel application of time series classification to predict shellfish farm closure for aquaculture decision support is investigated in this research. We exploit feature extraction methods to identify characteristics of both univariate and multivariate time series to predict closing or re-opening of shellfish farms. For univariate time series of rainfall, auto-correlation function and piecewise aggregate approximation feature extraction methods are used. In multivariate time series of rainfall and river flow, we consider features derived using cross-correlation and principal component analysis functions. Experimental studies show that time series without any feature extraction methods give poor accuracy of predicting closure. Feature extraction from rainfall time series using piecewise aggregate approximation and auto-correlation functions improve up to 30% accuracy of prediction over no feature extraction when a support vector machine based classifier is applied. Features extracted from rainfall and river flow using cross-correlation and principal component analysis functions also improve accuracy up to 25% over no feature extraction when a support vector machine technique is used. Overall, statistical features using auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions achieve promising results for univariate and multivariate time series respectively using a support vector machine classifier.

Here, we aim to assess the ten-network model in severely brain-injured patients suffering from disorders of consciousness and to identify those networks which will be most relevant to discriminate between patients and healthy subjects. Methods: 300 fMRI volumes were obtained in 27 healthy controls and 53 patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) and coma. Independent component analysis (ICA) reduced data dimensionality. The ten networks were identified by means of a multiple template-matching procedure and were tested on neuronality properties (neuronal vs non-neuronal) in a data-driven way. Univariate analyses detected between-group differences in networks' neuronal properties and estimated voxel-wise functional connectivity in the networks, which were significantly less identifiable in patients. A nearest-neighbor "clinical" classifier was used to determine the networks with high between-group discriminative accuracy. Results: Healthy controls were characterized by more neuronal components compared to patients in VS/UWS and in coma. Compared to healthy controls, fewer patients in MCS and VS/UWS showed components of neuronal origin for the left executive control network, default mode network (DMN), auditory, and right executive control network. The "clinical" classifier indicated the DMN and auditory network with the highest accuracy (85.3%) in discriminating patients from healthy subjects. Conclusions: FMRI multiple-network resting state connectivity is disrupted in severely brain-injured patients suffering from disorders of consciousness. When performing ICA, multiple-network testing and control for neuronal properties of the identified RSNs can advance fMRI system-level characterization. Automatic data-driven patient classification is the first step towards future single-subject objective diagnostics based on fMRI resting state acquisitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mashayekhi, M; MacPherson, B; Gras, R				Mashayekhi, Morteza; MacPherson, Brian; Gras, Robin			A machine learning approach to investigate the reasons behind species extinction	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Individual-based model; Machine learning; Species extinction; Rule extraction	EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SIZE; COLONIZATION; ENVIRONMENTS; CONSERVATION; SPECIATION; MODEL; RISK	Species extinction is one of the most important phenomena in conservation biology. Many factors are involved in the disappearance of species, including stochastic population fluctuations, habitat change, resource depletion, and inbreeding. Due to the complexity of the interactions between these various factors and the lengthy time period required to make empirical observations, studying the phenomenon of species extinction can prove to be very difficult in nature. On the other hand, an investigation of the various features involved in species extinction using individual-based simulation modeling and machine learning techniques can be accomplished in a reasonably short period of time. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate multiple factors involved in species extinction using computer simulation modeling. We apply several machine learning techniques to the data generated by EcoSim, a predator-prey ecosystem simulation, in order to select the most prominent features involved in species extinction, along with extracting rules that outline conditions that have the potential to be used for predicting extinction. In particular, we used five feature selection methods resulting in the selection of 25 features followed by a reduction of these to 14 features using correlation analysis. Each of the remaining features was placed in one of three broad categories, viz., genetic, environmental, or demographic. The experimental results suggest that factors such as population fluctuation, reproductive age, and genetic distance are important in the occurrence of species extinction in EcoSim, similar to what is observed in nature. We argue that the study of the behavior of species through Individual-Based Modeling has the potential to give rise to new insights into the central factors involved in extinction for real ecosystems. This approach has the potential to help with the detection of early signals of species extinction that could in turn lead to conservation policies to help prevent extinction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Healthcare is on the cusp of its own era of big data, catalyzed by the changing regulatory and competitive environments, fueled by growing adoption of electronic health records, as well as efforts to integrate medical claims, electronic health records and other novel data sources. Applying the lessons from big data pioneers will require healthcare and life science organizations to make investments in new hardware and software, as well as in individuals with different skills. For life science companies, this will impact the entire pharmaceutical value chain from early research to postcommercialization support. More generally, this will revolutionize comparative effectiveness research.

The two important parameters of harmony search algorithm namely Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR) and Pitch Adjusting Rate (PAR), which were either kept constant or the PAR value was dynamically changed while still keeping HMCR fixed, as observed from literature, are both being allowed to change dynamically in this proposed PAHS. This change in the parameters has been done to get the global optimal solution. Four different cases of linear and exponential changes have been explored. The change has been allowed during the process of improvization. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 15 standard benchmark functions of various characteristics. Its performance is investigated and compared with three existing harmony search algorithms. Experimental results reveal that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing approaches when applied to 15 benchmark functions. The effects of scalability, noise, and harmony memory size have also been investigated on four approaches of HS. The proposed algorithm is also employed for data clustering. Five real life datasets selected from UCI machine learning repository are used. The results show that, for data clustering, the proposed algorithm achieved results better than other algorithms.

In this study, a Swarm Intelligence approach, namely artificial bee colony (ABC) is utilized to optimize parameters of least squares support vector machines. Considering critical issues such as enriching the searching strategy and preventing over fitting, two modifications to the original ABC are introduced. By using commodities prices time series as empirical data, the proposed technique is compared against two techniques, including Back Propagation Neural Network and by Genetic Algorithm.

J	Ben-David, S; Urner, R				Ben-David, Shai; Urner, Ruth			Domain adaptation-can quantity compensate for quality?	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Domain adaptation; Sample complexity		The Domain Adaptation problem in machine learning occurs when the distribution generating the test data differs from the one that generates the training data. A common approach to this issue is to train a standard learner for the learning task with the available training sample (generated by a distribution that is different from the test distribution). One can view such learning as learning from a not-perfectly-representative training sample. The question we focus on is under which circumstances large sizes of such training samples can guarantee that the learned classifier preforms just as well as one learned from target generated samples. In other words, are there circumstances in which quantity can compensate for quality (of the training data)? We give a positive answer, showing that this is possible when using a Nearest Neighbor algorithm. We show this under some assumptions about the relationship between the training and the target data distributions (the assumptions of covariate shift as well as a bound on the ratio of certain probability weights between the source (training) and target (test) distribution). We further show that in a slightly different learning model, when one imposes restrictions on the nature of the learned classifier, these assumptions are not always sufficient to allow such a replacement of the training sample: For proper learning, where the output classifier has to come from a predefined class, we prove that any learner needs access to data generated from the target distribution.

Modeling of a Rotary Blood Pump	ARTIFICIAL ORGANS			English	Article						Support vector machine; Total artificial heart; Machine learning; Data-driven model	VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; FLOW; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM; HEART	The accurate representation of rotary blood pumps in a numerical environment is important for meaningful investigation of pump-cardiovascular system interactions. Although numerous models for ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed, modeling methods for rotary total artificial hearts (rTAHs) are still required. Therefore, an rTAH prototype was characterized in a steady flow, hydraulic test bench over a wide operational range for pump and hydraulic parameters. In order to develop a generic modeling method, a data-driven modeling approach was chosen. k-Nearest-neighbors, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs) were the machine learning approaches evaluated. The best performing parameters for each algorithm were determined via optimization. The resulting multiple-input-multiple-output models were subsequently assessed under identical conditions, and a SVM with a radial basis function kernel was identified as the best performing. The achieved root mean squared errors were 0.03 L/min, 0.06 L/min, and 0.18 W for left and right flow and motor power consumption, respectively. In comparison with existing models for VADs, the flow errors are more than 70% lower. Further advantages of the SVM model are the robustness to measurement noise and the capability to operate outside of the trained parameter range. This proposed modeling method will accelerate further device refinements by providing a more appropriate numerical environment in which to evaluate the pump-cardiovascular system interaction.

In the field of probabilistic graphical models, which includes Bayesian network models, conditional independence tests are especially important for the task of learning the probabilistic graphical model structure from data. In this paper, we propose the full Bayesian significance test for tests of conditional independence for discrete datasets. The full Bayesian significance test is a powerful Bayesian test for precise hypothesis, as an alternative to the frequentist's significance tests (characterized by the calculation of the p-value).

Based on this fact, we capture and classifi) NetFlow records to extract feature patterns for each PC on the network within a certain period of time. A feature pattern includes: No of DNS requests, no of DNS responses, no of DNS normals, and no of DNS anomalies. Two learning machines are used, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB), for the purpose of classification. Solid statistical tests, the cross-validation and paired t-test, are conducted to compare the individual performance between the KNN and NB algorithms. We used the classification accuracy, false alarm rates, and training time as metrics of performance to conclude which algorithm is superior to another. The data set used in training and testing the algorithms is created by using 18 real-life worm variants along with a big amount of benign flows.

Most state of the art traffic management and information systems focus on data analysis, and very little has been done in the sense of prediction. In this article, we devise an efficient system for the prediction of peak traffic flow using machine learning techniques. In the proposed system, the traffic flow of a locality is predicted with the aid of the geospatial data obtained from aerial images. The proposed system comprises of two significant phases: Geospatial data extraction from aerial images, and traffic flow prediction using See5.0 decision tree. Firstly, geographic information essential for traffic flow prediction are extracted from aerial images like traffic maps, using suitable image processing techniques. Subsequently, for a user query, the trained See5.0 decision tree predicts the traffic state of the intended location with relevance to the date and time specified. The experimental results portray the effectiveness of the proposed system in predicting traffic flow.

Most of such research includes supervised Machine Learning (ML) approaches such as Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree. Most of these techniques have complex mathematical models and do not usually lead to accurate results for Arabic TC. Moreover, all the previous research tended to deal with the Feature Selection (FS) and the classification respectively as independent problems in automatic TC, which led to the cost and complex computational issues. Based on this, the need to apply new techniques suitable for Arabic language and its complex morphology arises. A new approach in the Arabic TC term called the Frequency Ratio Accumulation Method (FRAM), which has a simple mathematical model is applied in this study. The categorization task is combined with a feature processing task. The current research mainly aims at solving the problem of automatic Arabic TC by investigating the FRAM in order to enhance the performance of Arabic TC model. The performance of FRAM classifier is compared with three classifiers based on Bayesian theorem which are called Simple NB, Multi-variant Bernoulli Naive Bayes (MNB) and Multinomial Naive Bayes models (MBNB). Based on the findings of the study, the FRAM has outperformed the state of the arts. It's achieved 95.1% macro-Fl value by using unigram word-level representation method	[Sharef, Baraa; Omar, Nazlia] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Sharef, Zeyad] Univ Mosul, Coll Elect Engn, Mosul, Iraq; [Sharef, Baraa] Univ Mosul, Coll Comp Sci & Math, Mosul, Iraq	Sharef, B (reprint author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.							23	0	0	ZARKA PRIVATE UNIV	ZARQA	COLLEGE COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PO BOX 2000, ZARQA, 13110, JORDAN	1683-3198			INT ARAB J INF TECHN	Int.

J	Maalouf, M; Siddiqi, M				Maalouf, Maher; Siddiqi, Mohammad			Weighted logistic regression for large-scale imbalanced and rare events data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; Endogenous sampling; Logistic regression; Kernel methods; Truncated Newton	LIKELIHOOD; SAMPLES; PROBABILITIES; MODELS	Latest developments in computing and technology, along with the availability of large amounts of raw data, have led to the development of many computational techniques and algorithms. Concerning binary data classification in particular, analysis of data containing rare events or disproportionate class distributions poses a great challenge to industry and to the machine learning community. Logistic Regression (LR) is a powerful classifier. The combination of LR and the truncated-regularized iteratively re-weighted least squares (TR-IRLS) algorithm, has provided a powerful classification method for large data sets. This study examines imbalanced data with binary response variables containing many more non-events (zeros) than events (ones). It has been established in the literature that these variables are difficult to predict and explain. This research combines rare events corrections to LR with truncated Newton methods. The proposed method, Rare Event Weighted Logistic Regression (RE-WLR), is capable of processing large imbalanced data sets at relatively the same processing speed as the TR-IRLS, however, with higher accuracy.

One of those techniques, reservoir computing (RC), is a decade old and has achieved state-of-the-art performance for processing sequential data. Dedicated hardware realizations of RC could enable speed gains and power savings. Here we propose the first integrated passive silicon photonics reservoir. We demonstrate experimentally and through simulations that, thanks to the RC paradigm, this generic chip can be used to perform arbitrary Boolean logic operations with memory as well as 5-bit header recognition up to 12.5 Gbit s(-1), without power consumption in the reservoir. It can also perform isolated spoken digit recognition. Our realization exploits optical phase for computing. It is scalable to larger networks and much higher bitrates, up to speeds >100 Gbit s(-1). These results pave the way for the application of integrated photonic RC for a wide range of applications.

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for fuzzy classification in survival prediction	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Fuzzy classification; Multi-objective evolutionary computation; Severity scores; Intensive care burns unit	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; BURN PATIENTS; SPECIAL-ISSUE; SYSTEMS; INTERPRETABILITY; MORTALITY; OPTIMIZATION; PROBABILITY	Objective: This paper presents a novel rule-based fuzzy classification methodology for survival/mortality prediction in severe burnt patients. Due to the ethical aspects involved in this medical scenario, physicians tend not to accept a computer-based evaluation unless they understand why and how such a recommendation is given. Therefore, any fuzzy classifier model must be both accurate and interpretable. Methods and materials: The proposed methodology is a three-step process: (1) multi-objective constrained optimization of a patient's data set, using Pareto-based elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to maximize accuracy and minimize the complexity (number of rules) of classifiers, subject to interpretability constraints; this step produces a set of alternative (Pareto) classifiers; (2) linguistic labeling, which assigns a linguistic label to each fuzzy set of the classifiers; this step is essential to the interpretability of the classifiers; (3) decision making, whereby a classifier is chosen, if it is satisfactory, according to the preferences of the decision maker. If no classifier is satisfactory for the decision maker, the process starts again in step (1) with a different input parameter set. Results: The performance of three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, niched pre-selection multi-objective algorithm, elitist Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for diversity reinforcement (ENORA) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), was tested using a patient's data set from an intensive care burn unit and a standard machine learning data set from an standard machine learning repository. The results are compared using the hypervolume multi-objective metric. Besides, the results have been compared with other non-evolutionary techniques and validated with a multi-objective cross-validation technique. Our proposal improves the classification rate obtained by other non-evolutionary techniques (decision trees, artificial neural networks, Naive Bayes, and case-based reasoning) obtaining with ENORA a classification rate of 0.9298, specificity of 0.9385, and sensitivity of 0.9364, with 14.2 interpretable fuzzy rules on average. Conclusions: Our proposal improves the accuracy and interpretability of the classifiers, compared with other non-evolutionary techniques. We also conclude that ENORA outperforms niched pre-selection and NSGA-II algorithms. Moreover, given that our multi-objective evolutionary methodology is non-combinational based on real parameter optimization, the time cost is significantly reduced compared with other evolutionary approaches existing in literature based on combinational optimization.

J	Zhang, B; Wang, Y; Chen, F				Zhang, Bang; Wang, Yang; Chen, Fang			Multilabel Image Classification via High-Order Label Correlation Driven Active Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Active learning; multilabel classification; high-order label correlation	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Supervised machine learning techniques have been applied to multilabel image classification problems with tremendous success. Despite disparate learning mechanisms, their performances heavily rely on the quality of training images. However, the acquisition of training images requires significant efforts from human annotators. This hinders the applications of supervised learning techniques to large scale problems. In this paper, we propose a high-order label correlation driven active learning (HoAL) approach that allows the iterative learning algorithm itself to select the informative example-label pairs from which it learns so as to learn an accurate classifier with less annotation efforts. Four crucial issues are considered by the proposed HoAL: 1) unlike binary cases, the selection granularity for multilabel active learning need to be fined from example to example-label pair; 2) different labels are seldom independent, and label correlations provide critical information for efficient learning; 3) in addition to pair-wise label correlations, high-order label correlations are also informative for multilabel active learning; and 4) since the number of label combinations increases exponentially with respect to the number of labels, an efficient mining method is required to discover informative label correlations. The proposed approach is tested on public data sets, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness.

While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks, such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory, unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore, every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space-the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal-could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The key improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions-a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the similar to 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.

Such programs are common today in the form of machine-learned classifiers. We consider the problem of testing this common kind of machine-generated program when the only oracle is an end user: e.g., only you can determine if your email is properly filed. We present test selection methods that provide very good failure rates even for small test suites, and show that these methods work in both large-scale random experiments using a "gold standard" and in studies with real users. Our methods are inexpensive and largely algorithm-independent. Key to our methods is an exploitation of properties of classifiers that is not possible in traditional software testing. Our results suggest that it is plausible for time-pressured end users to interactively detect failures-even very hard-to-find failures-without wading through a large number of successful (and thus less useful) tests. We additionally show that some methods are able to find the arguably most difficult-to-detect faults of classifiers: cases where machine learning algorithms have high confidence in an incorrect result.

Emotion classification in Parkinson's disease by higher-order spectra and power spectrum features using EEG signals: A comparative study	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; emotion; Parkinson's disease; bispectrum; power spectrum; pattern classification	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; MUSIC; BRAIN; SPEECH; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULI; PERSPECTIVES; METAANALYSIS; PROGRESSION; PERCEPTION	Deficits in the ability to process emotions characterize several neuropsychiatric disorders and are traits of Parkinson's disease (PD), and there is need for a method of quantifying emotion, which is currently performed by clinical diagnosis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system (CNS), can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize EEG emotional states in PD patients that would classify six basic emotions (happiness and sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust) in comparison with healthy controls (HC). Emotional EEG data were recorded from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, education level- and sex-matched controls using multimodal (audio-visual) stimuli. The use of nonlinear features motivated by the higher-order spectra (HOS) has been reported to be a promising approach to classify the emotional states. In this work, we made the comparative study of the performance of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using the features derived from HOS and from the power spectrum. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that power spectrum and HOS based features were statistically significant among the six emotional states (p < 0.0001). Classification results shows that using the selected HOS based features instead of power spectrum based features provided comparatively better accuracy for all the six classes with an overall accuracy of 70.10% +/- 2.83% and 77.29% +/- 1.73% for PD patients and HC in beta (13-30 Hz) band using SVM classifier. Besides, PD patients achieved less accuracy in the processing of negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions (happiness, surprise) compared with HC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to the classification of emotional states in PD patients in a user independent manner using EEG signals. The accuracy of the system can be improved by investigating the other HOS based features. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

J	Hainmueller, J; Hazlett, C				Hainmueller, Jens; Hazlett, Chad			Kernel Regularized Least Squares: Reducing Misspecification Bias with a Flexible and Interpretable Machine Learning Approach	POLITICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							SPLINES	We propose the use of Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) for social science modeling and inference problems. KRLS borrows from machine learning methods designed to solve regression and classification problems without relying on linearity or additivity assumptions. The method constructs a flexible hypothesis space that uses kernels as radial basis functions and finds the best-fitting surface in this space by minimizing a complexity-penalized least squares problem. We argue that the method is well-suited for social science inquiry because it avoids strong parametric assumptions, yet allows interpretation in ways analogous to generalized linear models while also permitting more complex interpretation to examine nonlinearities, interactions, and heterogeneous effects. We also extend the method in several directions to make it more effective for social inquiry, by (1) deriving estimators for the pointwise marginal effects and their variances, (2) establishing unbiasedness, consistency, and asymptotic normality of the KRLS estimator under fairly general conditions, (3) proposing a simple automated rule for choosing the kernel bandwidth, and (4) providing companion software. We illustrate the use of the method through simulations and empirical examples.

The highest accuracy obtained by linear logistic regression and sparse multinomial logistic regression is 100% and sensitivity, specificity of 0.983 and 0.996, respectively. All the experiments are conducted over 95% and 99% confidence levels and establish the results with corrected t-tests. This work shows a high degree of advancement in software reliability and quality of the computer-aided diagnosis system and experimentally shows best results with supportive statistical inference.

The performance of the prediction methods depends on the verified peptides. However, the available peptide datasets of most alleles contain significant biases. An investigation to the effect of the peptides in the training dataset on the performance of the generated model indicated that there was a discrepancy between the classification of binders from biological data and classification of binders from super-motif-sharing peptides, which was induced by the non-motif-containing peptides. Most human MHC (called HLA) class I molecules could be assigned to supertypes-based on their overlapping peptide-binding specificities, therefore, we proposed a supertype-based method for the modeling of the HLA class 1-peptide binding: candidates of peptides binding to alleles in a given supertypes were screened using the super-motifs, and then the peptides binding to specific allele in the supertype were predicted by the model trained on the super-motif-sharing peptides. The efficacy of this supertype-based method was examined in two matrix-based methods and one machine learning method for 20 alleles in HLA supertypes Al, A2, 16, A24, B44 and B7. Evaluations on several benchmark datasets indicated that the supertype-based method achieved remarkable success in improving the prediction of HLA-binding peptides.

Congruence in demersal fish, macroinvertebrate, and macroalgal community turnover on shallow temperate reefs	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Australia; biological surrogacy; coastal planning; gradient forest; marine biodiversity; prediction; random forest; species turnover; Tasmania	MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SPECIES RICHNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BETA-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; CORAL; ASSEMBLAGES; SURROGATES	To support coastal planning through improved understanding of patterns of biotic and abiotic surrogacy at broad scales, we used gradient forest modeling (GFM) to analyze and predict spatial patterns of compositional turnover of demersal fishes, macroinvertebrates, and macroalgae on shallow, temperate Australian reefs. Predictive models were first developed using environmental surrogates with estimates of prediction uncertainty, and then the efficacy of the three assemblages as biosurrogates for each other was assessed. Data from underwater visual surveys of subtidal rocky reefs were collected from the southeastern coastline of continental Australia (including South Australia and Victoria) and the northern coastline of Tasmania. These data were combined with 0.01 degrees-resolution gridded environmental variables to develop statistical models of compositional turnover (beta diversity) using GFM. GFM extends the machine learning, ensemble tree-based method of random forests (RF), to allow the simultaneous modeling of multiple taxa. The models were used to generate predictions of compositional turnover for each of the three assemblages within unsurveyed areas across the 6600 km of coastline in the region of interest. The most important predictor for all three assemblages was variability in sea surface temperature (measured as standard deviation from measures taken interannually). Spatial predictions of compositional turnover within unsurveyed areas across the region of interest were remarkably congruent across the three taxa. However, the greatest uncertainty in these predictions varied in location among the different assemblages. Pairwise congruency comparisons of observed and predicted turnover among the three assemblages showed that invertebrate and macroalgal biodiversity were most similar, followed by fishes and macroalgae, and lastly fishes and invertebrate biodiversity, suggesting that of the three assemblages, macroalgae would make the best biosurrogate for both invertebrate and fish compositional turnover.

As an effective solution, data-driven soft sensors provide stable and reliable online estimation of these variables based on historical measurements of easy-to-measure process variables. Deep learning, as a novel training strategy for deep neural networks, has recently become a popular data-driven approach in the area of machine learning. In the present study, the deep learning technique is employed to build soft sensors and applied to an industrial case to estimate the heavy diesel 95% cut point of a crude distillation unit (CDU). The comparison of modeling results demonstrates that the deep learning technique is especially suitable for soft sensor modeling because of the following advantages over traditional methods. First, with a complex multi-layer structure, the deep neural network is able to contain richer information and yield improved representation ability compared with traditional data-driven models. Second, deep neural networks are established as latent variable models that help to describe highly correlated process variables. Third, the deep learning is semi-supervised so that all available process data can be utilized. Fourth, the deep learning technique is particularly efficient dealing with massive data in practice.

The majority of species we surveyed were terrestrial direct-developing frogs or frogs that breed in tank bromeliads, rather than those that use permanent water bodies to breed. Thus, we were able to investigate the climatic correlates of Bd infection in a frog assemblage that does not rely on permanent water bodies. We sampled frogs for Bd across all of the major habitat types on the island, used machine learning algorithms to identify climatic variables that are correlated with infection rates, and extrapolated infection rates across the island. We compared the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms for species distribution modeling in the context of our study, and found that infection rate rose quickly with precipitation in the driest month. Infection rates also increased with mean temperature in the warmest quarter until 22 degrees C, and remained relatively level thereafter. Both of these results are in accordance with previous studies of the physiology of Bd. Based on our environmental results, we suggest that frogs occupying high-precipitation habitats with cool rainy-season temperatures, though zcurrently experiencing low frequencies of infection, may experience an increase in infection rates as global warming increases temperatures in their habitat.

The approach presented is designed to provide a significant increase in robustness relative to existing methods when faced with widely varying field conditions while operating fast enough to be used in large scale applications. In particular, a clustering method for segmentation is developed that exploits inherent characteristics of fracture images to achieve consistent performance, combined with robust feature extraction to improve recognition algorithm classifier outcomes. The approach is shown to perform well in detecting cracks across a broad range of surface and lighting conditions, which can cause existing techniques to exhibit significant reductions in detection accuracy and/or detection speed.

It is widely used within computational linguistics and natural language processing, but surprisingly little in other areas. TBL is a simple yet flexible paradigm, which achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance in several areas and does not overtrain easily. It is especially successful at catching local, fixed-distance dependencies and seamlessly exploits information from heterogeneous discrete feature types. The learned representation-an ordered list of transformation rules-is compact and efficient, with clear semantics. Individual rules are interpretable and often meaningful to humans. The present article offers a survey of the most important theoretical work on TBL, addressing a perceived gap in the literature. Because the method should be useful also outside the world of computational linguistics and natural language processing, a chief aim is to provide an informal but relatively comprehensive introduction, readable also by people coming from other specialities.

An Integrated Model of Multiple-Condition ChIP-Seq Data Reveals Predeterminants of Cdx2 Binding	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION-FACTOR-BINDING; GENOME-WIDE IDENTIFICATION; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR-BINDING; MIXTURE-MODELS; DNA; CHROMATIN; RESOLUTION; DIFFERENTIATION	Regulatory proteins can bind to different sets of genomic targets in various cell types or conditions. To reliably characterize such condition-specific regulatory binding we introduce MultiGPS, an integrated machine learning approach for the analysis of multiple related ChIP-seq experiments. MultiGPS is based on a generalized Expectation Maximization framework that shares information across multiple experiments for binding event discovery. We demonstrate that our framework enables the simultaneous modeling of sparse condition-specific binding changes, sequence dependence, and replicate-specific noise sources. MultiGPS encourages consistency in reported binding event locations across multiple-condition ChIP-seq datasets and provides accurate estimation of ChIP enrichment levels at each event. MultiGPS's multi-experiment modeling approach thus provides a reliable platform for detecting differential binding enrichment across experimental conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of MultiGPS with an analysis of Cdx2 binding in three distinct developmental contexts. By accurately characterizing condition-specific Cdx2 binding, MultiGPS enables novel insight into the mechanistic basis of Cdx2 site selectivity. Specifically, the condition-specific Cdx2 sites characterized by MultiGPS are highly associated with preexisting genomic context, suggesting that such sites are pre-determined by cell-specific regulatory architecture. However, MultiGPS-defined condition-independent sites are not predicted by pre-existing regulatory signals, suggesting that Cdx2 can bind to a subset of locations regardless of genomic environment. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2-5.

One of the difficulties of antimicrobial prescribing lies in the necessity to sequentially adjust the treatment of a patient as new clinical data become available. The lack of specialized health-care resources and the overwhelming amount of information to process make manual surveillance unsustainable. To solve this problem, we have developed and deployed an automated antimicrobial prescription surveillance system that assists hospital pharmacists in identifying and reporting inappropriate prescriptions. Since its deployment, the system has improved antimicrobial prescribing and decreased antimicrobial use. However, the highly sensitive knowledge base used by the system leads to many false alerts. As a remedy, we are developing a machine-learning algorithm that combines instance-based learning and rule induction techniques to discover new rules for detecting inappropriate prescriptions from previous false alerts. In this article, we describe the system, point to results and lessons learned so far, and provide insight into the machine-learning capability.

In recent years, the number of application's to the UTCS Ph.D. program has become too large to manage With a traditional review process. GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee Is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant's file that matter the most. An evaluation over two seasons of Ph.D. admissions indicates that the system leads to dramatic tithe savings, reducing the total time spent on reviews by at least 74 percent.

An ANN learns to map stimuli to responses through repeated evaluation of exemplars of the mapping. This learning approach results in networks which are recognized for their noise tolerance and ability to generalize meaningful responses for novel stimuli. It is these properties of ANNs which make them appealing for applications to bioinformatics problems where interpretation of data may not always be obvious, and where the domain knowledge required for deductive techniques is incomplete or can cause a combinatorial explosion of rules. In this paper, we provide an introduction to artificial neural network theory and review some interesting recent applications to bioinformatics problems.

A feasibility study involving N = 10 participants was carried out to evaluate the devices' ability to differentiate between nine everyday activities. The activities examined include walking, running, cycling, standing, sitting, elevator ascents, elevator descents, stair ascents and stair descents. The authors also evaluated the ability of these devices to differentiate indoors from outdoors, with the aim of enhancing contextual awareness. Data from this study was used to train and test five well known machine learning algorithms: C4.5, CART, Na ve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptrons and finally Support Vector Machines. Both single and multi-sensor approaches were examined to better understand the role each sensor in the device can play in unobtrusive activity recognition. The authors found overall results to be promising, with some models correctly classifying up to 100% of all instances.

The investigated categories of body movements belong to the Laban Effort Framework: Strong-Light, Free-Bound and Sudden-Sustained. All body movements were represented by a set of activities used for data collection. The calculated accuracy of detecting the body movements was based on collecting data from a single wireless tri-axial accelerometer sensor. Ten healthy subjects collected data from three body locations (chest, wrist and thigh) simultaneously in order to analyze the locations comparatively. The data was then processed and analyzed using Machine Learning techniques. The wrist placement was found to be the best single location to record data for detecting Strong-Light body movements using the Random Forest classifier. The wrist placement was also the best location for classifying Bound-Free body movements using the SVM classifier. However, the data collected from the chest placement yielded the best results for detecting Sudden-Sustained body movements using the Random Forest classifier. The study shows that the choice of the accelerometer placement should depend on the targeted type of movement. In addition, the choice of the classifier when processing data should also depend on the chosen location and the target movement.

In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50% when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.

An Algorithm for Finding Biologically Significant Features in Microarray Data Based on A Priori Manifold Learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; CANCER; ISOMAP	Microarray databases are a large source of genetic data, which, upon proper analysis, could enhance our understanding of biology and medicine. Many microarray experiments have been designed to investigate the genetic mechanisms of cancer, and analytical approaches have been applied in order to classify different types of cancer or distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. However, microarrays are high-dimensional datasets with high levels of noise and this causes problems when using machine learning methods. A popular approach to this problem is to search for a set of features that will simplify the structure and to some degree remove the noise from the data. The most widely used approach to feature extraction is principal component analysis (PCA) which assumes a multivariate Gaussian model of the data. More recently, non-linear methods have been investigated. Among these, manifold learning algorithms, for example Isomap, aim to project the data from a higher dimensional space onto a lower dimension one. We have proposed a priori manifold learning for finding a manifold in which a representative set of microarray data is fused with relevant data taken from the KEGG pathway database. Once the manifold has been constructed the raw microarray data is projected onto it and clustering and classification can take place. In contrast to earlier fusion based methods, the prior knowledge from the KEGG databases is not used in, and does not bias the classification process-it merely acts as an aid to find the best space in which to search the data. In our experiments we have found that using our new manifold method gives better classification results than using either PCA or conventional Isomap.

J	Maestri, M; Ode, J; Hegde, J				Maestri, Matthew; Ode, Jeffrey; Hegde, Jay			Semantic descriptor ranking: a quantitative method for evaluating qualitative verbal reports of visual cognition in the laboratory or the clinic	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						qualitative research; natural language processing; semantic processing; visual cognition; neuropsychological tests	BLOCK DESIGN PERFORMANCE; FACE PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; RECOGNITION; CATEGORIZATION; 3D	For scientific, clinical, and machine learning purposes alike, it is desirable to quantify the verbal reports of high-level visual percepts. Methods to do this simply do not exist at present. Here we propose a novel methodological principle to help fill this gap, and provide empirical evidence designed to serve as the initial "proof" of this principle. In the proposed method, subjects view images of real-world scenes and describe, in their own words, what they saw. The verbal description is independently evaluated by several evaluators. Each evaluator assigns a rank score to the subject's description of each visual object in each image using a novel ranking principle, which takes advantage of the well-known fact that semantic descriptions of real life objects and scenes can usually be rank-ordered. Thus, for instance, "animal," "dog," and "retriever" can be regarded as increasingly finer-level, and therefore higher ranking, descriptions of a given object. These numeric scores can preserve the richness of the original verbal description, and can be subsequently evaluated using conventional statistical procedures. We describe an exemplar implementation of this method and empirical data that show its feasibility. With appropriate future standardization and validation, this novel method can serve as an important tool to help quantify the subjective experience of the visual world. In addition to being a novel, potentially powerful testing tool, our method also represents, to our knowledge, the only available method for numerically representing verbal accounts of real-world experience. Given that its minimal requirements, i.e., a verbal description and the ground truth that elicited the description, our method has a wide variety of potential real-world applications.

Answers (http://answers.yahoo.com), WikiAnswer (http://wiki.answers.com), and Baidu Zhidao (http://zhidao.baidu.com), etc., have emerged as alternatives for knowledge and information acquisition. Over time, a large number of question and answer (Q&A) pairs with high quality devoted by human intelligence have been accumulated as a comprehensive knowledge base. Unlike the search engines, which return long lists of results, searching in the CQA services can obtain the correct answers to the question queries by automatically finding similar questions that have already been answered by other users. Hence, it greatly improves the efficiency of the online information retrieval. However, given a question query, finding the similar and well-answered questions is a non-trivial task. The main challenge is the word mismatch between question query (query) and candidate question for retrieval (question). To investigate this problem, in this study, we capture the word semantic similarity between query and question by introducing the topic modeling approach. We then propose an unsupervised machine-learning approach to finding similar questions on CQA Q&A archives. The experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Knowledge-based extraction of adverse drug events from biomedical text	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Relation extraction; Knowledge base; Adverse drug effect	PROTEIN; CORPUS	Background: Many biomedical relation extraction systems are machine-learning based and have to be trained on large annotated corpora that are expensive and cumbersome to construct. We developed a knowledge-based relation extraction system that requires minimal training data, and applied the system for the extraction of adverse drug events from biomedical text. The system consists of a concept recognition module that identifies drugs and adverse effects in sentences, and a knowledge-base module that establishes whether a relation exists between the recognized concepts. The knowledge base was filled with information from the Unified Medical Language System. The performance of the system was evaluated on the ADE corpus, consisting of 1644 abstracts with manually annotated adverse drug events. Fifty abstracts were used for training, the remaining abstracts were used for testing. Results: The knowledge-based system obtained an F-score of 50.5%, which was 34.4 percentage points better than the co-occurrence baseline. Increasing the training set to 400 abstracts improved the F-score to 54.3%. When the system was compared with a machine-learning system, jSRE, on a subset of the sentences in the ADE corpus, our knowledge-based system achieved an F-score that is 7 percentage points higher than the F-score of jSRE trained on 50 abstracts, and still 2 percentage points higher than jSRE trained on 90% of the corpus. Conclusion: A knowledge-based approach can be successfully used to extract adverse drug events from biomedical text without need for a large training set. Whether use of a knowledge base is equally advantageous for other biomedical relation-extraction tasks remains to be investigated.

This study attempts to estimate two major water quality indicators, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, in coastal environments on the west coast of South Korea using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data. Three machine learning approaches including random forest, Cubist, and support vector regression (SVR) were evaluated for coastal water quality estimation. In situ measurements (63 samples) collected during four days in 2011 and 2012 were used as reference data. Due to the limited number of samples, leave-one-out cross validation (CV) was used to assess the performance of the water quality estimation models. Results show that SVR outperformed the other two machine learning approaches, yielding calibration R-2 of 0.91 and CV root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 1.74 mg/m(3) (40.7%) for chl-a, and calibration R-2 of 0.98 and CV RMSE of 11.42 g/m(3) (63.1%) for SPM when using GOCI-derived radiance data. Relative importance of the predictor variables was examined. When GOCI-derived radiance data were used, the ratio of band 2 to band 4 and bands 6 and 5 were the most influential input variables in predicting chl-a and SPM concentrations, respectively. Hourly available GOCI images were useful to discuss spatiotemporal distributions of the water quality parameters with tidal phases in the west coast of Korea.

Here, we study under what conditions such continuous learning (CL) may be more adaptive than simple reinforcement learning and examine how it could have evolved from the same basic associative elements. We use agent-based computer simulations to compare three learning strategies: simple reinforcement learning; reinforcement learning with chaining (RL-chain) and CL that applies the same associative mechanisms used by the other strategies, but also seeks statistical regularities in the relations among all items in the environment, regardless of the initial association with food. We show that a sufficiently structured environment favours the evolution of both RL-chain and CL and that CL outperforms the other strategies when food is relatively rare and the time for learning is limited. This advantage of internally motivated CL stems from its ability to capture statistical patterns in the environment even before they are associated with food, at which point they immediately become useful for planning.

Previous studies have shown change in the activation levels of broad cortical areas such as the premotor cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus during phonological processing. However, whether these areas actually convey signals to representations related to individual phonemes remains unclear. This study focused on single vowels and investigated cortical areas important for representing single vowels using electrocorticography (ECoG) during covert articulation. To identify such cortical areas, we used a neural decoding approach in which machine learning models identify vowels. A decoding model was trained on the ECoG signals from individual electrodes placed on the subjects' cortices. We then statistically evaluated whether each decoding model showed accurate identification of vowels, and we found cortical areas such as the premotor cortex and the superior temporal gyrus. These cortical areas were consistent with previous findings. On the other hand, no electrodes over Broca's area showed significant decoding accuracies. This was inconsistent with findings from a previous study showing that vowels within the phonemic sequence of words can be decoded using ECoG signals from Broca's area. Our results therefore suggest that Broca's area is involved in the processing of vowels within phonemic sequences, but not in the processing of single vowels.

Publicly available data sets have allowed researchers to empirically assess their learners and, jointly with open source machine learning software, they have favoured the emergence of comparative analyses of learners' performance over a common framework. These studies have brought standard procedures to evaluate machine learning techniques. However, current claims such as the superiority of enhanced algorithms are biased by unsustained assumptions made throughout some praxes. In this paper, the early steps of the methodology, which refer to data set selection, are inspected. Particularly, the exploitation of the most popular data repository in machine learning the UCI repository is examined. We analyse the type, complexity, and use of UCI data sets. The study recommends the design of a mindful data repository, UCI+, which should include a set of properly characterised data sets consisting of a complete and representative sample of real-world problems, enriched with artificial benchmarks. The ultimate goal of the UCI+ is to lay the foundations towards a well-supported methodology for learner assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Origins of hole traps in hydrogenated nanocrystalline and amorphous silicon revealed through machine learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							A-SI-H; LIGHT-INDUCED CREATION; MICROCRYSTALLINE SILICON; DANGLING BONDS; MECHANISM; ELECTRON; METASTABILITY; ELLIPSOMETRY; STATES; MODEL	Genetic programming is used to identify the structural features most strongly associated with hole traps in hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon with very low crystalline volume fraction. The genetic programming algorithm reveals that hole traps are most strongly associated with local structures within the amorphous region in which a single hydrogen atom is bound to two silicon atoms (bridge bonds), near fivefold coordinated silicon (floating bonds), or where there is a particularly dense cluster of many silicon atoms. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism by which deep hole traps associated with bridge bonds may contribute to the Staebler-Wronski effect.

Presently, many machine learning methods for PPI extraction have achieved promising results. However, the performance is still not satisfactory. One reason is that the semantic resources were basically ignored. In this paper, we propose a multiple-kernel learning-based approach to extract PPIs, combining the feature-based kernel, tree kernel and semantic kernel. Particularly, we extend the shortest path-enclosed tree kernel (SPT) by a dynamic extended strategy to retrieve the richer syntactic information. Our semantic kernel calculates the protein-protein pair similarity and the context similarity based on two semantic resources: WordNet and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH). We evaluate our method with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and achieve an F-score of 69.40% and an AUC of 92.00%, which show that our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems by integrating semantic information.

Materials and Methods: 1793 low-dose chest CT scans were analyzed (non-contrast-enhanced, non-gated). To establish the reference standard for CAC, first automated calcium scoring was performed using a preliminary version of a method employing coronary calcium atlas and machine learning approach. Thereafter, each scan was inspected by one of four trained raters. When needed, the raters corrected initially automaticity-identified results. In addition, an independent observer subsequently inspected manually corrected results and discarded scans with gross segmentation errors. Subsequently, fully automatic coronary calcium scoring was performed. Agatston score, CAC volume and number of calcifications were computed. Agreement was determined by calculating proportion of agreement and examining Bland-Altman plots. Reliability was determined by calculating linearly weighted kappa (k) for Agatston strata and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous values. Results: 44 (2.5%) scans were excluded due to metal artifacts or gross segmentation errors. In the remaining 1749 scans, median Agatston score was 39.6 (P25-P75:0-345.9), median volume score was 60.4 mm(3) (P25-P75:0-361.4) and median number of calcifications was 2 (P25-P75:0-4) for the automated scores. The k demonstrated very good reliability (0.85) for Agatston risk categories between the automated and reference scores. The Bland-Altman plots showed underestimation of calcium score values by automated quantification. Median difference was 2.5 (p25-p75:0.0-53.2) for Agatston score, 7.6 (p25-p75:0.0-94.4) for CAC volume and 1 (p25-p75:0-5) for number of calcifications. The ICC was very good for Agatston score (0.90), very good for calcium volume (0.88) and good for number of calcifications (0.64). Discussion: Fully automated coronary calcium scoring in a lung cancer screening setting is feasible with acceptable reliability and agreement despite an underestimation of the amount of calcium when compared to reference scores.

Analysis and interpretation of gene expression data has evolved from the gene to the pathway and interaction level, i.e. from the detection of differentially expressed genes, to the establishment of gene interaction networks and the identification of enriched functional categories. Still, the understanding of biological systems requires a further level of analysis that addresses the characterization of the interaction between functional modules. Results: We present a novel computational methodology to study the functional interconnections among the molecular elements of a biological system. The PANA approach uses high-throughput genomics measurements and a functional annotation scheme to extract an activity profile from each functional block -or pathway-followed by machine-learning methods to infer the relationships between these functional profiles. The result is a global, interconnected network of pathways that represents the functional cross-talk within the molecular system. We have applied this approach to describe the functional transcriptional connections during the yeast cell cycle and to identify pathways that change their connectivity in a disease condition using an Alzheimer example. Conclusions: PANA is a useful tool to deepen in our understanding of the functional interdependences that operate within complex biological systems. We show the approach is algorithmically consistent and the inferred network is well supported by the available functional data. The method allows the dissection of the molecular basis of the functional connections and we describe the different regulatory mechanisms that explain the network's topology obtained for the yeast cell cycle data.

Objectives: This review aims to explore wearable accelerometry-based technology (ABT) capable of assessing mobility-related functional activities intended for rehabilitation purposes in community settings for neurological populations. In this review, we focus on the accuracy of ABT-based methods, types of outcome measures, and the implementation of ABT in non-clinical settings for rehabilitation purposes. Data sources: Cochrane, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, and IEEE Xplore. The search strategy covered three main areas, namely wearable technology, rehabilitation, and setting. Study selection: Potentially relevant studies were categorized as systems either evaluating methods or outcome parameters. Methods: Methodological qualities of studies were assessed by two customized checklists, depending on their categorization and rated independently by three blinded reviewers. Results: Twelve studies involving ABT met the eligibility criteria, of which three studies were identified as having implemented ABT for rehabilitation purposes in non-clinical settings. From the twelve studies, seven studies achieved high methodological quality scores. These studies were not only capable of assessing the type, quantity, and quality measures of functional activities, but could also distinguish healthy from non-healthy subjects and/or address disease severity levels. Conclusion: While many studies support ABT's potential for telerehabilitation, few actually utilized it to assess mobility-related functional activities outside laboratory settings. To generate more appropriate outcome measures, there is a clear need to translate research findings and novel methods into practice.

Combinatorial screening for new materials in unconstrained composition space with machine learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE	Typically, computational screens for new materials sharply constrain the compositional search space, structural search space, or both, for the sake of tractability. To lift these constraints, we construct a machine learning model from a database of thousands of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The resulting model can predict the thermodynamic stability of arbitrary compositions without any other input and with six orders of magnitude less computer time than DFT. We use this model to scan roughly 1.6 million candidate compositions for novel ternary compounds (A(x)B(y)C(z)), and predict 4500 new stable materials. Our method can be readily applied to other descriptors of interest to accelerate domain-specific materials discovery.	[Meredig, B.; Kirklin, S.; Saal, J. E.; Doak, J.

The purpose of the present study was to address this issue through an investigation of the reliability of optical measures of cortical correlates of attention in conjunction with machine learning techniques to distinguish between states of full attention and states characterized by reduced attention capacity during a sustained attention task. Seven subjects engaged in a 30 minutes duration sustained attention reaction time task with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring over the prefrontal and the right parietal areas. NIRS signals from the first 10 minutes of the task were considered as characterizing the 'full attention' class, while the NIRS signals from the last 10 minutes of the task were considered as characterizing the 'attention decrement' class. A two-class support vector machine algorithm was exploited to distinguish between the two levels of attention using appropriate NIRS-derived signal features. Attention decrement occurred during the task as revealed by the significant increase in reaction time in the last 10 compared to the first 10 minutes of the task (p<.05). The esults demonstrate relatively good classification accuracy, ranging from 65 to 90%. The highest classification accuracy results were obtained when exploiting the oxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 77 to 89%, depending on the cortical area considered) rather than the deoxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 65 to 66%). Moreover, the classification accuracy increased to 90% when using signals from the right parietal area rather than from the prefrontal cortex. The results support the feasibility of developing cognitive tracking technologies using NIRS and machine learning techniques.

In such scenarios, an appropriate model at a time point may rapidly become obsolete, requiring updating or replacement. As there are several learning algorithms available, choosing one whose bias suits the current data best is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present a meta-learning based method for periodic algorithm selection in time-changing environments, named MetaStream. It works by mapping the characteristics extracted from the past and incoming data to the performance of regression models in order to choose between single learning algorithms or their combination. Experimental results for two real regression problems showed that MetaStream is able to improve the general performance of the learning system compared to a baseline method and an ensemble-based approach.

J	Zhang, XY				Zhang, Xiaoyu			Interactive patent classification based on multi-classifier fusion and active learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Patent classification; Machine learning; Semi-supervised learning; Multi-classifier fusion; Active learning	IMAGE RETRIEVAL	Patent classification is of great importance to effective patent analysis. Traditional manual classification suffers from the problem of low efficiency and high expense. To address this issue, an interactive patent classification algorithm based on multi-classifier fusion and active learning is proposed in this paper, which comprises the construction and update of classification model. For model construction, a sub-classifier is trained for each class of the patents by means of support vector machine. Via multi-classifier fusion, the sub-classifiers are effectively combined to acquire enhanced classifiers, based on which the classification decision can be made. For model update, active learning is used to select the most informative patents for labeling, in which dynamic batch sampling is presented to cope with the problem of redundancy in traditional batch mode. Using dynamic certainty propagation, the selected patents become more informative for active learning. By iterating model construction and update, the classification performance can be gradually refined. The interactive classification algorithm is applied to both synthetic data and patents, and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the encouraging results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To enable the application of these tasks on a large-scale, scalability and computational efficiency are considered as desirable properties for a practical semidefinite programming algorithm. In this paper, we theoretically analyze a new bilateral greedy optimization (denoted BILGO) strategy in solving general semidefinite programs on large-scale datasets. As compared to existing methods, BILGO employs a bilateral search strategy during each optimization iteration. In such an iteration, the current semidefinite matrix solution is updated as a bilateral linear combination of the previous solution and a suitable rank-1 matrix, which can be efficiently computed from the leading eigenvector of the descent direction at this iteration. By optimizing for the coefficients of the bilateral combination, BILGO reduces the cost function in every iteration until the KKT conditions are fully satisfied, thus, it tends to converge to a global optimum. In fact, we prove that BILGO converges to the global optimal solution at a rate of O(1/k), where k is the iteration counter. The algorithm thus successfully combines the efficiency of conventional rank-1 update algorithms and the effectiveness of gradient descent. Moreover, BILGO can be easily extended to handle low rank constraints. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of BILGO, we apply it to two important machine learning tasks, namely Mahalanobis metric learning and maximum variance unfolding. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that BILGO can solve large-scale semidefinite programs efficiently. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes a non-invasive brain-actuated manipulator experiment, which defined a paradigm for the motion control of a serial manipulator based on motor imagery and shared control. The techniques of component selection, spatial filtering and classification of motor imagery were involved. Small-world neural network (SWNN) was used to classify five brain states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the SWNN classifier by a radial basis function (RBF) networks neural network, a standard multi-layered feed-forward backpropagation network (SMN) and a multi-SVM classifier, with the same features for the classification. The results also indicate that the proposed classifier achieves a 3.83% improvement over the best results of other classifiers. We proposed a shared control method consisting of two control patterns to expand the control of BMI from the software angle. The job of path building for reaching the 'end' point was designated as an assessment task. We recorded all paths contributed by subjects and picked up relevant parameters as evaluation coefficients. With the assistance of two control patterns and series of machine learning algorithms, the proposed BMI originally achieved the motion control of a manipulator in the whole workspace. According to experimental results, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed BMI method for 3D motion control of a manipulator using EEG during motor imagery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The rapidly increasing number of sequences entering the genome databanks has called for the development of automated analysis methods. Currently, most existing methods used to predict protein subcellular locations cover only one, or a very limited number of species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop reliable and effective computational approaches to further improve the performance of protein subcellular prediction and, at the same time, cover more species. The current study reports the development of a novel predictor called MSLoc-DT to predict the protein subcellular locations of human, animal, plant, bacteria, virus, fungi, and archaea by introducing a novel feature extraction approach termed Amino Acid Index Distribution (AAID) and then fusing gene ontology information, sequential evolutionary information, and sequence statistical information through four different modes of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) with a decision template rule. Using the jackknife test, MSLoc-DT can achieve 86.5, 98.3, 90.3, 98.5, 95.9, 98.1, and 99.3% overall accuracy for human, animal, plant, bacteria, virus, fungi, and archaea, respectively, on seven stringent benchmark datasets. Compared with other predictors (e.g., Gpos-PLoc, Gneg-PLoc, Virus-PLoc, Plant-PLoc, Plant-mPLoc, ProLoc-Go, Hum-PLoc, GOASVM) on the gram-positive, gram-negative, virus, plant, eukaiyotic, and human datasets, the new MSLoc-DT predictor is much more effective and robust. Although the MSLoc-DT predictor is designed to predict the single location of proteins, our method can be extended to multiple locations of proteins by introducing multilabel machine learning approaches, such as the support vector machine and deep learning, as substitutes for the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method.

The "true" imputation model may contain nonlinearities which are not included in default imputation models. Random forest imputation is a machine learning technique which can accommodate nonlinearities and interactions and does not require a particular regression model to be specified. We compared parametric MICE with a random forest-based MICE algorithm in 2 simulation studies. The first study used 1,000 random samples of 2,000 persons drawn from the 10,128 stable angina patients in the CALIBER database (Cardiovascular Disease Research using Linked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Records; 2001-2010) with complete data on all covariates. Variables were artificially made "missing at random," and the bias and efficiency of parameter estimates obtained using different imputation methods were compared. Both MICE methods produced unbiased estimates of (log) hazard ratios, but random forest was more efficient and produced narrower confidence intervals. The second study used simulated data in which the partially observed variable depended on the fully observed variables in a nonlinear way. Parameter estimates were less biased using random forest MICE, and confidence interval coverage was better. This suggests that random forest imputation may be useful for imputing complex epidemiologic data sets in which some patients have missing data.

Despite extensive efforts to automatically analyze various aspects of biomedical text, there have been only few studies focusing on anatomical entities, and no dedicated methods for learning to automatically recognize anatomical entity mentions in free-form text have been introduced. Results: We present AnatomyTagger, a machine learning-based system for anatomical entity mention recognition. The system incorporates a broad array of approaches proposed to benefit tagging, including the use of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)- and Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO)-based lexical resources, word representations induced from unlabeled text, statistical truecasing and non-local features. We train and evaluate the system on a newly introduced corpus that substantially extends on previously available resources, and apply the resulting tagger to automatically annotate the entire open access scientific domain literature. The resulting analyses have been applied to extend services provided by the Europe PubMed Central literature database.

Recently, ensemble approaches have been applied to this task, proving that they may lead to a significant improvement of the robustness of the recognition system. Most of one-class classifiers base their decision on a distance from an object to the decision boundary, canonically expressed in the Euclidean measure. When combining such predictors, one must map the distance into support function (probability). Additionally, we use weighted one-class support vector machine, which utilizes a distance-based function for calculating weights assigned to objects. Therefore, one may easily see that the measure used has a crucial impact on the quality of base classifiers as well as on the classifier fusion. This study investigates the performance of seven different distance measures over a set of diverse benchmark datasets. Additionally, we analyze the correlation between the used distance measure and the selected fusion method. Experimental analysis allows us to shed some light on strengths and weaknesses of examined distance metrics applied to combining one-class classifiers.

On damage diagnosis for a wind turbine blade using pattern recognition	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							HEALTH MONITORING METHODOLOGY; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NOVELTY DETECTION; EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION; NEURAL NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; AIRCRAFT; PCA	With the increased interest in implementation of wind turbine power plants in remote areas, structural health monitoring (SHM) will be one of the key cards in the efficient establishment of wind turbines in the energy arena. Detection of blade damage at an early stage is a critical problem, as blade failure can lead to a catastrophic outcome for the entire wind turbine system. Experimental measurements from vibration analysis were extracted from a 9 m CX-100 blade by researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) throughout a full-scale fatigue test conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and National Wind Technology Center (NWTC). The blade was harmonically excited at its first natural frequency using a Universal Resonant EXcitation (UREX) system. In the current study, machine learning algorithms based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including an Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN) based on a standard ANN form and a novel approach to auto-association with Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) networks are used, which are optimised for fast and efficient runs. This paper introduces such pattern recognition methods into the wind energy field and attempts to address the effectiveness of such methods by combining vibration response data with novelty detection techniques.

Proteome-wide identification of predominant subcellular protein localizations in a bacterial model organism	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Subcellular localization; Experimental proteomics data; Outer membrane proteome; Machine learning; Localization change; Prokaryote	GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA; INNER MEMBRANE PROTEOME; IV SECRETION SYSTEM; BARTONELLA-HENSELAE; OUTER-MEMBRANE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; GLOBAL ANALYSIS; COMPLEX-I; PREDICTION	Proteomics data provide unique insights into biological systems, including the predominant subcellular localization (SCL) of proteins, which can reveal important clues about their functions. Here we analyzed data of a complete prokaryotic proteome expressed under two conditions mimicking interaction of the emerging pathogen Bartonella henselae with its mammalian host. Normalized spectral count data from cytoplasmic, total membrane, inner and outer membrane fractions allowed us to identify the predominant SCL for 82% of the identified proteins. The spectral count proportion of total membrane versus cytoplasmic fractions indicated the propensity of cytoplasmic proteins to co-fractionate with the inner membrane, and enabled us to distinguish cytoplasmic, peripheral inner membrane and bona fide inner membrane proteins. Principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor classification training on selected marker proteins or predominantly localized proteins, allowed us to determine an extensive catalog of at least 74 expressed outer membrane proteins, and to extend the SCL assignment to 94% of the identified proteins, including 18% where in silico methods gave no prediction. Suitable experimental proteomics data combined with straightforward computational approaches can thus identify the predominant SCL on a proteome-wide scale. Finally, we present a conceptual approach to identify proteins potentially changing their SCL in a condition-dependent fashion. Biological significance The work presented here describes the first prokaryotic proteome-wide subcellular localization (SCL) dataset for the emerging pathogen B. henselae (Bhen). The study indicates that suitable subcellular fractionation experiments combined with straight-forward computational analysis approaches assessing the proportion of spectral counts observed in different subcellular fractions are powerful for determining the predominant SCL of a large percentage of the experimentally observed proteins. This includes numerous cases where in silico prediction methods do not provide any prediction. Avoiding a treatment with harsh conditions, cytoplasmic proteins tend to co-fractionate with proteins of the inner membrane fraction, indicative of close functional interactions. The spectral count proportion (SCP) of total membrane versus cytoplasmic fractions allowed us to obtain a good indication about the relative proximity of individual protein complex members to the inner membrane. Using principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor approaches, we were able to extend the percentage of proteins with a predominant experimental localization to over 90% of all expressed proteins and identified a set of at least 74 outer membrane (OM) proteins. In general, OM proteins represent a rich source of candidates for the development of urgently needed new therapeutics in combat of resurgence of infectious disease and multi-drug resistant bacteria. Finally, by comparing the data from two infection biology relevant conditions, we conceptually explore methods to identify and visualize potential candidates that may partially change their SCL in these different conditions. The data are made available to researchers as a SCL compendium for Bhen and as an assistance in further improving in silico SCL prediction algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal is to identify the macromolecular targets of new chemical agents. Although several computational tools for predicting such targets are publicly available, none of these methods was explicitly designed to predict target engagement by de novo-designed molecules. Here we present the development and practical application of a unique technique, self-organizing map-based prediction of drug equivalence relationships (SPiDER), that merges the concepts of self-organizing maps, consensus scoring, and statistical analysis to successfully identify targets for both known drugs and computer-generated molecular scaffolds. We discovered a potential off-target liability of fenofibrate-related compounds, and in a comprehensive prospective application, we identified a multitarget-modulating profile of de novo designed molecules. These results demonstrate that SPiDER may be used to identify innovative compounds in chemical biology and in the early stages of drug discovery, and help investigate the potential side effects of drugs and their repurposing options.

So far, a comprehensive inventory of interphase chromatin has not been determined. This is largely due to its heterogeneous and dynamic composition, which makes conclusive biochemical purification difficult, if not impossible. As a fuzzy organelle, it defies classical organellar proteomics and cannot be described by a single and ultimate list of protein components. Instead, we propose a new approach that provides a quantitative assessment of a protein's probability to function in chromatin. We integrate chromatin composition over a range of different biochemical and biological conditions. This resulted in interphase chromatin probabilities for 7635 human proteins, including 1840 previously uncharacterized proteins. We demonstrate the power of our large-scale data-driven annotation during the analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) regulation in chromatin. Quantitative protein ontologies may provide a general alternative to list-based investigations of organelles and complement Gene Ontology.	[Kustatscher, Georg; Wills, Karen L.

However, the development of effective vaccines will depend on the identification and characterization of the neutralizing antibodies and their epitopes. We developed bioinformatics methods to predict epitope networks and antigenic determinants using structural information, as well as corresponding genotypes and phenotypes generated by a highly sensitive and reproducible neutralization assay. 282 clonal envelope sequences from a multiclade panel of HIV-1 viruses were tested in viral neutralization assays with an array of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs: b12, PG9,16,PGT121-128, PGT130-131, PGT135-137, PGT141-145, and PGV04). We correlated IC50 titers with the envelope sequences, and used this information to predict antibody epitope networks. Structural patches were defined as amino acid groups based on solvent-accessibility, radius, atomic depth, and interaction networks within 3D envelope models. We applied a boosted algorithm consisting of multiple machine-learning and statistical models to evaluate these patches as possible antibody epitope regions, evidenced by strong correlations with the neutralization response for each antibody. Results: We identified patch clusters with significant correlation to IC50 titers as sites that impact neutralization sensitivity and therefore are potentially part of the antibody binding sites. Predicted epitope networks were mostly located within the variable loops of the envelope glycoprotein (gp120), particularly in V1/V2. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments involving residues identified as epitope networks across multiple mAbs confirmed association of these residues with loss or gain of neutralization sensitivity. Conclusions: Computational methods were implemented to rapidly survey protein structures and predict epitope networks associated with response to individual monoclonal antibodies, which resulted in the identification and deeper understanding of immunological hotspots targeted by broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies.

Fifteen healthy young subjects managed unexpected perturbations during walking. Whole-body 3D kinematics was recorded and a machine learning algorithm was developed to detect perturbation events. In particular, the linear acceleration of all the body segments was parsed by Independent Component Analysis and a Neural Network was used to classify walking from unexpected perturbations. The Mean Detection Time (MDT) was 3516123 ms with an Accuracy of 95.4%. The procedure was repeated with data related to different subsets of all body segments whose variability appeared strongly influenced by the perturbation-induced dynamic modifications. Accordingly, feet and hands accounted for most data information and the performance of the algorithm were slightly reduced using their combination. Results support the hypothesis that, in the framework of the proposed approach, the information conveyed by all the body segments is redundant to achieve effective fall detection, and suitable performance can be obtained by simply observing the kinematics of upper and lower distal extremities. Future studies are required to assess the extent to which such results can be reproduced in older adults and in different experimental conditions.

Transient protein-protein interface prediction: datasets, features, algorithms, and the RAD-T predictor	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Protein-protein interaction; Protein-protein interface; Feature selection; Protein datasets; Protein interface identification; Protein prediction scoring	INTERACTION SITE PREDICTION; BINDING-SITES; STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT; SEQUENCE PROFILE; SURFACE; RECOGNITION; NETWORK; CLASSIFIER; PRINCIPLES; COMPLEXES	Background: Transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which underly most biological processes, are a prime target for therapeutic development. Immense progress has been made towards computational prediction of PPIs using methods such as protein docking and sequence analysis. However, docking generally requires high resolution structures of both of the binding partners and sequence analysis requires that a significant number of recurrent patterns exist for the identification of a potential binding site. Researchers have turned to machine learning to overcome some of the other methods' restrictions by generalising interface sites with sets of descriptive features. Best practices for dataset generation, features, and learning algorithms have not yet been identified or agreed upon, and an analysis of the overall efficacy of machine learning based PPI predictors is due, in order to highlight potential areas for improvement. Results: The presence of unknown interaction sites as a result of limited knowledge about protein interactions in the testing set dramatically reduces prediction accuracy. Greater accuracy in labelling the data by enforcing higher interface site rates per domain resulted in an average 44% improvement across multiple machine learning algorithms. A set of 10 biologically unrelated proteins that were consistently predicted on with high accuracy emerged through our analysis. We identify seven features with the most predictive power over multiple datasets and machine learning algorithms. Through our analysis, we created a new predictor, RAD-T, that outperforms existing non-structurally specializing machine learning protein interface predictors, with an average 59% increase in MCC score on a dataset with a high number of interactions. Conclusion: Current methods of evaluating machine-learning based PPI predictors tend to undervalue their performance, which may be artificially decreased by the presence of un-identified interaction sites. Changes to predictors' training sets will be integral to the future progress of interface prediction by machine learning methods. We reveal the need for a larger test set of well studied proteins or domain-specific scoring algorithms to compensate for poor interaction site identification on proteins in general.

Feature combination networks for the interpretation of statistical machine learning models: application to Ames mutagenicity	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Interpretation; Interpretable; Machine learning; Mutagenicity; QSAR	QSAR MODELS; PREDICTION; EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; VISUALIZATION	Background: A new algorithm has been developed to enable the interpretation of black box models. The developed algorithm is agnostic to learning algorithm and open to all structural based descriptors such as fragments, keys and hashed fingerprints. The algorithm has provided meaningful interpretation of Ames mutagenicity predictions from both random forest and support vector machine models built on a variety of structural fingerprints. A fragmentation algorithm is utilised to investigate the model's behaviour on specific substructures present in the query. An output is formulated summarising causes of activation and deactivation. The algorithm is able to identify multiple causes of activation or deactivation in addition to identifying localised deactivations where the prediction for the query is active overall. No loss in performance is seen as there is no change in the prediction; the interpretation is produced directly on the model's behaviour for the specific query. Results: Models have been built using multiple learning algorithms including support vector machine and random forest. The models were built on public Ames mutagenicity data and a variety of fingerprint descriptors were used. These models produced a good performance in both internal and external validation with accuracies around 82%. The models were used to evaluate the interpretation algorithm. Interpretation was revealed that links closely with understood mechanisms for Ames mutagenicity. Conclusion: This methodology allows for a greater utilisation of the predictions made by black box models and can expedite further study based on the output for a (quantitative) structure activity model. Additionally the algorithm could be utilised for chemical dataset investigation and knowledge extraction/human SAR development.

Within this method, low cost electrodes were used, including stainless steel, graphite, and Pb/PbO2, and the operating parameters (pH, current density, and operating time) were experimentally optimized. In order to determine sludge stabilization (removal of organic matters and microorganisms), the decrease of parameters like chemical oxygen demand, the increase of electroconductivity and the total dissolved solids, total coli form, and fecal coli form were investigated. Two machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and support vector machines) were applied comparatively for prediction of the process efficiency.

An Empirical Investigation Based on Bayesian Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; MODEL SELECTION; PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; BELIEF NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; INFORMATION; VARIABLES; DISCRETIZATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; ALGORITHMS	The bias-variance dilemma is a well-known and important problem in Machine Learning. It basically relates the generalization capability (goodness of fit) of a learning method to its corresponding complexity. When we have enough data at hand, it is possible to use these data in such a way so as to minimize overfitting (the risk of selecting a complex model that generalizes poorly). Unfortunately, there are many situations where we simply do not have this required amount of data. Thus, we need to find methods capable of efficiently exploiting the available data while avoiding overfitting. Different metrics have been proposed to achieve this goal: the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL), Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), among others. In this paper, we focus on crude MDL and empirically evaluate its performance in selecting models with a good balance between goodness of fit and complexity: the so-called bias-variance dilemma, decomposition or tradeoff. Although the graphical interaction between these dimensions (bias and variance) is ubiquitous in the Machine Learning literature, few works present experimental evidence to recover such interaction. In our experiments, we argue that the resulting graphs allow us to gain insights that are difficult to unveil otherwise: that crude MDL naturally selects balanced models in terms of bias-variance, which not necessarily need be the gold-standard ones. We carry out these experiments using a specific model: a Bayesian network. In spite of these motivating results, we also should not overlook three other components that may significantly affect the final model selection: the search procedure, the noise rate and the sample size.

In our proposal, each of several 'experts' guesses a fixed value. The weighted average of these guesses estimates the RTT, with the weights updated after every RTT measurement based on the difference between the estimated and actual RTT. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed machine-learning algorithm adapts very quickly to changes in the RTT. Our results show a considerable reduction in the number of retransmitted packets and an increase in goodput, especially in more heavily congested scenarios. We corroborate our results through 'live' experiments using an implementation of the proposed algorithm in the Linux kernel. These experiments confirm the higher RTT estimation accuracy of the machine learning approach which yields over 40% improvement when compared against both standard transmission control protocol (TCP) as well as the well known Eifel RTT estimator. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use on-line learning algorithms to predict network performance and, given the promising results reported here, creates the opportunity of applying on-line learning to estimate other important network variables.

For oncogenes specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of "driver" mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and their resulting tumors, a variety of approaches have been developed to identify potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and mutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary structure via a graph theoretical approach. Results: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino acid Clustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial structure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods. Specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in well known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory to account for the tertiary structure, GraphPAC discovers clusters in DPP4, NRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods. The R package is available at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GraphPAC.html. Conclusion: GraphPAC provides an alternative to iPAC and an extension to current methodology when identifying potential activating driver mutations by utilizing a graph theoretic approach when considering protein tertiary structure.

Recently, a weighted ELM is proposed to deal with data with imbalanced class distribution. The key essence of weighted ELM is that each training sample is assigned with an extra weight. Although some empirical weighting schemes were provided, how to determine better sample weights remains an open problem. In this paper, we proposed a Boosting weighted ELM, which embedded weighted ELM seamlessly into a modified AdaBoost framework, to solve the above problem. Intuitively, the distribution weights in AdaBoost framework, which reflect importance of training samples, are input into weighted ELM as training sample weights. Furthermore, AdaBoost is modified in two aspects to be more effective for imbalanced learning: (i) the initial distribution weights are set to be asymmetric so that AdaBoost converges at a faster speed; (ii) the distribution weights are updated separately for different classes to avoid destroying the distribution weights asymmetry. Experimental results on 16 binary datasets and 5 multiclass datasets from KEEL repository show that the proposed method could achieve more balanced results than weighted ELM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, when applied to large datasets, the computational complexities of these methods become a major drawback. With a significantly reduced computational complexity, the Extreme Learning Machines provide an attractive balance between computational time and generalization performance. In the method proposed in this paper, after searching for interfacial residues using a dynamic strategy and extracting spatially neighboring residue profiles for a set of 563 non-redundant protein chains, we implement the interface prediction either on multi-chain sets or on single-chain sets, using the two methods Extreme Learning Machines and support vector machines for a comparable study. As a consequence, in both multi-chain and single-chain cases Extreme Learning Machines tend to obtain higher Recall values than support vector machines, and in the multi-chain case Extreme Learning Machines as well show a remarkable advantage in the computational speed.

To deal with high-dimensional data with noise, ELM with a hierarchical structure (HELM) is proposed in this paper. The proposed HELM consists of two parts: some groups of subnets and a main net. The subnets are based on some well-trained auto-associative neural networks (AANNs), which can reduce dimension and filter out noise. The main net is based on the traditional ELM. Additionally, from the perspective of data attributes spaces (DASs), the difficulties in designing subnets are avoided by using a method of Data Attributes Extension Classification (DAEC). Experiments on five high-dimensional datasets with noise are carried out to examine the HELM model. Experimental results show that HELM has higher accuracy with fewer neurons in the main net than ELM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four classifier models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Least-Squares SVM (LSSVM), the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and the Margin Loss ELM (MLELM) are discussed to demonstrate how specific parametrizations of a general problem statement affect the classifier design and performance, and how ideas from the four different classifiers can be mixed and used together. Furthermore, 21 public domain benchmark datasets are used to experimentally evaluate five performance metrics of each model and corroborate the theoretical analysis. Comparison of classification accuracies under a nested cross-validation evaluation shows that with an exception all four models perform similarly on the evaluated datasets. However, the four classifiers command different amounts of computational resources for both testing and training. These requirements are directly linked to their formulations as different convex optimization problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the restricted likelihood ratio test (ReLRT) are investigated. The relationship between the kernel machine learning and the mixed effects model is discussed. By using the eigenvalue representation of LRT and ReLRT, their exact finite sample distributions are obtained in a simulation manner. Numerical studies are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under the contexts of standard mixed effects model and kernel machine learning. The results have shown that the LRT and ReLRT can control the type I error correctly at the given alpha level. The LRT and ReLRT consistently outperform the SKAT, regardless of the sample size and the proportion of the negative causal rare variants, and suffer from fewer power reductions compared to the SKAT when both positive and negative effects of rare variants are present. The LRT and ReLRT performed under the context of kernel machine learning have slightly higher powers than those performed under the context of standard mixed effects model. We use the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 exome sequencing SNP data as an illustrative example. Some interesting results are observed from the analysis. Finally, we give the discussion.

This paper surveys novel approaches and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology in vehicular ad hoc networks. We review how CR technologies such as dynamic spectrum access, adaptive software-defined radios, and cooperative communications will enhance vehicular communications and, hence, present the potential of transforming vehicle communication in terms of efficiency and safety. Our work is different from existing works in that we provide recent advances and open research directions on applying cognitive radio in vehicular ad hoc networks (CR-VANETs) focusing on architecture, machine learning, cooperation, reprogrammability, and spectrum management as well as QoE optimization for infotainment applications. A taxonomy of recent advances in cognitive radio for vehicular networks is also provided. In addition, several challenges and requirements have been identified. The research on applying CR in vehicular networks is still in its early stage, and there are not many experimental platforms due to their complex setup and requirements. Some related testbeds and research projects are provided at the end.

Identification of biomarkers that distinguish chemical contaminants based on gene expression profiles	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Biomarker; Microarray; Hepatocytes; Chemical; Classification	NF-KAPPA-B; MICROARRAY DATA; IN-VITRO; CLASSIFICATION METHODS; UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CANCER-DIAGNOSIS; TOXICITY; SELECTION; LIVER	Background: High throughput transcriptomics profiles such as those generated using microarrays have been useful in identifying biomarkers for different classification and toxicity prediction purposes. Here, we investigated the use of microarrays to predict chemical toxicants and their possible mechanisms of action. Results: In this study, in vitro cultures of primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to 105 chemicals and vehicle controls, representing 14 compound classes. We comprehensively compared various normalization of gene expression profiles, feature selection and classification algorithms for the classification of these 105 chemicals into14 compound classes. We found that normalization had little effect on the averaged classification accuracy. Two support vector machine (SVM) methods, LibSVM and sequential minimal optimization, had better classification performance than other methods. SVM recursive feature selection (SVM-RFE) had the highest overfitting rate when an independent dataset was used for a prediction. Therefore, we developed a new feature selection algorithm called gradient method that had a relatively high training classification as well as prediction accuracy with the lowest overfitting rate of the methods tested. Analysis of biomarkers that distinguished the 14 classes of compounds identified a group of genes principally involved in cell cycle function that were significantly downregulated by metal and inflammatory compounds, but were induced by anti-microbial, cancer related drugs, pesticides, and PXR mediators. Conclusions: Our results indicate that using microarrays and a supervised machine learning approach to predict chemical toxicants, their potential toxicity and mechanisms of action is practical and efficient. Choosing the right feature and classification algorithms for this multiple category classification and prediction is critical.

The hybrid intelligent system aims to exploit the advantages of the constituent models and, at the same time, alleviate their limitations. It is able to learn incrementally from data samples (owing to Fuzzy Min-Max neural network), explain its predicted outputs (owing to the Classification and Regression Tree), and achieve high classification performances (owing to Random Forest). To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent system, three benchmark medical data sets, viz., Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Pima Indians Diabetes, and Liver Disorders from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning, are used for evaluation. A number of useful performance metrics in medical applications which include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve are computed. The results are analyzed and compared with those from other methods published in the literature. The experimental outcomes positively demonstrate that the hybrid intelligent system is effective in undertaking medical data classification tasks. More importantly, the hybrid intelligent system not only is able to produce good results but also to elucidate its knowledge base with a decision tree. As a result, domain users (i.e., medical practitioners) are able to comprehend the prediction given by the hybrid intelligent system; hence accepting its role as a useful medical decision support tool.

Learning collaborative team behavior from observation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multi-agent system; Machine learning; Learning by observation; Context-based	MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CONTEXT	This paper describes an approach to creating a simulated team of agents through observation of another team performing a collaborative task. Simulated human teamwork can be used for a number of purposes, such as automated teammates for training purposes and realistic opponents in games as well as in military training simulation. Current simulated teamwork representations require that the team member behaviors be manually programmed into the agents, often requiring much time and effort. None of the currently documented techniques for multi-agent learning employ observational learning and a context-aware framework to automatically build agents that replicate the collaborative behaviors observed. Machine learning techniques for learning from observation and learning by demonstration have proven successful at observing the behavior of humans or other software agents and creating a behavior function for a single agent. This technique described here known as COLTS combines current research in teamwork simulation and learning from observation to effectively train a multi-agent system capable of displaying effective team behavior in limited domains. The paper describes the background and the related work by others as well as a detailed description of the learning method. A prototype built to evaluate the developed approach as well as the extensive experimentation conducted is also described. The results indicate success in the selected experiments.

To this end, the various commonly used image fusion (pan-sharpening) techniques are tested. However, traditionally, image fusion quality is assessed by measuring the spectral distortion between the original and the fused MS images. The traditional methods focus on the spectral information at the data level but fail to indicate the image content at the information level, which is more important for specific remote sensing applications. In this context, we propose an information-based approach for assessing the fused image quality by the use of a set of primitive indices which can be calculated automatically without a requirement for training samples or machine learning. Experiments are conducted using ZY-3 PAN and MS images from Wuhan, central China. One of the objectives of the experiments is to investigate the appropriate image fusion strategies for the ZY-3 satellite at both the data and information levels. On the other hand, the experiments also aim to reveal the inadequacy of the traditional image quality indices and the advantages of the proposed information indices for describing image content. It is suggested that an appropriate image quality index should take into account the global and local image features at both the data and information levels.

In contrast with conventional spectral analysis approaches, this letter focuses on one of the machine learning algorithms, namely, the support vector machine, to perform time delay estimation and dielectric constant estimation of the medium from backscattered radar signals. This letter shows the super time resolution capability of such technique to resolve overlapping and fully correlated echoes within the context of thin pavement layer testing.

J	Rahman, A; Smith, DV; Timms, G				Rahman, Ashfaqur; Smith, Daniel V.; Timms, Greg			A Novel Machine Learning Approach Toward Quality Assessment of Sensor Data	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Sensors; quality assessment of sensor data; ensemble classifier; class balancing; time series classification	ANOMALY DETECTION; OUTLIER DETECTION; NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; ENSEMBLE	A novel machine learning approach to assess the quality of sensor data using an ensemble classification framework is presented in this paper. The quality of sensor data is indicated by discrete quality flags that indicate the level of uncertainty associated with a sensor reading. Depending on the domain and the problem under consideration, the level of uncertainty is different and thus unsupervised methods like outlier detection fails to match the expectation. The quality flags are normally assigned by domain experts. Considering the volume of sensor data, manual assignment is a laborious task and subject to human error. Given a representative set of labelled data, a supervised classification approach is thus a feasible alternative. The nature of sensor data, however, poses some challenges to the classification task. Data of dubious quality exists in such data sets with very small frequency leading to the class imbalance problem. We thus adopt a cluster oriented sampling approach to address the imbalance issue. In addition, it is beneficial to train multiple classifiers to improve the overall classification accuracy. We thus produce multiple under-sampled training sets using cluster oriented sampling and train base classifiers on each of them. Decisions produced by the base classifiers are fused into a single decision using majority voting. We have evaluated the proposed ensemble classification framework by assessing the quality of marine sensor data obtained from sensors situated at Sullivans Cove, Hobart, Australia. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework agrees with expert judgement with high accuracy and achieves superior classification performance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

Different from local methods operating on local regions of images, the non-local methods utilize non-local information (even the whole image) to accomplish image denoising. Due to their superior performance, the non-local methods have recently drawn more and more attention in the image denoising community. However, these methods generally do not work well in handling complicated noises with different levels and types. Inspired by the fact in machine learning field that multi-kernel methods are more robust and effective in tackling complex problems than single-kernel ones, we establish a general non-local denoising model based on multi-kernel-induced measures (GNLMKIM for short), which provides us a platform to analyze some existing and design new filters. With the help of GNLMKIM, we reinterpret two well-known non-local filters in the united view and extend them to their novel multi-kernel counterparts. The comprehensive experiments indicate that these novel filters achieve encouraging denoising results in both visual effect and PSNR index. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A framework for selection and fusion of pattern classifiers in multimedia recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Meta-learning; Ensemble of classifiers; Diversity measures	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; KERNEL MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; COLOR; SIMILARITY; ENSEMBLES; FEATURES	The frequent growth of visual data, either by countless monitoring video cameras wherever we go or the popularization of mobile devices that allow each person to create and edit their own images and videos have contributed enormously to the so-called "big-data revolution". This shear amount of visual data gives rise to a Pandora box of new visual classification problems never imagined before. Image and video classification tasks have been inserted in different and complex applications and the use of machine learning-based solutions has become the most popular approach for several applications. Notwithstanding, there is no silver bullet that solves all the problems, i.e., it is not possible to characterize all images of different domains with the same description method nor is it possible to use the same learning method to achieve good results in any kind of application. In this work, we aim at proposing a framework for classifier selection and fusion. Our method seeks to combine image characterization and learning methods by means of a meta-learning approach responsible for assessing which methods contribute more towards the solution of a given problem. The framework uses a strategy of classifier selection which pinpoints the less correlated, yet effective, classifiers through a series of diversity measures analysis. The experiments show that the proposed approach achieves comparable results to well-known algorithms from the literature on four different applications but using less learning and description methods as well as not incurring in the curse of dimensionality and normalization problems common to some fusion techniques. Furthermore, our approach is able to achieve effective classification results using very reduced training sets. The proposed method is also amenable to continuous learning and flexible enough for implementation in highly-parallel architectures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fabian, J; Pires, R; Rocha, A				Fabian, Junior; Pires, Ramon; Rocha, Anderson			Visual words dictionaries and fusion techniques for searching people through textual and visual attributes	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Face search; Attribute classifiers; Rank fusion; Visual dictionaries; Dense-sampling characterization	IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; RETRIEVAL; FEATURES	Using personal traits for searching people is paramount in several application areas and has attracted an ever-growing attention from the scientific community over the past years. Some practical applications in the realm of digital forensics and surveillance include locating a suspect or finding missing people in a public space. In this paper, we aim at assigning describable visual attributes (e.g., white chubby male wearing glasses and with bangs) as labels to images to describe their appearance and performing visual searches without relying on image annotations during testing. For that, we create mid-level image representations for face images based on visual dictionaries linking visual properties in the images to describable attributes. In addition, we take advantage of machine learning techniques for combining different attributes and performing a query. First, we propose three methods for building the visual dictionaries. Method #1 uses a sparse-sampling scheme to obtain low-level features with a clustering algorithm to build the visual dictionaries. Method #2 uses dense-sampling to obtain low-level features and random selection to build the visual dictionaries while Method #3 uses dense-sampling to obtain low-level features followed by a clustering algorithm to build the visual dictionaries. Thereafter, we train 2-class classifiers for the describable visual attributes of interest which assign to each image a decision score used to obtain its ranking. For more complex queries (2+ attributes), we use three state-of-the-art approaches for combining the rankings: (1) product of probabilities, (2) rank aggregation and (3) rank position. To date, we have considered fifteen attribute classifiers and, consequently, their direct counterparts theoretically allowing 2(15) = 32,768 different combined queries (the actual number is smaller since some attributes are contradictory or mutually exclusive). Notwithstanding, the method is easily extensible to include new attributes. Experimental results show that Method #3 greatly improves retrieval precision for some attributes in comparison with other methods in the literature. Finally, for combined attributes, product of probabilities, rank aggregation and rank position yield complementary results for rank fusion and the final decision making suggesting interesting possible combinations for further work.

J	Koestel, J; Jorda, H				Koestel, John; Jorda, Helena			What determines the strength of preferential transport in undisturbed soil under steady-state flow?	GEODERMA			English	Article						Solute transport; Preferential flow; Random forest; Pedotranfer function; Breakthrough curve; Machine learning	NONREACTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT; TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; MISSISSIPPI DELTA SOIL; WATER-FLOW; PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; TRITIUM TRANSPORT; FIELD-SCALE; SANDY SOIL; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES	Preferential flow and transport has to be taken into account to successfully predict solute transport through the vadose zone. The relative 5%-arrival time of inert tracer can serve as a measure for the strength of preferential transport. As direct measurements of solute transport are not practical at large scales, soil susceptibility to preferential flow and transport has to be estimated using proxy variables. In this study we investigated how well the relative 5%-arrival time of inert tracer could be inferred from soil properties, site factors, scale and hydrologic conditions for 442 breakthrough curve experiments on undisturbed soil columns under steady state irrigation. Using a random forest as a global regression tool, we found a coefficient of determination of 0.561 in a ten-fold cross-validation. When predicting relative 5%-arrival times on a completely independent benchmark dataset of 149 experiments we obtained a still reasonable coefficient of determination of 0336. When the soil columns had not been sampled from the same site and soil horizon, the random forest was able to rank the experiments correctly according to their relative 5%-arrival time, apart from one exception. Our study demonstrates that soil susceptibility to preferential flow and transport occurring under steady state initial and boundary conditions is to a large part predictable from proxy variables. We furthermore found evidence that the prediction performance should be considerably increased if information on the water saturation state during the experiment could be included into the random forest. An investigation of the importance of the predictors for estimating the relative 5%-arrival time yielded that the clay content was fundamental. Next important were the ratio between clay content and organic carbon, the lateral observation scale and whether the column had been slowly saturated from the bottom prior to the experiment or not. Flow rate, soil management and bulk density were found useful to further refine the predictions. A caveat has to be given that the investigated dataset includes few experiments on large columns and no experiments under natural transient hydrologic boundary conditions, since such experiments are scarce. Availability of such experiments is crucial to account for additional important preferential flow transport mechanisms caused by hydrophobicity, instabilities at infiltration fronts or funneling at soil horizon boundaries.

Existing machine learning approaches to visual servoing involve system identification of image and kinematic Jacobians. In contrast, the proposed approach actuates a control signal primarily as a function of the error and derivative of the error in the desired visual feature space. This approach leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden as compared to model-based approaches, as well as existing learning approaches to model inverse kinematics. The simplicity of the controller structure will make it attractive in industrial implementations where PD/PID type schemes are in common use. While the initial values of PD gain are learned with the help of model-based controller, an online adaptation scheme has been proposed that is capable of compensating for local uncertainties associated with the system and its environment. Rigorous experiments have been performed to show that visual servoing tasks such as reaching a static target and tracking of a moving target can be achieved using the proposed distributed PD controller. It is shown that the proposed adaptive scheme can dynamically tune the controller parameters during visual servoing, so as to improve its initial performance based on parameters obtained while mimicking the model-based controller. The proposed control scheme is applied and assessed in real-time experiments using an uncalibrated eye-in-hand robotic system with a 7-DOF PowerCube robot manipulator.

Boolean matrix decomposition has frequently been applied to data mining and machine learning. In this paper, three types of existing covering approximation operators are represented by Boolean matrices, and then used in Boolean matrix decomposition. First, we define two characteristic matrices of a covering. Through these Boolean characteristic matrices, three types of existing covering approximation operator are concisely and equivalently represented. Second, these operator representations are applied to Boolean matrix decomposition, which has a close relationship with nonnegative matrix factorization, a popular and efficient technique for machine learning. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a square Boolean matrix to decompose into the Boolean product of another matrix and its transpose. We then develop an algorithm for this Boolean matrix decomposition. Finally, these three covering approximation operators are axiomatized using Boolean matrices. This work presents an interesting viewpoint from which to investigate covering-based rough set theory and its applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Pattern matching techniques require pre-defined dictionaries, and machine learning techniques require an extensive training set. Methods exist in French, but either bring weak results or are not freely available. The objective is to define and evaluate FASDIM, a Fast And Simple De-Identification Method for French medical free-text records. Methods: FASDIM consists in removing all the words that are not present in the authorized word list, and in removing all the numbers except those that match a list of protection patterns. The corresponding lists are incremented in the course of the iterations of the method. For the evaluation, the workload is estimated in the course of records de-identification. The efficiency of the de-identification is assessed by independent medical experts on 508 discharge letters that are randomly selected and de-identified by FASDIM. Finally, the letters are encoded after and before de-identification according to 3 terminologies (ATC, ICD10, CCAM) and the codes are compared. Results: The construction of the list of authorized words is progressive: 12 h for the first 7000 letters, 16 additional hours for 20,000 additional letters. The Recall (proportion of removed Protected Health Information, PHI) is 98.1%, the Precision (proportion of PHI within the removed token) is 79.6% and the F-measure (harmonic mean) is 87.9%. In average 30.6 terminology codes are encoded per letter, and 99.02% of those codes are preserved despite the de-identification. Conclusion: FASDIM gets good results in French and is freely available. It is easy to implement and does not require any predefined dictionary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Towards linking libraries and Wikipedia: automatic subject indexing of library records with Wikipedia concepts	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						text mining; library metadata; subject metadata; metadata generation; Wikipedia; bibliographic records		In this article, we first argue the importance and timely need of linking libraries and Wikipedia for improving the quality of their services to information consumers, as such linkage will enrich the quality of Wikipedia articles and at the same time increase the visibility of library resources which are currently overlooked to a large degree. We then describe the development of an automatic system for subject indexing of library metadata records with Wikipedia concepts as an important step towards library-Wikipedia integration. The proposed system is based on first identifying all Wikipedia concepts occurring in the metadata elements of library records. This is then followed by training and deploying generic machine learning algorithms to automatically select those concepts which most accurately reflect the core subjects of the library materials whose records are being indexed. We have assessed the performance of the developed system using standard information retrieval measures of precision, recall and F-score on a dataset consisting of 100 library metadata records manually indexed with a total of 469 Wikipedia concepts. The evaluation results show that the developed system is capable of achieving an averaged F-score as high as 0.92.

Different from the traditional machine learning method of 'copy learning', the proposed IT2FW-SVM obtains lower energy cost and larger zero moment point (ZMP) stability margin using a novel strategy of 'selective learning', which is similar to human selections based on experience. To handle the uncertainty of the experience, the learning weights in the IT2FW-SVM are deduced using an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS), which is an extension of the previous weighted SVM. Simulation studies show that the existing biped walking which generates the original walking samples is improved remarkably in terms of both energy efficiency and biped dynamic balance using the proposed IT2FW-SVM.

In recent years, a number of methods are proposed for this task, however, there has been little work done on combining multiple predictors. Previous studies on combining multiple predictors rely on non-backtracking based machine learning methods. These studies show minor improvement over single predictors due to the limitation of non-backtracking. This paper discusses work on using machine learning to automatically generate an effective predictors' combination for query performance prediction. This task is referred to as-learning to predict for query performance prediction in the field. In this paper, a learning method, PredGP, is presented to address this task. PredGP employs genetic programming to learn a predictor by combining various pre-retrieval predictors. The proposed method is evaluated using the TREC Chemical Prior-Art Retrieval Task dataset and found to be significantly better than single predictors.

There are various kinds of such cysts with different biological behaviours that carry different patient risks and require different treatment plans. Types of odontogenic cysts can be distinguished by the properties of their epithelial layers in H&E stained samples. Herein we detail a set of image features for automatically distinguishing between four types of odontogenic cyst in digital micrographs and evaluate their effectiveness using two statistical classifiers a support vector machine (SVM) and bagging with logistic regression as the base learner (BLR). Cyst type was correctly predicted from among four classes of odontogenic cysts between 83.8% and 92.3% of the time with an SVM and between 90 +/- 0.92% and 95.4 +/- 1.94% with a BLR. One particular cyst type was associated with the majority of misclassifications. Omission of this cyst type from the data set improved the classification rate for the remaining three cyst types to 96.2% for both SVM and BLR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, finite Dirichlet mixture models have proved to be an effective and flexible model learning technique in several machine learning and data mining applications. In this article, the problem of learning and selecting finite Dirichlet mixture models is addressed using an expectation propagation (EP) inference framework. Within the proposed EP learning method, for finite mixture models, all the involved parameters and the model complexity (i.e. the number of mixture components), can be evaluated simultaneously in a single optimization framework. Extensive simulations using synthetic data along with two challenging real-world applications involving automatic image annotation and human action videos categorization demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve better results than comparable techniques.

A number of machine learning techniques were successfully applied as the learning algorithms for relevance ranking, including neural network, regularized least square, support vector machine and so on. From machine learning point of view, extreme learning machine actually provides a unified framework where the aforementioned algorithms can be considered as special cases. In this paper, pointwise ELM and pairwise ELM are proposed to learn relevance ranking problems for the first time. In particular, ELM type of linear random node is newly proposed together with kernel version of ELM to be linear as well. The famous publicly available dataset collection LETOR is tested to compare ELM-based ranking algorithms with state-of-art linear ranking algorithms.

In this work, we developed a novel integrated score function (SVR_CAF) to discriminate native structures from decoys, as well as to rank near-native structures and select best decoys when native structures are absent. SVR_CAF is a machine learning score, which incorporates the contact energy based score (CE_score), amino acid network based score (AAN_score), and the fast Fourier transform based score (FFT_score). The score function was evaluated with four decoy sets for its discriminative ability and it shows higher overall performance than the state-of-the-art score functions. Proteins 2014; 82:556-564.

The approach uses random projections to alleviate the proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multiclass classification. The result is a multiclass classifier with a single vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the original data into new spaces, while the second method randomly projects the outputs of learned weak classifiers. These methods are not only conceptually simple but also effective and easy to implement. A series of experiments on synthetic, machine learning, and visual recognition data sets demonstrate that our proposed methods could be compared favorably with existing multiclass boosting algorithms in terms of both the convergence rate and classification accuracy.

The proposed ordering algorithm manipulates the presentation order of the training data for each member of a FAM ensemble such that the categories created in each ensemble member are biased toward the vector of the chosen input feature. Diversity is created by varying the training presentation order based on the ascending order of the values from the most uncorrelated input features. Analysis shows that the categories created in two FAMs are compulsively diverse when the chosen input features used to determine the presentation order of the training data are uncorrelated. The proposed ordering algorithm was tested on 10 classification benchmark problems from the University of California, Irvine, machine learning repository and a cervical cancer problem as a case study. The experimental results show that the proposed method can produce a diverse, yet well generalized, FAM ensemble.

J	Luo, JH; Vong, CM; Wong, PK				Luo, Jiahua; Vong, Chi-Man; Wong, Pak-Kin			Sparse Bayesian Extreme Learning Machine for Multi-classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian learning; classification; extreme learning machine (ELM); sparsity	HIDDEN NODES; NETWORKS	Extreme learning machine (ELM) has become a popular topic in machine learning in recent years. ELM is a new kind of single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with an extremely low computational cost. ELM, however, has two evident drawbacks: 1) the output weights solved by Moore-Penrose generalized inverse is a least squares minimization issue, which easily suffers from overfitting and 2) the accuracy of ELM is drastically sensitive to the number of hidden neurons so that a large model is usually generated. This brief presents a sparse Bayesian approach for learning the output weights of ELM in classification. The new model, called Sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM), can resolve these two drawbacks by estimating the marginal likelihood of network outputs and automatically pruning most of the redundant hidden neurons during learning phase, which results in an accurate and compact model. The proposed SBELM is evaluated on wide types of benchmark classification problems, which verifies that the accuracy of SBELM model is relatively insensitive to the number of hidden neurons; and hence a much more compact model is always produced as compared with other state-of-the-art neural network classifiers.

In the Gaussian case, the conditional independencies between different variables correspond to zero entries in the precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Hence, there has been much recent interest in sparse precision matrix estimation in areas such as statistics, machine learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, and signal processing. A popular estimation method involves optimizing a penalized log-likelihood problem. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity and a common choice is the convex l(1) norm. Even though the l(0) penalty is the natural choice guaranteeing maximum sparsity, it has been avoided due to lack of convexity. As a result, in this paper we bridge the gap between these two penalties and propose the non-concave l(q) penalized log-likelihood problem for sparse precision matrix estimation where 0 <= q < 1. A novel algorithm is developed for the optimization and we provide some of its theoretic properties that are useful in sparse linear regression. We illustrate on synthetic and real data, showing reconstruction quality comparisons of sparsity inducing penalties: l(0), l(q) with 0 < q < 1, l(1) and SCAD.

Reliable real-time calculation of heart-rate complexity in critically ill patients using multiple noisy waveform sources	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Signal detection analysis; Electrocardiography; Heart rate; Clinical decision support systems; Machine learning; Automatic data processing	QRS DETECTION; RATE-VARIABILITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS; NEONATAL SEPSIS; TRAUMA PATIENTS; EARLY-DIAGNOSIS; SAMPLE ENTROPY; FUSION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM	Heart-rate complexity (HRC) has been proposed as a new vital sign for critical care medicine. The purpose of this research was to develop a reliable method for determining HRC continuously in real time in critically ill patients using multiple waveform channels that also compensates for noisy and unreliable data. Using simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram (Leads I, II, V) and arterial blood pressure waveforms sampled at 360 Hz from 250 patients (over 375 h of patient data), we evaluated a new data fusion framework for computing HRC in real time. The framework employs two algorithms as well as signal quality indices. HRC was calculated (via the method of sample entropy), and equivalence tests were then performed. Bland-Altman plots and box plots of differences between mean HRC values were also obtained. Finally, HRC differences were analyzed by paired t tests. The gold standard for obtaining true means was manual verification of R waves and subsequent entropy calculations. Equivalence tests between mean HRC values derived from manually verified sequences and those derived from automatically detected peaks showed that the "Fusion" values were the least statistically different from the gold standard. Furthermore, the fusion of waveform sources produced better error density distributions than those derived from individual waveforms. The data fusion framework was shown to provide in real-time a reliable continuously streamed HRC value, derived from multiple waveforms in the presence of noise and artifacts. This approach will be validated and tested for assessment of HRC in critically ill patients.

M. tuberculosis kills approximately two million people each year and is thought to latently infect one-third of the world's population. Proteins of these two strains vary a lot and do share some similar characteristics too. Wet lab experiments usually used to classify the proteins of these strains are highly expensive, labor intensive and time consuming. Thus there arises a need for computational approach for classification of H37Rv and Leprae. These computational approaches are fast and economical as compared to wet lab techniques. Realizing their importance, in this paper an attempt has been made to correlate strains with their physicochemical parameters and predict them with fair accuracy. The new SVM learning algorithm called Sequential Minimal Optimization (or SMO) and LibSVM and Multilayer perceptron has been used for classification of H37Rv and Leprae. The performance of the method was evaluated using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation. The model has been tested on available data using different SVM learning algorithms and a comparative analysis was made which gives results with 77%, 75% and 85% accuracy respectively. Hence the best algorithm for classification is Multilayer Perceptron using 5-fold cross-validation.

It has been shown to be very effective on a variety of data classification problems. However, the strong assumption that all attributes are conditionally independent given the class is often violated in real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed in order to improve the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier by alleviating the attribute independence assumption. However, violation of the independence assumption can increase the expected error. Another alternative is assigning the weights for attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute weighted Naive Bayes classifier by considering weights to the conditional probabilities. An objective function is modeled and taken into account, which is based on the structure of the Naive Bayes classifier and the attribute weights. The optimal weights are determined by a local optimization method using the quasisecant method. In the proposed approach, the Naive Bayes classifier is taken as a starting point. We report the results of numerical experiments on several real-world data sets in binary classification, which show the efficiency of the proposed method.

SVM has shown its excellent learning and generalization ability and has been extensively employed in many areas. This paper presents a performance analysis of six types of SVMs for the diagnosis of the classical Wisconsin breast cancer problem from a statistical point of view. The classification performance of standard SVM (St-SVM) is analyzed and compared with those of the other modified classifiers such as proximal support vector machine (PSVM) classifiers, Lagrangian support vector machines (LSVM), finite Newton method for Lagrangian support vector machine (NSVM), Linear programming support vector machines (LPSVM), and smooth support vector machine (SSVM). The experimental results reveal that these SVM classifiers achieve very fast, simple, and efficient breast cancer diagnosis. The training results indicated that LSVM has the lowest accuracy of 95.6107 %, while St-SVM performed better than other methods for all performance indices (accuracy = 97.71 %) and is closely followed by LPSVM (accuracy = 97.3282). However, in the validation phase, the overall accuracies of LPSVM achieved 97.1429 %, which was superior to LSVM (95.4286 %), SSVM (96.5714 %), PSVM (96 %), NSVM (96.5714 %), and St-SVM (94.86 %). Value of ROC and MCC for LPSVM achieved 0.9938 and 0.9369, respectively, which outperformed other classifiers. The results strongly suggest that LPSVM can aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

In addition, the TSVH successfully avoids matrix inversion compared with the twin support vector machine, which indicates learning algorithms of the SVM can be easily extended to this TSVH. Computational results on several synthetic as well as benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed TSVH is not only faster, but also obtains better generalization.

In African Americans maternal plasma samples IL-1RA, TNF-, angiopoietin 2, TNFRI, IL-5, MIP1, IL-1 and TGF- modeled preterm birth (AUC train: 0.98, AUC test: 0.86). In Caucasians TNFR1, ICAM-1 and IL-1RA contributed to the model (AUC train: 0.84, AUC test: 0.68). African Americans cord plasma samples produced IL-12P70, IL-8 (AUC train: 0.82, AUC test: 0.66). Cord plasma in Caucasians modeled IGFII, PDGFBB, TGF-(1), IL-12P70, and TIMP1 (AUC train: 0.99, AUC test: 0.82). Amniotic fluid in African Americans modeled FasL, TNFRII, RANTES, KGF, IGFI (AUC train: 0.95, AUC test: 0.89) and in Caucasians, TNF-, MCP3, TGF-(3), TNFR1 and angiopoietin 2 (AUC train: 0.94 AUC test: 0.79). ConclusionsMultivariate adaptive regression splines models multiple biomarkers associated with preterm birth and demonstrated racial disparity.

RUBI: rapid proteomic-scale prediction of lysine ubiquitination and factors influencing predictor performance	AMINO ACIDS			English	Article						Ubiquitination; Ubiquitylation; Lysine; Machine learning; Intrinsic disorder	PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS; DRUG DISCOVERY; SITES; PHOSPHORYLATION; DISORDER; IDENTIFICATION; UBIQUITYLATION; SEQUENCES; ACCURATE	Post-translational modification of protein lysines was recently shown to be a common feature of eukaryotic organisms. The ubiquitin modification is regarded as a versatile regulatory mechanism with many important cellular roles. Large-scale datasets are becoming available for H. sapiens ubiquitination. However, using current experimental techniques the vast majority of their sites remain unidentified and in silico tools may offer an alternative. Here, we introduce Rapid UBIquitination (RUBI) a sequence-based ubiquitination predictor designed for rapid application on a genome scale. RUBI was constructed using an iterative approach. At each iteration, important factors which influenced performance and its usability were investigated. The final RUBI model has an AUC of 0.868 on a large cross-validation set and is shown to outperform other available methods on independent sets. Predicted intrinsic disorder is shown to be weakly anti-correlated to ubiquitination for the H. sapiens dataset and improves performance slightly. RUBI predicts the number of ubiquitination sites correctly within three sites for ca. 80 % of the tested proteins. The average potentially ubiquitinated proteome fraction is predicted to be at least 25 % across a variety of model organisms, including several thousand possible H. sapiens proteins awaiting experimental characterization. RUBI can accurately predict ubiquitination on unseen examples and has a signal across different eukaryotic organisms. The factors which influenced the construction of RUBI could also be tested in other post-translational modification predictors. One of the more interesting factors is the influence of intrinsic protein disorder on ubiquitinated lysines where residues with low disorder probability are preferred.

The predictive performance of these models is often reported using a variety of different measures. Most performance measures are not directly comparable. This lack of comparability means that it is often difficult to evaluate the performance of one model against another. Our aim is to present an approach that allows other researchers and practitioners to transform many performance measures back into a confusion matrix. Once performance is expressed in a confusion matrix alternative preferred performance measures can then be derived. Our approach has enabled us to compare the performance of 600 models published in 42 studies. We demonstrate the application of our approach on 8 case studies, and discuss the advantages and implications of doing this.

J	Danziger, Z				Danziger, Zachary			A reductionist approach to the analysis of learning in brain-computer interfaces	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Machine learning; Motor learning; Cyberglove	MACHINE INTERFACES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MOVEMENT SIGNAL; HAND MOVEMENTS; NEURAL-CONTROL; VELOCITY; HUMANS; TETRAPLEGIA; INFORMATION	The complexity and scale of brain-computer interface (BCI) studies limit our ability to investigate how humans learn to use BCI systems. It also limits our capacity to develop adaptive algorithms needed to assist users with their control. Adaptive algorithm development is forced offline and typically uses static data sets. But this is a poor substitute for the online, dynamic environment where algorithms are ultimately deployed and interact with an adapting user. This work evaluates a paradigm that simulates the control problem faced by human subjects when controlling a BCI, but which avoids the many complications associated with full-scale BCI studies. Biological learners can be studied in a reductionist way as they solve BCI-like control problems, and machine learning algorithms can be developed and tested in closed loop with the subjects before being translated to full BCIs. The method is to map 19 joint angles of the hand (representing neural signals) to the position of a 2D cursor which must be piloted to displayed targets (a typical BCI task). An investigation is presented on how closely the joint angle method emulates BCI systems; a novel learning algorithm is evaluated, and a performance difference between genders is discussed.

As an attempt to utilize novel opportunities, we developed a next-generation sequence clustering method focusing on interdependency between genomics and proteomics data. Under the assumption that we can obtain next-generation read sequences and proteomics data of a target species, we mapped the read sequences against protein sequences and found physically adjacent reads based on a machine learning-based read assignment method. We measured the performance of our method by using simulated read sequences and collected protein sequences of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Here, we concentrated on the actual adjacency of the clustered reads in the E. coli genome and found that (i) the proposed method improves the performance of read clustering and (ii) the use of proteomics data does have a potential for enhancing the performance of genome assemblers. These results demonstrate that the integrative approach is effective for the accurate grouping of adjacent reads in a genome, which will result in a better genome assembly.

Each player yields a noisy response to a binary query governed by a certain error probability. First, we propose a sequential policy for constructing questions that queries each player in sequence and refines the posterior of the target location. Second, we consider a joint policy that asks all players questions in parallel at each time instant and characterize the structure of the optimal policy for constructing the sequence of questions. This generalizes the single player probabilistic bisection method for stochastic search problems. Third, we prove an equivalence between the two schemes showing that, despite the fact that the sequential scheme has access to a more refined filtration, the joint scheme performs just as well on average. Fourth, we establish convergence rates of the mean-square error and derive error exponents. Finally, we obtain an extension to the case of unknown error probabilities. This framework provides a mathematical model for incorporating a human in the loop for active machine learning systems.

Finding this optimal submatrix is what renders the problem NP-hard. In this paper, we prove that, if the matrix is positive semidefinite and its rank is constant, then its sparse principal component is polynomially computable. Our proof utilizes the auxiliary unit vector technique that has been recently developed to identify problems that are polynomially solvable. In addition, we use this technique to design an algorithm which, for any sparsity value, computes the sparse principal component with complexity O(ND+1), where N and D are the matrix size and rank, respectively. Our algorithm is fully parallelizable and memory efficient.

The morphological transducer is based on a lexical database specifically constructed for this purpose. In contrast to previous resources, the database is tuned to MSA, eliminating lexical entries no longer attested in contemporary use. The database is built using a corpus of 1,089,111,204 word tokens, a pre-annotation tool, machine learning techniques and knowledge-based pattern matching to automatically acquire lexical knowledge. Our morphological transducer is evaluated and compared to LDC's SAMA(Standard Arabic Morphological Analyser). We also develop a finite-state morphological guesser as part of a methodology for extracting unknown word forms, lemmatizing them, and giving them a priority weight for inclusion in the lexicon.

Machine learning for science and society	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Editorial Material							KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES	The special issue on "Machine Learning for Science and Society" showcases machine learning work with influence on our current and future society. These papers address several key problems such as how we perform repairs on critical infrastructure, how we predict severe weather and aviation turbulence, how we conduct tax audits, whether we can detect privacy breaches in access to healthcare data, and how we link individuals across census data sets for new insights into population changes. In this introduction, we discuss the need for such a special issue within the context of our field and its relationship to the broader world. In the era of "big data," there is a need for machine learning to address important large-scale applied problems, yet it is difficult to find top venues in machine learning where such work is encouraged. We discuss the ramifications of this contradictory situation and encourage further discussion on the best strategy that we as a field may adopt. We also summarize key lessons learned from individual papers in the special issue so that the community as a whole can benefit.

We are developing spatiotemporal machine learning techniques that will enable meteorologists to improve the prediction of these events by improving their understanding of the fundamental causes of the phenomena and by building skillful empirical predictive models. In this paper, we present significant enhancements of our Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Trees that enable autonomous discovery of spatiotemporal relationships as well as learning with arbitrary shapes. We focus our evaluation on two real-world case studies using our technique: predicting tornadoes in Oklahoma and predicting aircraft turbulence in the United States. We also discuss how to evaluate success for a machine learning algorithm in the severe weather domain, which will enable new methods such as ours to transfer from research to operations, provide a set of lessons learned for embedded machine learning applications, and discuss how to field our technique.

This process is inefficient, as each suspicious access has to be reviewed by a security expert, and is purely retrospective, as it occurs after damage may have been incurred. This motivates automated approaches based on machine learning using historical data. Previous attempts at such a system have successfully applied supervised learning models to this end, such as SVMs and logistic regression. While providing benefits over manual auditing, these approaches ignore the identity of the users and patients involved in a record access. Therefore, they cannot exploit the fact that a patient whose record was previously involved in a violation has an increased risk of being involved in a future violation. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering inspired approach to predicting inappropriate accesses. Our solution integrates both explicit and latent features for staff and patients, the latter acting as a personalized "fingerprint" based on historical access patterns. The proposed method, when applied to real EHR access data from two tertiary hospitals and a file-access dataset from Amazon, shows not only significantly improved performance compared to existing methods, but also provides insights as to what indicates an inappropriate access.

Machine learning for targeted display advertising: transfer learning in action	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Transfer learning; Display advertising; Predictive modeling	INDUCTION	This paper presents the design of a fully deployed multistage transfer learning system for targeted display advertising, highlighting the important role of problem formulation and the sampling of data from distributions different from that of the target environment. Notably, the machine learning system itself is deployed and has been in continual use for years for thousands of advertising campaigns-in contrast to the more common case where predictive models are built outside the system, curated, and then deployed. In this domain, acquiring sufficient data for training from the ideal sampling distribution is prohibitively expensive. Instead, data are drawn from surrogate distributions and learning tasks, and then transferred to the target task.

This paper dealt with semantic image classification based on hierarchical Fuzzy Association Rules (FARs) mining in the image database. Intuitively, an association rule is a unique and significant combination of image features and a semantic concept, which determines the degree of correlation between features and concept. The main idea behind this approach is that any image visual concept has some associated features, so that, there are strong correlations between the concepts and their corresponding features. Regardless of the semantic gap, an image concept appears when the corresponding features emerge in an image and vice versa. Specially, this paper's contribution was to propose a novel Fuzzy Association Rule for improving traditional association rules. Moreover, it was concerned with establishing a hierarchical fuzzy rule base in the training phase and setup corresponding fuzzy inference engine in order to classify images in the testing phase. The presented approach was independent from image segmentation and can be applied on multi-label images. Experimental results on a database of 6000 general-purpose images demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

Early specification of CD8(+) T lymphocyte fates during adaptive immunity revealed by single-cell gene-expression analyses	NATURE IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY; NONLYMPHOID TISSUE; MEMORY CELLS; IN-VIVO; EFFECTOR; SUBSETS; BET; DIFFERENTIATION; NAIVE	T lymphocytes responding to microbial infection give rise to effector cells that mediate acute host defense and memory cells that provide long-lived immunity, but the fundamental question of when and how these cells arise remains unresolved. Here we combined single-cell gene-expression analyses with 'machine-learning' approaches to trace the transcriptional 'roadmap' of individual CD8(+) T lymphocytes throughout the course of an immune response in vivo. Gene-expression signatures predictive of eventual fates could be discerned as early as the first T lymphocyte division and may have been influenced by asymmetric partitioning of the receptor for interleukin 2 (IL-2R alpha) during mitosis. Our findings emphasize the importance of single-cell analyses in understanding fate determination and provide new insights into the specification of divergent lymphocyte fates early during an immune response to microbial infection.

As part of a larger effort, we perform automatic classification of steatosis, the cardinal feature of NAFLD, and other regions that manifest as white in images of hematoxylin and eosin stained liver biopsy sections. These regions include macrosteatosis, central veins, portal veins, portal arteries, sinusoids and bile ducts. Digital images of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of 47 liver biopsies from patients with normal liver histology (n = 20) and NAFLD (n = 27) were obtained at 20x magnification. The images were analyzed using supervised machine learning classifiers created from annotations provided by two expert pathologists. The classification algorithm performs with 89% overall accuracy. It identified macrosteatosis, bile ducts, portal veins and sinusoids with high precision and recall (>= 82%). Identification of central veins and portal arteries was less robust but still good. The accuracy of the classifier in identifying macrosteatosis is the best reported. The accurate automated identification of macrosteatosis achieved with this algorithm has useful clinical and research-related applications. The accurate detection of liver microscopic anatomical landmarks may facilitate important subsequent tasks, such as localization of other histological lesions according to liver microscopic anatomy.

As a kind of promising machine learning technique, LS-SVR is employed to approximate the inverse function of the reflection spectrum. The LS-SVR detection model is established from the training samples, and then the Bragg wavelength of each FBG can be directly identified by inputting the measured spectrum into the well-trained model. We also discuss the impact of the sample size and the preprocess of the input spectrum on the performance of the training effectiveness. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective in improving the accuracy for sensor networks with a large number of FBGs.

Multivariate Pattern Analysis of fMRI in Breast Cancer Survivors and Healthy Women	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Machine learning; Executive function; Functional connectivity; Breast cancer; Response inhibition; fMRI	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CHEMOTHERAPY; DISEASE; MEMORY	Advances in breast cancer (BC) treatments have resulted in significantly improved survival rates. However, BC chemotherapy is often associated with several side effects including cognitive dysfunction. We applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to find a brain connectivity pattern that accurately and automatically distinguishes chemotherapy-treated (C+) from non-chemotherapy treated (C-) BC females and healthy female controls (HC). Twenty-seven C+, 29 C-, and 30 HC underwent fMRI during an executive-prefrontal task (Go/Nogo). The pattern of functional connectivity associated with this task discriminated with significant accuracy between C+ and HC groups (72%, p = .006) and between C+ and C- groups (71%, p = .012). However, the accuracy of discrimination between C- and HC was not significant (51%, p = .46). Compared with HC, behavioral performance of the C+ and C- groups during the task was intact. However, the C+ group demonstrated altered functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal and left supplementary motor area networks compared to HC, and in the right middle frontal and left superior frontal gyri networks, compared to C-. Our results provide further evidence that executive function performance may be preserved in some chemotherapy-treated BC survivors through recruitment of additional neural connections.

Psycho-Informatics: Big Data shaping modern psychometrics	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							INTERNET ADDICTION; SLEEP MEDICINE; ACTIGRAPHY; DEPRESSION; SCALE	For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical A beta (extracellular beta-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and A beta accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen.

J	Ayerdi, B; Grana, M				Ayerdi, Borja; Grana, Manuel			Hybrid extreme rotation forest	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Extreme learning machines; Ensembles of classifiers; Rotation forest	LEARNING-MACHINE; HIDDEN NODES; ENSEMBLE; NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ELM; REGRESSION	This paper proposes the Hybrid Extreme Rotation Forest (HERF), an innovative ensemble learning algorithm for classification problems, combining classical Decision Trees with the recently proposed Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) training of Neural Networks. In the HERF algorithm, training of each individual classifier involves two steps: first computing a randomized data rotation transformation of the training data, second, training the individual classifier on the rotated data. The testing data is subjected to the same transformation as the training data, which is specific for each classifier in the ensemble. Experimental design in this paper involves (a) the comparison of factorization approaches to compute the randomized rotation matrix: the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Quartimax, (b) assessing the effect of data normalization and bootstrapping training data selection, (c) all variants of single and combined ELM and decision trees, including Regularized ELM. This experimental design effectively includes other state-of-the-art ensemble approaches in the comparison, such as Voting ELM and Random Forest. We report extensive results over a collection of machine learning benchmark databases. Ranking the cross-validation results per experimental dataset and classifier tested concludes that HERF significantly improves over the other state-of-the-art ensemble classifier. Besides, we find some other results such as that the data rotation with Quartimax improves over PCA, and the relative insensitivity of the approach to regularization which may be attributable to the de facto regularization performed by the ensemble approach.

NeuCube: A spiking neural network architecture for mapping, learning and understanding of spatio-temporal brain data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Spiking neural networks; Spatio-temporal brain data; Pattern recognition; Data mining; EEG; FMRI; Neurogenetic data; Gene regulatory networks; Computational neuro-genetic modeling; Associative memory; Finite automata for spatio-temporal data	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; STATES; MODEL; EEG	The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine. Spatio- and spectra-temporal brain data (STBD) are the most commonly collected data for measuring brain response to external stimuli. An enormous amount of such data has been already collected, including brain structural and functional data under different conditions, molecular and genetic data, in an attempt to make a progress in medicine, health, cognitive science, engineering, education, neuro-economics, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying computational framework to deal with all these types of data in order to better understand this data and the processes that generated it. Standard machine learning techniques only partially succeeded and they were not designed in the first instance to deal with such complex data. Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal with STBD. This paper reviews some methods of spiking neural networks (SNN) and argues that SNN are suitable for the creation of a unifying computational framework for learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG, fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and interaction. One of the reasons is that SNN use the same computational principle that generates STBD, namely spiking information processing. This paper introduces a new SNN architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of concrete models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model is based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of structural and functional areas of interest of the brain related to the modeling STBD. Gene information is included optionally in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRN) if this is relevant to the problem and the data. A NeuCube model learns from STBD and creates connections between clusters of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of neuronal activity. Once learning is applied, a NeuCube model can reproduce these trajectories, even if only part of the input STBD or the stimuli data is presented, thus acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework can be used not only to discover functional pathways from data, but also as a predictive system of brain activities, to predict and possibly, prevent certain events. Analysis of the internal structure of a model after training can reveal important spatio-temporal relationships 'hidden' in the data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a single subject (personalized modeling) or to a population of subjects. The use of NeuCube for classification of STBD is illustrated in a case study problem of EEG data. NeuCube models result in a better accuracy of STBD classification than standard machine learning techniques. They are robust to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD and the brain conditions under which data was collected. Future directions for the use of SNN for STBD are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to cope with these unfamiliar situations, improvements must be made both in sensing technologies and in the capability to autonomously train perception models. In this paper, we explore this problem in the context of tactile surface identification and categorization. Using a highly-discriminant tactile probe based upon large bandwidth, triple axis accelerometer that is sensitive to surface texture and material properties, we demonstrate that unsupervised learning for surface identification with this tactile probe is feasible. To this end, we derived a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on Pitman-Yor processes to model power-law distributions, an extension of our previous work using Dirichlet processes Dallaire et al. (2011). When tested against a large collection of surfaces and without providing the actual number of surfaces, the tactile probe combined with our proposed approach demonstrated near-perfect recognition in many cases and achieved perfect recognition given the right conditions. We consider that our combined improvements demonstrate the feasibility of effective autonomous tactile perception systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cognitive Management of Devices in the Wireless World	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; Cognitive device; Cognitive systems; Device management; Learning; User preferences	LEARNING USER PREFERENCES; RADIO SYSTEMS; NETWORKS; ENVIRONMENT; DISCOVERY; SELECTION; ACCESS	The success of mobile networks has been driven by the services offered, i.e. voice in second generation and multimedia services in third generation networks. Similarly, a key issue for the success of future generation networks is considered to be the provision of enhanced, always available, personalised services. At the same time, the complexity and heterogeneity of the infrastructure of mobile network operators increases as Radio Access Technologies continue to evolve and new ones emerge. All these issues call for self-management and learning capabilities in future generation network systems. Cognitive, reconfigurable systems encompassing self-management and learning capabilities have been devised as a solution in this direction. Cognitive systems determine their behaviour, in a self-managed way. This is done reactively or proactively, based on goals, policies, knowledge and experience obtained through learning. This paper focuses on the user device and presents a Cognitive Device Management System that comprises mechanisms for dynamically selecting the optimal device configuration, taking into account user preferences, device environment characteristics (context), policies, and knowledge established through machine learning functionality.

Comparing the Performance of Statistical Models for Predicting PM10 Concentrations	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Performance evaluation; Multiple linear regression; Quantile regression model; Generalised additive model; Boosted regression trees	MULTIPLE-REGRESSION MODELS; GENERALIZED ADDITIVE-MODELS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; QUANTILE REGRESSION; OZONE CONCENTRATION; AIR-POLLUTION; PM2.5; TREES; TRENDS; METEOROLOGY	The ability to accurately model and predict the ambient concentration of Particulate Matter (PM) is essential for effective air quality management and policies development. Various statistical approaches exist for modelling air pollutant levels. In this paper, several approaches including linear, non-linear, and machine learning methods are evaluated for the prediction of urban PM10 concentrations in the City of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The models employed are Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM), Quantile Regression Model (QRM), Generalised Additive Model (GAM), and Boosted Regression Trees1-way (BRT1) and 2-way (BRT2). Several meteorological parameters and chemical species measured during 2012 are used as covariates in the models. Various statistical metrics, including the Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the fraction of prediction within a Factor of Two (FACT2), correlation coefficient (R), and Index of Agreement (IA) are calculated to compare the predictive performance of the models. Results show that both MLRM and QRM captured the mean PM10 levels. However, QRM topped the other models in capturing the variations in PM10 concentrations. Based on the values of error indices, QRM showed better performance in predicting hourly PM10 concentrations. Superiority over the other models is explained by the ability of QRM to model the contribution of covariates at different quantiles of the modelled variable (here PM10). In this way QRM provides a better approximation procedure compared to the other modelling approaches, which consider a single central tendency response to a set of independent variables. Numerous recent studies have used these modelling approaches, however this is the first study that compares their performance for predicting PM10 concentrations.

J	Ofer, D; Linial, M				Ofer, Dan; Linial, Michal			NeuroPID: a predictor for identifying neuropeptide precursors from metazoan proteomes	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CLEAVAGE SITES; PROTEIN FAMILIES; SIGNAL PEPTIDES; DATABASE; INSECTS; GENOMES; BRAIN; BIOINFORMATICS; CLASSIFICATION	Motivation: The evolution of multicellular organisms is associated with increasing variability of molecules governing behavioral and physiological states. This is often achieved by neuropeptides (NPs) that are produced in neurons from a longer protein, named neuropeptide precursor (NPP). The maturation of NPs occurs through a sequence of proteolytic cleavages. The difficulty in identifying NPPs is a consequence of their diversity and the lack of applicable sequence similarity among the short functionally related NPs. Results: Herein, we describe Neuropeptide Precursor Identifier (NeuroPID), a machine learning scheme that predicts metazoan NPPs. NeuroPID was trained on hundreds of identified NPPs from the UniProtKB database. Some 600 features were extracted from the primary sequences and processed using support vector machines (SVM) and ensemble decision tree classifiers. These features combined biophysical, chemical and informational-statistical properties of NPs and NPPs. Other features were guided by the defining characteristics of the dibasic cleavage sites motif. NeuroPID reached 89-94% accuracy and 90-93% precision in cross-validation blind tests against known NPPs (with an emphasis on Chordata and Arthropoda). NeuroPID also identified NPP-like proteins from extensively studied model organisms as well as from poorly annotated proteomes. We then focused on the most significant sets of features that contribute to the success of the classifiers. We propose that NPPs are attractive targets for investigating and modulating behavior, metabolism and homeostasis and that a rich repertoire of NPs remains to be identified.

J	Milano, M; Lombardi, M				Milano, Michela; Lombardi, Michele			Strategic decision making on complex systems	CONSTRAINTS			English	Article						Combinatorial optimization; Complex systems; Constraint programming; Machine learning; Simulation; Game theory; Hybrid optimization; Large scale problems		In this paper, we propose a challenging research direction for Constraint Programming and optimization techniques in general. We address problems where decisions to be taken affect and are affected by complex systems, which exhibit phenomena emerging from a collection of interacting objects, capable to self organize and to adapt their behaviour according to their history and feedback. Such systems are unfortunately impervious to modeling efforts via state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization techniques. We provide some hints on approaches to connect and integrate decision making and optimization technology with complex systems via machine learning, game theory and mechanism design. In the first case, the aim is to extract modeling components to express the relation between global decisions and observables emerging from the real system, or from an accurate predictive model (e.g. a simulator). In the second case, the idea is to exploit game theory, mechanism design and distributed decision making to drive the process toward realistic equilibrium points avoiding globally optimal, but unrealistic, configurations. We conclude by observing how dealing with the complexity of the considered problems will require to greatly extend the capabilities of state of the art solvers: in this context, we identify some key issues and highlight future research directions.

We believe that constraint reasoning can have a major impact in this field, by providing general and flexible frameworks to model agents' preferences over the alternative decisions, efficient algorithms to compute the best individual and collective decisions, and innovative approaches to deal with missing information. However, in order to do this, we claim that constraint reasoning should increase its efforts to open up to other research areas, such as voting and game theory, multi-agent systems, machine learning, and reasoning under uncertainty.

Despite its important implications on the planning and management of the area, predictive modeling of Phragmites distribution is not well studied. We examined the prevalence and progression of Phragmites in four sites along the Southern Finnish coast in multiple time frames in relation to a number of predictors. We also analyzed patterns of neighborhood effect on the expansion and disappearance of Phragmites in a cellular data model. We developed boosted regression trees models to predict Phragmites occurrences and produce maps of habitat suitability. Various Phragmites spread figures were observed in different areas and time periods, with a minimum annual expansion rate of 1% and a maximum of 8%. The water depth, shore openness, and proximity to river mouths were found influential in Phragmites distribution. The neighborhood configuration partially explained the dynamics of Phragmites colonies. The boosted regression trees method was successfully used to interpolate and extrapolate Phragmites distributions in the study sites highlighting its potential for assessing habitat suitability for Phragmites along the Finnish coast. Our findings are useful for a number of applications. With variables easily available, delineation of areas susceptible for Phragmites colonization allows early management plans to be made. Given the influence of reed beds on the littoral species and ecosystem, these results can be useful for the ecological studies of coastal areas. We provide estimates of habitat suitability and quantification of Phragmites expansion in a form suitable for dynamic modeling, which would be useful for predicting future Phragmites distribution under different scenarios of land cover change and Phragmites spatial configuration.

A gradient boosting approach to the Kaggle load forecasting competition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						Short-term load forecasting; Multi-step forecasting; Additive models; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Kaggle competition	STATISTICAL VIEW; EVIDENCE CONTRARY; REGRESSION	We describe and analyse the approach used by Team TinTin (Souhaib Ben Taieb and Rob J Hyndman) in the Load Forecasting track of the Kaggle Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. The competition involved a hierarchical load forecasting problem for a US utility with 20 geographical zones. The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand. Team TinTin ranked fifth out of 105 participating teams. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among all the dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most popular methods that have been widely used in many classification applications. But LDA can only utilize labeled samples while neglect the unlabeled samples, which are abundant and can be easily obtained in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new dimensionality reduction method by using unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of LDA. The new method first propagates the label information from labeled set to unlabeled set via a label propagation process, where the predicted labels of unlabeled samples, called soft labels, can be obtained. It then incorporates the soft labels into the construction of scatter matrixes to find a transformed matrix for dimensionality reduction. In this way, the proposed method can preserve more discriminative information, which is preferable when solving the classification problem. Extensive simulations are conducted on several datasets and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.(C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, Mingbo; Chow, Tommy W.

Predicting Political Orientation and Measuring Political Homophily in Twitter Using Big Data	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; DIFFERENCE; COMMUNICATION; HETEROGENEITY; POLARIZATION; EXPOSURE; INTERNET; ONLINE	This paper investigates political homophily on Twitter. Using a combination of machine learning and social network analysis we classify users as Democrats or as Republicans based on the political content shared. We then investigate political homophily both in the network of reciprocated and nonreciprocated ties. We find that structures of political homophily differ strongly between Democrats and Republicans. In general, Democrats exhibit higher levels of political homophily. But Republicans who follow official Republican accounts exhibit higher levels of homophily than Democrats. In addition, levels of homophily are higher in the network of reciprocated followers than in the nonreciprocated network. We suggest that research on political homophily on the Internet should take the political culture and practices of users seriously.

J	Di Mauro, N; Taranto, C; Esposito, F				Di Mauro, Nicola; Taranto, Claudio; Esposito, Floriana			Link classification with probabilistic graphs	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Probabilistic graphs; Logistic regression; Stochastic gradient descent; Statistical relational learning; Link classification	NETWORKS	The need to deal with the inherent uncertainty in real-world relational or networked data leads to the proposal of new probabilistic models, such as probabilistic graphs. Every edge in a probabilistic graph is associated with a probability whose value represents the likelihood of its existence, or the strength of the relation between the entities it connects. The aim of this paper is to propose two machine learning techniques for the link classification problem in relational data exploiting the probabilistic graph representation. Both the proposed methods will exploit a language-constrained reachability method to infer the probability of possible hidden relationships that may exists between two nodes in a probabilistic graph. Each hidden relationships between two nodes may be viewed as a feature (or a factor), and its corresponding probability as its weight, while an observed relationship is considered as a positive instance for its corresponding link label. Given a training set of observed links, the first learning approach is to use a propositionalization technique adopting a L2-regularized Logistic Regression to learn a model able to predict unobserved link labels. Since in some cases the edges' probability may be not known in advance or they could not be precisely defined for a classification task, the second xposed approach is to exploit the inference method and to use a mean squared technique to learn the edges' probabilities. Both the proposed methods have been evaluated on real world data sets and the corresponding results proved their validity.

Most of currently available business process engineering and mining techniques either focus on machine learning techniques to mine, discover and model any possible Business Processes from raw data, or use semantically-enabled process models and service descriptions to construct and represent complex Business Processes. However, in real-life scenario, all the required services are not always available and hence exact matching of the services in order to construct Business Process is not possible. In this paper, we present our approach of using fuzzy Web Service discovery to construct and represent Business Processes. It helps in relaxing the matching criteria of Web Services, and allows service consumers to specify business requirements in a more fuzzy way, and hence increases the possibility of finding required Web Services that could construct Business Processes. The paper presents the proposed solution then reports and discusses the evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This approach is based on features extracted from the output of several retinal image processing algorithms, such as image-level (quality assessment, pre-screening, AM/FM), lesion-specific (microaneurysms, exudates) and anatomical (macula, optic disk) components. The actual decision about the presence of the disease is then made by an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. We have tested our approach on the publicly available Messidor database, where 90% sensitivity, 91% specificity and 90% accuracy and 0.989 AUC are achieved in a disease/no-disease setting. These results are highly competitive in this field and suggest that retinal image processing is a valid approach for automatic DR screening. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nilashi, M; bin Ibrahim, O; Ithnin, N				Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh; bin Ibrahim, Othman; Ithnin, Norafida			Multi-criteria collaborative filtering with high accuracy using higher order singular value decomposition and Neuro-Fuzzy system	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Neuro-Fuzzy inference system; Higher order singular value decomposition; Subtractive clustering; Sparsity; Scalability; Multi-criteria collaborative filtering	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; PRODUCTS; ACCESS; LOGIC; NEWS	Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most widely used prediction technique in recommender systems. It makes recommendations based on ratings that users have assigned to items. Most of the current CF recommender systems maintain only single user ratings inside the user-item ratings matrix. Multi-criteria based CF presents a possibility of providing accurate recommendations by considering the user preferences in multi aspects of items. However, in the multi-criteria CF, the user behavior about items' features is frequently subjective, imprecise and vague. These in turn induce uncertainty in reasoning and representation of items' features that exactly cannot be solved using crisp machine learning techniques. In contrast, approaches such as fuzzy methods instead of crisp methods can better solve the issue of uncertainty. In addition, fuzzy methods can predict the users' preference more accurately and even better alleviate the sparsity problem in overall rating by considering user perception about items' features. Apart from this, in the multi-criteria CF, users provide the ratings on different aspects (criteria) of an item in new dimensions; thereby, increasing the scalability problem. Appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques are thus needed to capture the high dimensions all together without reducing them into lower dimensions to reveal the latent associations among the components. This study presents a new model for multi-criteria CF using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combined with subtractive clustering and Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD). HOSVD is used for dimensionality reduction for improving the scalability problem and ANFIS is used for extracting fuzzy rules from the experimental dataset, alleviating the sparsity problems in overall ratings and representing and reasoning the users' behavior on items' features. Experimental results on real-world dataset show that combination of two techniques remarkably improves the predictive accuracy and recommendation quality of multicriteria CF. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce download throughput, an effective strategy on web cache management is needed to exploit web usage information in order to make a decision on evicting the document stored in case of cache saturation. This paper presents a so-called Learning Based Replacement algorithm (LBR), a hybrid approach towards an efficient replacement model for web caching by incorporating a machine learning technique (naive Bayes) into the LRU replacement method to improve prediction of possibility that an existing page will be revised by a succeeding request, from access history in a web log. The learned knowledge includes information on which URL objects in cache should be kept or evicted. The learning-based model is acquired to represent the hidden aspect of user request pattern for predicting the re-reference possibility. By a number of experiments, the LBR gains potential improvement of prediction on revisit probability, hit rate and byte hit rate overtraditional methods; LRU, LFU, and GDSF, respectively.

More specifically, patients are classified according to the nature of inflammatory lesions patterns. It is expected that this characterization can infer new prospective figures from the earliest imaging signs of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), since it can provide a classification of different types of lesions across patients. Methods: The method is based on a two- tiered classification. Initially, the spatio- temporal lesion patterns are classified. The discovered lesion patterns are then used to characterize groups of patients. The patient groups are validated using statistical measures and by correlations at 24- month follow- up with hypointense lesion loads. Results: The methodology identified 3 statistically significantly different clusters of lesion patterns showing p- values smaller than 0.01. Moreover, these patterns defined at baseline correlated with chronic hypointense lesion volumes by follow-up with an R-2 score of 0.90. Conclusions: The proposed methodology is capable of identifying three major different lesion patterns that are heterogeneously present in patients, allowing a patient classification using only two MRI scans. This finding may lead to more accurate prognosis and thus to more suitable treatments at early stage of MS.

The computational principles and neural mechanisms underlying operant learning are a subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations. Theoretical approaches largely rely on concepts and algorithms from reinforcement learning. The dominant view is that organisms maintain a value function, that is, a set of estimates of the cumulative future rewards associated with the different behavioral options. These values are then used to select actions. Learning in this framework results from the update of these values depending on experience of the consequences of past actions. An alternative view questions the applicability of such a computational scheme to many real-life situations. Instead, it posits that organisms exploit the intrinsic variability in their action-selection mechanism(s) to modify their behavior, e.g., via stochastic gradient ascent, without the need of an explicit representation of values. In this review, we compare these two approaches in terms of their computational power and flexibility, their putative neural correlates, and, finally, in terms of their ability to account for behavior as observed in repeated-choice experiments. We discuss the successes and failures of these alternative approaches in explaining the observed patterns of choice behavior. We conclude by identifying some of the important challenges to a comprehensive theory of operant learning.

We address the standard multiarmed bandit problem, the multiarmed bandit problem with transition costs, and the multiarmed bandit problem on graphs. We focus on the case of Gaussian rewards in a setting where the decision maker uses Bayesian inference to estimate the reward values. We model the decision maker's prior knowledge with the Bayesian prior on the mean reward. We develop the upper-credible-limit (UCL) algorithm for the standard multiarmed bandit problem and show that this deterministic algorithm achieves logarithmic cumulative expected regret, which is optimal performance for uninformative priors. We show how good priors and good assumptions on the correlation structure among arms can greatly enhance decision-making performance, even over short time horizons. We extend to the stochastic UCL algorithm and draw several connections to human decision-making behavior. We present empirical data from human experiments and show that human performance is efficiently captured by the stochastic UCL algorithm with appropriate parameters. For the multiarmed bandit problem with transition costs and the multiarmed bandit problem on graphs, we generalize the UCL algorithm to the block UCL algorithm and the graphical block UCL algorithm, respectively. We show that these algorithms also achieve logarithmic cumulative expected regret and require a sublogarithmic expected number of transitions among arms. We further illustrate the performance of these algorithms with numerical examples.

Random Forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning data driven method that is rarely used in water resources studies, and thus has not been evaluated thoroughly in this field, when compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques key advantages of RF include: its non-parametric nature; high predictive accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. This last characteristic can be used to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to a pollutant. In this paper, the performance of the RF regression for predictive modeling of nitrate pollution is explored, based on intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment of the Vega de Granada aquifer. The applicability of this new machine learning technique is demonstrated in an agriculture-dominated area where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can exceed the trigger value of 50 mg/L, at many locations. A comprehensive GIS database of twenty-four parameters related to intrinsic hydrogeologic proprieties, driving forces, remotely sensed variables and physical-chemical variables measured in "situ", were used as inputs to build different predictive models of nitrate pollution. RF measures of importance were also used to define the most significant predictors of nitrate pollution in groundwater, allowing the establishment of the pollution sources (pressures). The potential of RF for generating a vulnerability map to nitrate pollution is assessed considering multiple criteria related to variations in the algorithm parameters and the accuracy of the maps. The performance of the RF is also evaluated in comparison to the logistic regression (LR) method using different efficiency measures to ensure their generalization ability. Prediction results show the ability of RF to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, we present a seizure-detection processor that directly uses compressively-sensed electroencephalograms (EEGs) for embedded signal analysis. In addition to addressing communication, this has two advantages for local computation. First, with compressive sensing, reconstruction costs are typically severe, precluding embedded analysis; directly analyzing the compressed signals circumvents reconstruction costs, enabling embedded analysis within applications. Second, compared to Nyquist-sampled signals, the use of compressed representations reduces the computational energy of signal analysis due to the reduced number of signal samples. We describe an algorithmic formulation as well as a hardware architecture that enables two strong power-management knobs, wherein application-level performance can scale with computational energy. The two knobs are parameterized as follows: 1) xi, which quantifies the amount of data compression, and 2) nu, which determines the approximation error within the proposed compressed-domain processing algorithm. For xi and nu in the range 2-24x, the energy to extract signal features (over 18 channels) is 70.8-1.3 nJ, and the detector's performance for sensitivity, latency, and specificity is 96-91%, 4.7-5.3 sec., and 0.17-0.30 false-alarms/hr., respectively (compared to a baseline performance of 96%, 4.6 sec., and 0.15 false-alarms/hr.).

Active Structured Learning for Cell Tracking: Algorithm, Framework, and Usability	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Active learning; cell tracking; glyph visualization; integer linear programming; machine learning; mitosis detection; structured prediction; tracking features	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY; MULTITARGET TRACKING; CRF MODEL; IMAGES	One distinguishing property of life is its temporal dynamics, and it is hence only natural that time lapse experiments play a crucial role in modern biomedical research areas such as signaling pathways, drug discovery or developmental biology. Such experiments yield a very large number of images that encode complex cellular activities, and reliable automated cell tracking emerges naturally as a prerequisite for further quantitative analysis. However, many existing cell tracking methods are restricted to using only a small number of features to allow for manual tweaking. In this paper, we propose a novel cell tracking approach that embraces a powerful machine learning technique to optimize the tracking parameters based on user annotated tracks. Our approach replaces the tedious parameter tuning with parameter learning and allows for the use of a much richer set of complex tracking features, which in turn affords superior prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we developed an active learning approach for efficient training data retrieval, which reduces the annotation effort to only 17%. In practical terms, our approach allows life science researchers to inject their expertise in a more intuitive and direct manner. This process is further facilitated by using a glyph visualization technique for ground truth annotation and validation. Evaluation and comparison on several publicly available benchmark sequences show significant performance improvement over recently reported approaches. Code and software tools are provided to the public.

J	Chau, DP; Thonnat, M; Bremond, F; Corvee, E				Chau, Duc Phu; Thonnat, Monique; Bremond, Francois; Corvee, Etienne			Online parameter tuning for object tracking algorithms	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						Object tracking; Online parameter tuning; Controller; Self-adaptation; Machine learning	SYSTEMS	Object tracking quality usually depends on video scene conditions (e.g. illumination, density of objects, object occlusion level). In order to overcome this limitation, this article presents a new control approach to adapt the object tracking process to the scene condition variations. More precisely, this approach learns how to tune the tracker parameters to cope with the tracking context variations. The tracking context, or context, of a video sequence is defined as a set of six features: density of mobile objects, their occlusion level, their contrast with regard to the surrounding background, their contrast variance, their 2D area and their 2D area variance. In an offline phase, training video sequences are classified by clustering their contextual features. Each context cluster is then associated to satisfactory tracking parameters. In the online control phase, once a context change is detected, the tracking parameters are tuned using the learned values. The approach has been experimented with three different tracking algorithms and on long, complex video datasets. This article brings two significant contributions: (1) a classification method of video sequences to learn offline tracking parameters and (2) a new method to tune online tracking parameters using tracking context.

Each participant underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) examination that was pre-processed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) using the standard pipeline of voxel-based morphometly (VBM) studies. Subsequently, we applied our multivariate feature selection algorithm, which also included an L-2 norm regularization to account for the clustering nature of MRI data, and a transduction-based refinement to further control overfitting. Our approach proved to be superior to two state-of-the-art feature selection methods (i.e., mass-univariate t-Test selection and recursive feature elimination), since, following the application of transductive refinement, we obtained a lower test error rate of the final classifier. Importantly, the regions identified by our method have been previously reported to be altered in OCD patients in studies using traditional brain morphometry methods. By contrast, the discrimination patterns obtained with the t-Test and the recursive feature elimination approaches extended across fewer brain regions and included fewer voxels per cluster. These findings suggest that the feature selection method presented here provides a more comprehensive characterization of the disorder, thus yielding not only a superior identification of OCD patients on the basis of their brain anatomy, but also a discrimination map that incorporates most of the alterations previously described to be associated with the disorder.

DIRBoost-An algorithm for boosting deformable image registration: Application to lung CT intra-subject registration	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Deformable image registration; Machine learning; Boosting; Pattern recognition	BRAIN	We introduce a boosting algorithm to improve on existing methods for deformable image registration (DIR). The proposed DIRBoost algorithm is inspired by the theory on hypothesis boosting, well known in the field of machine learning. DIRBoost utilizes a method for automatic registration error detection to obtain estimates of local registration quality. All areas detected as erroneously registered are subjected to boosting, i.e. undergo iterative registrations by employing boosting masks on both the fixed and moving image. We validated the DIRBoost algorithm on three different DIR methods (ANTS gSyn, NiftyReg, and DROP) on three independent reference datasets of pulmonary image scan pairs. DIRBoost reduced registration errors significantly and consistently on all reference datasets for each DIR algorithm, yielding an improvement of the registration accuracy by 5-34% depending on the dataset and the registration algorithm employed.

A classification rule reduction algorithm based on significance domains	TOP			English	Article						Classification rules; Reduction; Significance measures		Many rule systems generated from decision trees (like CART, ID3, C4.5, etc.) or from direct counting frequency methods (like Apriori) are usually non-significant or even contradictory. Nevertheless, most papers on this subject demonstrate that important reductions can be made to generate rule sets by searching and removing redundancies and conflicts and simplifying the similarities between them. The objective of this paper is to present an algorithm (RBS: Reduction Based on Significance) for allocating a significance value to each rule in the system so that experts may select the rules that should be considered as preferable and understand the exact degree of correlation between the different rule attributes. Significance is calculated from the antecedent frequency and rule frequency parameters for each rule; if the first one is above the minimal level and rule frequency is in a critical interval, its significance ratio is computed by the algorithm. These critical boundaries are calculated by an incremental method and the rule space is divided according to them. The significance function is defined for these intervals. As with other methods of rule reduction, our approach can also be applied to rule sets generated from decision trees or frequency counting algorithms, in an independent way and after the rule set has been created. Three simulated data sets are used to carry out a computational experiment. Other standard data sets from UCI repository (UCI Machine Learning Repository) and two particular data sets with expert interpretation are used too, in order to obtain a greater consistency. The proposed method offers a more reduced and more easily understandable rule set than the original sets, and highlights the most significant attribute correlations quantifying their influence on consequent attribute.

Prediction of B-cell epitopes is critical for immunological applications. B-cell epitopes are categorized into linear and conformational. The majority of B-cell epitopes are conformational. Several machine learning methods have been proposed to identify conformational B-cell epitopes. However, the quality of these methods is not ideal. One question is whether or not the prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes can be improved by using ensemble methods. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method, which combined 12 support vector machine-based predictors, to predict the conformational B-cell epitopes, using an unbound dataset. AdaBoost and resampling methods are used to deal with an imbalanced labeled dataset. The proposed method achieves AUC of 0.642-0.672 on training dataset with 5-fold cross validation and AUC of 0.579-0.604 on test dataset. We also find some interesting results with the bound and unbound datasets. Epitopes are more accessible than non-epitopes, in bound and unbound datasets. Epitopes are also preferred in beta-turn, in bound and unbound datasets. The flexibility and polarity of epitopes are higher than non-epitopes. In a bound dataset, Asn (N), Glu (E), Gly (G), Lys (K), Ser (S), and Thr (T) are preferred in epitope regions, while Ala (A), Leu (L) and Val (V) are preferred in non-epitope regions. In the unbound dataset, Glu (E) and Lys (K) are preferred in epitope sites, while Leu (L) and Val (V) are preferred in non-epitiopes sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An Extended Result on the Optimal Estimation Under the Minimum Error Entropy Criterion	ENTROPY			English	Article						estimation; minimum error entropy; Renyi entropy; information potential	INFORMATION; MINIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion has been successfully used in fields such as parameter estimation, system identification and the supervised machine learning. There is in general no explicit expression for the optimal MEE estimate unless some constraints on the conditional distribution are imposed. A recent paper has proved that if the conditional density is conditionally symmetric and unimodal (CSUM), then the optimal MEE estimate (with Shannon entropy) equals the conditional median. In this study, we extend this result to the generalized MEE estimation where the optimality criterion is the Renyi entropy or equivalently, the alpha-order information potential (IP).

J	Blanchart, P; Ferecatu, M; Cui, SY; Datcu, M				Blanchart, Pierre; Ferecatu, Marin; Cui, Shiyong; Datcu, Mihai			Pattern Retrieval in Large Image Databases Using Multiscale Coarse-to-Fine Cascaded Active Learning	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Active learning; coarse-to-fine testing; multiple instance learning (MIL); pattern retrieval; support vector machines (SVMs)	RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; FACE DETECTION	Pattern retrieval is a fundamental challenge in machine learning but is often subject to the problem of gathering enough labeled examples of the target pattern, and also to the computational complexity inherent to the training and the evaluation of complex classifier functions on large databases. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical top-down processing scheme for pattern retrieval in high-volume high-resolution optical satellite image repositories. We learn via a multistage active learning process a cascade of classifiers working each at a certain scale on a patch-based representation of images. At each stage of the hierarchy, we seek to eliminate large parts of images considered as nonrelevant, the purpose being to set the focus at the finest scales on more promising and as spatially limited as possible areas. Our scheme is based on the fact that by reducing the size of the analysis window (i.e., the size of the patch), we better capture the properties of the targeted object. The cascaded hierarchy is introduced to compensate for the extra computational burden incurred by diminishing the size of the patch, which causes an explosion of the number of patches to process. Unlike most other retrieval methods, which require large training sets and costly offline training, we propose a cascaded active learning strategy to build a classifier at each level of the hierarchy, and we provide a new Multiple Instance Learning algorithm to propagate automatically the training examples from one level of the hierarchy to the other. Two study cases are performed for validation. The first is a test on a database of 61-cm resolution QuickBird panchromatic images and the second is an example of temporal pattern retrieval from a database of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series. These tests show that our method achieves a reduction in the number of computations of two orders of magnitude, while keeping the same accuracy level as recent state-of-the-art methods.

This paper introduces a new machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) toolbox into the scientific Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator (ARTMO) software package. ARTMO facilitates retrieval of biophysical parameters from remote observations in a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) environment. The MLRA toolbox enables analyzing the predictive power of various MLRAs in a semiautomatic and systematic manner, and applying a selected MLRA to multispectral or hyperspectral imagery for mapping applications. It contains both linear and nonlinear state-of-the-art regression algorithms, in particular linear feature extraction via principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision trees (DTs), neural networks (NNs), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The performance of multiple implemented regression strategies has been evaluated against the SPARC dataset (Barrax, Spain) and simulated Sentinel-2 (8 bands), CHRIS (62 bands) and HyMap (125 bands) observations. In general, nonlinear regression algorithms (NN, KRR, and GPR) outperformed linear techniques (PCR and PLSR) in terms of accuracy, bias, and robustness. Most robust results along gradients of training/validation partitioning and noise variance were obtained by KRR while GPR delivered most accurate estimations. We applied a GPR model to a hyperspectral HyMap flightline to map LCC and LAI. We exploited the associated uncertainty intervals to gain insight in the per-pixel performance of the model.

In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms. The results show that SVR_SRM can generate fine resolution land cover maps with more detailed spatial information and higher accuracy at different spatial scales.

The conventional ToF maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) exhibits a rapid deterioration in the accuracy when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) falls below a certain threshold. This threshold effect emerges mostly due to appearance of outliers associated with the side lobes in the autocorrelation function of a narrowband source signal. In our previous work, we have introduced a bank of unmatched filters and biased ToF estimators derived using these filters. These biased estimators form a feature vector for training a classifier which, subsequently, is used for reducing the bias and the variance parts induced by outliers in the mean-square error (MSE) of the MLE. In this paper, we extend the above method by introducing an adaptive scheme for controlling the number of measurements (pulses) required to achieve a desired accuracy. We show that using the information provided by a classifier, it is possible to achieve the estimation error of the MLE but by using significantly less number of pulses and thus energy on average.

Corrugated tubes are tubes with their inner surface enhanced in these systems. One of the applications of machine learning, named as pattern classification, is often used to separate the human faces, voices, finger prints etc. In this study, it is used to separate the R134a data taken in-tube boiling process in smooth and enhanced tubes automatically. In other words, the developed numerical algorithms enabled artificial intelligence to predict the type of tubes having equivalent diameters used in the experiments. Systematical experiments, including saturation temperatures of 10,15 and 20 degrees C, mass fluxes of 200, 300 and 400 kg m(-2) s(-1) and heat fluxes of 20,25 and 30W m(-2), are carried out for the comparisons using smooth and 5 different types of corrugated tubes having various corrugation depths and helix angles. The boiling process in the test tubes has been measured with 300 data points, having 30 individual parameters (inputs) for varying tube types for the reduction process by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The classification success rates of the methods of Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC), Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Minimum Mahalanobis Distance Classifier (MMDC) by each dimensional reduction and the total area occupying under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are determined according to 3-fold cross validation method. NBC method has the highest classification success with the accuracy of 98.33% as a result of the reduction to 3 dimensions by LDA method. In addition to this, QDC method has the highest area under curve (AUC) with the value of 0.9994 according to the reduction to 3 dimensions by LDA method. Dependency analyses showed that the use of 8 dimensional experimental parameters as the most important input is enough to determine the type of test tubes with a high accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is difficult to determine by experiments, and in silk methods are hence developed as an alternative. In this study, a comprehensive data set containing 12 204 diverse compounds with median lethal dose (LD50) was compiled. These chemicals were classified into four categories, namely categories I, II, III and IV, based on the criterion of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Then several multiclassification models were developed using five machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree (C4.5), random forest (RF), kappa-nearest neighbor (kNN), and naive Bayes (NB) algorithms, along with MACCS and FP4 fingerprints. One-against-one (OAO) and binary tree (BT) strategies were employed for SVM multiclassification. Performances were measured by two external validation sets containing 1678 and 375 chemicals, separately. The overall accuracy of the MACCS-SVMOAO model was 83.0% and 89.9% for external validation sets I and II, respectively, which showed reliable predictive accuracy for each class. In addition, some representative substructures responsible for acute oral toxicity were identified using information gain and substructure frequency analysis methods, which might be very helpful for further study to avoid the toxicity.

As an example, recent years have seen whole-cell phenotypic screens of millions of compounds yielding over 1500 inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). These must be prioritized for testing in the mouse in vivo assay for Mtb infection, a validated model utilized to select compounds for further testing. We demonstrate learning from in vivo active and inactive compounds using machine learning classification models (Bayesian, support vector machines, and recursive partitioning) consisting of 773 compounds. The Bayesian model predicted 8 out of 11 additional in vivo actives not included in the model as an external test set. Curation of 70 years of Mtb data can therefore provide statistically robust computational models to focus resources on in vivo active small molecule antituberculars. This highlights a cost-effective predictor for in vivo testing elsewhere in other diseases.

Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) is used to partition the electron density of a chemical system into atoms, then the machine learning method Kriging is used to build models that relate the multipole moments of the atoms to the positions of their surrounding nuclei. The pilot system serine is used to study both the influence of the level of theory and the set of data generator methods used. The latter consists of: (i) sampling of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), or (ii) normal mode distortion along either (a) Cartesian coordinates, or (b) redundant internal coordinates. Wavefunctions for the sampled geometries were obtained at the HF/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/apc-1, and MP2/cc-pVDZ levels of theory, prior to calculation of the atomic multipole moments by volume integration. The average absolute error (over an independent test set of conformations) in the total atom-atom electrostatic interaction energy of serine, using Kriging models built with the three data generator methods is 11.3 kJ mol(-1) (PDB), 8.2 kJ mol(-1) (Cartesian distortion), and 10.1 kJ mol(-1) (redundant internal distortion) at the HF/6-31G(d, p) level. At the B3LYP/apc-1 level, the respective errors are 7.7 kJ mol(-1), 6.7 kJ mol(-1), and 4.9 kJmol(-1), while at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level they are 6.5 kJ mol(-1), 5.3 kJ mol(-1), and 4.0 kJmol(-1). The ranges of geometries generated by the redundant internal coordinate distortion and by extraction from the PDB are much wider than the range generated by Cartesian distortion. The atomic multipole moment and electrostatic interaction energy predictions for the B3LYP/apc-1 and MP2/cc-pVDZ levels are similar, and both are better than the corresponding predictions at the HF/6-31G(d, p) level.

The method relies on the determination of an effective likelihood for inflation which is a function of the primordial amplitude of the scalar perturbations complemented with the necessary number of the so-called Hubble flow functions to reach the desired accuracy. Starting from any cosmological data set, the effective likelihood is obtained by marginalization over the standard cosmological parameters, here viewed as 'nuisance' from the early Universe point of view. As being low dimensional, basic machine-learning algorithms can be trained to accurately reproduce its multidimensional shape and then be used as a proxy to perform fast Bayesian inference on the inflationary models. The robustness and accuracy of the method are illustrated using the Planck cosmic microwave background data to perform primordial parameter estimation for the large field models of inflation. In particular, marginalized over all possible reheating history, we find the power index of the potential to verify p < 2.3 at 95 per cent of confidence.

The search is based on the peculiar properties of merging galaxies that are found in a mock galaxy catalogue from the Millennium Simulation. MBHBs are expected to be the main gravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is still unclear if the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs, or if it will have the properties of a stochastic background. The goal of this work is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned a probability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that could be detected by PTAs. This constitutes a step forward in the understanding of the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be used to investigate the clustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the observable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities could be used as inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources. We also investigate the distribution of neighbouring galaxies around galaxies hosting MBHBs, finding that the most likely detectable PTA sources are located in dense galaxy environments. Different techniques are used in the search, including Bayesian and machine learning algorithms, with consistent outputs. Our method generates a list of galaxies classified as MBHB hosts, that can be combined with other searches to effectively reduce the number of misclassifications. The spectral coverage of the SDSS reaches less than a fifth of the sky, and the catalogue becomes severely incomplete at large redshifts; however, this technique can be applied in the future to larger catalogues to obtain complete, observationally based information of the expected GW signal detectable by PTAs.

Previous studies have mostly focused on categorical discrimination of patients and matched healthy controls and more recently, on prediction of individual continuous variables such as clinical scores or age. However, these studies are greatly hampered by the large number of predictor variables (voxels) and low observations (subjects) also known as the curse-of-dimensionality or small-n-large-p problem. As a result, feature reduction techniques such as feature subset selection and dimensionality reduction are used to remove redundant predictor variables and experimental noise, a process which mitigates the curse-of-dimensionality and small-n-large-p effects. Feature reduction is an essential step before training a machine learning model to avoid overfitting and therefore improving model prediction accuracy and generalization ability. In this review, we discuss feature reduction techniques used with machine learning in neuroimaging studies.

Moreover, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm based rule extractor is also proposed in this work for improving the detection accuracy. Intelligent fuzzy rules are extracted from the temporal features with Fuzzy Min-Max neural network based classifier, and then PSO rule extractor is used to minimize the number of features in the extracted rules. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed TFMM-PSO system using the UCI Machine Learning Repository Data Set. The results are analysed and compared with other published results. In addition, the detection accuracy is validated by using the ten-fold cross validation.

A class of social networks is those with positive and negative links. In such networks, a positive link indicates friendship (or trust), whereas links with a negative sign correspond to enmity (or distrust). Predicting the sign of the links in these networks is an important issue and has many applications, such as friendship recommendation and identifying malicious nodes in the network. In this manuscript, we proposed a new method for sign prediction in networks with positive and negative links. Our algorithm is based first on clustering the network into a number of clusters and then applying a collaborative filtering algorithm. The clusters are such that the number of intra-cluster negative links and inter-cluster positive links are minimal, that is, the clusters are socially balanced as much as possible (a signed graph is socially balanced if it can be divided into clusters with all positive links inside the clusters and all negative links between them). We then used similarity between the clusters (based on the links between them) in a collaborative filtering algorithm. Our experiments on a number of real datasets showed that the proposed method outperformed previous methods, including those based on social balance and status theories and one based on a machine learning framework (logistic regression in this work).

Attempts to ameliorate this important medical issue have included development of antimicrobial surfaces on materials, no touch surgical procedures, and development of materials with inherent low pathogen attachment. The search for new materials is increasingly being carried out by high throughput methods. Efficient methods for extracting knowledge from these large data sets are essential. Data from a large polymer microarray exposed to three clinical pathogens is used to derive robust and predictive machine-learning models of pathogen attachment. The models can predict pathogen attachment for the polymer library quantitatively.

How such dynamics embody the computations that ultimately lead to behavior remains a mystery. Approaching this issue requires developing plausible hypotheses couched in terms of neural dynamics. A tool ideally suited to aid in this question is the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs straddle the fields of nonlinear dynamical systems and machine learning and have recently seen great advances in both theory and application. I summarize recent theoretical and technological advances and highlight an example of how RNNs helped to explain perplexing high-dimensional neurophysiological data in the prefrontal cortex.

Stylistic clusters and the Syrian/South Syrian tradition of first-millennium BCE Levantine ivory carving: a machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Clustering; Mutual information; Ivory sculpture; Iron Age; Levant; Attribution	STATISTICS; LIKELIHOOD; MODEL	Thousands of first-millennium BCE ivory carvings have been excavated from Neo-Assyrian sites in Mesopotamia (primarily Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Arslan Tash), hundreds of miles from their Levantine production contexts. At present, their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification and regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual approaches with machine learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives on the classification and attribution of this Iron Age corpus. The study sample consists of 162 sculptures of female figures that have been conventionally attributed to three main regional carving traditions: "Phoenician," "North Syrian," and "Syrian/South Syrian". We have developed an algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical classifications, while revealing new insights, especially with regard to the "Syrian/South Syrian" tradition. Specifically, we have determined that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian tradition might be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects. We also reconsider the classification of a subset of "Phoenician" objects, and we confirm Syrian/South Syrian stylistic subgroups, the geographic distribution of which might illuminate Neo-Assyrian acquisition networks. Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual classifications and demonstrates how machine learning techniques may be employed to retrieve complementary information not accessible through an exclusively visual analysis.

Development and evaluation of RapTAT: A machine learning system for concept mapping of phrases from medical narratives	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Bayesian prediction; Machine learning; Systematized nomenclature of medicine	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; CLINICAL TEXT; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; CLASSIFICATION; CONCEPTUALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; NORMALIZATION; RECORDS; TERMS; NEED	Rapid, automated determination of the mapping of free text phrases to pre-defined concepts could assist in the annotation of clinical notes and increase the speed of natural language processing systems. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate a token-order-specific naive Bayes-based machine learning system (RapTAT) to predict associations between phrases and concepts. Performance was assessed using a reference standard generated from 2860 VA discharge summaries containing 567,520 phrases that had been mapped to 12,056 distinct Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) concepts by the MCVS natural language processing system. It was also assessed on the manually annotated, 2010 i2b2 challenge data. Performance was established with regard to precision, recall, and F-measure for each of the concepts within the VA documents using bootstrapping. Within that corpus, concepts identified by MCVS were broadly distributed throughout SNOMED CT, and the token-order-specific language model achieved better performance based on precision, recall, and F-measure (0.95 +/- 0.15, 0.96 +/- 0.16, and 0.95 +/- 0.16, respectively; mean +/- SD) than the bag-of-words based, naive Bayes model (0.64 +/- 0.45, 0.61 +/- 0.46, and 0.60 +/- 0.45, respectively) that has previously been used for concept mapping. Precision, recall, and F-measure on the i2b2 test set were 92.9%, 85.9%, and 89.2% respectively, using the token-order-specific model. RapTAT required just 7.2 ms to map all phrases within a single discharge summary, and mapping rate did not decrease as the number of processed documents increased. The high performance attained by the tool in terms of both accuracy and speed was encouraging, and the mapping rate should be sufficient to support near-real-time, interactive annotation of medical narratives. These results demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly and accurately mapping phrases to a wide range of medical concepts based on a token-order-specific naive Bayes model and machine learning.

Learning Bayesian networks for clinical time series analysis	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Chronic disease management; Bayesian networks; Machine learning; Temporal modelling; Clinical time series; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; BOOTSTRAP METHODS; COPD; MANAGEMENT; EXACERBATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	Introduction: Autonomous chronic disease management requires models that are able to interpret time series data from patients. However, construction of such models by means of machine learning requires the availability of costly health-care data, often resulting in small samples. We analysed data from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with the goal of constructing a model to predict the occurrence of exacerbation events, i.e., episodes of decreased pulmonary health status. Methods: Data from 10 COPD patients, gathered with our home monitoring system, were used for temporal Bayesian network learning, combined with bootstrapping methods for data analysis of small data samples. For comparison a temporal variant of augmented naive Bayes models and a temporal nodes Bayesian network (TNBN) were constructed. The performances of the methods were first tested with synthetic data. Subsequently, different COPD models were compared to each other using an external validation data set. Results: The model learning methods are capable of finding good predictive models for our COPD data. Model averaging over models based on bootstrap replications is able to find a good balance between true and false positive rates on predicting COPD exacerbation events. Temporal naive Bayes offers an alternative that trades some performance for a reduction in computation time and easier interpretation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cai, BH; Jiang, X				Cai, Binghuang; Jiang, Xia			A novel artificial neural network method for biomedical prediction based on matrix pseudo-inversion	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Biomedical prediction and classification; Neural networks; Matrix pseudo-inversion; Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP); Cancer	EXPRESSION DATA; CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; RECURRENCE; REGRESSION; SYSTEM	Biomedical prediction based on clinical and genome-wide data has become increasingly important in disease diagnosis and classification. To solve the prediction problem in an effective manner for the improvement of clinical care, we develop a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method based on Matrix Pseudo-Inversion (MPI) for use in biomedical applications. The MPI-ANN is constructed as a three-layer (i.e., input, hidden, and output layers) feed-forward neural network, and the weights connecting the hidden and output layers are directly determined based on MPI without a lengthy learning iteration. The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method is also presented for comparative purposes. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) simulated data and real breast cancer data are employed to validate the performance of the MPI-ANN method via 5-fold cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed MPI-ANN for disease classification and prediction, in view of the significantly superior accuracy (i.e., the rate of correct predictions), as compared with LASSO. The results based on the real breast cancer data also show that the MPI-ANN has better performance than other machine learning methods (including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and an iterative ANN). In addition, experiments demonstrate that our MPI-ANN could be used for bio-marker selection as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although natural language Processing (NLP) methods have been profoundly studied in electronic medical records (EMR), few studies have explored NLP in extracting information from Chinese clinical narratives. In this study, we report the development and evaluation of extracting tumor-related information from operation notes of hepatic carcinomas which were written in Chinese. Using 86 operation notes manually annotated by physicians as the training set, we explored both rule-based and supervised machine-learning approaches.

Mohamadian			Prediction of roadway accident frequencies: Count regressions versus machine learning models	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Accident frequency prediction; Negative binomial regression; Zero inflated negative binomial regression; Support vector machine; Back-propagation neural network	TRAFFIC FLOW; SAFETY	Prediction of accident frequency based on traffic and roadway characteristics has been a very significant tool in the field of traffic management. The accident frequencies on 185 roadway segments of the city of Mashhad, Iran, for the year 2007, were used to develop accident prediction models. Negative Binomial Regression, Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Regression, Support Vector Machine and Back-Propagation Neural Network models were used to fit the accident data. Both fitting and predicting abilities of the models were evaluated through computing error values. Results show that the NBR model is the most effective model for predicting the number of accidents because of its low prediction and fitting error values. Although the BPNN model has high fitting capability, it does not have the prediction ability of the NBR model. Furthermore, the NBR is easily able to develop and interpret the role of effective variables, in comparison with machine learning models which have a black-box form. Marginal effect values for the NBR and ZINBR models, and sensitivity analysis of the SVM and BPNN models, reveal that Volume to Capacity ratio (V/C), Vehicle-Kilometers Travelled (VKT) and roadway width are the most significant variables. An increase in V/C and roadway width will decrease the number of accidents, however, an increase in VKT and permission to park on the right lane of the roadway can increase the crash frequency.

As a consequence, the monitoring and analysis of DNS queries has recently been proposed as one of the most promising techniques to detect and blacklist domains involved in malicious activities (e.g., phishing, spam, botnets command-and-control, etc.). EXPOSURE is a system we designed to detect such domains in real time, by applying 15 unique features grouped in four categories. We conducted a controlled experiment with a large, real-world dataset consisting of billions of DNS requests. The extremely positive results obtained in the tests convinced us to implement our techniques and deploy it as a free, online service. In this article, we present the EXPOSURE system and describe the results and lessons learned from 17 months of its operation. Over this amount of time, the service detected over 100K malicious domains. The statistics about the time of usage, number of queries, and target IP addresses of each domain are also published on a daily basis on the service Web page.

John			Author Name Disambiguation for PubMed	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ENTITY RESOLUTION; MODEL; SIMILARITY; ARTICLES	Log analysis shows that PubMed users frequently use author names in queries for retrieving scientific literature. However, author name ambiguity may lead to irrelevant retrieval results. To improve the PubMed user experience with author name queries, we designed an author name disambiguation system consisting of similarity estimation and agglomerative clustering. A machine-learning method was employed to score the features for disambiguating a pair of papers with ambiguous names. These features enable the computation of pairwise similarity scores to estimate the probability of a pair of papers belonging to the same author, which drives an agglomerative clustering algorithm regulated by 2 factors: name compatibility and probability level. With transitivity violation correction, high precision author clustering is achieved by focusing on minimizing false-positive pairing. Disambiguation performance is evaluated with manual verification of random samples of pairs from clustering results. When compared with a state-of-the-art system, our evaluation shows that among all the pairs the lumping error rate drops from 10.1% to 2.2% for our system, while the splitting error rises from 1.8% to 7.7%. This results in an overall error rate of 9.9%, compared with 11.9% for the state-of-the-art method. Other evaluations based on gold standard data also show the increase in accuracy of our clustering. We attribute the performance improvement to the machine-learning method driven by a large-scale training set and the clustering algorithm regulated by a name compatibility scheme preferring precision. With integration of the author name disambiguation system into the PubMed search engine, the overall click-through-rate of PubMed users on author name query results improved from 34.9% to 36.9%.

Primary sequences, biochemical properties of the amino acids and 3D structural information of proteins are used to evolve prediction models. The information about the significant residues to govern different biological processes has not been considered yet to develop a prediction model. MAPRes is an efficient tool which has been utilized to mine significant residues and association patterns for surrounding amino acids of some specific modifications on hydroxyl and amino group such as phosphorylation and acetylation. The primary sequences of the proteins and association patterns of surrounding amino acids of modified residues may use to train new dataset for the development of an efficient and reliable prediction model. Biophysical and biochemical properties of the amino acids are also important parameters for the prediction of the modified residues. This study proposes, GEARS (Genetic Evolution of ClAssifers by Learning Residue Rules and Sequences), a classifier rule learning model, which considered different machine learning techniques such as ANNs, HMM and MAPRes were considered for the development of GEARS model. The GEARS, by combining these models, will have the capacity to reduce the false negative and positive predictions.	[Qazi, Wajahat M.; Khan, M.

For this type of application we want to achieve a higher level of confidence than can be achieved through standard software testing. Unfortunately, given the current state of the art, especially when efforts are constrained by the tight deadlines and resource limitations of a flight project, it is not feasible to produce a rigorous formal proof of correctness of even a well-specified stand-alone module such as a file system (much less more tightly coupled or difficult-to-specify modules). This means that we must look for a practical alternative in the area between traditional testing and proof, as we attempt to optimize rigor and coverage. The approaches we describe here are based on testing, model checking, constraint-solving, monitoring, and finite-state machine learning, in addition to static code analysis. The results we have obtained in the domain of file systems are encouraging, and suggest that for more complex properties of programs with complex data structures, it is possibly more beneficial to use constraint solvers to guide and analyze execution (i.e., as in testing, even if performed by a model checking tool) than to translate the program and property into a set of constraints, as in abstraction-based and bounded model checkers. Our experience with non-file-system flight software modules shows that methods even further removed from traditional static formal methods can be assisted by formal approaches, yet readily adopted by test engineers and software developers, even as the key problem shifts from test generation and selection to test evaluation.

Here, we review how video game play may be leveraged for enhancing attentional control, allowing greater cognitive flexibility and learning and in turn new routes to better address developmental disorders.Recent findingsVideo games, initially developed for entertainment, appear to enhance the behavior in domains as varied as perception, attention, task switching, or mental rotation. This surprisingly wide transfer may be mediated by enhanced attentional control, allowing increased signal-to-noise ratio and thus more informed decisions.SummaryThe possibility of enhancing attentional control through targeted interventions, be it computerized training or self-regulation techniques, is now well established. Embedding such training in video game play is appealing, given the astounding amount of time spent by children and adults worldwide with this media. It holds the promise of increasing compliance in patients and motivation in school children, and of enhancing the use of positive impact games. Yet for all the promises, existing research indicates that not all games are created equal: a better understanding of the game play elements that foster attention and learning as well as of the strategies developed by the players is needed. Computational models from machine learning or developmental robotics provide a rich theoretical framework to develop this work further and address its impact on developmental disorders.

This study aims at developing an unsupervised machine learning approach for the accurate identification of major depression based on single resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in the absence of clinical information. Twenty-four medication-naive patients with major depression and 29 demographically similar healthy individuals underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We first clustered the voxels within the perigenual cingulate cortex into two subregions, a subgenual region and a pregenual region, according to their distinct resting-state functional connectivity patterns and showed that a maximum margin clustering-based unsupervised machine learning approach extracted sufficient information from the subgenual cingulate functional connectivity map to differentiate depressed patients from healthy controls with a group-level clustering consistency of 92.5% and an individual-level classification consistency of 92.5%. It was also revealed that the subgenual cingulate functional connectivity network with the highest discriminative power primarily included the ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyri and limbic areas, indicating that these connections may play critical roles in the pathophysiology of major depression. The current study suggests that subgenual cingulate functional connectivity network signatures may provide promising objective biomarkers for the diagnosis of major depression and that maximum margin clustering-based unsupervised machine learning approaches may have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.

Six male, and six female elite competitive races were investigated using half-lap split times. A 2x3x2x2 way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to test for differences in speed and speed SD, across race-quarter, lap-type, and lap-half between successful (top 6 finishers) and unsuccessful groups (7th-12th). Additionally, Spearman's Rho correlations were used to test patterns between speed, speed SD variables and the final finishing position of riders. Pacing patterns of the men's and women's races were complex, but followed an overall positive and variable pacing pattern, with men's race quarter speeds of 52.8km/h (+/- 1.9), 52.1km/h (+/- 2.1), 51.1km/h (+/- 2.2), and 49.5km/h (+/- 5.5). In general, differences in pacing strategy were not found to significantly influence the success of riders unless employed late in the race. Results are discussed for the application and the development of effective elimination race strategies and tactics.

Unraveling the dynamics that scale cross-shore headland relief on rocky coastlines: 1. Model development	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						rocky coasts; wave energy; sea cliff retreat; genetic programming; headland evolution	COHESIVE CLAY COASTS; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIFF EROSION; NEW-ZEALAND; SOUTH ISLAND; KAIKOURA PENINSULA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; PLANVIEW GEOMETRY	We have developed an exploratory model of plan view, millennial-scale headland and bay evolution on rocky coastlines. Cross-shore coastline relief, or amplitude, arises from alongshore differences in sea cliff lithology, where durable, erosion-resistant rocks protrude seaward as headlands and weaker rocks retreat landward as bays. The model is built around two concurrent negative feedbacks that control headland amplitude: (1) wave energy convergence and divergence at headlands and bays, respectively, that increases in intensity as cross-shore amplitude grows and (2) the combined processes of beach sediment production by sea cliff erosion, distribution of sediment to bays by waves, and beach accumulation that buffers sea cliffs from wave attack and limits further sea cliff retreat. Paired with the coastline relief model is a numerical wave transformation model that explores how wave energy is distributed along an embayed coastline. The two models are linked through genetic programming, a machine learning technique that parses wave model results into a tractable input for the coastline model. Using a pool of 4800 wave model simulations, genetic programming yields a function that relates breaking wave power density to cross-shore headland amplitude, offshore wave height, approach angle, and period. The goal of the coastline model is to make simple, but fundamental, scaling arguments on how different variables (such as sea cliff height and composition) affect the equilibrium cross-shore relief of headland and bays. The model's generality highlights the key feedbacks involved in coastline evolution and allows its equations (and model behaviors) to be easily modified by future users.

Machine Learning Helps Identify CHRONO as a Circadian Clock Component	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SLEEP-PHASE SYNDROME; GENE-EXPRESSION; FEEDBACK LOOP; NEGATIVE LIMB; GENOME-WIDE; MOUSE CLOCK; TRANSCRIPTION; MICE; METABOLISM; MECHANISM	Over the last decades, researchers have characterized a set of clock genes that drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. This arduous work has yielded results with far-reaching consequences in metabolic, psychiatric, and neoplastic disorders. Recent attempts to expand our understanding of circadian regulation have moved beyond the mutagenesis screens that identified the first clock components, employing higher throughput genomic and proteomic techniques. In order to further accelerate clock gene discovery, we utilized a computer-assisted approach to identify and prioritize candidate clock components. We used a simple form of probabilistic machine learning to integrate biologically relevant, genome-scale data and ranked genes on their similarity to known clock components. We then used a secondary experimental screen to characterize the top candidates. We found that several physically interact with known clock components in a mammalian two-hybrid screen and modulate in vitro cellular rhythms in an immortalized mouse fibroblast line (NIH 3T3). One candidate, Gene Model 129, interacts with BMAL1 and functionally represses the key driver of molecular rhythms, the BMAL1/CLOCK transcriptional complex. Given these results, we have renamed the gene CHRONO (computationally highlighted repressor of the network oscillator). Bi-molecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrate that CHRONO represses by abrogating the binding of BMAL1 to its transcriptional co-activator CBP. Most importantly, CHRONO knockout mice display a prolonged free-running circadian period similar to, or more drastic than, six other clock components. We conclude that CHRONO is a functional clock component providing a new layer of control on circadian molecular dynamics. Author Summary Daily rhythms are ever-present in the living world, driving the sleep-wake cycle and many other physiological changes. In the last two decades, several labs have identified clock genes that interact to generate underlying molecular oscillations. However, many aspects of circadian molecular physiology remain unexplained. Here, we used a simple machine learning approach to identify new clock genes by searching the genome for candidate genes that share clock-like features such as cycling, broad-based tissue RNA expression, in vitro circadian activity, genetic interactions, and homology across species. Genes were ranked by their similarity to known clock components and the candidates were screened and validated for evidence of clock function in vitro. One candidate, which we renamed CHRONO (Gm129), interacted with the master regulator of the clock, BMAL1, disrupting its transcriptional activity. We found that Chrono knockout mice had prolonged locomotor activity rhythms, getting up progressively later each day.

Machine learning and linear regression models to predict catchment- level base cation weathering rates across the southern Appalachian Mountain region, USA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						base cation weathering; machine learning; sulfur; acid deposition; critical loads; regression	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; CRITICAL LOADS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACIDIC DEPOSITION; SURFACE WATERS; RANDOM FORESTS; ORGANIC-ACIDS; SOIL; CHEMISTRY	Accurate estimates of soil mineral weathering are required for regional critical load (CL) modeling to identify ecosystems at risk of the deleterious effects from acidification. Within a correlative modeling framework, we used modeled catchment-level base cation weathering (BCw) as the response variable to identify key environmental correlates and predict a continuous map of BCw within the southern Appalachian Mountain region. More than 50 initial candidate predictor variables were submitted to a variety of conventional and machine learning regression models. Predictors included aspects of the underlying geology, soils, geomorphology, climate, topographic context, and acidic deposition rates. Low BCw rates were predicted in catchments with low precipitation, siliceous lithology, low soil clay, nitrogen and organic matter contents, and relatively high levels of canopy cover in mixed deciduous and coniferous forest types. Machine learning approaches, particularly random forest modeling, significantly improved model prediction of catchment-level BCw rates over traditional linear regression, with higher model accuracy and lower error rates. Our results confirmed findings from other studies, but also identified several influential climatic predictor variables, interactions, and nonlinearities among the predictors. Results reported here will be used to support regional sulfur critical loads modeling to identify areas impacted by industrially derived atmospheric S inputs. These methods are readily adapted to other regions where accurate CL estimates are required over broad spatial extents to inform policy and management decisions.

The genetic programming routine is coupled to a novel selection algorithm that determines training data from a collected database of published experiments (985 measurements). While varying the training data set size and retaining an invariant validation set we perform multiple iterations of genetic programming to determine the least data needed to train the algorithm. This method retains a maximum quantity of data for testing against published predictors. The machine learning predictor for settling velocity performs better than two common predictors in the literature and indicates that particle settling velocity is a nonlinear function of all the provided independent variables: nominal diameter of the settling particle, kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and submerged specific gravity of the particle.

This large and dynamic availability of digital data is referred to as Big Data and is very promising in bringing forward new insights and knowledge. For obtaining these insights, the proper combination and processing of the data is required. However, the dynamicity and the increasing size of data start making their handling impossible for analysts and raise many concerns on the manner in which data will be processed from now on. Towards this direction, this paper proposes a tool that processes and combines disparate data in order to create insights regarding a future network load. In particular, the tool (based on the unsupervised machine learning technique of Self-Organizing Maps) builds knowledge on the network load that is encountered with respect to the date of interest, the location, the weather, and the features of the day (e. g., weekend, bank holiday, etc.). The obtained results reveal that the tool is capable of learning the traffic pattern and thus predicting the network load that will be encountered in the near or distant future given information for the above presented parameters with small deviations (up to 0.000553 in terms of Mean Square Error). Moreover, the tool maintains only the most representative data instances and thus reduces the data storage requirements with no loss of information.

The need for automated and efficient management of the current networks, more specifically the Next Generation Network (NGN), is the subject addressed in this research. A detailed description of the management challenges in the context of current networks is presented and then this work enlists the desired features and characteristics of an efficient NMS. It then proposes that there is a need to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches for enhancing and automating the functions of NMS. The first contribution of this work is a comprehensive survey of the AI and ML approaches applied to the domain of NM. The second contribution of this work is that it presents the reasoning and evidence to support the choice of Bayesian Networks (BN) as a viable solution for ML-based NMS. The final contribution of this work is that it proposes and implements three novel NM solutions based on the BN approach, namely BN-based Admission Control (BNAC), BN-based Distributed Admission Control (BNDAC) and BN-based Intelligent Traffic Engineering (BNITE), along with the description of algorithms underpinning the proposed framework.

Two critical components of NMA methods are coarse-graining in the level of simplification used to represent protein structures and the choice of potential energy functional form. There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in different choices. In one extreme one finds accurate but slow molecular-dynamics based methods with all-atom representations and detailed atom potentials. On the other extreme, fast elastic network model (ENM) methods with C(-)only representations and simplified potentials that based on geometry alone, thus oblivious to protein sequence. Here we present ENCoM, an Elastic Network Contact Model that employs a potential energy function that includes a pairwise atom-type non-bonded interaction term and thus makes it possible to consider the effect of the specific nature of amino-acids on dynamics within the context of NMA. ENCoM is as fast as existing ENM methods and outperforms such methods in the generation of conformational ensembles. Here we introduce a new application for NMA methods with the use of ENCoM in the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability. While existing methods are based on machine learning or enthalpic considerations, the use of ENCoM, based on vibrational normal modes, is based on entropic considerations. This represents a novel area of application for NMA methods and a novel approach for the prediction of the effect of mutations. We compare ENCoM to a large number of methods in terms of accuracy and self-consistency. We show that the accuracy of ENCoM is comparable to that of the best existing methods. We show that existing methods are biased towards the prediction of destabilizing mutations and that ENCoM is less biased at predicting stabilizing mutations.

Although cancer genome sequencing studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various cancers, identifying the small subset of causative mutations from the large subset of non-causative mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays. Author Summary Cancer progresses by accumulation of mutations in a subset of genes that confer growth advantage. The 518 protein kinase genes encoded in the human genome, collectively called the kinome, represent one of the largest families of oncogenes. Targeted sequencing studies of many different cancers have shown that the mutational landscape comprises both cancer-causing driver mutations and harmless passenger mutations. While the frequent recurrence of some driver mutations in human cancers helps distinguish them from the large number of passenger mutations, a significant challenge is to identify the rare driver mutations that are less frequently observed in patient samples and yet are causative. Here we combine computational and experimental approaches to identify rare cancer-associated mutations in Epidermal Growth Factor receptor kinase (EGFR), a signaling protein frequently mutated in cancers. Specifically, we evaluate a novel multiple-classifier approach and features specific to the protein kinase super-family in distinguishing known cancer-associated mutations from benign mutations. We then apply the multiple classifier to identify and test the functional impact of rare cancer-associated mutations in EGFR. We report, for the first time, that the EGFR mutations T725M and L861R, which are infrequently observed in cancers, constitutively activate EGFR in a manner analogous to the frequently observed driver mutations.

Knowledge-based Fragment Binding Prediction	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							KINASE-C-IOTA; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PROTEIN DATA-BANK; DRUG DISCOVERY; EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE; CATALYTIC DOMAIN; LEAD DISCOVERY; DESIGN; INHIBITORS	Target-based drug discovery must assess many drug-like compounds for potential activity. Focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds (fragments) can dramatically reduce the chemical search space. However, approaches for determining protein-fragment interactions have limitations. Experimental assays are time-consuming, expensive, and not always applicable. At the same time, computational approaches using physics-based methods have limited accuracy. With increasing high-resolution structural data for protein-ligand complexes, there is now an opportunity for data-driven approaches to fragment binding prediction. We present FragFEATURE, a machine learning approach to predict small molecule fragments preferred by a target protein structure. We first create a knowledge base of protein structural environments annotated with the small molecule substructures they bind. These substructures have low-molecular weight and serve as a proxy for fragments. FragFEATURE then compares the structural environments within a target protein to those in the knowledge base to retrieve statistically preferred fragments. It merges information across diverse ligands with shared substructures to generate predictions. Our results demonstrate FragFEATURE's ability to rediscover fragments corresponding to the ligand bound with 74% precision and 82% recall on average. For many protein targets, it identifies high scoring fragments that are substructures of known inhibitors. FragFEATURE thus predicts fragments that can serve as inputs to fragment-based drug design or serve as refinement criteria for creating target-specific compound libraries for experimental or computational screening. Author Summary In drug discovery, the goal is to identify new compounds to alter the behavior of a protein implicated in disease. With the very large number of small molecules to test, researchers have increasingly studied fragments (compounds with a small number of atoms) because there are fewer possibilities to evaluate and they can be used to identify larger compounds. Computational tools can efficiently assess if a fragment will bind a protein target of interest. Given the large number of structures available for protein-small molecule complexes, we present in this study a data-driven computational method for fragment binding prediction called FragFEATURE. FragFEATURE predicts fragments preferred by a protein structure using a knowledge base of all previously observed protein-fragment interactions. Comparison to previous observations enables it to determine if a query structure is likely to bind particular fragments. For numerous protein structures bound to small molecules, FragFEATURE predicted fragments matching the bound entity. For multiple proteins, it also predicted fragments matching drugs known to inhibit the proteins. These fragments can therefore lead us to promising drug-like compounds to study further using computational tools or experimental resources.

A more systematic exploration is needed to gain a thorough systems understanding. We present an active learning approach based on machine learning techniques as iterative surrogate modeling and model-guided experimentation to systematically analyze both common and edge manifestations of complex model runs. Symbolic regression is used for nonlinear response surface modeling with automatic feature selection. First, we illustrate our approach using an individual-based model for influenza vaccination. After optimizing the parameter space, we observe an inverse relationship between vaccination coverage and cumulative attack rate reinforced by herd immunity. Second, we demonstrate the use of surrogate modeling techniques on input-response data from a deterministic dynamic model, which was designed to explore the cost-effectiveness of varicella-zoster virus vaccination. We use symbolic regression to handle high dimensionality and correlated inputs and to identify the most influential variables. Provided insight is used to focus research, reduce dimensionality and decrease decision uncertainty. We conclude that active learning is needed to fully understand complex systems behavior. Surrogate models can be readily explored at no computational expense, and can also be used as emulator to improve rapid policy making in various settings.

J	Wieland, M; Pittore, M				Wieland, Marc; Pittore, Massimiliano			Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Urban Pattern Recognition from Multi-spectral Satellite Images	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						machine learning; data mining; urban remote sensing; object-based image analysis	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; SEGMENTATION; INFORMATION; ACCURACY	In this study, a classification and performance evaluation framework for the recognition of urban patterns in medium (Landsat ETM, TM and MSS) and very high resolution (WorldView-2, Quickbird, Ikonos) multi-spectral satellite images is presented. The study aims at exploring the potential of machine learning algorithms in the context of an object-based image analysis and to thoroughly test the algorithm's performance under varying conditions to optimize their usage for urban pattern recognition tasks. Four classification algorithms, Normal Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Trees and Support Vector Machines, which represent different concepts in machine learning (probabilistic, nearest neighbor, tree-based, function-based), have been selected and implemented on a free and open-source basis. Particular focus is given to assess the generalization ability of machine learning algorithms and the transferability of trained learning machines between different image types and image scenes. Moreover, the influence of the number and choice of training data, the influence of the size and composition of the feature vector and the effect of image segmentation on the classification accuracy is evaluated.

It is, therefore, necessary to monitor these changes in order to understand their impacts and to support management decisions that help ensuring sustainability. Remote sensing has proven to be a valuable tool for these purposes, and especially hyperspectral sensors are expected to provide valuable data for quantitative characterization of land change processes. In this study, simulated EnMAP data were used for mapping shrub cover fractions along a gradient of shrub encroachment, in a study region in southern Portugal. We compared three machine learning regression techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR); Random Forest Regression (RF); and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Additionally, we compared the influence of training sample size on the prediction performance. All techniques showed reasonably good results when trained with large samples, while SVR always outperformed the other algorithms. The best model was applied to produce a fractional shrub cover map for the whole study area. The predicted patterns revealed a gradient of shrub cover between regions affected by special agricultural management schemes for nature protection and areas without land use incentives. Our results highlight the value of EnMAP data in combination with machine learning regression techniques for monitoring gradual land change processes.

SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SIMULATOR PERFORMANCE; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; DROWSINESS; FATIGUE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PREDICTION; ALERTNESS; ACCIDENTS	Brain activity associated with attention sustained on the task of safe driving has received considerable attention recently in many neurophysiological studies. Those investigations have also accurately estimated shifts in drivers' levels of arousal, fatigue, and vigilance, as evidenced by variations in their task performance, by evaluating electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. However, monitoring the neurophysiological activities of automobile drivers poses a major measurement challenge when using a laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. This work presents a novel dry EEG sensor based mobile wireless EEG system (referred to herein as Mindo) to monitor in real time a driver's vigilance status in order to link the fluctuation of driving performance with changes in brain activities. The proposed Mindo system incorporates the use of a wireless and wearable EEG device to record EEG signals from hairy regions of the driver conveniently. Additionally, the proposed system can process EEG recordings and translate them into the vigilance level. The study compares the system performance between different regression models. Moreover, the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for online analysis. A case study involving 15 study participants assigned a 90 min sustained-attention driving task in an immersive virtual driving environment demonstrates the reliability of the proposed system. Consistent with previous studies, power spectral analysis results confirm that the EEG activities correlate well with the variations in vigilance. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the driver's vigilance in real time.

Using the collected data, a longitudinal feature vector was created for each patient's eye by computing the norm 1 difference vector of the data at the baseline and at each follow-up visit. The longitudinal features from each patient's eye were then fed to the machine learning classifier to classify each eye as stable or progressed over time. This study was performed using several machine learning classifiers including Bayesian, Lazy, Meta, and Tree, composing different families. Combinations of structural and functional features were selected and ranked to determine the relative effectiveness of each feature. Finally, the outcomes of the classifiers were assessed by several performance metrics and the effectiveness of structural and functional features were analyzed.

Occupancy Modeling and Prediction for Building Energy Management	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Algorithms; Measurement; Occupancy; HVAC; ventilation; energy savings; demand response; machine learning		Heating, cooling and ventilation accounts for 35% energy usage in the United States. Currently, most modern buildings still condition rooms assuming maximum occupancy rather than actual usage. As a result, rooms are often over-conditioned needlessly. Thus, in order to achieve efficient conditioning, we require knowledge of occupancy. This article shows how real time occupancy data from a wireless sensor network can be used to create occupancy models, which in turn can be integrated into building conditioning system for usage-based demand control conditioning strategies. Using strategies based on sensor network occupancy model predictions, we show that it is possible to achieve 42% annual energy savings while still maintaining American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) comfort standards.

Temporal Adaptive Link Quality Prediction with Online Learning	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Link quality estimation; link quality prediction	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	Link quality estimation is a fundamental component of the low-power wireless network protocols and is essential for routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task due to the notoriously dynamic and unpredictable wireless environment. In this article we argue that, in addition to the estimation of current link quality, prediction of the future link quality is more important for the routing protocol to establish low-cost delivery paths. We propose to apply machine learning methods to predict the link quality in the near future to facilitate the utilization of intermediate links with frequent quality changes. Moreover, we show that, by using online learning methods, our adaptive link estimator (TALENT) adapts to network dynamics better than statically trained models without the need of a priori data collection for training the model before deployment. We implemented TALENT in TinyOS with Low-Power Listening (LPL) and conducted extensive experiments in three testbeds. Our experimental results show that the addition of TALENT increases the delivery efficiency 1.95 times on average compared with a 4B, state-of-the-art link quality estimator, as well as improves the end-to-end delivery rate when tested on three different wireless testbeds.

Consequently, the first step in a good retinal image analysis system is measuring the quality of the input image. We present an approach for finding medically suitable retinal images for retinal diagnosis. We used a three-class grading system that consists of good, bad, and outlier classes. We created a retinal image quality dataset with a total of 216 consecutive images called the Diabetic Retinopathy Image Database. We identified the suitable images within the good images for automatic retinal image analysis systems using a novel method. Subsequently, we evaluated our retinal image suitability approach using the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction and Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database Calibration level 1 public datasets. The results were measured through the F1 metric, which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall metrics. The highest F1 scores of the IQA tests were 99.60%, 96.50%, and 85.00% for good, bad, and outlier classes, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of our suitable image detection approach was 98.08%. Our approach can be integrated into any automatic retinal analysis system with sufficient performance scores.

MHC binding prediction is an active research area. Reliable predictors are demanded to identify potential vaccine candidates. The recent kernel-based algorithm KernelRLSpan (Shen et al., 2013) shows promising power on MHC II binding prediction. Here, KernelRLSpan is modified and applied to MHC I binding prediction, which we refer to as KernelRLSpanl. Besides this, we develop a novel consensus method to predict naturally processed peptides through integrating KernelRLSpanl with two state-of-the-art predictors NetMHCpan and NetMHC. The consensus method achieved top performance in the Machine Learning in Immunology (MLI) 2012 Competition,(3) group 2. We also introduce our progress of improving our MHC II binding prediction method KernelRLSpan by diffusion map. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its focus is on problems where the smooth geometry of the search space can be leveraged to design efficient numerical algorithms. In particular, optimization on manifolds is well-suited to deal with rank and orthogonality constraints. Such structured constraints appear pervasively in machine learning applications, including low-rank matrix completion, sensor network localization, camera network registration, independent component analysis, metric learning, dimensionality reduction and so on. The Manopt toolbox, available at www.manopt.org, is a user-friendly, documented piece of software dedicated to simplify experimenting with state of the art Riemannian optimization algorithms. By dealing internally with most of the differential geometry, the package aims particularly at lowering the entrance barrier.

Previous research has highlighted the relationship between gesture and learning during instruction. In the current study we applied readily available computer vision hardware and machine learning algorithms to the gestures of teacher/student dyads (N = 106) during a learning session to automatically distinguish between high and low success learning interactions, operationalized by recall for information presented during that learning session. Models predicted learning performance of the dyad with accuracies as high as 85.7 percent when tested on dyads not included in the training set. In addition, correlations were found between summed measures of body movement and learning score. We discuss theoretical and applied implications for learning.

The affect recognition is never perfect, and its accuracy (percentage of times the correct affective state is recognized) depends on many factors. However, it is unclear how this accuracy relates to the overall user experience. As recognition accuracy is difficult to control in a real affective feedback loop, we describe a method of simulating recognition accuracy in a game where difficulty is increased or decreased after each round. The game was played by 261 participants at different simulated recognition accuracies. Participants reported their satisfaction with the recognition algorithm as well as their overall game experience. We observed that in such a game, the affective feedback loop must adapt game difficulty with an accuracy of at least 80 percent to be accepted by users. Furthermore, users who do not enjoy the game are likely to stop playing it rather than continue playing and report low enjoyment. However, the acceptable recognition accuracy may not generalize to other contexts, and studies of affect recognition accuracies in other applications are needed.

The package is for variable importance analysis, and is meant primarily for analyzing data from exploratory epidemiological studies, though it could certainly be applied in other areas as well. The approach taken to variable importance comes from the causal inference field, and is different from approaches taken in other R packages. By default, multiPIM uses a double robust targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) of a parameter akin to the attributable risk. Several regression methods/machine learning algorithms are available for estimating the nuisance parameters of the models, including super learner, a meta-learner which combines several different algorithms into one. We describe a simulation in which the double robust TMLE is compared to the graphical computation estimator. We also provide example analyses using two data sets which are included with the package.

The sample-based SMI approxirnator called least-squares mutual information (LSMI) was demonstrated to be useful in performing various machine learning tasks such as dimension reduction, clustering, and causal inference. The original LSMI approximates the pointwise mutual information by using the kernel model, which is a linear combination of kernel basis functions located on paired data samples. Although LSMI was proved to achieve the optimal approximation accuracy asymptotically, its approximation capability is limited when the sample size is small due to an insufficient number of kernel basis functions. Increasing the number of kernel basis functions can mitigate this weakness, but a naive implementation of this idea significantly increases the computation costs. In this article, we show that the computational complexity of LSMI with the multiplicative kernel model, which locates kernel basis functions on unpaired data samples and thus the number of kernel basis functions is the sample size squared, is the same as that for the plain kernel model. We experimentally demonstrate that LSMI with the multiplicative kernel model is more accurate than that with plain kernel models in small sample cases, with only mild increase in computation time.

K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) is a simple and effective classification model in the traditional supervised learning. As its two variants, Bayesian-KNN (BKNN) and Citation-KNN (CKNN) are proposed and are widely used for solving multi-instance classification problems. However, CKNN still applies the simplest majority vote approach among the references and citers to classify unseen bags. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm called Bayesian Citation-KNN (BCKNN). For each unseen bag, BCKNN firstly finds its k references and q citers respectively, and then a Bayesian approach is applied to its k references and a distance weighted majority vote approach is applied to its q citers. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our BCKNN is generally better than previous BKNN and CKNN. Besides, BCKNN almost maintains the same order of computational overhead as CKNN.

Our goal is to predict the quality of phylogeny reconstruction basing on features that can be extracted from the input alignment. We used Fitch-Margoliash (FM) method of phylogeny reconstruction and random forest as a predictor. For training and testing the predictor, alignments of orthologous series (OS) were used, for which the result of phylogeny reconstruction can be evaluated by comparison with trees of corresponding organisms. Our results show that the quality of phylogeny reconstruction can be predicted with more than 80% precision. Also, we tried to predict which phylogeny reconstruction method, FM or UPGMA, is better for a particular alignment. With the used set of features, among alignments for which the obtained predictor predicts a better performance of UPGMA, 56% really give a better result with UPGMA. Taking into account that in our testing set only for 34% alignments UPGMA performs better, this result shows a principal possibility to predict the better phylogeny reconstruction method basing on features of a sequence alignment.

In parallel, the incidence of conditions that affect mobility and independence is also rising as a consequence of a longer life expectancy. In this paper, the specific problem of falls of old adults is addressed by devising a technological solution for monitoring these users. Video cameras, accelerometers and GPS sensors are combined in a multi-modal approach to monitor humans inside and outside the domestic environment. Machine learning techniques are used to detect falls and classify activities from accelerometer data. Video feeds and GPS are used to provide location inside and outside the domestic environment. It results in a monitoring solution that does not imply the confinement of the users to a closed environment.

J	Chaves, R; Luft, L; Gross, D				Chaves, Rafael; Luft, Lukas; Gross, David			Causal structures from entropic information: geometry and novel scenarios	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						non-locality; marginal scenarios; causal structures; entropic inequalities	BELL INEQUALITIES; QUANTUM; ENTANGLEMENT; STATES	Bell's theorem in physics, as well as causal discovery in machine learning, both face the problem of deciding whether observed data is compatible with a presumed causal relationship between the variables (for example, a local hidden variable model). Traditionally, Bell inequalities have been used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal distributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on the accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on the observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this paper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding the set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first time, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple observables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit inequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as well as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties. Many of our results are based on a geometric observation: Bell polytopes for two-outcome measurements can be naturally imbedded into the convex cone of attainable marginal entropies. Thus, any entropic inequality can be translated into one valid for probabilities. In some situations the converse also holds, which provides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities.

The functional transformation from high-dimensional stimulus space to the binary space of spike and non-spike responses is commonly described with linear-nonlinear models, whose linear filter component describes the neuron's receptive field. From a machine learning perspective, this corresponds to the binary classification problem of discriminating spike-eliciting from non-spike-eliciting stimulus examples. The classification-based receptive field (CbRF) estimation method proposed here adapts a linear large-margin classifier to optimally predict experimental stimulus-response data and subsequently interprets learned classifier weights as the neuron's receptive field filter. Computational learning theory provides a theoretical framework for learning from data and guarantees optimality in the sense that the risk of erroneously assigning a spike-eliciting stimulus example to the non-spike class (and vice versa) is minimized. Efficacy of the CbRF method is validated with simulations and for auditory spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF) estimation from experimental recordings in the auditory midbrain of Mongolian gerbils. Acoustic stimulation is performed with frequency-modulated tone complexes that mimic properties of natural stimuli, specifically non-Gaussian amplitude distribution and higher-order correlations. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully identifies correct underlying STRFs, even in cases where second-order methods based on the spike-triggered average (STA) do not. Applied to small data samples, the method is shown to converge on smaller amounts of experimental recordings and with lower estimation variance than the generalized linear model and recent information theoretic methods. Thus, CbRF estimation may prove useful for investigation of neuronal processes in response to natural stimuli and in settings where rapid adaptation is induced by experimental design.

Yet, their use by clinicians is limited by the complexity of available tools and amount of data required. We propose to use Disjunctive Normal Forms as a novel approach to predict hospital and 90-day mortality from instance-based patient data, comprising demographic, genetic, and physiologic information in a large cohort of patients admitted with severe community acquired pneumonia. We develop two algorithms to efficiently learn Disjunctive Normal Forms, which yield easy-to-interpret rules that explicitly map data to the outcome of interest. Disjunctive Normal Forms achieve higher prediction performance quality compared to a set of state-of-the-art machine learning models, and unveils insights unavailable with standard methods. Disjunctive Normal Forms constitute an intuitive set of prediction rules that could be easily implemented to predict outcomes and guide criteria-based clinical decision making and clinical trial execution, and thus of greater practical usefulness than currently available prediction tools. The Java implementation of the tool JavaDNF will be publicly available.

Aims To assess the usefulness of ALS as a tool for predicting species richness and single-species presence, and to investigate if including information from multispectral aerial images further improved predictability of bird presence. Methods Bird presence data were sampled in a Norwegian boreal forest reserve. Prediction models were developed for species richness and presence of the eight most abundant species by the use of two different modelling approaches: generalized linear models and the machine learning method random forest. Predictor variables were descriptors of three-dimensional forest structure obtained by ALS, and descriptors of tree species composition obtained from multispectral aerial images. Results Cross-validation of the prediction models indicated overall slight or fair predictive capability. Best predictions were obtained for Goldcrest, Wren, and Willow Warbler. Inclusion of spectral variables derived from the aerial imagery slightly improved the predictive performance of several models, most notably for Willow Warbler. Conclusion We suggest that predictability of species richness and presence of single bird species can be improved by better matching of the scale of recording for birds and the predictor variables obtained by remote sensing.

These censored production rules are created by augmenting ordinary production rules with rare or particular conditions employing unless operator or provided operator, respectively. Systems which use censored production rules are free to ignore the censor conditions when the resources are limited. Censor conditions can be examined later leading to more specific and accurate rules if the time permits or resources are at hand. Integration of the RS theory with censored production rules allows for handling of vague and imprecise information in a limited resource environment. The proposed algorithm generates a separate list of rules for the lower and upper approximation of the concept. The rule belonging to lower approximation is a certain rule, and the rule belonging to upper approximation is a possible rule, which can be further investigated using the censor conditions. We extend the basic notion of production rules using the censor condition with provided operator to find out the certain rules in the given data-set. We have investigated our algorithm on the benchmark data-sets from the UCI machine learning repository, which have shown promising results.

Curated MicroRNAs in Urine and Blood Fail to Validate as Predictive Biomarkers for High-Risk Prostate Cancer	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CIRCULATING MICRORNAS; ANTIGEN; EXPRESSION; GENE; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; PROGRESSION; SERUM; FLUID; PCR	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if microRNA profiling of urine and plasma at radical prostatectomy can distinguish potentially lethal from indolent prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: A panel of microRNAs was profiled in the plasma of 70 patients and the urine of 33 patients collected prior to radical prostatectomy. Expression of microRNAs was correlated to the clinical endpoints at a follow-up time of 3.9 years to identify microRNAs that may predict clinical response after radical prostatectomy. A machine learning approach was applied to test the predictive ability of all microRNAs profiled in urine, plasma, and a combination of both, and global performance assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Validation of urinary expression of miRNAs was performed on a further independent cohort of 36 patients. Results: The best predictor in plasma using eight miRs yielded only moderate predictive performance (AUC = 0.62). The best predictor of high-risk disease was achieved using miR-16, miR-21 and miR-222 measured in urine (AUC = 0.75). This combination of three microRNAs in urine was a better predictor of high-risk disease than any individual microRNA. Using a different methodology we found that this set of miRNAs was unable to predict high-volume, high-grade disease. Conclusions: Our initial findings suggested that plasma and urinary profiling of microRNAs at radical prostatectomy may allow prognostication of prostate cancer behaviour. However we found that the microRNA expression signature failed to validate in an independent cohort of patients using a different platform for PCR. This highlights the need for independent validation patient cohorts and suggests that urinary microRNA signatures at radical prostatectomy may not be a robust way to predict the course of clinical disease after definitive treatment for prostate cancer.

Graph-based active learning of agglomeration (GALA): a Python library to segment 2D and 3D neuroimages	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						connectomics; Python; electron microscopy; image segmentation; machine learning	RECONSTRUCTION; CONNECTOMICS	The aim in high-resolution connectomics is to reconstruct complete neuronal connectivity in a tissue. Currently, the only technology capable of resolving the smallest neuronal processes is electron microscopy (EM). Thus, a common approach to network reconstruction is to perform (error-prone) automatic segmentation of EM images, followed by manual proofreading by experts to fix errors. We have developed an algorithm and software library to not only improve the accuracy of the initial automatic segmentation, but also point out the image coordinates where it is likely to have made errors. Our software, called gala (graph-based active learning of agglomeration), improves the state of the art in agglomerative image segmentation. It is implemented in Python and makes extensive use of the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy, networkx, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and others). We present here the software architecture of the gala library, and discuss several designs that we consider would be generally useful for other segmentation packages. We also discuss the current limitations of the gala library and how we intend to address them.

Nathan			Classification of birefringence in mode-locked fiber lasers using machine learning and sparse representation	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							OPTICAL-FIBERS; TRANSMISSION FILTERS; PULSE-PROPAGATION; DISPERSION; LOCKING; ENERGY	It has been observed that changes in the birefringence, which are difficult or impossible to directly measure, can significantly affect mode-locking in a fiber laser. In this work we develop techniques to estimate the effective birefringence by comparing a test measurement of a given objective function against a learned library. In particular, a toroidal search algorithm is applied to the laser cavity for various birefringence values by varying the waveplate and polarizer angles at incommensurate angular frequencies, thus producing a time-series of the objective function. The resulting time series, which is converted to a spectrogram and then dimensionally reduced with a singular value decomposition, is then labelled with the corresponding effective birefringence and concatenated into a library of modes. A sparse search algorithm (L-1-norm optimization) is then applied to a test measurement in order to classify the birefringence of the fiber laser. Simulations show that the sparse search algorithm performs very well in recognizing cavity birefringence even in the presence of noise and/or noisy measurements. Once classified, the wave plates and polarizers can be adjusted using servo-control motors to the optimal positions obtained from the toroidal search. The result is an efficient, self-tuning laser.

Neural decoding of expressive human movement from scalp electroencephalography (EEG)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; neural classification; mobile neuroimaging; neural decoding; dance; Laban Movement Analysis	TREADMILL WALKING; SIGNALS; DANCE; BODY; INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS; MOTION; BRAIN; SPACE; TIME	Although efforts to characterize human movement through electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed neural activities unique to limb control that can be used to infer movement kinematics, it is still unknown the extent to which EEG can be used to discern the expressive qualities that influence such movements. In this study we used EEG and inertial sensors to record brain activity and movement of five skilled and certified Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) dancers. Each dancer performed whole body movements of three Action types: movements devoid of expressive qualities ("Neutral"), non-expressive movements while thinking about specific expressive qualities ("Think"), and enacted expressive movements ("Do"). The expressive movement qualities that were used in the "Think" and "Do" actions consisted of a sequence of eight Laban Effort qualities as defined by LMA a notation system and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting all varieties of human movement. We used delta band (0.2-4 Hz) EEG as input to a machine learning algorithm that computed locality-preserving Fisher's discriminant analysis (LFDA) for dimensionality reduction followed by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to decode the type of Action. We also trained our LFDA-GMM models to classify all the possible combinations of Action Type and Laban Effort quality (giving a total of 17 classes). Classification accuracy rates were 59.4 +/- 0.6% for Action Type and 88.2 +/- 0.7% for Laban Effort quality Type. Ancillary analyses of the potential relations between the EEG and movement kinematics of the dancer's body, indicated that motion-related artifacts did not significantly influence our classification results. In summary, this research demonstrates that EEG has valuable information about the expressive qualities of movement. These results may have applications for advancing the understanding of the neural basis of expressive movements and for the development of neuroprosthetics to restore movements.

Although sentinel node biopsy is a reliable way to manage ALN, there are still no good methods of predicting ALN status before surgery. Since morbidity in breast cancer surgery is predominantly related to ALN dissection, predictive models for lymph node involvement may provide a way to alert the surgeon in subgroups of patients. Material/Methods: A total of 1325 invasive breast cancer patients were analyzed using tumor biological parameters that included age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, lymphovascular invasion, and HER2, to test their ability to predict ALN involvement. A support vector machine (SVM) was used as a classification model. The SVM is a machine-learning system developed using statistical learning theories to classify data points into 2 classes. Notably, SVM models have been applied in bioinformatics. Results: The SVM model correctly predicted ALN metastases in 74.7% of patients using tumor biological parameters. The predictive ability of luminal A, luminal B, triple negative, and HER2 subtypes using subgroup analysis showed no difference, and this predictive performance was inferior, with only 60% accuracy. Conclusions: With an SVM model based on clinical pathologic parameters obtained in the primary tumor, it is possible to predict ALN status in order to alert the surgeon about breast cancer counseling and in decision-making for ALN management.

Massive efforts have been made in the last few years to acquire high-dimensional neuroimaging and genetic data on large cohorts of subjects. The statistical analysis of such data is carried out with increasingly sophisticated techniques and represents a great computational challenge. Fortunately, increasing computational power in distributed architectures can be harnessed, if new neuroinformatics infrastructures are designed and training to use these new tools is provided. Combining a MapReduce framework (TomusBLOB) with machine learning algorithms (Scikit-learn library), we design a scalable analysis tool that can deal with non-parametric statistics on high-dimensional data. End-users describe the statistical procedure to perform and can then test the model on their own computers before running the very same code in the cloud at a larger scale. We illustrate the potential of our approach on real data with an experiment showing how the functional signal in subcortical brain regions can be significantly fit with genome-wide genotypes. This experiment demonstrates the scalability and the reliability of our framework in the cloud with a 2 weeks deployment on hundreds of virtual machines.

It can be classified into papillary carcinomas (PTCs) and anaplastic carcinomas (ATCs). Although ATCs are in an very aggressive status and cause more death than PTCs, their difference is poorly understood at molecular level. In this study, we focus on the transcriptome difference among PTCs, ATCs and normal tissue from a published dataset including 45 normal tissues, 49 PTCs and 11 ATCs, by applying a machine learning method, maximum relevance minimum redundancy, and identified 9 genes (BCL2, MRPS31, ID4, RASAL2, DLG2, MY01B, ZBTB5, PRKCQ and PPP6C) and 1 miscRNA (miscellaneous RNA, LOC646736) as important candidates involved in the progression of thyroid cancer. We further identified the protein-protein interaction (PPI) sub network from the shortest paths among the 9 genes in a PPI network constructed based on STRING database.

One popular model Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD) allows us to explore the interactions of different factors with nonnegative constraints. In order to reduce degeneracy problem of tensor decomposition caused by component delays, convolutive tensor decomposition model is an appropriate model for exploring temporal correlations. In this paper, a flexible two stage algorithm for K-mode Convolutive Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (K-CNTD) model is proposed using an alternating least square procedure. This model can be seen as a convolutive extension of Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition. The patterns across columns in convolutive tensor model are investigated to represent audio and image considering multiple factors. We employ the K-CNTD algorithm to extract the shift-invariant sparse features in different subspaces for robust speaker recognition and Alzheimer's Disease(AD) diagnosis task. The experimental results confirm the validity of our proposed algorithm and indicate that it is able to improve the speaker recognition performance especially in noisy conditions and has potential application on AD diagnosis.

Until now, however, researchers had little understanding of the details of relationship between different emotional states and various EEG features. To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our EEG data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

However, in the field of machine learning, the information offered by the teacher is seldom applied. In this paper, inspired by Vapnik et al., we propose a fast learning model using privileged information, which uses two smaller-sized Linear Programming (LP) model to take place of a larger Quadratic Programming (QP) model and applies two nonparallel hyperplanes to construct the final classifier. After that, we introduce the Learning model Using Privileged Information (LUPI) into the Visual Tracking Object (VOT) field, which can accelerate the convergence rate of learning and effectively improve the quality. In detail, we give the clear definition of the privileged information about VOT problem and propose a simple but effective online object tracking algorithm using privileged information, and all experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, at the same time show the privileged information provides a great help for further improving the quality.

New detection schemes based on machine learning principles are therefore desirable as they can learn the nature of normal traffic behavior and autonomously adapt to variations in the structure of normality' as well as recognize the significant deviations as suspicious or anomalous events. The main advantages of these techniques are that, in principle, they are not restricted to any specific environment and that they can provide a way of detecting unknown attacks. Detection performance is directly correlated with the traffic model quality, in terms of ability of representing the traffic behavior from its most characterizing internal dynamics. Starting from these ideas, we developed a two-stage anomaly detection strategy based on multiple distributed sensors located throughout the network. By using Independent Component Analysis, the first step, modeled as a Blind Source Separation problem, extracts the fundamental traffic components (the source' signals), corresponding to the independent traffic dynamics, from the multidimensional time series incoming from the sensors, corresponding to the perceived mixed/aggregate' effect of traffic on their interfaces. These components will be used to build the baseline traffic profiles needed in the second supervised phase, based on a binary classification scheme (detection is casted into an anomalous/normal classification problem) driven by machine learning-inferred decision trees.

In theory, bagging can be useful when the predictor has large variance or when the number of markers is much larger than sample size, preventing effective regularization. After presenting a brief review of GBLUP, bagging was adapted to the context of GBLUP, both at the level of the genetic signal and of marker effects. The performance of bagging was evaluated with four simulated case studies including known or unknown quantitative trait loci, and an application was made to real data on grain yield in wheat planted in four environments. A metric aimed to quantify candidate-specific cross-validation uncertainty was proposed and assessed; as expected, model derived theoretical reliabilities bore no relationship with cross-validation accuracy. It was found that bagging can ameliorate predictive performance of GBLUP and make it more robust against over-fitting. Seemingly, 25-50 bootstrap samples was enough to attain reasonable predictions as well as stable measures of individual predictive mean squared errors.

Species classification with DNA Barcode sequences has been proven effective on different organisms. Indeed, specific gene regions have been identified as Barcode: COI in animals, rbcL and matK in plants, and ITS in fungi. The classification problem assigns an unknown specimen to a known species by analyzing its Barcode. This task has to be supported with reliable methods and algorithms. Methods: In this work the efficacy of supervised machine learning methods to classify species with DNA Barcode sequences is shown. The Weka software suite, which includes a collection of supervised classification methods, is adopted to address the task of DNA Barcode analysis. Classifier families are tested on synthetic and empirical datasets belonging to the animal, fungus, and plant kingdoms. In particular, the function-based method Support Vector Machines (SVM), the rule-based RIPPER, the decision tree C4.5, and the Naive Bayes method are considered. Additionally, the classification results are compared with respect to ad-hoc and well-established DNA Barcode classification methods. Results: A software that converts the DNA Barcode FASTA sequences to the Weka format is released, to adapt different input formats and to allow the execution of the classification procedure. The analysis of results on synthetic and real datasets shows that SVM and Naive Bayes outperform on average the other considered classifiers, although they do not provide a human interpretable classification model. Rule-based methods have slightly inferior classification performances, but deliver the species specific positions and nucleotide assignments. On synthetic data the supervised machine learning methods obtain superior classification performances with respect to the traditional DNA Barcode classification methods. On empirical data their classification performances are at a comparable level to the other methods. Conclusions: The classification analysis shows that supervised machine learning methods are promising candidates for handling with success the DNA Barcoding species classification problem, obtaining excellent performances. To conclude, a powerful tool to perform species identification is now available to the DNA Barcoding community.

Detailed knowledge about which domains and residues are involved in a given interaction has extensive applications to biology, including better understanding of the binding process and more efficient drug/enzyme design. Alas, most current interaction prediction methods do not identify which parts of a protein actually instantiate an interaction. Furthermore, they also fail to leverage the hierarchical nature of the problem, ignoring otherwise useful information available at the lower levels; when they do, they do not generate predictions that are guaranteed to be consistent between levels. Results: Inspired by earlier ideas of Yip et al. (BMC Bioinformatics 10: 241, 2009), in the present paper we view the problem as a multi-level learning task, with one task per level (proteins, domains and residues), and propose a machine learning method that collectively infers the binding state of all object pairs. Our method is based on Semantic Based Regularization (SBR), a flexible and theoretically sound machine learning framework that uses First Order Logic constraints to tie the learning tasks together. We introduce a set of biologically motivated rules that enforce consistent predictions between the hierarchy levels. Conclusions: We study the empirical performance of our method using a standard validation procedure, and compare its performance against the only other existing multi-level prediction technique. We present results showing that our method substantially outperforms the competitor in several experimental settings, indicating that exploiting the hierarchical nature of the problem can lead to better predictions. In addition, our method is also guaranteed to produce interactions that are consistent with respect to the protein-domain-residue hierarchy.

Mitochondrial Morphological Features Are Associated with Fission and Fusion Events	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMIN-RELATED GTPASE; PANCREATIC BETA-CELLS; APOPTOSIS; OPA1; DYSFUNCTION; MITOFUSINS; STRESS	Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo constant remodeling through the regulation of two opposing processes, mitochondrial fission and fusion. Although several key regulators and physiological stimuli have been identified to control mitochondrial fission and fusion, the role of mitochondrial morphology in the two processes remains to be determined. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated whether morphological features extracted from time-lapse live-cell images of mitochondria could be used to predict mitochondrial fate. That is, we asked if we could predict whether a mitochondrion is likely to participate in a fission or fusion event based on its current shape and local environment. Using live-cell microscopy, image analysis software, and supervised machine learning, we characterized mitochondrial dynamics with single-organelle resolution to identify features of mitochondria that are predictive of fission and fusion events. A random forest (RF) model was trained to correctly classify mitochondria poised for either fission or fusion based on a series of morphological and positional features for each organelle. Of the features we evaluated, mitochondrial perimeter positively correlated with mitochondria about to undergo a fission event. Similarly mitochondrial solidity (compact shape) positively correlated with mitochondria about to undergo a fusion event. Our results indicate that fission and fusion are positively correlated with mitochondrial morphological features; and therefore, mitochondrial fission and fusion may be influenced by the mechanical properties of mitochondrial membranes.

The approach translates the nature-inspired concept of ant colony optimization to combinatorial building block selection. By relying on publicly available structure-activity data, we developed a predictive quantitative polypharmacology model for 640 human drug targets. By taking reductive amination as an example of a privileged reaction, we obtained novel subtype-selective and multitarget-modulating dopamine D-4 antagonists, as well as ligands selective for the sigma-1 receptor with accurately predicted affinities. The nanomolar potencies of the hits obtained, their high ligand efficiencies, and an overall success rate of 90% demonstrate that this ligand-based computer-aided molecular design method may guide target-focused combinatorial chemistry.

Digital stethoscopes offer an opportunity to re-evaluate the diagnosis of PAH. We hypothesized that spectral analysis of heart sound frequencies using recordings from a digital stethoscope would differ between children with and without PAH. Methods: We recorded heart sounds using a digital stethoscope from 27 subjects (12 males) with a median age of 7 years (3 months to 19 years) undergoing simultaneous cardiac catheterization. 13 subjects had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAp) < 25 mm Hg (8-24 mm Hg). 14 subjects had a mPAp >= 25 mm Hg (25-97 mm Hg). We applied the fast Fourier transform, power spectral analysis, separability testing, and linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation to the heart sounds recorded from the cardiac apex and 2nd left intercostal space (LICS) to examine the frequency domain. The significance of the results was determined using a t-test and rank-sum test. Results: The relative power of the frequencies 21-22 Hz of the heart sounds recorded at the 2nd LICS was decreased significantly in subjects mPAp >= 25 mm Hg versus < 25 mm Hg. Conclusions: Heart sound signals of patients with PAH contain significantly less relative power in the band 21-22 Hz compared to subjects with normal PAp. Information contained in the frequency domain may be useful in diagnosing PAH and aid the development of auscultation based techniques for diagnosing PAH. In the future, utilizing the diagnostic information contained in heart sounds recordings may require analysis of both the time and frequency domains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A path- and label-cost propagation approach to speedup the training of the optimum-path forest classifier	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Optimum-path forest		In general, pattern recognition techniques require a high computational burden for learning the discriminating functions that are responsible to separate samples from distinct classes. As such, there are several studies that make effort to employ machine learning algorithms in the context of "big data" classification problems. The research on this area ranges from Graphics Processing Units-based implementations to mathematical optimizations, being the main drawback of the former approaches to be dependent on the graphic video card. Here, we propose an architecture-independent optimization approach for the optimum-path forest (OPF) classifier, that is designed using a theoretical formulation that relates the minimum spanning tree with the minimum spanning forest generated by the OPF over the training dataset. The experiments have shown that the approach proposed can be faster than the traditional one in five public datasets, being also as accurate as the original OPF. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Many studies have used acceleration as the main input to discriminate between falls and activities of daily living (ADL). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using smartphones for fall detection. The most promising results have been obtained by supervised Machine Learning algorithms. However, a drawback of these approaches is that they rely on falls simulated by young or mature people, which might not represent every possible fall situation and might be different from older people's falls. Thus, we propose to tackle the problem of fall detection by applying a kind of novelty detection methods which rely only on true ADL. In this way, a fall is any abnormal movement with respect to ADL. A system based on these methods could easily adapt itself to new situations since new ADL could be recorded continuously and the system could be retrained on the fly. The goal of this work is to explore the use of such novelty detectors by selecting one of them and by comparing it with a state-of-the-art traditional supervised method under different conditions. The data sets we have collected were recorded with smartphones. Ten volunteers simulated eight type of falls, whereas ADL were recorded while they carried the phone in their real life. Even though we have not collected data from the elderly, the data sets were suitable to check the adaptability of novelty detectors. They have been made publicly available to improve the reproducibility of our results. We have studied several novelty detection methods, selecting the nearest neighbour-based technique (NN) as the most suitable. Then, we have compared NN with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). In most situations a generic SVM outperformed an adapted NN.

In this work, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), an effective kernel-based machine learning algorithm, is applied to probabilistic streamflow forecasting. GPR is built on Gaussian process, which is a stochastic process that generalizes multivariate Gaussian distribution to infinite-dimensional space such that distributions over function values can be defined. The GPR algorithm provides a tractable and flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework for inferring the posterior distribution of streamflows. The prediction skill of the algorithm is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using the MOPEX database, which includes long-term hydrometeorological time series collected from 438 basins across the U.S. from 1948 to 2003. Comparisons with linear regression and artificial neural network models indicate that GPR outperforms both regression methods in most cases. The GPR prediction of MOPEX basins is further examined using the Budyko framework, which helps to reveal the close relationships among water-energy partitions, hydrologic similarity, and predictability. Flow regime modification and the resulting loss of predictability have been a major concern in recent years because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. The persistence of streamflow predictability is thus examined by extending the original MOPEX data records to 2012. Results indicate relatively strong persistence of streamflow predictability in the extended period, although the low-predictability basins tend to show more variations. Because many low-predictability basins are located in regions experiencing fast growth of human activities, the significance of sustainable development and water resources management can be even greater for those regions.

Nonlinear Machine Learning of Patchy Colloid Self-Assembly Pathways and Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; DIFFUSION MAPS; FREE-ENERGY; PARTICLES; NANOSTRUCTURES; SIMULATIONS; PROTEINS; MOTIONS	Bottom-up self-assembly offers a means to synthesize materials with desirable structural and functional properties that cannot easily be fabricated by other techniques. An improved understanding of the structural pathways and mechanisms by which self-assembling materials spontaneously form from their constituent building blocks is of value in understanding the fundamental principles of assembly and in guiding inverse building block design. We present an approach to infer systematically assembly pathways and mechanisms by nonlinear data mining of molecular simulation trajectories using diffusion maps. We have validated our methodology in applications to Brownian dynamics simulations of the assembly of anisotropic "patchy colloids" into polyhedral aggregates. For particles designed to form tetrahedral aggregates, we identify two divergent assembly pathways leading to chains of interlocking dimers and tetramers and chains of interlocking trigonal planar trimers. For particles designed to assemble icosahedral aggregates, our approach recovers two distinct assembly pathways corresponding to monomeric addition and budding from a disordered liquid phase. These assembly routes were previously reported by inspection of simulation trajectories by Wilber et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 085106; J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 175102), validating the capacity of our approach to systematically recover assembly mechanisms previously discernible only by trajectory visualization.

A comprehensive study of small non-frameshift insertions/deletions in proteins and prediction of their phenotypic effects by a machine learning method (KD4i)	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Genotype-phenotype relationship; Insertion/deletion; Machine learning; Indeuctive logic programming	GENETIC-VARIATION; HUMAN GENOME; MISSENSE MUTATIONS; HUMAN-DISEASES; DATABASE; VARIANTS; INDELS; INFORMATION; DELETIONS; INSERTION	Background: Small insertion and deletion polymorphisms (Indels) are the second most common mutations in the human genome, after Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Recent studies have shown that they have significant influence on genetic variation by altering human traits and can cause multiple human diseases. In particular, many Indels that occur in protein coding regions are known to impact the structure or function of the protein. A major challenge is to predict the effects of these Indels and to distinguish between deleterious and neutral variants. When an Indel occurs within a coding region, it can be either frameshifting (FS) or non-frameshifting (NFS). FS-Indels either modify the complete C-terminal region of the protein or result in premature termination of translation. NFS-Indels insert/delete multiples of three nucleotides leading to the insertion/deletion of one or more amino acids. Results: In order to study the relationships between NFS-Indels and Mendelian diseases, we characterized NFS-Indels according to numerous structural, functional and evolutionary parameters. We then used these parameters to identify specific characteristics of disease-causing and neutral NFS-Indels. Finally, we developed a new machine learning approach, KD4i, that can be used to predict the phenotypic effects of NFS-Indels. Conclusions: We demonstrate in a large-scale evaluation that the accuracy of KD4i is comparable to existing state-of-the- art methods. However, a major advantage of our approach is that we also provide the reasons for the predictions, in the form of a set of rules. The rules are interpretable by non-expert humans and they thus represent new knowledge about the relationships between the genotype and phenotypes of NFS-Indels and the causative molecular perturbations that result in the disease.

The training algorithm and network topology affect the performance of the neural network. There are several training algorithms used in the training of neural networks. In this study, the effect of various learning algorithms on the learning performance of the neural networks on the inverse kinematics model learning of a seven-joint redundant robotic manipulator is investigated. After the implementation of various training algorithms, the Levenberg-Marquardth (LM) algorithm is found to be significantly more efficient compared to other training algorithms. The effect of the various network types, activation functions and number of neurons in the hidden layer on the learning performance of the neural network is then investigated using the LM algorithm. Among different network topologies, the best results are obtained for the feedforward network model with logistic sigmoid- activation function (logsig) and 41 neurons in the hidden layer. The results are presented with graphics and tables.

Then, independent base classifiers are learned to face each problem, whose outputs are combined to predict a single class label. This way, the accuracy of the baseline classifiers without decomposition is usually enhanced, aside from enabling the usage of binary classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machines, to solve multi-class problems. This paper analyzes the fact that existing aggregations favor easily recognizable classes; hence, the accuracy enhancement mainly comes from the higher correct classification rates over these classes. Using other evaluation criteria, the significant improvements of One-vs-One are diminished, showing a weakness due to the presence of difficult classes. Difficult classes can be defined as those obtaining a lower correct classification rate than that obtained by the other classes in the problem. After studying the problem of difficult classes in this framework and aiming to empower these classes, a novel similarity-based aggregation is presented, which generalizes the well-known weighted voting. The experimental analysis shows that the new methodology is able to increase the recognition of difficult classes, obtaining a more balanced performance over all classes, which is a desirable behavior. The methodology is tested within several Machine Learning paradigms and is compared with the state-of-the-art on aggregations for One-vs-One strategy. The results are contrasted by the proper statistical tests, as suggested in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is essential for software developers to identify defective software modules in order to continuously improve the quality of a software system. As the conditions for a software module to have defects are hard to identify, machine learning based classification models are still developed to approach the problem of defect prediction. We propose a novel classification model based on relational association rules mining. Relational association rules are an extension of ordinal association rules, which are a particular type of association rules that describe numerical orderings between attributes that commonly occur over a dataset. Our classifier is based on the discovery of relational association rules for predicting whether a software module is or it is not defective. An experimental evaluation of the proposed model on the open source NASA datasets, as well as a comparison to similar existing approaches is provided. The obtained results show that our classifier overperforms, for most of the considered evaluation measures, the existing machine learning based techniques for defect prediction. This confirms the potential of our proposal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

There are many approaches in the literature that try to solve this hitherto rather ill-defined task. In the present study, we propose a general generative model of binary data for Boolean Factor Analysis and introduce two new Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithms which maximize the likelihood of a Boolean Factor Analysis solution. To show the maturity of our solutions we propose an informational measure of Boolean Factor Analysis efficiency. Using the so-called bars problem benchmark, we compare the efficiencies of the proposed algorithms to that of Dendritic Inhibition Neural Network, Maximal Causes Analysis, and Boolean Matrix Factorization.

Many techniques have been devised to tackle such a diversity of applications. Despite the long tradition of pattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best classification in all scenarios. Therefore, as many techniques as possible should be considered in high accuracy applications. Typical related works either focus on the performance of a given algorithm or compare various classification methods. In many occasions, however, researchers who are not experts in the field of machine learning have to deal with practical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the underlying parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of classifiers and parameters in such practical circumstances constitutes a long-standing problem and is one of the subjects of the current paper. We carried out a performance study of nine well-known classifiers implemented in the Weka framework and compared the influence of the parameter configurations on the accuracy. The default configuration of parameters in Weka was found to provide near optimal performance for most cases, not including methods such as the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, the k-nearest neighbor method frequently allowed the best accuracy. In certain conditions, it was possible to improve the quality of SVM by more than 20% with respect to their default parameter configuration.

Due to often extreme divergence in sequence, detection and analysis of such motifs is performed more reliably on the structural level. Yet, few algorithms have been developed for the detection and analysis of structures of periodic proteins. Results: ConSole recognizes modularity in protein contact maps, allowing for precise identification of repeats in solenoid protein structures, an important subgroup of periodic proteins. Tests on benchmarks show that ConSole has higher recognition accuracy as compared to Raphael, the only other publicly available solenoid structure detection tool. As a next step of ConSole analysis, we show how detection of solenoid repeats in structures can be used to improve sequence recognition of these motifs and to detect subtle irregularities of repeat lengths in three solenoid protein families. Conclusions: The ConSole algorithm provides a fast and accurate tool to recognize solenoid protein structures as a whole and to identify individual solenoid repeat units from a structure. ConSole is available as a web-based, interactive server and is available for download at http://console.sanfordburnham.org.

The method that can predict the absolute local quality of individual residues in a single protein model is rare, yet particularly needed for using, ranking and refining protein models. Results: We developed a machine learning tool (SMOQ) that can predict the distance deviation of each residue in a single protein model. SMOQ uses support vector machines (SVM) with protein sequence and structural features (i.e. basic feature set), including amino acid sequence, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, and residue-residue contacts to make predictions. We also trained a SVM model with two new additional features (profiles and SOV scores) on 20 CASP8 targets and found that including them can only improve the performance when real deviations between native and model are higher than 5 angstrom. The SMOQ tool finally released uses the basic feature set trained on 85 CASP8 targets. Moreover, SMOQ implemented a way to convert predicted local quality scores into a global quality score. SMOQ was tested on the 84 CASP9 single-domain targets. The average difference between the residue-specific distance deviation predicted by our method and the actual distance deviation on the test data is 2.637 angstrom. The global quality prediction accuracy of the tool is comparable to other good tools on the same benchmark. Conclusion: SMOQ is a useful tool for protein single model quality assessment.

Several studies have proposed integrated analyses of microarray data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to find diagnostic subnetwork markers. However, the neighborhood relationship among network member genes has not been fully considered by those methods, leaving many potential gene markers unidentified. The main idea of this study is to take full advantage of the biological observation that genes associated with the same or similar diseases commonly reside in the same neighborhood of molecular networks. Results: We present EgoNet, a novel method based on egocentric network-analysis techniques, to exhaustively search and prioritize disease subnetworks and gene markers from a large-scale biological network. When applied to a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) microarray dataset, the top selected modules contain both known gene markers in TNBC and novel candidates, such as RAD51 and DOK1, which play a central role in their respective ego-networks by connecting many differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that EgoNet, which is based on the ego network concept, allows the identification of novel biomarkers and provides a deeper understanding of their roles in complex diseases.

The chemistry literature is very rich with information about chemical entities. Extracting molecules and their related properties and activities from the scientific literature to "text mine" these extracted data and determine contextual relationships helps research scientists, particularly those in drug development. One of the most important challenges in chemical text mining is the recognition of chemical entities mentioned in the texts. In this review, the authors briefly introduce the fundamental concepts of chemical literature mining, the textual contents of chemical documents, and the methods of naming chemicals in documents. We sketch out dictionary-based, rule-based and machine learning, as well as hybrid chemical named entity recognition approaches with their applied solutions. We end with an outlook on the pros and cons of these approaches and the types of chemical entities extracted.

A Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms and Feature Vectors for MS Lesion Segmentation Using Multimodal Structural MRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; OF-THE-ART; BRAIN MRI; IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; SCIENCE	Machine learning is a popular method for mining and analyzing large collections of medical data. We focus on a particular problem from medical research, supervised multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examine the extent to which the choice of machine learning or classification algorithm and feature extraction function impacts the performance of lesion segmentation methods. As quantitative measures derived from structural MRI are important clinical tools for research into the pathophysiology and natural history of MS, the development of automated lesion segmentation methods is an active research field. Yet, little is known about what drives performance of these methods. We evaluate the performance of automated MS lesion segmentation methods, which consist of a supervised classification algorithm composed with a feature extraction function. These feature extraction functions act on the observed T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI voxel intensities. Each MRI study has a manual lesion segmentation that we use to train and validate the supervised classification algorithms. Our main finding is that the differences in predictive performance are due more to differences in the feature vectors, rather than the machine learning or classification algorithms. Features that incorporate information from neighboring voxels in the brain were found to increase performance substantially. For lesion segmentation, we conclude that it is better to use simple, interpretable, and fast algorithms, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis, and to develop the features to improve performance.

The core FARSIGHT modules for image segmentation, feature extraction, tracking, and machine learning are written in C++, leveraging widely used libraries including ITK, VTK, Boost, and Qt. For solving complex image analysis tasks, these modules must be combined into scripts using Python. As a concrete example, we consider the problem of analyzing 3-D multi-spectral images of brain tissue surrounding implanted neuroprosthetic devices, acquired using high-throughput multi-spectral spinning disk step-and-repeat confocal microscopy. The resulting images typically contain 5 fluorescent channels. Each channel consists of 6000 x 10,000 x 500 voxels with 16 bits/voxel, implying image sizes exceeding 250 GB. These images must be mosaicked, pre-processed to overcome imaging artifacts, and segmented to enable cellular-scale feature extraction. The features are used to identify cell types, and perform large-scale analysis for identifying spatial distributions of specific cell types relative to the device. Python was used to build a server-based script (Dell 910 Power Edge servers with 4 sockets/server with 10 cores each, 2 threads per core and 1TB of RAM running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux linked to a RAID 5 SAN) capable of routinely handling image datasets at this scale and performing all these processing steps in a collaborative multi-user multi-platform environment. Our Python script enables efficient data storage and movement between computers and storage servers, logs all the processing steps, and performs full multi-threaded execution of all codes, including open and closed-source third party libraries.

Understanding the relationships of these properties requires the ability to first identify and catalog each property. However, information about such properties is largely locked away in decades of closed-access journal articles with heterogeneous conventions for reporting results, making it difficult to utilize the underlying data. We solve this problem through the NeuroElectro project: a Python library, RESTful API, and web application (at http://neuroelectro.org) for the extraction, visualization, and summarization of published data on neurons' electrophysiological properties. Information is organized both by neuron type (using neuron definitions provided by NeuroLex) and by electrophysiological property (using a newly developed ontology). We describe the techniques and challenges associated with the automated extraction of tabular electrophysiological data and methodological metadata from journal articles. We further discuss strategies for how to best combine, normalize and organize data across these heterogeneous sources. NeuroElectro is a valuable resource for experimental physiologists attempting to supplement their own data, for computational modelers looking to constrain their model parameters, and for theoreticians searching for undiscovered relationships among neurons and their properties.

In the pursuit of robust aromatase inhibitors, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and classification structure-activity relationship (CSAR) studies were performed on a non-redundant set of 63 flavonoids using multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine and decision tree approaches. Easy-to-interpret descriptors providing comprehensive coverage on general characteristics of molecules (i.e., molecular size, flexibility, polarity, solubility, charge and electronic properties) were employed to describe the unique physicochemical properties of the investigated flavonoids. QSAR models provided good predictive performance as observed from their statistical parameters with Q values in the range of 0.8014 and 0.9870 for the cross-validation set and Q values in the range of 0.8966 and 0.9943 for the external test set. Furthermore, CSAR models developed with the J48 algorithm are able to accurately classify flavonoids as active and inactive as observed from the percentage of correctly classified instances in the range of 84.6 % and 100 %. The study presented herein represents the first large-scale QSAR study of aromatase inhibition on a large set of flavonoids. Such investigations provide an important insight on the origins of aromatase inhibitory properties of flavonoids as breast cancer therapeutics.

J	Pourhabib, A; Liang, FM; Ding, Y				Pourhabib, Arash; Liang, Faming; Ding, Yu			Bayesian site selection for fast Gaussian process regression	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Bayesian model averaging; Gaussian process computation; large data sets; reversible jump MCMC		Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular method in the field of machine learning and computer experiment designs; however, its ability to handle large data sets is hindered by the computational difficulty in inverting a large covariance matrix. Likelihood approximation methods were developed as a fast GP approximation, thereby reducing the computation cost of GP regression by utilizing a much smaller set of unobserved latent variables called pseudo points. This article reports a further improvement to the likelihood approximation methods by simultaneously deciding both the number and locations of the pseudo points. The proposed approach is a Bayesian site selection method where both the number and locations of the pseudo inputs are parameters in the model, and the Bayesian model is solved using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. Through a number of simulated and real data sets, it is demonstrated that with appropriate priors chosen, the Bayesian site selection method can produce a good balance between computation time and prediction accuracy: it is fast enough to handle large data sets that a full GP is unable to handle, and it improves, quite often remarkably, the prediction accuracy, compared with the existing likelihood approximations.

Continuous machining operations lead tool to undergo wear. Worn out tools effect surface finish during machining. The dimensional accuracy of components is also compromised. Robust tool health is vital for better productivity. Hence, an online system condition monitoring of tools is the need of hour, promising reduction in maintenance cost with a greater productivity saving both time and money. This paper presents the classification performance of K-star algorithm. A set of statistical features extracted from vibration signals (good and faulty conditions) form the input to algorithm.

Most existing crowdsourcing services prohibit requesters from posting illegal or objectionable tasks. Operators in marketplaces have to monitor tasks continuously to find such improper ones; however, it is very expensive to manually investigate each task. In this paper, we present the results of our trial study on automatic detection of improper tasks to support the monitoring of activities by marketplace operators. We performed experiments using real task data from a commercial crowdsourcing marketplace and showed that the classifier trained by the operators' judgments achieves a high performance in detecting improper tasks. By analyzing the estimated classifier, we observed several effective features for detecting improper tasks, such as the words appeared in the task information, the amount of money that each worker will receive for the task, and the type of worker qualification option set for a task. In addition, to reduce the annotation costs of the operators and improve classification performance, we considered the use of crowdsourcing for task annotation. We hired a group of crowdsourcing (nonexpert) workers to monitor posted tasks and use their judgments to train the classifier. We were able to confirm that applying quality control techniques is beneficial for handling the variability in worker reliability and that it improved the performance of the classifier. Finally, our results showed that the use of non-expert judgments of crowdsourcing workers in combination with expert judgments improves the performance of detecting improper crowdsourcing tasks, and that the use of crowdsourced labels allows a reduction in the required number of expert judgments by 25% while maintaining the level of detection performance.

J	Hu, H; Pang, L; Tian, DP; Shi, ZZ				Hu, Hong; Pang, Liang; Tian, Dongping; Shi, Zhongzhi			Perception granular computing in visual haze-free task	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Granular computing; Leveled granular system; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Haze free; Brain-like computer	ROUGH SET APPROXIMATION; FUZZY-LOGIC; INFORMATION GRANULATION	In the past decade, granular computing (GrC) has been an active topic of research in machine learning and computer vision. However, the granularity division is itself an open and complex problem. Deep learning, at the same time, has been proposed by Geoffrey Hinton, which simulates the hierarchical structure of human brain, processes data from lower level to higher level and gradually composes more and more semantic concepts. The information similarity, proximity and functionality constitute the key points in the original insight of granular computing proposed by Zadeh. Many GrC researches are based on the equivalence relation or the more general tolerance relation, either of which can be described by some distance functions. The information similarity and proximity depended on the samples distribution can be easily described by the fuzzy logic. From this point of view, GrC can be considered as a set of fuzzy logical formulas, which is geometrically defined as a layered framework in a multi-scale granular system. The necessity of such kind multi-scale layered granular system can be supported by the columnar organization of the neocortex. So the granular system proposed in this paper can be viewed as a new explanation of deep learning that simulates the hierarchical structure of human brain. In view of this, a novel learning approach, which combines fuzzy logical designing with machine learning, is proposed in this paper to construct a GrC system to explore a novel direction for deep learning. Unlike those previous works on the theoretical framework of GrC, our granular system is abstracted from brain science and information science, so it can be used to guide the research of image processing and pattern recognition. Finally, we take the task of haze-free as an example to demonstrate that our multi-scale GrC has high ability to increase the texture information entropy and improve the effect of haze-removing.

This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels' geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Feng, G; Zhang, JD; Liao, SS				Feng, Guang; Zhang, Jia-Dong; Liao, Stephen Shaoyi			A novel method for combining Bayesian networks, theoretical analysis, and its applications	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Bayesian networks combination; Conditional independencies; Association degree superpose; Knowledge fusion	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFICATION; COMBINATION; CLASSIFIERS; DIAGNOSIS; ACCURACY; AREA	Effective knowledge integration plays a very important role in knowledge engineering and knowledge-based machine learning. The combination of Bayesian networks (BNs) has shown a promising technique in knowledge fusion and the way of combining BNs remains a challenging research topic. An effective method of BNs combination should not impose any particular constraints on the underlying BNs such that the method is applicable to a variety of knowledge engineering scenarios. In general, a sound method of BNs combination should satisfy three fundamental criteria, that is, avoiding cycles, preserving the conditional independencies of BN structures, and preserving the characteristics of individual BN parameters, respectively. However, none of the existing BNs combination method satisfies all the aforementioned criteria. Accordingly, there are only marginal theoretical contributions and limited practical values of previous research on BNs combination. In this paper, following the approach adopted by existing BNs combination methods, we assume that there is an ancestral ordering shared by individual BNs that helps avoid cycles. We first design and develop a novel BNs combination method that focuses on the following two aspects: (1) a generic method for combining BNs that does not impose any particular constraints on the underlying BNs, and (2) an effective approach ensuring that the last two criteria of BNs combination are satisfied. Further through a formal analysis, we compare the properties of the proposed method and that of three classical BNs combination methods, and hence to demonstrate the distinctive advantages of the proposed BNs combination method. Finally, we apply the proposed method in recommender systems for estimating users' ratings based on their implicit preferences, bank direct marketing for predicting clients' willingness of deposit subscription, and disease diagnosis for assessing patients' breast cancer risk.

Second-order cone programming SVM (SOCP-SVM) studies each class separately instead, providing quite an interesting formulation for the imbalanced classification task. This work presents a novel second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation, based on the LP-SVM formulation principle: the bound of the VC dimension is loosened properly using the l(infinity)-norm, and the margin is directly maximized using two margin variables associated with each class. A regularization parameter C is considered in order to control the trade-off between the maximization of these two margin variables. The proposed method has the following advantages: it provides better results, since it is specially designed for imbalanced classification, and it reduces computational complexity, since one conic restriction is eliminated. Experiments on benchmark imbalanced data sets demonstrate that our approach accomplishes the best classification performance, compared with the traditional SOCP-SVM formulation and with cost-sensitive formulations for linear SVM.

A properly designed group of combined classifiers exploiting knowledge gathered in a pool of elementary classifiers can successfully outperform a single classifier. There are two essential issues to consider when creating combined classifiers: how to establish the most comprehensive pool and how to design a fusion model that allows for taking full advantage of the collected knowledge. In this work, we address the issues and propose an AdaSS+, training algorithm dedicated for the compound classifier system that effectively exploits local specialization of the elementary classifiers. An effective training procedure consists of two phases. The first phase detects the classifier competencies and adjusts the respective fusion parameters. The second phase boosts classification accuracy by elevating the degree of local specialization. The quality of the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the basis of a wide range of computer experiments that show that AdaSS+ can outperform the original method and several reference classifiers.

In the recent years, clustering that seeks the continuity of data (in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches) has attracted an increasing research interest. It is a challenging problem with a remarkable practical interest. The most popular continuity clustering method is the spectral clustering (SC) algorithm, which is based on graph cut: It initially generates a similarity graph using a distance measure and then studies its graph spectrum to find the best cut. This approach is sensitive to the parameters of the metric, and a correct parameter choice is critical to the quality of the cluster. This work proposes a new algorithm, inspired by SC, that reduces the parameter dependency while maintaining the quality of the solution. The new algorithm, named genetic graph-based clustering (GGC), takes an evolutionary approach introducing a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster the similarity graph. The experimental validation shows that GGC increases robustness of SC and has competitive performance in comparison with classical clustering methods, at least, in the synthetic and real dataset used in the experiments.

Selecting and creating the appropriate data structure for implementing an abstract data type is not a trivial problem for a software developer, as it is hard to anticipate all the usage scenarios of the deployed application. Moreover, it is not clear how to select a good implementation for an abstract data type when access patterns to it are highly variant, or even unpredictable. The problem of automatic data structure selection is a complex one because each particular data structure is usually more efficient for some operations and less efficient for others, that is why a static analysis for choosing the best representation can be inappropriate, as the performed operations cannot be statically predicted. Therefore, we propose a predictive model in which the software system learns to choose the appropriate data representation, at runtime, based on the effective data usage pattern. This paper describes a novel approach in using a support vector machine model in order to dynamically select the most suitable representation for an aggregate according to the software system's execution context. Computational experiments confirm a good performance of the proposed model and indicates the potential of our proposal. The advantages of our approach in comparison with similar existing approaches are also emphasized. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, by alternating the effective polarization of the sensing elements in a PIR sensor, it is possible to determine the relative direction of the movement of an object moving on the motion plane of the PIR sensor. In this paper, we present a novel method of detecting a relative direction of human movement (in eight directions uniformly distributed) with two pairs of PIR sensors whose sensing elements are orthogonally aligned. We have developed a data collection unit with four dual sensing element PIR sensors with modified lenses, and collected data set from six subjects walking in eight directions each. Based on the collected PIR signals, we have performed classification analysis with well known machine learning algorithms, including instance-based learning and support vector machine. Our findings show that with the raw data set captured from two orthogonally aligned PIR sensors with modified lenses, we were able to achieve more than 98% correct detection of direction of movement. We also found that with the reduced feature set composed of three peak values for each PIR sensor, we could achieve 89%-95% recognition accuracy according to machine learning algorithms.

J	Bresson, X; Tai, XC; Chan, TF; Szlam, A				Bresson, Xavier; Tai, Xue-Cheng; Chan, Tony F.; Szlam, Arthur			Multi-class Transductive Learning Based on a"" (1) Relaxations of Cheeger Cut and Mumford-Shah-Potts Model	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION			English	Article						Data analysis; Clustering; Transductive learning; Multi-class; Ratio cut; Min cut; Potts and Mumford-Shah energies; Exact relaxation; Fast L1 optimization; Total variation	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHMS; SIMPLEX; FLOW	Recent advances in a"" (1) optimization for imaging problems provide promising tools to solve the fundamental high-dimensional data classification in machine learning. In this paper, we extend the main result of Szlam and Bresson (Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1039-1046, 2010), which introduced an exact a"" (1) relaxation of the Cheeger ratio cut problem for unsupervised data classification. The proposed extension deals with the multi-class transductive learning problem, which consists in learning several classes with a set of labels for each class. Learning several classes (i.e. more than two classes) simultaneously is generally a challenging problem, but the proposed method builds on strong results introduced in imaging to overcome the multi-class issue. Besides, the proposed multi-class transductive learning algorithms also benefit from recent fast a"" (1) solvers, specifically designed for the total variation norm, which plays a central role in our approach. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed a"" (1) relaxation algorithms are more accurate and robust than standard a"" (2) relaxation methods s.a. spectral clustering, particularly when considering a very small number of labels for each class to be classified. For instance, the mean error of classification for the benchmark MNIST dataset of 60,000 data in using the proposed a"" (1) relaxation of the multi-class Cheeger cut is 2.4 % when only one label is considered for each class, while the error of classification for the a"" (2) relaxation method of spectral clustering is 24.7 %.

However, many prediction analyses require methods and techniques, not typically required in neuroimaging, to accurately assess a model's predictive ability. Regression models will tend to fit to the idiosyncratic characteristics of a particular sample and consequently will perform worse on unseen data. Failure to account for this inherent optimism is especially pernicious when the number of possible predictors is high relative to the number of participants, a common scenario in psychiatric neuroimaging. We show via simulated data that models can appear predictive even when data and outcomes are random, and we note examples of optimistic prediction in the literature. We provide some recommendations for assessment of model performance.

Materials and Methods CRLM-bearing mice were scanned during the early stage of tumor growth and subsequently during the advanced-stage. Three experienced radiologists marked various suspected-foci on the early stage anatomical images and classified each as either highly certain or as suspected tumors. The statistical model construction was based on HRI maps (functional-MRI combined with hypercapnia and hyperoxia) using a supervised learning paradigm which was further trained either with the advanced-stage sets (late training; LT) or with the early stage sets (early training; ET). For each group of foci, the classifier results were compared with the ground-truth. Results The ET-based classification significantly improved the manual classification of the highly certain foci (P < 0.05) and was superior compared with the LT-based classification (P < 0.05). Additionally, the ET-based classification, offered high sensitivity (57-63%), accompanied with high positive predictive value (>94%) and high specificity (>98%) for suspected-foci. Conclusion The ET-based classifier can strengthen the radiologist's classification of highly certain foci. Additionally, it can aid in classifying suspected-foci, thus enabling earlier intervention which can often be lifesaving. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:1246-1253. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Young, W; Sobhani, A; Lenne, MG; Sarvi, M				Young, William; Sobhani, Amir; Lenne, Michael G.; Sarvi, Majid			Simulation of safety: A review of the state of the art in road safety simulation modelling	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Review						Simulation; Safety; Models; Surrogate safety measures	CAR-FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR; MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES; TRAFFIC CONFLICTS; SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; FATALITY RISK; FRONTAL CRASHES; MASS-RATIO; DRIVER; SEVERITY; IMPACT	Recent decades have seen considerable growth in computer capabilities, data collection technology and communication mediums. This growth has had considerable impact on our ability to replicate driver behaviour and understand the processes involved in failures in the traffic system. From time to time it is necessary to assess the level of development as a basis of determining how far we have come. This paper sets out to assess the state of the art in the use of computer models to simulate and assess the level of safety in existing and future traffic systems. It reviews developments in the area of road safety simulation models. In particular, it reviews computer models of driver and vehicle behaviour within a road context. It focuses on stochastic numerical models of traffic behaviour and how reliable these are in estimating levels of safety on the traffic network. Models of this type are commonly used in the assessment of traffic systems for capacity, delay and general performance. Adding safety to this assessment regime may allow more comprehensive assessment of future traffic systems. To date the models have focused primarily on vehicular traffic that is, cars and heavy vehicles. It has been shown that these models have potential in measuring the level of conflict on parts of the network and the measure of conflict correlated well with crash statistics. Interest in the prediction of crashes and crash severity is growing and new models are focusing on the continuum of general traffic conditions, conflict, severe conflict, crash and severe crashes. The paper also explores the general data types used to develop, calibrate and validate these models. Recent technological development in in-vehicle data collection, driver simulators and machine learning offers considerable potential for improving the behavioural base, rigour and application of road safety simulation models. The paper closes with some indication of areas of future development. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	de Wilde, P				de Wilde, Pieter			The gap between predicted and measured energy performance of buildings: A framework for investigation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Energy performance gap; Prediction; Measurement; Building design and engineering	SIMULATION PROGRAMS; OFFICE BUILDINGS; VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT; TOOLS; MODEL; BENCHMARKING; CONSUMPTION; OPERATION; RP-1051	There often is a significant difference between predicted (computed) energy performance of buildings and actual measured energy use once buildings are operational. This article reviews literature on this 'performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice.

Such control mechanisms can be modeled as control systems that restrict the control input to discrete values. In this paper, a controller design method based on a machine-learning technique is discussed. The relationship between the current situation (previous input sequence and previous output sequence), applied input, and output evolution is learned by applying certain machine-learning methods. Specifically, machine-learning methods such as the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) method and support vector machine (SVM) are used in this study. The trained classifier will be a controller that connects the current situation and a suitable control input that can drive the current output to the desired one. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified for discrete input systems via simulations and experiments.

With this expansive resource comes a challenge: integrating these new layers of information into our current knowledge of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and previously described metabolic pathways with the aim of discovering new genes and pathways related to human diseases and traits. Further, we must determine which computational methods will be most useful in this pursuit. In this paper, we speculate over the possible methods that will emerge in this new, challenging field.

It consists of an application of the elastic maps algorithm, which is a machine learning method, to the probability density function of differential pressure measurements in pipes. The proposed method was found to be insensitive to axial location of the measurements, pipe diameter within the range 13.9-49.2 mm and absolute pressure within the range 100-240 kPa; it is therefore amenable to relatively simple calibration in a calibration rig. Compared to three previously suggested machine learning algorithms, the present one had a superior performance in identifying the gas-liquid flow regime. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to predict river flows using various ML methods [feed forward neural network (FFNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and genetic programming (GP)] and also a non-ML method (multiple linear regression) in the Euphrates Basin in Turkey. Infilling the missing data in the runoff record of the selected stations in Euphrates Basin is also an objective of this study. The ML methods were applied to the three main sub-basins of the Euphrates Basin, namely the Upper, Middle, and Lower Euphrates Basins. ANFIS and FFNN methods were the most successful ML methods for runoff estimation in the Upper and Lower Euphrates Basins, whereas GP and ANFIS models were the best ones in the Middle Euphrates Basin. Missing flow data were constructed successfully in the selected stations.

J	Wu, YC				Wu, Yu-Chieh			A sparse -regularized support vector machines for efficient natural language learning	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						L2-regularization; Support vector machines; Machine learning; Text chunking; Dependency parsing; Chinese word segmentation		Linear kernel support vector machines (SVMs) using either -norm or -norm have emerged as an important and wildly used classification algorithm for many applications such as text chunking, part-of-speech tagging, information retrieval, and dependency parsing. -norm SVMs usually provide slightly better accuracy than -SVMs in most tasks. However, -norm SVMs produce too many near-but-nonzero feature weights that are highly time-consuming when computing nonsignificant weights. In this paper, we present a cutting-weight algorithm to guide the optimization process of the -SVMs toward a sparse solution. Before checking the optimality, our method automatically discards a set of near-but-nonzero feature weight. The final objects can then be achieved when the objective function is met by the remaining features and hypothesis. One characteristic of our cutting-weight algorithm is that it requires no changes in the original learning objects. To verify this concept, we conduct the experiments using three well-known benchmarks, i.e., CoNLL-2000 text chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation, and Chinese word dependency parsing. Our method achieves 1-10 times feature parameter reduction rates in comparison with the original -SVMs, slightly better accuracy with a lower training time cost. In terms of run-time efficiency, our method is reasonably faster than the original -regularized SVMs. For example, our sparse -SVMs is 2.55 times faster than the original -SVMs with the same accuracy.

The target is to deduce almost optimal rates of approximation and learning by RBFNs. For approximation, we show that for large classes of functions, the convergence rate of approximation by RBFNs is not slower than that of multivariate algebraic polynomials. For learning, we prove that, using the classical empirical risk minimization, the RBFNs estimator can theoretically realize the almost optimal learning rate.

Several approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, but they disregard sequence labeling problems. However, these are very common, for example, among the Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics communities. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach for sequence labeling using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for situations where label sequences from multiple annotators are available but there is no actual ground truth. The approach uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly learn the CRF model parameters, the reliability of the annotators and the estimated ground truth. When it comes to performance, the proposed method (CRF-MA) significantly outperforms typical approaches such as majority voting.

J	Yang, TB; Mahdavi, M; Jin, R; Zhu, SH				Yang, Tianbao; Mahdavi, Mehrdad; Jin, Rong; Zhu, Shenghuo			Regret bounded by gradual variation for online convex optimization	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Online convex optimization; Regret bound; Gradual variation; Bandit	MINIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Recently, it has been shown that the regret of the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithm for online linear optimization can be bounded by the total variation of the cost vectors rather than the number of rounds. In this paper, we extend this result to general online convex optimization. In particular, this resolves an open problem that has been posed in a number of recent papers. We first analyze the limitations of the FTRL algorithm as proposed by Hazan and Kale (in Machine Learning 80(2-3), 165-188, 2010) when applied to online convex optimization, and extend the definition of variation to a gradual variation which is shown to be a lower bound of the total variation. We then present two novel algorithms that bound the regret by the gradual variation of cost functions. Unlike previous approaches that maintain a single sequence of solutions, the proposed algorithms maintain two sequences of solutions that make it possible to achieve a variation-based regret bound for online convex optimization. To establish the main results, we discuss a lower bound for FTRL that maintains only one sequence of solutions, and a necessary condition on smoothness of the cost functions for obtaining a gradual variation bound. We extend the main results three-fold: (i) we present a general method to obtain a gradual variation bound measured by general norm; (ii) we extend algorithms to a class of online non-smooth optimization with gradual variation bound; and (iii) we develop a deterministic algorithm for online bandit optimization in multipoint bandit setting.

Knowing which instances are misclassified and understanding why they are misclassified and how they contribute to data set complexity can improve the learning process and could guide the future development of learning algorithms and data analysis methods. The goal of this paper is to better understand the data used in machine learning problems by identifying and analyzing the instances that are frequently misclassified by learning algorithms that have shown utility to date and are commonly used in practice. We identify instances that are hard to classify correctly (instance hardness) by classifying over 190,000 instances from 64 data sets with 9 learning algorithms. We then use a set of hardness measures to understand why some instances are harder to classify correctly than others. We find that class overlap is a principal contributor to instance hardness. We seek to integrate this information into the training process to alleviate the effects of class overlap and present ways that instance hardness can be used to improve learning.

It has been recently widely employed in data analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning applications. Isomap is one of the most promising manifold learning algorithms, which extends metric multi-dimensional scaling by using approximate geodesic distance. However, when Isomap is conducted on real-world applications, it may have some difficulties in dealing with noisy data. Although many applications represent a special sample by multiple feature vectors in different spaces, Isomap employs samples in unique observation space. In this paper, two extended versions of Isomap to multiple feature spaces problem, namely fusion of dissimilarities and fusion of geodesic distances, are presented. We have employed the advantages of several spaces and depicted the Euclidean distance on learned manifold that is more compatible to the semantic distance. To show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method, some experiments have been carried out on the application of shape analysis on MPEG7 CE Part B and Fish data sets.

Traditionally, clinical diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer was based on physician's clinical experience with various risk factors. Since the risk factors are broad categories, years of clinical study and experience have tried to identify key risk factors for recurrence. In this study, three machine learning approaches including support vector machine, C5.0 and extreme learning machine were considered to find important risk factors to predict the recurrence-proneness for cervical cancer. The medical records and pathology were accessible by the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital Tumor Registry. Experimental results illustrate that C5.0 model is the most useful approach to the discovery of recurrence-proneness factors. Our findings suggest that four most important recurrence-proneness factors were Pathologic Stage, Pathologic T, Cell Type and RT Target Summary. In particular, Pathologic Stage and Pathologic T were important and independent prognostic factor. To study the benefit of adjuvant therapy, clinical trials should randomize patients stratified by these prognostic factors, and to improve surveillance after treatment might lead to earlier detection of relapse, and precise assessment of recurrent status could improve outcome.

In this paper, a new feature selection evaluation criterion based on low-loss learning vector quantization (LVQ) classification is proposed. Based on the evaluation criterion, a feature selection algorithm that optimizes the hypothesis margin of LVQ classification through minimizing its loss function is presented. Some experiments that are compared with well-known SVM-RFE and Relief are carried out on 4 UCI data sets using Naive Bayes and RBF Network classifier. Experimental results show that new algorithm achieves similar or even higher performance than Relief on all training data and has better or comparable performance than SVM-RFE.

Subsequent supervised and unsupervised learning methods are applied to extract dominant morphological characteristics of weeds present in corn and soybean fields. The novelty of the presented technique resides in the feature extraction process that is based on spatial localization of vegetation in fields. Features from the weed leaf area distribution are extracted from the cultivation inter-rows, then features from the crop are inferred from the mixture model equation. Those extracted features are then passed to a naive bayesian classifier and a gaussian mixture clustering algorithm to discriminate weed from crop plant. The presented technique correctly classifies an average of 94 % of corn and soybean plants and 85 % of the weed (multiple species) without any prior knowledge on the species present in the field.

Exploiting only basic properties of the Hilbert space, superposition principle of quantum mechanics and quantum measurements, we construct a quantum analog for Rosenblatt's perceptron, which is the simplest learning machine. We demonstrate that the quantum perceptron is superior to its classical counterpart in learning capabilities. In particular, we show that the quantum perceptron is able to learn an arbitrary (Boolean) logical function, perform the classification on previously unseen classes and even recognize the superpositions of learned classes-the task of high importance in applied medical engineering.

It is routinely invoked in the explanation of cognitive processes as diverse as memory retrieval, categorization, visual search, problem solving, learning, language processing, reasoning, and social behavior. At the same time, it is of fundamental practical concern to computer scientists concerned with clustering and machine learning, and it figures in many philosophical contexts. Crucially, similar' is not a relationship that simply reflects objective properties of the objects under consideration but rather is dependent on how those objects are represented by an observer. This ties theories of similarity closely to theories of representation. For further resources related to this article, please visit the .

However, new ML models, trained with novel experimental results, are required to build regularly for more precise predictions. ML methods can build models from numeric data, whereas biological data are generally textual (DNA, protein sequences) or images and needs feature calculation algorithms to generate quantitative features. Programming skills along with domain knowledge are required to develop these algorithms. Therefore, the process of knowledge discovery through ML is decelerated due to lack of generic tools to construct features and to build models directly from the data. Hence, we developed a schema that calculates about 5,000 features, selects relevant features and develops protein classifiers from the training data. To demonstrate the general applicability and robustness of our method, fungal adhesins and nuclear receptor proteins were used for building classifiers which outperformed existing classifiers when tested on independent data. Next, we built a classifier for mitochondrial proteins of Plasmodium falciparum which causes human malaria because the latest corresponding classifiers are not publically accessible. Our classifier attained 98.18 % accuracy and 0.95 Matthews correlation coefficient by fivefold cross-validation and outperformed existing classifiers on independent test set. We implemented this schema as user-friendly and open source application Pro-Gyan (http://code.google.com/p/pro-gyan/), to build and share executable classifiers without programming knowledge.

A mathematical analysis of some of the static and dynamic properties of dropout is provided using Bernoulli gating variables, general enough to accommodate dropout on units or connections, and with variable rates. The framework allows a complete analysis of the ensemble averaging properties of dropout in linear networks, which is useful to understand the non-linear case. The ensemble averaging properties of dropout in non-linear logistic networks result from three fundamental equations: (1) the approximation of the expectations of logistic functions by normalized geometric means, for which bounds and estimates are derived; (2) the algebraic equality between normalized geometric means of logistic functions with the logistic of the means, which mathematically characterizes logistic functions; and (3) the linearity of the means with respect to sums, as well as products of independent variables. The results are also extended to other classes of transfer functions, including rectified linear functions. Approximation errors tend to cancel each other and do not accumulate. Dropout can also be connected to stochastic neurons and used to predict firing rates, and to backpropagation by viewing the backward propagation as ensemble averaging in a dropout linear network. Moreover, the convergence properties of dropout can be understood in terms of stochastic gradient descent. Finally, for the regularization properties of dropout, the expectation of the dropout gradient is the gradient of the corresponding approximation ensemble, regularized by an adaptive weight decay term with a propensity for self-consistent variance minimization and sparse representations.

This extensive study in seizure prediction considers the 278 patients from the European Epilepsy Database, collected in three epilepsy centres: Hopital Pitie-la-Salpetriere, Paris, France; Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Germany; Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Portugal. For a considerable number of patients it was possible to find a patient specific predictor with an acceptable performance, as for example predictors that anticipate at least half of the seizures with a rate of false alarms of no more than 1 in 6 h (0.15 h(-1)). We observed that the epileptic focus localization, data sampling frequency, testing duration, number of seizures in testing, type of machine learning, and preictal time influence significantly the prediction performance. The results allow to face optimistically the feasibility of a patient specific prospective alarming system, based on machine learning techniques by considering the combination of several univariate (single-channel) electroencephalogram features.

Several cache strategies have been proposed for ECPs to manage data access and distributions while maintaining the service availability. In our earlier research, we have demonstrated that there is no "one-fits-all" strategy for heterogeneous scenarios and the selection of the optimal strategy is related with workload patterns, cluster size and the number of concurrent users. In this paper, we present a new reconfiguration framework named PRESC . It applies machine learning approaches to determine an optimal cache strategy and supports online optimization of performance model through trace-driven simulation or semi-supervised classification. Besides, the authors also propose a robust cache entries synchronization algorithm and a new optimization mechanism to further lower the adaptation costs. In our experiments, we find that PRESC improves the elasticity of ECPs and brings big performance gains when compared with static configurations.

J	Korycki, R				Korycki, Rafal			Authenticity examination of compressed audio recordings using detection of multiple compression and encoders' identification	FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Digital audio authenticity; Detection of montage; Digital forensics; Multiple compression; MP3 encoder classification; MDCT coefficients; SVM; Discriminant analysis; Binary decision tree	CLASSIFICATION; SVM	Since the appearance of digital audio recordings, audio authentication has been becoming increasingly difficult. The currently available technologies and free editing software allow a forger to cut or paste any single word without audible artifacts. Nowadays, the only method referring to digital audio files commonly approved by forensic experts is the ENF criterion. It consists in fluctuation analysis of the mains frequency induced in electronic circuits of recording devices. Therefore, its effectiveness is strictly dependent on the presence of mains signal in the recording, which is a rare occurrence. Recently, much attention has been paid to authenticity analysis of compressed multimedia files and several solutions were proposed for detection of double compression in both digital video and digital audio. This paper addresses the problem of tampering detection in compressed audio files and discusses new methods that can be used for authenticity analysis of digital recordings. Presented approaches consist in evaluation of statistical features extracted from the MDCT coefficients as well as other parameters that may be obtained from compressed audio files. Calculated feature vectors are used for training selected machine learning algorithms. The detection of multiple compression covers up tampering activities as well as identification of traces of montage in digital audio recordings. To enhance the methods' robustness an encoder identification algorithm was developed and applied based on analysis of inherent parameters of compression. The effectiveness of tampering detection algorithms is tested on a predefined large music database consisting of nearly one million of compressed audio files. The influence of compression algorithms' parameters on the classification performance is discussed, based on the results of the current study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rasheed, F; Alhajj, R				Rasheed, Faraz; Alhajj, Reda			A Framework for Periodic Outlier Pattern Detection in Time-Series Sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Outlier periodic patterns; performance; periodicity detection; suffix tree; surprising patterns; surprising periodicity; time series; unusual periods	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE; SUFFIX TREES; DATABASES; MODEL	Periodic pattern detection in time-ordered sequences is an important data mining task, which discovers in the time series all patterns that exhibit temporal regularities. Periodic pattern mining has a large number of applications in real life; it helps understanding the regular trend of the data along time, and enables the forecast and prediction of future events. An interesting related and vital problem that has not received enough attention is to discover outlier periodic patterns in a time series. Outlier patterns are defined as those which are different from the rest of the patterns; outliers are not noise. While noise does not belong to the data and it is mostly eliminated by preprocessing, outliers are actual instances in the data but have exceptional characteristics compared with the majority of the other instances. Outliers are unusual patterns that rarely occur, and, thus, have lesser support (frequency of appearance) in the data. Outlier patterns may hint toward discrepancy in the data such as fraudulent transactions, network intrusion, change in customer behavior, recession in the economy, epidemic and disease biomarkers, severe weather conditions like tornados, etc. We argue that detecting the periodicity of outlier patterns might be more important in many sequences than the periodicity of regular, more frequent patterns. In this paper, we present a robust and time efficient suffix tree-based algorithm capable of detecting the periodicity of outlier patterns in a time series by giving more significance to less frequent yet periodic patterns. Several experiments have been conducted using both real and synthetic data; all aspects of the proposed approach are compared with the existing algorithm InfoMiner; the reported results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

However, the heavy computational burden renders DML systems implemented on conventional digital processors impractical for large-scale problems. The highly parallel computations required to implement large-scale deep learning systems are well suited to custom hardware. Analog computation has demonstrated power efficiency advantages of multiple orders of magnitude relative to digital systems while performing nonideal computations. In this paper, we investigate typical error sources introduced by analog computational elements and their impact on system-level performance in DeSTIN-a compositional deep learning architecture. These inaccuracies are evaluated on a pattern classification benchmark, clearly demonstrating the robustness of the underlying algorithm to the errors introduced by analog computational elements. A clear understanding of the impacts of nonideal computations is necessary to fully exploit the efficiency of analog circuits.

A direct formulation of multiclass boosting had been introduced in the past in the sense that it directly maximized the multiclass margin. The major problem of that approach is its high computational complexity during training, which hampers its application to real-world problems. In this brief, we propose a scalable and simple stagewise multiclass boosting method which also directly maximizes the multiclass margin. Our approach offers the following advantages: 1) it is simple and computationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time by more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification accuracy and 2) like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of parameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance. Experimental results on challenging multiclass machine learning and vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the convergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional computational cost compared to existing multiclass boosting.

Ideally, the performance of an application running inside a virtual machine (VM) shall be independent of co-located applications and VMs that share the physical machine. However, adverse interference effects exist and are especially severe for data-intensive applications in such virtualized environments. In this work, we present TRACON, a novel Task and Resource Allocation CONtrol framework that mitigates the interference effects from concurrent data-intensive applications and greatly improves the overall system performance. TRACON utilizes modeling and control techniques from statistical machine learning and consists of three major components: the interference prediction model that infers application performance from resource consumption observed from different VMs, the interference-aware scheduler that is designed to utilize the model for effective resource management, and the task and resource monitor that collects application characteristics at the runtime for model adaption. We implement and validate TRACON with a variety of cloud applications. The evaluation results show that TRACON can achieve up to 25 percent improvement on application throughput on virtualized servers.	[Chiang, Ron C.; Huang, H.

Emotions irrelevant to the working memory representation may interfere with the processing of relevant tasks and can influence task performance and behavior, making the accurate detection of CL from nonverbal information challenging. This paper investigates automatic CL detection from facial features, physiology and task performance under affective interference. Data were collected from participants (n=20) solving mental arithmetic tasks with emotional stimuli in the background, and a combined classifier was used for detecting CL levels. Results indicate that the face modality for CL detection was more accurate under affective interference, whereas physiology and task performance were more accurate without the affective interference. Multimodal fusion improved detection accuracies, but it was less accurate under affective interferences. More specifically, the accuracy decreased with an increasing intensity of emotional arousal.

Discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							INFORMATION EXTRACTION; PATHOLOGY REPORTS; RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM	Objective To research computational methods for discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts. Methods We cast the task of discovering body site and severity modifiers as a relation extraction problem in the context of a supervised machine learning framework. We utilize rich linguistic features to represent the pairs of relation arguments and delegate the decision about the nature of the relationship between them to a support vector machine model. We evaluate our models using two corpora that annotate body site and severity modifiers. We also compare the model performance to a number of rule-based baselines. We conduct cross-domain portability experiments. In addition, we carry out feature ablation experiments to determine the contribution of various feature groups. Finally, we perform error analysis and report the sources of errors. Results The performance of our method for discovering body site modifiers achieves F1 of 0.740-0.908 and our method for discovering severity modifiers achieves F1 of 0.905-0.929. Discussion Results indicate that both methods perform well on both in-domain and out-domain data, approaching the performance of human annotators. The most salient features are token and named entity features, although syntactic dependency features also contribute to the overall performance. The dominant sources of errors are infrequent patterns in the data and inability of the system to discern deeper semantic structures. Conclusions We investigated computational methods for discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts. Our best system is released open source as part of the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES).

J	Nguyen, Q; Valizadegan, H; Hauskrecht, M				Nguyen, Quang; Valizadegan, Hamed; Hauskrecht, Milos			Learning classification models with soft-label information	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							REGRESSION; PROBABILITY; AGREEMENT	Objective Learning of classification models in medicine often relies on data labeled by a human expert. Since labeling of clinical data may be time-consuming, finding ways of alleviating the labeling costs is critical for our ability to automatically learn such models. In this paper we propose a new machine learning approach that is able to learn improved binary classification models more efficiently by refining the binary class information in the training phase with soft labels that reflect how strongly the human expert feels about the original class labels. Materials and methods Two types of methods that can learn improved binary classification models from soft labels are proposed. The first relies on probabilistic/numeric labels, the other on ordinal categorical labels. We study and demonstrate the benefits of these methods for learning an alerting model for heparin induced thrombocytopenia. The experiments are conducted on the data of 377 patient instances labeled by three different human experts. The methods are compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score. Results Our AUC results show that the new approach is capable of learning classification models more efficiently compared to traditional learning methods. The improvement in AUC is most remarkable when the number of examples we learn from is small. Conclusions A new classification learning framework that lets us learn from auxiliary soft-label information provided by a human expert is a promising new direction for learning classification models from expert labels, reducing the time and cost needed to label data.

However, the vast majority of research does not consider the enormous influence a crisis has on social media that further affects the relationship between social media and the stock market. This article aims to address these challenges by proposing a multistage dynamic analysis framework. In this framework, we use an authorship analysis technique and topic model method to identify stakeholder groups and topics related to a special firm. We analyze the activities of stakeholder groups and topics in different periods of a crisis to evaluate the crisis's influence on various social media parameters. Then, we construct a stock regression model in each stage of crisis to analyze the relationships of changes among stakeholder groups/topics and stock behavior during a crisis. Finally, we discuss some interesting and significant results, which show that a crisis affects social media discussion topics and that different stakeholder groups/topics have distinct effects on stock market predictions during each stage of a crisis.

In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach named LGPRank to evaluate the web forum posts, where a genetic programming architecture is used to rank Web forum posts according to the qualities of their contents. In order to address the shortcomings of current studies, we take both the semantic-free and semantic-specific information of a post into account. We propose a set of new features named Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) semantic features which are computed in LDA topic space. The proposed features as well as content surface features and forum specific features are used in the learning process. Experiments are conducted on three web forum datasets in comparison with methods used in prior ranking research. LGPRank outperforms all the other methods in terms of P@N, NDCG@N and MAP measures. Furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the proposed LDA semantic features have a positive effect in improving the ranking performance.

J	Mitic, M; Miljkovic, Z				Mitic, Marko; Miljkovic, Zoran			Neural network learning from demonstration and epipolar geometry for visual control of a nonholonomic mobile robot	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Neural network; Learning from demonstration; Epipolar geometry; Visual control; Mobile robot	SERVO CONTROL; NAVIGATION; VISION; VEHICLES; MODEL	The control of a robot system using camera information is a challenging task regarding unpredictable conditions, such as feature point mismatch and changing scene illumination. This paper presents a solution for the visual control of a nonholonomic mobile robot in demanding real world circumstances based on machine learning techniques. A novel intelligent approach for mobile robots using neural networks (NNs), learning from demonstration (LfD) framework, and epipolar geometry between two views is proposed and evaluated in a series of experiments. A direct mapping from the image space to the actuator command is conducted using two phases. In an offline phase, NN-LfD approach is employed in order to relate the feature position in the image plane with the angular velocity for lateral motion correction. An online phase refers to a switching vision based scheme between the epipole based linear velocity controller and NN-LfD based angular velocity controller, which selection depends on the feature distance from the pre-defined interest area in the image. In total, 18 architectures and 6 learning algorithms are tested in order to find optimal solution for robot control. The best training outcomes for each learning algorithms are then employed in real time so as to discover optimal NN configuration for robot orientation correction. Experiments conducted on a nonholonomic mobile robot in a structured indoor environment confirm an excellent performance with respect to the system robustness and positioning accuracy in the desired location.

Novel Insights into Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal Revealed Through Comparative Human and Mouse Systems Biology Networks	STEM CELLS			English	Article						Embryonic stem cells; Cell signaling, Genomics; Computational biology; Biomathematical modeling; Pluripotent stem cells	FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC DATA; FUNCTION PREDICTION; IN-VIVO; PLURIPOTENT; EXPRESSION; MECHANISMS; CANCER; NAIVE; DIFFERENTIATION; INACTIVATION	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), characterized by their ability to both self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell lineages, are a powerful model for biomedical research and developmental biology. Human and mouse ESCs share many features, yet have distinctive aspects, including fundamental differences in the signaling pathways and cell cycle controls that support self-renewal. Here, we explore the molecular basis of human ESC self-renewal using Bayesian network machine learning to integrate cell-type-specific, high-throughput data for gene function discovery. We integrated high-throughput ESC data from 83 human studies (similar to 1.8 million data points collected under 1,100 conditions) and 62 mouse studies (similar to 2.4 million data points collected under 1,085 conditions) into separate human and mouse predictive networks focused on ESC self-renewal to analyze shared and distinct functional relationships among protein-coding gene orthologs. Computational evaluations show that these networks are highly accurate, literature validation confirms their biological relevance, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation supports our predictions. Our results reflect the importance of key regulatory genes known to be strongly associated with self-renewal and pluripotency in both species (e.g., POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG), identify metabolic differences between species (e.g., threonine metabolism), clarify differences between human and mouse ESC developmental signaling pathways (e.g., leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-activated JAK/STAT in mouse; NODAL/ACTIVIN-A-activated fibroblast growth factor in human), and reveal many novel genes and pathways predicted to be functionally associated with self-renewal in each species. These interactive networks are available online at for stem cell researchers to develop new hypotheses, discover potential mechanisms involving sparsely annotated genes, and prioritize genes of interest for experimental validation.

Materials and Methods: One hundred eight malocclusion patients randomly selected from six universities in China were randomly divided into nine groups, with each group containing an equal number of patients with Class I, II, and Ill malocclusions. Sixty-nine expert Chinese orthodontists ranked photographs of the patients (frontal, lateral, and frontal smiling photos) before and after orthodontic treatment from "most attractive" to "least attractive" in each group. A weighted mean ranking was then calculated for each patient, based on which a three-point scale was created. Procrustes superimposition was conducted on 101 landmarks identified on the photographs. A support vector regression (SVR) function was set up according to the coordinate values of identified landmarks of each photographic set and its corresponding grading. Its predictive ability was tested for each group in turn. Results: The average coincidence rate obtained for comparisons of the subjective ratings with the SVR evaluation was 71.8% according to 18 verification tests. Conclusions: Geometric morphometrics combined with SVR may be a prospective method for objective comprehensive evaluation of facial attractiveness in the near future.

J	Chen, L				Chen, Liang			ROBUSTNESS INSTEAD OF ACCURACY SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR SUBJECTIVE PATTERN RECOGNITION RESEARCH: STABILITY ANALYSIS ON MULTICANDIDATE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VERSUS DIRECT POPULAR VOTE	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge retrieval; stability; perceptual reasoning; regional voting; computer vision; similarity measures; national voting; image processing; representations; machine learning; decision support; vision and scene understanding	FACE-RECOGNITION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; IMAGE RETRIEVAL; LAPLACIANFACES; EIGENFACES	Subjective pattern recognition is a class of pattern recognition problems, where we not only merely know a few, if any, the strategies our brains employ in making decisions in daily life but also have only limited ideas on the standards our brains use in determining the equality/inequality among the objects. Face recognition is a typical example of such problems. For solving a subjective pattern recognition problem by machinery, application accuracy is the standard performance metric for evaluating algorithms. However, we indeed do not know the connection between algorithm design and application accuracy in subjective pattern recognition. Consequently, the research in this area follows a "trial and error" process in a general sense: try different parameters of an algorithm, try different algorithms, and try different algorithms with different parameters. This phenomenon can be observed clearly in the nearly 30 years research of the face recognition: although huge advances have been made, no algorithm has ever been shown a potential to be consistently better than most of the algorithms developed earlier; it was even shown that a naive algorithm can work, in the sense of accuracy, at least no worse than many newly developed ones in a few benchmarks. We argue that, the primary objective of subjective pattern recognition research should be moved to theoretical robustness from application accuracy so that we can evaluate and compare algorithms without or with only few "trial and error" steps. We in this paper introduce an analytical model for studying the theoretical stabilities of multicandidate Electoral College and Direct Popular Vote schemes (aka regional voting scheme and national voting scheme, respectively), which can be expressed as the a posteriori probability that a winning candidate will continue to be chosen after the system is subjected to noise. This model shows that, in the context of multicandidate elections, generally, Electoral College is more stable than Direct Popular Vote, that the stability of Electoral College increases from that of Direct Popular Vote as the size of the subdivided regions decreases from the original nation size, up to a certain level, and then the stability starts to decrease approaching the stability of Direct Popular Vote as the region size approaches the original unit cell size; and that the stability of Electoral College approaches that of Direct Popular Vote in the two extremities as the region size increases to the original national size or decreases to the unit cell size. It also shows a special situation of white noise dominance with negligibly small concentrated noise, where Direct Popular Vote is surprisingly more stable than Electoral College, although the existence of such a special situation is questionable. We observe that "high stability" in theory indeed always reveals itself in "high accuracy" in applications. Extensive experiments on two human face benchmark databases applying an Electoral College framework embedded with standard baseline and newly developed holistic algorithms have been conducted. The impressive improvement by Electoral College over regular holistic algorithms verifies the stability theory on the voting systems. It also shows an evidential support for adopting theoretical stability instead of application accuracy as the primary objective for subjective pattern recognition research.

This study is focused on characterization and classification of malicious cyber activities aimed at Web systems. The empirical analysis is based on three datasets, each in duration of four to five months, collected by high-interaction honeypots which ran fully functional three-tier Web systems. We first explore the types and prevalence of malicious scans and attacks to Web systems, and the extent to which these malicious activities differ in different periods of time or on Web servers running different services. In addition to descriptive statistical analysis, we include an inferential statistical analysis of the malicious session attributes, such as duration, number of requests and bytes transferred in a session. Then, we use supervised machine learning methods to classify attacker activities to two classes: vulnerability scans and attacks. Our main observations include the following: (1) Some characteristics of the malicious Web traffic were invariant across different servers and time periods, such as for example the dominant use of the search-based strategy for attacking the servers and the heavy-tailed behavior of session attributes. (2) On the other side, servers running different services experienced almost complementary profiles of vulnerability scan and attack types. (3) Supervised learning methods efficiently distinguished attack sessions from vulnerability scan sessions, with high probability of detection and very low probability of false alarms. (4) Decision tree based methods J48 and PART performed better than SVM across all datasets. (5) Attacks differed from vulnerability scans only in a small number of session attributes; depending on the dataset, classification of malicious activities can be performed using from four to six features without significantly affecting learners' performance compared to when all 43 features were used.

It can be approached by the application of some instance selection algorithms to filter out unrepresentative or noisy data from a given (training) dataset. However, the performance of instance selection over very high dimensional data has not yet been fully examined. In this paper, we introduce a novel efficient genetic algorithm (EGA), which fits "biological evolution" into the evolutionary process. In other words, after long-term evolution, individuals find the most efficient way to allocate resources and evolve. The experimental study is based on four very high dimensional datasets ranging from 200 to 18,236 dimensions. In addition, four state-of-the-art algorithms including IB3, DROP3, ICF, and GA are compared with EGA. The experimental results show that EGA allows the k-NN and SVM classifiers to provide the most comparable classification performance with the baseline classifiers without instance selection. Particularly, EGA outperforms the four algorithms in terms of average classification accuracy. Moreover, EGA can produce the largest reduction rates (the same as GA) and it requires relatively less computational time than the other four algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.

These genetic studies usually involve high dimensional data where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples. The high dimensionality of genetic data introduces a problem that there exist multiple solutions for optimizing a sparse model. In such situations, a single optimization result provides only an incomplete view of the data and lacks power to find alternative features associated with the same trait. In this article, we propose a novel method aimed to detecting alternative eQTLs where two genetic variants have alternative relationships regarding their associations with the expression of a particular gene. Our method accomplishes this goal by exploring multiple solutions sampled from the solution space. We proved our method theoretically and demonstrated its usage on simulated data. We then applied our method to a real eQTL data and identified a set of alternative eQTLs with potential biological insights. Additionally, these alternative eQTLs implicate a network view of understanding gene regulation.

Dynamic programming (DP) has been widely studied to find the optimal replacement policies in dairy cattle. However, DP models are computationally intensive and might not be practical for daily decision making. Hence, the ability of applying machine learning on a prerun DP model to provide fast and accurate predictions of nonlinear and intercorrelated variables makes it an ideal methodology. Milk class (1 to 5), lactation number (1 to 9), month in milk (1 to 20), and month of pregnancy (0 to 9) were used to describe all cows in a herd in a DP model. Twenty-seven scenarios based on all combinations of 3 levels (base, 20% above, and 20% below) of milk production, milk price, and replacement cost were solved with the DP model, resulting in a data set of 122,716 records, each with a calculated retention pay-off (RPO). Then, a machine learning model tree algorithm was used to mimic the evaluated RPO with DP. The correlation coefficient factor was used to observe the concordance of RPO evaluated by DP and RPO predicted by the model tree. The obtained correlatfon coefficient was 0.991, with a corresponding value of 0.11 for relative absolute error. At least 100 instances were required per model constraint, resulting in 204 total equations (models). When these models were used for binary classification of positive and negative RPO, error rates were 1% false negatives and 9% false positives. Applying this trained model from simulated data for prediction of RPO for 102 actual replacement records from the University of Wisconsin-Madison dairy herd resulted in a 0.994 correlation with 0.10 relative absolute error rate. Overall results showed that model tree has a potential to be used in conjunction with DP to assist farmers in their replacement decisions.

The main feature of the models is that the precise vector of weights assigned for examples in the training set at each iteration of boosting is replaced by a local convex set of weight vectors. The minimax strategy is used for building weak classifiers at each iteration. The local sets of weights are constructed by means of imprecise statistical models. The proposed models are called RILBoost (Robust Imprecise Local Boost).

Using a method known as high-throughput small RNA-sequencing, we can now profile the expression of small regulatory RNAs such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with a great deal of sensitivity. However, there are many other types of small RNAs (< 50 nt) present in the cell, including fragments derived from snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs), snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs), scRNAs (small cytoplasmic RNAs), tRNAs (transfer RNAs), and transposon-derived RNAs. Here, we present a user's guide for CoRAL (Classification of RNAs by Analysis of Length), a computational method for discriminating between different classes of RNA using high-throughput small RNA-sequencing data. Not only can CoRAL distinguish between RNA classes with high accuracy, but it also uses features that are relevant to small RNA biogenesis pathways.

The successful outcome of such analysis is usually determined by the reverse engineer's skills and by the volume and complexity of the code under analysis. To assist reverse engineers in such a tedious and error-prone task, it is desirable to develop reliable and automated tools for supporting the practice of malware authorship attribution. In a recent work, machine learning was used to rank and select syntax-based features such as n-grams and flow graphs. The experimental results showed that the top ranked features were unique for each author, which was regarded as an evidence that those features capture the author's programming styles. In this paper, however, we show that the uniqueness of features does not necessarily correspond to authorship. Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that many "unique" features selected using this method are clearly unrelated to the authors' programming styles, for example, unique IDs or random but unique function names generated by the compiler; furthermore, the overall accuracy is generally unsatisfactory. Motivated by this discovery, we propose a layered Onion Approach for Binary Authorship Attribution called OBA2. The novelty of our approach lies in the three complementary layers: preprocessing, syntax-based attribution, and semantic-based attribution. Experiments show that our method produces results that not only are more accurate but have a meaningful connection to the authors' styles. (C) 2014 The Author.

Unsupervised phenotyping of Severe Asthma Research Program participants using expanded lung data	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Asthma phenotyping; variable analysis; unsupervised approaches; supervised machine learning approaches	CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; WHEEZE	Background: Previous studies have identified asthma phenotypes based on small numbers of clinical, physiologic, or inflammatory characteristics. However, no studies have used a wide range of variables using machine learning approaches. Objectives: We sought to identify subphenotypes of asthma by using blood, bronchoscopic, exhaled nitric oxide, and clinical data from the Severe Asthma Research Program with unsupervised clustering and then characterize them by using supervised learning approaches. Methods: Unsupervised clustering approaches were applied to 112 clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory variables from 378 subjects. Variable selection and supervised learning techniques were used to select relevant and nonredundant variables and address their predictive values, as well as the predictive value of the full variable set. Results: Ten variable clusters and 6 subject clusters were identified, which differed and overlapped with previous clusters. Patients with traditionally defined severe asthma were distributed through subject clusters 3 to 6. Cluster 4 identified patients with early-onset allergic asthma with low lung function and eosinophilic inflammation. Patients with later-onset, mostly severe asthma with nasal polyps and eosinophilia characterized cluster 5. Cluster 6 asthmatic patients manifested persistent inflammation in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and exacerbations despite high systemic corticosteroid use and side effects. Age of asthma onset, quality of life, symptoms, medications, and health care use were some of the 51 nonredundant variables distinguishing subject clusters. These 51 variables classified test cases with 88% accuracy compared with 93% accuracy with all 112 variables. Conclusion: The unsupervised machine learning approaches used here provide unique insights into disease, confirming other approaches while revealing novel additional phenotypes.

Most anomaly detectors rely on machine learning algorithms to derive a model of normality that is later used to detect suspicious events. Such algorithms, however, are generally susceptible to evasion by means of carefully constructed attacks that are not recognized as anomalous. Different strategies to thwart evasion have been proposed over the last years, including the use of randomization to make somewhat uncertain how each packet will be processed. In this paper we analyze the strength of the randomization strategy suggested for Anagram, a well-known anomaly detector based on n-gram models. We show that an adversary who can interact with the system for a short period of time with inputs of his choosing will be able to recover the secret mask used to process packets. We describe and discuss an efficient algorithm to do this and report our experiences with a prototype implementation. Furthermore, we show that the specific form of randomization suggested for Anagram is a double-edged sword, as knowledge of the mask makes evasion easier than in the nonrandomized case. We finally discuss a simple countermeasure to prevent our attacks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, XZ; Qin, J				Liu, Xiaozhong; Qin, Jian			An Interactive Metadata Model for Structural, Descriptive, and Referential Representation of Scholarly Output	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ARTICLES	The scientific metadata model proposed in this article encompasses both classical descriptive metadata such as those defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DC) and the innovative structural and referential metadata properties that go beyond the classical model. Structural metadata capture the structural vocabulary in research publications; referential metadata include not only citations but also data about other types of scholarly output that is based on or related to the same publication. The article describes the structural, descriptive, and referential (SDR) elements of the metadata model and explains the underlying assumptions and justifications for each major component in the model. ScholarWiki, an experimental system developed as a proof of concept, was built over the wiki platform to allow user interaction with the metadata and the editing, deleting, and adding of metadata. By allowing and encouraging scholars (both as authors and as users) to participate in the knowledge and metadata editing and enhancing process, the larger community will benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval. The ScholarWiki system utilizes machine-learning techniques that can automatically produce self-enhanced metadata by learning from the structural metadata that scholars contribute, which will add intelligence to enhance and update automatically the publication of metadata Wiki pages.

However, the conventional indices of HRV have poor predictive value for mortality. Our aim was to develop novel predictive models based on support vector machine (SVM) to study the integrated features of HRV for improving risk stratification after AMI. Methods: A series of heart-rate dynamic parameters from 208 patients were analyzed after a mean follow-up time of 28 months. Patient electrocardiographic data were classified as either survivals or cardiac deaths. SVM models were established based on different combinations of heart-rate dynamic variables and compared to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate. We tested the accuracy of predictors by assessing the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Results: We evaluated a SVM algorithm that integrated various electrocardiographic features based on three models: (A) HRV complex; (B) 6 dimension vector; and (C) 8 dimension vector. Mean AUC of HRV complex was 0.8902, 0.8880 for 6 dimension vector and 0.8579 for 8 dimension vector, compared with 0.7424 for LVEF, 0.7932 for SDNN and 0.7399 for DC. Conclusions: HRV complex yielded the largest AUC and is the best classifier for predicting cardiac death after AMI.

Such patients are well suited to having their physiological condition monitored using low-power, minimally intrusive wearable sensors. Despite data-collection systems now being manufactured commercially, allowing physiological data to be acquired from mobile patients, little work has been undertaken on the use of the resultant data in a principled manner for robust patient care, including predictive monitoring. Most current devices generate so many false-positive alerts that devices cannot be used for routine clinical practice. This paper explores principled machine learning approaches to interpreting large quantities of continuously acquired, multivariate physiological data, using wearable patient monitors, where the goal is to provide early warning of serious physiological determination, such that a degree of predictive care may be provided. We adopt a one-class support vector machine formulation, proposing a formulation for determining the free parameters of the model using partial area under the ROC curve, a method arising from the unique requirements of performing online analysis with data from patient-worn sensors. There are few clinical evaluations of machine learning techniques in the literature, so we present results from a study at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust devised to investigate the large-scale clinical use of patient-worn sensors for predictive monitoring in a ward with a high incidence of patient mortality. We show that our system can combine routine manual observations made by clinical staff with the continuous data acquired from wearable sensors. Practical considerations and recommendations based on our experiences of this clinical study are discussed, in the context of a framework for personalized monitoring.

The system is robust to time-varying illumination conditions while using standard camera and infrared illumination hardware. We tested the system for periodic limb movement (PLM) detection during sleep, using EMG signals as a reference. We evaluated the motion detection performance both per frame and with respect to movement event classification relevant for PLM detection. The Matthews correlation coefficient improved by a factor of 2, compared to a state-of-the-art motion detection method, while sensitivity and specificity increased with 45% and 15%, respectively. Movement event classification improved by a factor of 6 and 3 in constant and highly varying lighting conditions, respectively. On 11 PLM patient test sequences, the proposed system achieved a 100% accurate PLM index (PLMI) score with a slight temporal misalignment of the starting time (<1 s) regarding one movement. We conclude that camera-based PLM detection during sleep is feasible and can give an indication of the PLMI score.

However, the general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature representations typically makes this problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple kernel-learning framework to combine multimodal features for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual, we look at the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a more straightforward solution of the problem in the primal. Furthermore, we impose the mixed L-21 norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as the group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection, while at the same time exploiting complementary information among different kernels. Therefore, it is able to extract the most discriminative features for classification. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Automated Detection of Perturbed Cardiac Physiology During Oral Food Allergen Challenge in Children	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automated diagnosis; decision support; machine learning; novelty detection	GAUSSIAN MIXTURE-MODELS; NOVELTY DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; PLATFORM; EEG	This paper investigates the fully automated computer-based detection of allergic reaction in oral food challenges using pediatric ECG signals. Nonallergic background is modeled using a mixture of Gaussians during oral food challenges, and the model likelihoods are used to determine whether a subject is allergic to a food type. The system performance is assessed on the dataset of 24 children (15 allergic and 9 nonallergic) totaling 34 h of data. The proposed detector correctly classified all nonallergic subjects (100% specificity) and 12 allergic subjects (80% sensitivity) and is capable of detecting allergy on average 17 min earlier than trained clinicians during oral food challenges, the gold standard of allergy diagnosis. Inclusion of the developed allergy classification platform during oral food challenges recorded would result in a 30% reduction of doses administered to allergic subjects. The results of study introduce the possibility to halt challenges earlier which can safely advance the state of clinical art of allergy diagnosis by reducing the overall exposure to the allergens.

Gaussian Process-Mixture Conditional Heteroscedasticity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Gaussian process; Pitman-Yor process; mixture model; conditional heteroscedasticity; copula; volatility modeling	MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; COPULA; HETEROSKEDASTICITY; GARCH(1,1); INFERENCE	Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models have long been considered as one of the most successful families of approaches for volatility modeling in financial return series. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on methodologies widely used in the field of statistical machine learning. Specifically, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian mixture of Gaussian process regression models, each component of which models the noise variance process that contaminates the observed data as a separate latent Gaussian process driven by the observed data. This way, we essentially obtain a Gaussian process-mixture conditional heteroscedasticity (GPMCH) model for volatility modeling in financial return series. We impose a nonparametric prior with power-law nature over the distribution of the model mixture components, namely the Pitman-Yor process prior, to allow for better capturing modeled data distributions with heavy tails and skewness. Finally, we provide a copula-based approach for obtaining a predictive posterior for the covariances over the asset returns modeled by means of a postulated GPMCH model. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a number of benchmark scenarios, and compare its performance to state-of-the-art methodologies.

In several real-world applications collecting many annotated data is costly and not always possible. However, a small training set does not allow to cover the high intraclass variability typical of visual objects. In this condition, machine learning methods provide very few guarantees. This paper presents a discriminative model adaptation algorithm able to proficiently learn a target object with few examples by relying on other previously learned source categories. The proposed method autonomously chooses from where and how much to transfer information by solving a convex optimization problem which ensures to have the minimal leave-one-out error on the available training set. We analyze several properties of the described approach and perform an extensive experimental comparison with other existing transfer solutions, consistently showing the value of our algorithm.

J	Lee, JT; Yang, MC; Rim, HC				Lee, Jung-Tae; Yang, Min-Chul; Rim, Hae-Chang			Discovering High-Quality Threaded Discussions in Online Forums	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						online forum; discussion board; thread quality		Archives of threaded discussions generated by users in online forums and discussion boards contain valuable knowledge on various topics. However, not all threads are useful because of deliberate abuses, such as trolling and flaming, that are commonly observed in online conversations. The existence of various users with different levels of expertise also makes it difficult to assume that every discussion thread stored online contains high-quality contents. Although finding high-quality threads automatically can help both users and search engines sift through a huge amount of thread archives and make use of these potentially useful resources effectively, no previous work to our knowledge has performed a study on such task. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for distinguishing high-quality threads from low-quality ones in online discussion sites. We first suggest four different artificial measures for inducing overall quality of a thread based on ratings of its posts. We then propose two tasks involving prediction of thread quality without using post rating information. We adopt a popular machine learning framework to solve the two prediction tasks Experimental results on a real world forum archive demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the prediction performance across all four measures of thread quality on both tasks. We also compare how different types of features derived from various aspects of threads contribute to the overall performance and investigate key features that play a crucial role in discovering high-quality threads in online discussion sites.

In this paper, we focus on evaluating the performance of both classic and less commonly known classifiers with application to three distinct human activity recognition datasets freely available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. During the research, we placed considerable limitations on how to approach the problem. We decided to test the classifiers on raw, unprocessed data received directly from the sensors and attempt to classify it in every single time-point, thus ignoring potentially beneficial properties of the provided time-series. This approach is beneficial as it alleviates the problem of classifiers having to be fast enough to process data coming from the sensors in real-time. The results show that even under these heavy restrictions, it is possible to achieve classification accuracy of up to 98.16 %. Implicitly, the results also suggest which of the three sensor configurations is the most suitable for this particular setting of the human activity recognition problem.

However, existing third-party probabilistic or machine-learning methods that significantly improve the accuracy of base-calls on these platforms are impractical for production use due to their computational inefficiency. Results: We directly formulate base-calling as a blind deconvolution problem and implemented BlindCall as an efficient solver to this inverse problem. BlindCall produced base-calls at accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art probabilistic methods while processing data at rates 10 times faster in most cases. The computational complexity of BlindCall scales linearly with read length making it better suited for new long-read sequencing technologies.

However, most results of these studies were data dependent and were not suitable for other data sets. This study performed cross-laboratory validations for the cancer patient data from 4 hospitals. We investigated the feasibility of survival risk predictions using high-throughput gene expression data and clinical data. We analyzed multiple data sets for prognostic applications in lung cancer diagnosis. After building tens of thousands of various ANN architectures using the training data, five survival-time correlated genes were identified from 4 microarray gene expression data sets by examining the correlation between gene signatures and patient survival time. The experimental results showed that gene expression data can be used for valid predictions of cancer patient survival classification with an overall accuracy of 83.0% based on survival time trusted data. The results show the prediction model yielded excellent predictions given that patients in the high-risk group obtained a lower median overall survival compared with low-risk patients (log-rank test P-value < 0.00001). This study provides a foundation for further clinical studies and research into other types of cancer. We hope these findings will improve the prognostic methods of cancer patients.

The method exploits advantages in domain knowledge and machine learning as complementary information sources. Whereas machine learning may discover patterns in interest domains that are too subtle for humans to detect, domain knowledge may contain information on a domain not present in the available domain dataset. CDKML has three steps. First, prior domain knowledge is enriched with relevant patterns obtained by machine learning to create an initial classifier. Second, genetic algorithms refine the classifier. Third, the classifier is adapted online on the basis of user feedback using the Markov decision process. CDKML was applied in fall detection. Tests showed that the classifiers developed by CDKML have better performance than machine-learning classifiers generated on a training dataset that does not adequately represent all real-life cases of the learned concept. The accuracy of the initial classifier was 10 percentage points higher than the best machine-learning classifier and the refinement added 3 percentage points. The online adaptation improved the accuracy of the refined classifier by an additional 15 percentage points.

The demand for animal products will nearly be doubled by 2030. Thus, to improve livestock production and meet the animal protein demand, it is essential to go for application of interventions based on genomics, statistics and informatics. Such interventions are quite often used in the animal improvement programs to develop offspring with desirable traits. More recently, with the emergence of high throughput sequencing technologies, genomes of farm animals, fishes and model organisms were sequenced and the same are available in public domain. Also, with the advent of new silicon technologies, it has become possible to manage the generated data from genome sequencing projects. Now, the challenge lies with the analysis and interpretation of sequence data in a biologically meaningful manner, for which many algorithmic based analytical techniques and high performance computing methods were developed. Here, a brief review is presented on the application of various statistical and computational approaches used in genomic data analysis. Applications of the above mentioned approaches for health management and sustainable animal and fish production from the view point of vaccine and drug designing, disease risk management, epigenomics and whole genome level SNP/CNV associations with traits at are also discussed here. Besides, this paper allows the molecular biologists and other application scientists to analyze overwhelming amount of genomic data by different methods outlined here.	[Rao, A.

The latter is related to the physical light phase through the transport of intensity equation (TIE). Recently, it was shown that it is possible to approximate the solution of the TIE using a low-pass monogenic signal framework. The purpose of this paper is to show that using the local phase of the aforementioned monogenic signal instead of the defocused image improves the cell/background classification accuracy. The paper statement was tested on an image database composed of three cell lines: adherent CHO, adherent L929, and Sf21 in suspension. Local phase and local energy images were generated using the low-pass monogenic signal framework with axial derivative images as input. Machine learning was then employed to investigate the discriminative power of the local phase. Three classifier models were utilized: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, and SVM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The improvement, averaged over cell lines, of classifying sized patches extracted from the local phase image instead of the defocused image was % using the RF, % using the linear SVM, and % when a RBF kernel was employed instead of the linear one. Furthermore, the feature images can be sorted by increasing discriminative power as follows: at-focus signal, local energy, defocused signal, local phase. The only exception to this order was the superiority of local energy over defocused signal for suspended cells. Local phase computed using the low-pass monogenic signal framework considerably outperforms the defocused image for the purpose of pixel-patch cell/background classification in bright-field microscopy.

The model utilizes RANDOM FOREST, a tree-based machine learning algorithm, which does not incorporate a priori knowledge of source characteristics or propagation mechanics. The response data encompasses 270 000 h of acoustical measurements from 190 sites located in National Parks across the contiguous United States. The explanatory variables were derived from national geospatial data layers and cross validation procedures were used to evaluate model performance and identify variables with predictive power. Using the model, the effects of individual explanatory variables on sound pressure level were isolated and quantified to reveal systematic trends across environmental gradients. Model performance varies by the acoustical metric of interest; the seasonal L-50 can be predicted with a median absolute deviation of approximately 3 dB. The primary application for this model is to generalize point measurements to maps expressing spatial variation in ambient sound levels. An example of this mapping capability is presented for Zion National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument in southwestern Utah. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

Automatically Annotating Topics in Transcripts of Patient-Provider Interactions via Machine Learning	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						machine learning; natural language processing; speech acts; patient-provider interaction; CRF; communication; informatics	OF-THE-LITERATURE; HIV CARE; ADHERENCE; DIALOGUE; UTILITY	Background. Annotated patient-provider encounters can provide important insights into clinical communication, ultimately suggesting how it might be improved to effect better health outcomes. But annotating outpatient transcripts with Roter or General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS) codes is expensive, limiting the scope of such analyses. We propose automatically annotating transcripts of patient-provider interactions with topic codes via machine learning. Methods. We use a conditional random field (CRF) to model utterance topic probabilities. The model accounts for the sequential structure of conversations and the words comprising utterances. We assess predictive performance via 10-fold cross-validation over GMIAS-annotated transcripts of 360 outpatient visits (>230,000 utterances). We then use automated in place of manual annotations to reproduce an analysis of 116 additional visits from a randomized trial that used GMIAS to assess the efficacy of an intervention aimed at improving communication around antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. Results. With respect to 6 topic codes, the CRF achieved a mean pairwise kappa compared with human annotators of 0.49 (range: 0.47-0.53) and a mean overall accuracy of 0.64 (range: 0.62-0.66). With respect to the RCT reanalysis, results using automated annotations agreed with those obtained using manual ones. According to the manual annotations, the median number of ARV-related utterances without and with the intervention was 49.5 versus 76, respectively (paired sign test P = 0.07). When automated annotations were used, the respective numbers were 39 versus 55 (P = 0.04). While moderately accurate, the predicted annotations are far from perfect. Conversational topics are intermediate outcomes, and their utility is still being researched. Conclusions. This foray into automated topic inference suggests that machine learning methods can classify utterances comprising patient-provider interactions into clinically relevant topics with reasonable accuracy.

Some noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are currently available for locked-in syndrome (LIS) but none have incorporated a statistical language model during text generation. Objective. To begin to address the communication needs of individuals with LIS using a noninvasive BCI that involves rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of symbols and a unique classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) and language model fusion. Methods. The RSVP Keyboard was developed with several unique features. Individual letters are presented at 2.5 per second. Computer classification of letters as targets or nontargets based on EEG is performed using machine learning that incorporates a language model for letter prediction via Bayesian fusion enabling targets to be presented only 1 to 4 times. Nine participants with LIS and 9 healthy controls were enrolled. After screening, subjects first calibrated the system, and then completed a series of balanced word generation mastery tasks that were designed with 5 incremental levels of difficulty, which increased by selecting phrases for which the utility of the language model decreased naturally. Results. Six participants with LIS and 9 controls completed the experiment. All LIS participants successfully mastered spelling at level 1 and one subject achieved level 5. Six of 9 control participants achieved level 5. Conclusions. Individuals who have incomplete LIS may benefit from an EEG-based BCI system, which relies on EEG classification and a statistical language model. Steps to further improve the system are discussed.

Automated diagnostics based on machine learning therefore could be very important for liver tests of patients. This paper investigates 225 liver function test records (each record include 14 features), which is a subset from 1000 patients' liver function test records that include the records of 25 patients with liver disease from a community hospital. We combine support vector data description (SVDD) with data visualisation techniques and the glowworm swarm optimisation (GSO) algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can achieve 96% sensitivity, 86.28% specificity, and 84.28% accuracy. The new method is thus well-suited for diagnosing early liver disease.

Although various scientists and researchers have proposed correlations for this purpose since 1942, but most of these models fail to provide the desired accuracy in prediction of dew-point pressure. Therefore, further improvement is still needed. The objective of this study is to present an improved artificial neural network (ANN) method to predict dew-point pressures in gas condensate reservoirs. The model was developed and tested using a total set of 562 experimental data point from different gas condensate fluids covering a wide range of variables. After a series of optimization processes by monitoring the networks performance, the best network structure was selected. This study also presents a detailed comparison between the results predicted by this ANN model and those of other universal empirical correlations for estimation dew-point pressure. The results showed that the developed model outperforms all the existing methods and provides predictions in acceptable agreement with experimental data. Also it is shown that the improved ANN model is capable of simulating the actual physical trend of the dew-point pressure versus temperature between the cricondenbar and cricondenterm on the phase envelope. Finally, an outlier diagnosis was performed on the whole data set to detect the erroneous measurements from experimental data. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Random Forest for improved analysis efficiency in passive acoustic monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Nocturnal flight call; Machine learning; Random Forest; Bioacoustics; Workflow	CLASSIFICATION; REFLECTIVITY; COUNTS; BIRDS; RADAR; CALLS	Passive acoustic monitoring often leads to large quantities of sound data which are burdensome to process, such that the availability and cost of expert human analysts can be a bottleneck and make ecosystem or landscape-scale projects infeasible. This manuscript presents a method for rapidly analyzing the results of band-limited energy detectors, which are commonly used for the detection of passerine nocturnal flight calls, but which typically are beset by high false positive rates. We first manually classify a subset of the detected events as signals of interest or false detections. From that subset, we build a Random Forest model to eliminate most of the remaining events as false detections without further human inspection. The overall reduction in the labor required to separate signals of interest from false detections can be 80% or more. Additionally, we present an R package, flightcallr, containing functions which can be used to implement this new workflow. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Behbood, V; Lu, J; Zhang, GQ				Behbood, Vahid; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Guangquan			Fuzzy Refinement Domain Adaptation for Long Term Prediction in Banking Ecosystem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bank failure prediction; banking ecosystem; domain adaptation; machine learning	EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; EWS	Long-term bank failure prediction is a challenging real world problem in banking ecosystem and machine learning methods have been recently applied to improve the prediction accuracy. However, traditional machine learning methods assume that the training data and the test data are drawn from the same distribution, which is hard to be met in real world banking applications. This paper proposes a novel algorithm known as fuzzy refinement domain adaptation to solve this problem based on the ecosystem-oriented architecture. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy system and similarity/dissimilarity concepts to modify the target instances' labels which were initially predicted by a shift-unaware prediction model. It employs a classifier to modify the label values of target instances based on their similarity/dissimilarity to the candidate positive and negative instances in mixture domains. Thirty six experiments are performed using three different shift-unaware prediction models. In these experiments bank failure financial data is used to evaluate the algorithm.

LSSVM is a practical machine learning approach that has been broadly utilized in numerous fields. To guarantee its convincing performance, it is crucial to select an appropriate technique in order to obtain the optimized hyper-parameters of LSSVM algorithm. In this paper, an Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (eABC) is used to obtain the ideal value of LSSVM's hyper parameters, which are regularization parameter, gamma and kernel parameter, sigma(2). Later, LSSVM is used as the prediction model. The proposed model was employed in predicting financial time series data and comparison is made against the standard Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Cross Validation (CV) technique. The simulation results assured the accuracy of parameter selection, thus proved the validity in improving the prediction accuracy with acceptable computational time.

Graph kernels provide good similarity measures between molecules. Conventional graph kernels are based on counting common subgraphs of specific types in the molecular graphs. This approach has two primary limitations: (i) only exact subgraph matching is considered in the counting operation, and (ii) most of the subgraphs will be less relevant to a given task. In order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we propose a new graph kernel as an extension of the subtree kernel initially proposed by Ramon and Gartner (2003). The proposed kernel tolerates an inexact match between subgraphs by allowing matching between atoms with similar local environments. In addition, the proposed kernel provides a method to assign an importance weight to each subgraph according to the relevance to the task, which is predetermined by a statistical test. These extensions are evaluated for classification and regression tasks of predicting a wide range of pharmaceutical properties from molecular structures, with promising results.

Such SAR features have thus far mostly been analyzed using descriptive approaches, in particular, on the basis of activity landscape modeling. However, compounds in different local SAR environments have not yet been predicted. Herein, we adapt the emerging chemical patterns (ECP) method, a machine learning approach for compound classification, to systematically predict compounds with different local SAR characteristics. ECP analysis is shown to accurately assign many compounds to different local SAR environments across a variety of activity classes covering the entire range of observed local SARs. Control calculations using random forests and multiclass support vector machines were carried out and a variety of statistical performance measures were applied. In all instances, ECP calculations yielded comparable or better performance than controls. The approach presented herein can be applied to predict compounds that complement local SARs or prioritize compounds with different SAR characteristics.

Contrary to available approaches, we suggest that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact that there are several kinds of AMP that vary in mechanisms of action, structure, mode of interaction with membrane, etc. According to our suggestion for each kind of AMP, a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high efficacy. Consequently, in this paper, a particular but the biggest class of AMP, linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP), has been considered and a newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide in relation to membrane, charge density, propensities to disordered structure and aggregation were studied. On the basis of these characteristics, a new simple algorithm of prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors, hydrophobic moment, charge density and location of the peptide along the membranes, can be used as discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set, our method gives the same level of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP database service tools. For the test set accuracy obtained by our method gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools. The AMP prediction tool based on the considered method is available at http://www.biomedicine.org.ge/dbaasp/.

Our fully automatic methodology uses a statistical shape model to produce diagnostic features tailored to the anatomy of the subject. We propose a computational anatomy approach for measuring shape abnormality in terms of the closest case from a multi-atlas of normal cases. Although other authors have tackled malformation characterization for craniosynostosis in the past, our approach involves several novel contributions (automatic labeling of cranial regions via graph cuts, identification of the closest morphology to a subject using a multi-atlas of normal anatomy, detection of suture fusion, registration using masked regions and diagnosis via classification using quantitative measures of local shape and malformation). Using our automatic technique we obtained for each subject an index of cranial suture fusion, and deformation and curvature discrepancy averages across five cranial bones and six suture regions. Significant differences between normal and craniosynostotic cases were obtained using these characteristics. Machine learning achieved a 92.7% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity for diagnosing craniosynostosis automatically, values comparable to those achieved by trained radiologists. The probability of correctly classifying a new subject is 95.7%. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the difficulties in dealing with these data sets, and in the development of automated machine learning systems which use them as input, is the lack of reliable ground truth information. In this paper we present a new web-based platform for visualization, retrieval and annotation of biosignals by non-technical users, aimed at improving the process of ground truth collection for biomedical applications. Moreover, a novel extendable and scalable data representation model and persistency framework is presented. The results of the experimental evaluation with possible users has further confirmed the potential of the presented framework.

Yet the adoption of such datasets in conservation science may be hindered by a perception that the data are of low quality. This perception likely stems from the propensity of data generated by CS to contain greater levels of variability (e.g., measurement error) or bias (e.g., spatio-temporal clustering) in comparison to data collected by scientists or instruments. Modern analytical approaches can account for many types of error and bias typical of CS datasets. It is possible to (1) describe how pseudo-replication in sampling influences the overall variability in response data using mixed-effects modeling, (2) integrate data to explicitly model the sampling process and account for bias using a hierarchical modeling framework, and (3) examine the relative influence of many different or related explanatory factors using machine learning tools. Information from these modeling approaches can be used to predict species distributions and to estimate biodiversity. Even so, achieving the full potential from CS projects requires meta-data describing the sampling process, reference data to allow for standardization, and insightful modeling suitable to the question of interest.

Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) targets viral replication and increases T-cell counts, but it does not always control macrophage polarization, brain infection or inflammation. Moreover, it remains difficult to identify those at risk for HAND. New therapies that focus on modulating host immune response by making use of biological pathways could prove to be more effective than cART for the treatment of neuroAIDS. Additionally, while numerous HAND biomarkers have been suggested, they are of little use without methods for appropriate data integration and a systems-level interpretation. Machine learning, could be used to develop multifactorial computational models that provide clinicians and researchers with the ability to identify which factors (in what combination and relative importance) are considered important to outcome.

Compared to human perception process, there is actually a gap between low-level features and high-level human perception of emotion. In order to bridge the gap, we propose a three-level affective content analysis framework by introducing mid-level representation to indicate dialog, audio emotional events (e. g., horror sounds and laughters) and textual concepts (e.g., informative keywords). Mid-level representation is obtained from machine learning on low-level features and used to infer high-level affective content. We further apply the proposed framework and focus on a number of case studies. Audio emotional event, dialog and subtitle are studied to assist affective content detection in different video domains/genres. Multiple modalities are considered for affective analysis, since different modality has its own merit to evoke emotions. Experimental results shows the proposed framework is effective and efficient for affective content analysis. Audio emotional event, dialog and subtitle are promising mid-level representations.

Are smooth intensity changes due to shading or material properties? For stereo: Which point in the left image corresponds to which point in the right one? What is the role of color in visual information processing? To answer these (seemingly different) questions we develop an analogy between the role of orientation in organizing visual cortex and tangents in differential geometry. Machine learning experiments suggest using geometry as a surrogate for high-order statistical interactions. The cortical columnar architecture becomes a bundle structure in geometry. Connection forms within these bundles suggest answers to the above questions, and curvatures emerge in key roles. More generally, our path through these questions suggests an overall strategy for solving the inverse problems of vision: decompose the global problems into networks of smaller ones and then seek constraints from these coupled problems to reduce ambiguity. Neural computations thus amount to satisfying constraints rather than seeking uniform approximations. Even when no global formulation exists one may be able to find localized structures on which ambiguity is minimal; these can then anchor an overall approximation.

Entities studied include depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer dementia. We review these recent studies which-despite the optimism from some articles-predominantly constitute explorative efforts at the proof-of-concept level. There is some evidence that, in particular, support vector machines seem to be promising. However, the field is still far from real clinical application, and much work has to be done regarding data preprocessing, model optimization, and validation. Reporting standards are proposed to facilitate future meta-analyses or systematic reviews.

Robust generalized eigenvalue classifier with ellipsoidal uncertainty	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Robust optimization; Generalized eigenvalue classification; Uncertainty	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REGULARIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; REGRESSION; PROGRAMS; NETWORKS	Uncertainty is a concept associated with data acquisition and analysis, usually appearing in the form of noise or measure error, often due to some technological constraint. In supervised learning, uncertainty affects classification accuracy and yields low quality solutions. For this reason, it is essential to develop machine learning algorithms able to handle efficiently data with imprecision. In this paper we study this problem from a robust optimization perspective. We consider a supervised learning algorithm based on generalized eigenvalues and we provide a robust counterpart formulation and solution in case of ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust scheme on artificial and benchmark datasets from University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and we compare results against a robust implementation of Support Vector Machines.

A set of features is constructed to describe the structure and sequence of the entire protein chain. Furthermore, a qualitative relationship is established between the calculated features and the underlying electromagnetic interaction that dominates this scale. The features we use are associated with residue-residue distances, residue-solvent distances, pairwise knowledge-based potentials and a four-body potential. In addition, we introduce a new target to be predicted, the fitness score, which measures the similarity of a model to the native structure. This new approach enables us to obtain information both from decoys and from native structures. It is also devoid of previous problems associated with knowledge-based potentials. These features were obtained for a large set of native and decoy structures and a back-propagating neural network was trained to predict the fitness score. Overall this new scoring potential proved to be superior to the knowledge-based scoring functions used as its inputs. In particular, in the latest CASP (CASP10) experiment our method was ranked third for all targets, and second for freely modeled hard targets among about 200 groups for top model prediction. Ours was the only method ranked in the top three for all targets and for hard targets. This shows that initial results from the novel approach are able to capture details that were missed by a broad spectrum of protein structure prediction approaches.

Temperate broadleaf forests in western Asia such as the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran have already suffered from intense anthropogenic activities. In those regions, forests mainly extend in rough terrain and comprise different stand structures, which are difficult to discriminate. This paper explores the joint analysis of Landsat7/ETM+, L-band SAR and their derived parameters and the effect of terrain corrections to overcome the challenges of discriminating forest stand age classes in mountain regions. We also verified the performances of three machine learning methods which have recently shown promising results using multisource data; support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forest (RF) and one traditional classifier (i.e., maximum likelihood classification (MLC)) as a benchmark. The non-topographically corrected ETM+ data failed to differentiate among different forest stand age classes (average classification accuracy (OA) = 65%). This confirms the need to reduce relief effects prior data classification in mountain regions. SAR backscattering alone cannot properly differentiate among different forest stand age classes (OA = 62%). However, textures and PolSAR features are very efficient for the separation of forest classes (OA = 82%). The highest classification accuracy was achieved by the joint usage of SAR and ETM+ (OA = 86%). However, this shows a slight improvement compared to the ETM+ classification (OA = 84%). The machine learning classifiers proved t o be more robust and accurate compared to MLC. SVM and RF statistically produced better classification results than NN in the exploitation of the considered multi-source data.

In this paper, we present an empirical study of human movement detection and identification using a set of PIR sensors. We have developed a data collection module having two pairs of PIR sensors orthogonally aligned and modified Fresnel lenses. We have placed three PIR-based modules in a hallway for monitoring people; one module on the ceiling; two modules on opposite walls facing each other. We have collected a data set from eight subjects when walking in three different conditions: two directions (back and forth), three distance intervals (close to one wall sensor, in the middle, close to the other wall sensor) and three speed levels (slow, moderate, fast). We have used two types of feature sets: a raw data set and a reduced feature set composed of amplitude and time to peaks; and passage duration extracted from each PIR sensor. We have performed classification analysis with well-known machine learning algorithms, including instance-based learning and support vector machine. Our findings show that with the raw data set captured from a single PIR sensor of each of the three modules, we could achieve more than 92% accuracy in classifying the direction and speed of movement, the distance interval and identifying subjects. We could also achieve more than 94% accuracy in classifying the direction, speed and distance and identifying subjects using the reduced feature set extracted from two pairs of PIR sensors of each of the three modules.

However, several challenges remain for researchers as how to define the relationship between reported physical activities, mood and social interaction to define an active lifestyle. We are conducting a project, ATHENA(activity-awareness for human-engaged wellness applications) to design and integrate the relationship between these basic health primitives to approximate the human lifestyle and real-time recommendations for wellbeing services. Our goal is to develop a system to promote an active lifestyle for individuals and to recommend to them valuable interventions by making comparisons to their past habits. The proposed system processes sensory data through our developed machine learning algorithms inside smart devices and utilizes cloud infrastructure to reduce the cost. We exploit big data infrastructure for massive sensory data storage and fast retrieval for recommendations. Our contributions include the development of a prototype system to promote an active lifestyle and a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing self-motivation. We believe that our study will impact the design of future ubiquitous wellness applications.

Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) approach has been employed to develop intelligent models for the application of interest. The required data for modeling purposes include the experimentally measured equilibrium data of (H2O + MEA + CO2), (H2O + DEA + CO2), and (H2O + TEA + CO2) systems reported in the literature. The optimum parameters of the proposed models have been obtained using Coupled Simulating Annealing (CSA) technique. According to the error analysis results, the models predictions are in satisfactory agreement with corresponding target values with R-squared of greater than 0.98 and the absolute average relative deviation percent (%AARD) to be less than 6.5% for all studied systems.

In addition, due to separation of liquids, the produced gas has fewer valuable components. This study tries to develop a dependable method based on machine learning to adequately predict this important parameter. The intelligent system used in this work is Radial Basis Function (RBF) network that is a very flexible tool for pattern recognition. This model was developed and tested using a total set of 562 experimental data point acquired from different retrograde gas condensate fluids covering a wide range of variables. To optimize the tuning parameters of the proposed model, genetic algorithm was incorporated. This study also presents a detailed comparison between the results predicted by the proposed RBF model and those of other universal empirical correlations and intelligent systems for estimation dew-point pressure. The results showed that the presented model is superior to the pervious classic correlations and also intelligent systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine-learned Bayesian Belief Networks (ml-BBNs) accurately estimate outcomes in CC, providing clinicians with Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) tools to facilitate treatment planning. We evaluated ml-BBNs ability to estimate survival and recurrence in CC. We performed a retrospective analysis of registry data of patients with CC to train-test-crossvalidate ml-BBNs using the Department of Defense Automated Central Tumor Registry (January 1993 to December 2004). Cases with events or follow-up that passed quality control were stratified into 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival cohorts. ml-BBNs were trained using machine-learning algorithms and k-fold crossvalidation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis used for validation. BBNs were comprised of 5301 patients and areas under the curve ranged from 0.85 to 0.90. Positive predictive values for recurrence and mortality ranged from 78 to 84 per cent and negative predictive values from 74 to 90 per cent by survival cohort. In the 12-month model alone, 1,132,462,080 unique rule sets allow physicians to predict individual recurrence/mortality estimates. Patients with Stage II (N0M0) CC benefit from chemotherapy at different rates. At one year, all patients older than 73 years of age with T2-4 tumors and abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen levels benefited, whereas at five years, all had relative reduction in mortality with the largest benefit amongst elderly, highest T-stage patients. ml-BBN can readily predict which high-risk patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. CDSS tools yield individualized, clinically relevant estimates of outcomes to assist clinicians in treatment planning.

Personalized medicine and gene therapy will confluence the days to come. This review highlights traditional approaches as well as current advancements in the analysis of the gene expression data from cancer perspective. Due to improvements in biometric instrumentation and automation, it has become easier to collect a lot of experimental data in molecular biology. Analysis of such data is extremely important as it leads to knowledge discovery that can be validated by experiments. Previously, the diagnosis of complex genetic diseases has conventionally been done based on the non-molecular characteristics like kind of tumor tissue, pathological characteristics, and clinical phase. The microarray data can be well accounted for high dimensional space and noise. Same were the reasons for ineffective and imprecise results. Several machine learning and data mining techniques are presently applied for identifying cancer using gene expression data. While differences in efficiency do exist, none of the well-established approaches is uniformly superior to others. The quality of algorithm is important, but is not in itself a guarantee of the quality of a specific data analysis.	[Jauhari, Shaurya; Rizvi, S. A.

In recent years, via integrating ensemble learning, the ensemble learning based feature selection approach has been proposed and studied. The general idea is to generate multiple diverse feature selectors and combine their outputs. This approach is superior to conventional feature selection methods in many aspects. Among them, its most prominent advantage is the ability to handle stability issue that is usually poor in existing feature selection methods. This review covers different issues related to ensemble learning based feature selection, which include the main modules, the stability measurement, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that focuses on ensemble feature selection. It can be a useful reference in the literature of feature selection.

However, its distributed nature leads to operational brittleness and difficulty in identifying the root causes of performance and availability issues, especially when the involved systems span multiple administrative domains. The first step to address this fragmentation is coordinated measurement: we propose to complement the current Internet's data and control planes with a measurement plane, or mPlane for short. mPlane's distributed measurement infrastructure collects and analyzes traffic measurements at a wide variety of scales to monitor the network status. Its architecture is centered on a flexible control interface, allowing the incorporation of existing measurement tools through lightweight mPlane proxy components, and offering dynamic support for new capabilities. A focus on automated, iterative measurement makes the platform well-suited to troubleshooting support. This is supported by a reasoning system, which applies machine learning algorithms to learn from success and failure in drilling down to the root cause of a problem. This article describes the mPlane architecture and shows its applicability to several distributed measurement problems involving content delivery networks and Internet service roviders. A first case study presents the tracking and iterative analysis of cache selection policies in Akamai, while a second example focuses on the cooperation between Internet service providers and content delivery networks to better orchestrate their traffic engineering decisions and jointly improve their performance.

Identifying Roadway Surface Disruptions Based on Accelerometer Patterns	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						road surface disruptions; RSD; mobile computing; mobile sensing; machine learning algorithms		In developed countries large-scale technology is used for the monitoring and management of road infrastructure. Sensor networks together with surveillance cameras help identify elements disturbing cars' mobility. On the contrary, in developing countries, the lack of this level of infrastructure makes the task of roads' maintenance and traffic control challenging. The presence of roadway surface disruptions (RSDs), in particular, affects the economy and reputation of individuals and companies. Urban computing strategies can be adopted to collect data about the presence of RSDs and be applied to monitor traffic related issues. The implementation of such level of navigation assistance could help save freight and money to companies and authorities, and even reduce cars' accidents. In this direction, current mobile technologies can help with the identification and location of road imperfections alerting drivers about alternative routes. In this paper we present our work that seeks to enable citizens' cars as road watchers. By means of the mobile phones' acceleration sensing capabilities we are identifying and tagging the presence of RSDs. Using Android-based devices situated on the copilot floor side of a car, 5 Mbytes of road information has been collected. We run a series of experiments aiming to differentiate acceleration patterns associated to potholes, speed bumps, metal humps and rough roads. Currently, the classification of disruptions is being experimented with techniques from the field of Machine Learning (ML) such as artificial neuronal networks and logistic regression. Classification of individual events is over 86% of accuracy that is competitive with those reported in the literature. In this work we provide the first public dataset that could be used by other researchers to offer more insight in this problem.	[Gonzalez, L. C.; Martinez, F.; Carlos, M.

J	Verkeenko, MS				Verkeenko, M. S.			Development of an algorithm for fast corner points detection	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEMS SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL			English	Article								A method for detecting corner points in digital images is presented. The method is distinguished by high stability and efficiency compared with many method for detecting corner points developed earlier. The stability of corner detection is especially important in computer vision tasks connected with matching images of the same object, recovering digital surface models based on a set of images, and tracking objects. The overwhelming majority of algorithms detect equally well both correct corners and excessive points not corresponding to real corners of objects. The presented algorithm does have this disadvantage, and it can be used in frame-to-frame processing video in real time, e.g. in navigation systems of mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles. In addition, the proposed algorithm may be adapted to any data set since it is based on the machine learning method. The advantages of the developed method are demonstrated by an example of detection of corners in images of a typical hangar and in images with the international space station.

This measurement requires extremely precise estimation of very small galaxy shape distortions, in the presence of far larger intrinsic galaxy shapes and distortions due to the blurring kernel caused by the atmosphere, telescope optics, and instrumental effects. The GREAT3 challenge is posed to the astronomy, machine learning, and statistics communities, and includes tests of three specific effects that are of immediate relevance to upcoming weak lensing surveys, two of which have never been tested in a community challenge before. These effects include many novel aspects including realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from space; a spatially varying, physically motivated blurring kernel; and a combination of multiple different exposures. To facilitate entry by people new to the field, and for use as a diagnostic tool, the simulation software for the challenge is publicly available, though the exact parameters used for the challenge are blinded. Sample scripts to analyze the challenge data using existing methods will also be provided.

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING TECHNIQUE FOR SALMONELLA ENTERITIDIS AND TYPHIMURIUM ON AGAR PLATES	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Hyperspectral imaging; Pathogen detection; Salmonella Enteritidis; Salmonella Typhimurium; Agar plate; Chicken carcass rinse; Background microflora	POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; SEROTYPE ENTERITIDIS; UNITED-STATES; QUALITY	Salmonella is a common cause of foodborne disease resulting from the consumption of contaminated food products: Although a direct plating method is widely used for presumptive positive screening of pathogenic Salmonella colonies on agar plates, it is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and also prone to human errors. This article reports the development of a hyperspectral imaging technique for automated screening of the two common serotypes of Salmonella, Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST), grown on agar plates and for differentiating them from background microflora often found in poultry carcass rinses. Visible near-infrared hyperspectral imaging, providing the spectral and spatial information unique to each microorganism, was utilized to differentiate SE and ST from the background microflora on brilliant green sulfa (BGS) and/or xylose lysine tergitol 4 (XLT4) agar plates. Five different machine-learning algorithms including Mahalanobis distance (MD), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in addition to a multivariate data analysis method, the principal component analysis (PCA), were compared to determine the best classification algorithm in Salmonella detection and classification. When trained on the data from pure cultures of Salmonella and known background microflora, the classification accuracy of each classification algorithm in detecting Salmonella on BGS agar was about 98% on average, although it was difficult to differentiate between SE and ST. The classification accuracy in detecting Salmonella colonies on XL,T4 agar was about 88% on average while the detection accuracy for ST colonies were over 99%.

Extensive evidences support the new hypothesis. We collected 390 well-known beautiful face images (e.g., Miss Universe, movie stars, and super models) as well as 409 common face images from multiple sources. Dozens of volunteers rated the face images according to their attractiveness. Statistical regression models are trained on this database. Under the empirical risk principle, the hypothesis is tested on 318,801 pairs of images and receives consistently supportive results. A corollary of the hypothesis is attractive facial geometric features construct a convex set. This corollary derives a convex hull based face beautification method, which guarantees attractiveness and minimizes the before-after difference. Experimental results show its superiority to state-of-the-art geometric based face beautification methods. Moreover, the mainstream hypotheses on facial beauty perception (e.g., the averageness, symmetry, and golden ratio hypotheses) are proved to be compatible with the proposed hypothesis.

J	Remus, DA				Remus, Dana A.			The Uncertain Promise of Predictive Coding	IOWA LAW REVIEW			English	Article							ELECTRONIC DISCOVERY; LITIGATION; REFORM; ABUSE; COST	Increasingly, machine-learning technologies known as "predictive coding" are automating document review in discovery practice. Recent law school graduates may lament the impact on entry-level law hiring, but the litigation community is embracing the new technologies. Proponents contend that by replacing the unreliable and inconsistent discretion of lawyers with the mechanized objectivity of computers, predictive-coding technologies can solve both the practical problems of e-discovery and the deeper-seated problems of excess, abuse, and trust that have long plagued discovery practice. In this Article, I advise caution in the adoption of predictive-coding technologies. These technologies hold unquestionable potential as a means of coping with unmanageable datasets, but they entail costs as well as benefits. I argue that if lawyers ignore these costs, they will unwittingly abdicate control to computer scientists and vendors, compromising the profession's jurisdiction and undermining lawyers' ability to serve clients and the judicial system. I conclude that the profession has an ethical obligation to explore the costs as well as the benefits of predictive coding, and to play a more active role in its design and use.

This approach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app in a "stand-alone" fashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time to distill useful information. We discuss the desired properties of risk signals and relative risk scores for Android apps in order to generate another metric that users can utilize when choosing apps. We present a wide range of techniques to generate both risk signals and risk scores that are based on heuristics as well as principled machine learning techniques. Experimental results conducted using real-world data sets show that these methods can effectively identify malware as very risky, are simple to understand, and easy to use.

For two vertices u and v, the hitting time H-uv is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from u to v. The commute distance is its symmetrized version C-uv = H-uv + H-vu. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph tends to infinity. We focus on random geometric graphs (epsilon-graphs, kNN graphs and Gaussian similarity graphs), but our results also extend to graphs with a given expected degree distribution or Erd6s-Renyi graphs with planted partitions. We prove that in these graph families, the suitably rescaled hitting time H uv converges to 1/d(v) and the rescaled commute time to 1/d(u) + 1/d(v) where du and dv denote the degrees of vertices u and v. In these cases, hitting and commute times do not provide information about the structure of the graph, and their use is discouraged in many machine learning applications.

J	Lin, YP; Yang, YH; Jung, TP				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Yang, Yi-Hsuan; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Fusion of electroencephalographic dynamics and musical contents for estimating emotional responses in music listening	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; emotion classification; affective brain-computer interface; music signal processing; music listening	INFINITY REFERENCE; UNPLEASANT MUSIC; BRAIN-REGIONS; EEG; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; COMMUNICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RECORDINGS	Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion classification during music listening has gained increasing attention nowadays due to its promise of potential applications such as musical affective brain-computer interface (ABCI), neuromarketing, music therapy, and implicit multimedia tagging and triggering. However, music is an ecologically valid and complex stimulus that conveys certain emotions to listeners through compositions of musical elements. Using solely EEG signals to distinguish emotions remained challenging. This study aimed to assess the applicability of a multimodal approach by leveraging the EEG dynamics and acoustic characteristics of musical contents for the classification of emotional valence and arousal. To this end, this study adopted machine-learning methods to systematically elucidate the roles of the EEG and music modalities in the emotion modeling. The empirical results suggested that when whole-head EEG signals were available, the inclusion of musical contents did not improve the classification performance. The obtained performance of 74 similar to 76% using solely EEG modality was statistically comparable to that using the multimodality approach. However, if EEG dynamics were only available from a small set of electrodes (likely the case in real-life applications), the music modality would play a complementary role and augment the EEG results from around 61-67% in valence classification and from around 58-67% in arousal classification. The musical timber appeared to replace less-discriminative EEG features and led to improvements in both valence and arousal classification, whereas musical loudness was contributed specifically to the arousal classification. The present study not only provided principles for constructing an EEG-based multimodal approach, but also revealed the fundamental insights into the interplay of the brain activity and musical contents in emotion modeling.

Hence, iron castings(1) are subject to very strict controls to assure the quality of the manufactured castings. One of the type of flaws that may appear in the castings are defects on the surface; in particular, our work focuses in inclusions, cold laps and misruns. We propose a new approach that detects imperfections on the surface using a segmentation method that marks the regions of the casting that may be affected by some of these defects and, then, applies machine-learning techniques to classify the regions in correct or in the different types of faults. We show that this method obtains high precision rates.

Errors in model structure, parameter and data lead to both random and systematic error even in the output of a calibrated model. We develop complementary data-driven models (DDMs) to reduce the predictive error of physically-based groundwater models. Two machine learning techniques, the instance-based weighting and support vector regression, are used to build the DDMs. This approach is illustrated using two real-world case studies of the Republican River Compact Administration model and the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie model. The two groundwater models have different hydrogeologic settings, parameterization, and calibration methods. In the first case study, cluster analysis is introduced for data preprocessing to make the DDMs more robust and computationally efficient. The DDMs reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction of piezometric head of the groundwater model by 82%, 60%, and 48%, respectively. In the second case study, the DDMs reduce the RMSE of the temporal prediction of piezometric head of the groundwater model by 77%. It is further demonstrated that the effectiveness of the DDMs depends on the existence and extent of the structure in the error of the physically-based model.

A main difficulty is the non-uniqueness of the solution: a task-space trajectory has multiple joint-space trajectories associated, therefore averaging over non-convex solution space needs to be done if treated as a regression problem. A second class of difficulties arise for those robots when the physical model is either too complex or even not available. In this situation machine learning methods may be a suitable alternative to classical approaches. We propose a learning framework for tracking control that is applicable for underactuated or non-rigid robots where an analytical physical model of the robot is unavailable. The proposed framework builds on the insight that tracking problems are well defined in the joint task- and joint-space coordinates and consequently predictions can be obtained via local optimization. Physical experiments show that state-of-the art accuracy can be achieved in both online and offline tracking control learning. Furthermore, we show that the presented method is capable of controlling underactuated robot architectures as well.

Using geographic coordinates of previous incidents in coincidence with spatial layers corresponding to environmental variables, we can produce probability maps in geographic and temporal space. Here, we evaluate spatial statistic and machine learning approaches to answer an important space-time question: where and when are wildland search and rescue (WiSAR) incidents most likely to occur within Yosemite National Park (YNP)? We produced a monthly probability map for the year 2011 based on the presence and background learning (PBL) algorithm that successfully forecasts the most likely areas of WiSAR incident occurrence based on environmental variables (distance to anthropogenic and natural features, vegetation, elevation, and slope) and the overlap with historic incidents from 2001 to 2010. This will allow decision-makers to spatially allocate resources where and when incidents are most likely to occur. In the process, we not only answered questions related to a real-world problem but also used novel space-time analyses that give us insight into machine learning principles. The GIScience findings from this applied research have major implications for best practices in future space-time research in the fields of epidemiology and ecological niche modeling.

However, most such methods only depend on the relative differences between samples instead of their particular values, and thus one useful approach is to directly estimate the pairwise distances between all samples in the data set. This is accomplished by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to the data, and using it to derive estimates for the distances. A variant of the model for high-dimensional data with missing values is also studied. Experimental simulations confirm that the proposed method provides accurate estimates compared to alternative methods for estimating distances. In particular, using the mixture model for estimating distances is on average more accurate than using the same model to impute any missing values and then calculating distances. The experimental evaluation additionally shows that more accurately estimating distances lead to improved prediction performance for classification and regression tasks when used as inputs for a neural network.

A neurology-inspired model of web usage	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Decision making; Web usage mining; Web user; Diffusion model; Stochastic simulation; Meshless	DECISION-MAKING; REACTION-TIME; EXACT SIMULATION; KNOWLEDGE-BASE; CHOICE; NAVIGATION; PROFILES; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; MACAQUE	The problem of predicting human behavior has been a great challenge for several disciplines including computer science. In particular, web user browsing behavior has been studied from the machine learning point of view, a field that has been coined web usage mining (WUM). However, current WUM techniques can be negatively impacted by changes in web site structure and content (e.g. Web 2.0). The key reason behind this issue may be that machine learning algorithms learn the observed behavior according to a particular training set, but do not model the user behavior under different conditions. We propose a simulation model that mimics human interaction with the web by recovering observed navigational steps. This web usage model is inspired by a neurophysiology's stochastic description of decision making and by the information utility of web page content. The proposed model corresponds to a high-dimensional stochastic process based on the leaky competing accumulator (LCA) neural model. We solve high-dimensional issues by considering a mesh-less symbolic interpolation. As a proof-of-concept we test the web user simulation system on an academic web site by recovering most of the observed behavior (73%). Therefore, our approach operationally describes web users that seem to react as observed users confronted by changes in the web site interface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To the best of our knowledge, most existing methods for image resizing are unsupervised. These unsupervised methods may either fail to protect the interesting regions or cause distortion of the image structure. This paper presents a novel learning based method for seam carving by incorporating the learned boundary of the important content. Specifically, a novel boundary model of the region of interest (ROI) is learned on a set of training images at first. Then the boundary of an input image is utilized as a key prior in performing seam carving to obtain the target image. The proposed method for image resizing can generate much less seams cutting through the ROI compared with previous efforts toward the same goal. Thus, the desirable regions can be preserved in the target image and the structural consistency of the input image is naturally maintained. Experiments on two publicly available data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

On the multi-agent learning neural and Bayesian methods in skin detector and pornography classifier: An automated anti-pornography system	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Skin detector; Pornography classifier; Bayesian method; Neural network	RELIABILITY; NETWORK; SITES	The main objective on this study proposed anti-pornography system works on four machine learning methods in two different stages namely skin detector stage and pornography classifier stage. A multi-agent learning is used twice. In the first stage, we propose a multi-agent learning method that combines the Bayesian method with a grouping histogram (GH) technique and the back-propagation neural network with a segment adjacent-nested (SAN) technique based on the YCbCr and RGB colour spaces respectively, to extract skin regions from the image accurately with taking into consideration the problems of the light-changing conditions, skin-like colour and reflection from glass and water. In the second stage, the features from the skin are extracted to classify the images into either pornographic or non-pornographic. Inaccurate classification occurs when different image sizes are used in the existing anti-pornography systems. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-agent learning that combines the Bayesian method with a grouping histogram technique again to extract the features from the skin detection based on YCbCr colour space and the back propagation neural network method using shape features extracted again from skin detection. The classification of the pornographic images becomes more robust to the variation in images sizes. The findings from this study have shown that the proposed multi-agent learning system for skin detection has produced a significant rate of true positives (TP) (i.e., 98.44%). In addition, it has achieved a significant low average rate for the false positives (FP) (i.e., only 0.14%) while the proposed multi-agent learning for pornography classifier has produced significant rates of TP (i.e., 96%). Moreover, it has achieved a significant low average rate of FP (i.e., only 2.67%). The experimental results show that multi-agent learning in the skin detector and pornography classifier are more efficient than other approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Current practices, however, mainly focus on a limited amount of wavelength bands while more information could be extracted from other wavelengths in the full range (400-2500 nm) spectrum. In this research, leaf characteristics were estimated from a field-based multi-species dataset, covering a wide range in leaf structures and Chl concentrations. The dataset contains leaves with extremely high Chl concentrations (>100 mu g cm(-2)), which are seldom estimated. Parameter retrieval was conducted with the machine learning regression algorithm Gaussian Processes (GP), which is able to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting for complex datasets. Moreover, insight in relevant bands is provided during the development of a regression model. Consequently, the physical meaning of the model can be explored. Best estimates of SLA, LWC and Chl yielded a best obtained normalized root mean square error of 6.0%, 7.7%, 9.1%, respectively. Several distinct wavebands were chosen across the whole spectrum. A band in the red edge (710 nm) appeared to be most important for the estimation of Chl. Interestingly, spectral features related to biochemicals with a structural or carbon storage function (e.g. 1090, 1550, 1670, 1730 nm) were found important not only for estimation of SLA, but also for LWC, Chl or N estimation. Similar, Chl estimation was also helped by some wavebands related to water content (950, 1430 nm) due to correlation between the parameters. It is shown that leaf parameter retrieval by GP regression is successful, and able to cope with large structural differences between leaves. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Application of genetic algorithms and constructive neural networks for the analysis of microarray cancer data	THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO)	MAR 18-20, 2013	Granada, SPAIN	Univ Grenada, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Spanish Chapter, SBV Improver, Illumina, e Hlth Business Dev Bull Espana S A, Univ Grenada, Fac Sci, Univ Grenada, Dept Comp Architecture & Comp Technol, Univ Granada, CITIC UGR	Univ Grenada, Fac Sci		EXPRESSION DATA; FEATURE-SELECTION; BREAST-CANCER; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CELL-LINES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; MAMMARY; BIOINFORMATICS; IDENTIFICATION	Background: Extracting relevant information from microarray data is a very complex task due to the characteristics of the data sets, as they comprise a large number of features while few samples are generally available. In this sense, feature selection is a very important aspect of the analysis helping in the tasks of identifying relevant genes and also for maximizing predictive information. Methods: Due to its simplicity and speed, Stepwise Forward Selection (SFS) is a widely used feature selection technique. In this work, we carry a comparative study of SFS and Genetic Algorithms (GA) as general frameworks for the analysis of microarray data with the aim of identifying group of genes with high predictive capability and biological relevance. Six standard and machine learning-based techniques (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), C-MANTEC Constructive Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP)) are used within both frameworks using six free-public datasets for the task of predicting cancer outcome. Results: Better cancer outcome prediction results were obtained using the GA framework noting that this approach, in comparison to the SFS one, leads to a larger selection set, uses a large number of comparison between genetic profiles and thus it is computationally more intensive. Also the GA framework permitted to obtain a set of genes that can be considered to be more biologically relevant. Regarding the different classifiers used standard feedforward neural networks (MLP), LDA and SVM lead to similar and best results, while C-MANTEC and k NN followed closely but with a lower accuracy. Further, C-MANTEC, MLP and LDA permitted to obtain a more limited set of genes in comparison to SVM, NB and kNN, and in particular C-MANTEC resulted in the most robust classifier in terms of changes in the parameter settings. Conclusions: This study shows that if prediction accuracy is the objective, the GA-based approach lead to better results respect to the SFS approach, independently of the classifier used. Regarding classifiers, even if C-MANTEC did not achieve the best overall results, the performance was competitive with a very robust behaviour in terms of the parameters of the algorithm, and thus it can be considered as a candidate technique for future studies.

Although logical strategies of genetic engineering have been established, protein overexpression is still an art. In particular, heterologous expression is often hindered by low level of production and frequent fail due to opaque reasons. The problem is accentuated because there is no generic solution available to enhance heterologous overexpression. For a given protein, the extent of its solubility can indicate the quality of its function. Over 30% of synthesized proteins are not soluble. In certain experimental circumstances, including temperature, expression host, etc., protein solubility is a feature eventually defined by its sequence. Until now, numerous methods based on machine learning are proposed to predict the solubility of protein merely from its amino acid sequence. In spite of the 20 years of research on the matter, no comprehensive review is available on the published methods. Results: This paper presents an extensive review of the existing models to predict protein solubility in Escherichia coli recombinant protein overexpression system. The models are investigated and compared regarding the datasets used, features, feature selection methods, machine learning techniques and accuracy of prediction. A discussion on the models is provided at the end. Conclusions: This study aims to investigate extensively the machine learning based methods to predict recombinant protein solubility, so as to offer a general as well as a detailed understanding for researches in the field. Some of the models present acceptable prediction performances and convenient user interfaces. These models can be considered as valuable tools to predict recombinant protein overexpression results before performing real laboratory experiments, thus saving labour, time and cost.

Most of the current approaches address this problem by using consensus models that operate at the prediction level. We explore the possibility to directly combine these sources at the knowledge level, with the aim to harvest potentially increased synergy at an earlier stage. Our goal is to design a general methodology to facilitate knowledge discovery and produce accurate and interpretable models. Results: To combine models at the knowledge level, we propose to decouple the learning phase from the knowledge application phase using a pivot representation (lingua franca) based on the concept of hypothesis. A hypothesis is a simple and interpretable knowledge unit. Regardless of its origin, knowledge is broken down into a collection of hypotheses. These hypotheses are subsequently organised into hierarchical network. This unification permits to combine different sources of knowledge into a common formalised framework. The approach allows us to create a synergistic system between different forms of knowledge and new algorithms can be applied to leverage this unified model. This first article focuses on the general principle of the Self Organising Hypothesis Network (SOHN) approach in the context of binary classification problems along with an illustrative application to the prediction of mutagenicity. Conclusion: It is possible to represent knowledge in the unified form of a hypothesis network allowing interpretable predictions with performances comparable to mainstream machine learning techniques. This new approach offers the potential to combine knowledge from different sources into a common framework in which high level reasoning and meta-learning can be applied; these latter perspectives will be explored in future work.

J	Han, H				Han, Henry			Derivative component analysis for mass spectral serum proteomic profiles	BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Translational Bioinformatics Conference (TBC) / ISCB-Asia	OCT 02-04, 2013	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	ISCB Asia			MOLECULAR-PATTERN DISCOVERY; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; BIOMARKER DISCOVERY; MATRIX FACTORIZATION; TUMOR CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Background: As a promising way to transform medicine, mass spectrometry based proteomics technologies have seen a great progress in identifying disease biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, there is a lack of effective feature selection methods that are able to capture essential data behaviors to achieve clinical level disease diagnosis. Moreover, it faces a challenge from data reproducibility, which means that no two independent studies have been found to produce same proteomic patterns. Such reproducibility issue causes the identified biomarker patterns to lose repeatability and prevents it from real clinical usage. Methods: In this work, we propose a novel machine-learning algorithm: derivative component analysis (DCA) for high-dimensional mass spectral proteomic profiles. As an implicit feature selection algorithm, derivative component analysis examines input proteomics data in a multi-resolution approach by seeking its derivatives to capture latent data characteristics and conduct de-noising. We further demonstrate DCA's advantages in disease diagnosis by viewing input proteomics data as a profile biomarker via integrating it with support vector machines to tackle the reproducibility issue, besides comparing it with state-of-the-art peers. Results: Our results show that high-dimensional proteomics data are actually linearly separable under proposed derivative component analysis (DCA). As a novel multi-resolution feature selection algorithm, DCA not only overcomes the weakness of the traditional methods in subtle data behavior discovery, but also suggests an effective resolution to overcoming proteomics data's reproducibility problem and provides new techniques and insights in translational bioinformatics and machine learning. The DCA-based profile biomarker diagnosis makes clinical level diagnostic performances reproducible across different proteomic data, which is more robust and systematic than the existing biomarker discovery based diagnosis. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and power of the proposed DCA-based profile biomarker diagnosis in achieving high sensitivity and conquering the data reproducibility issue in serum proteomics. Furthermore, our proposed derivative component analysis suggests the subtle data characteristics gleaning and de-noising are essential in separating true signals from red herrings for high-dimensional proteomic profiles, which can be more important than the conventional feature selection or dimension reduction. In particular, our profile biomarker diagnosis can be generalized to other omics data for derivative component analysis (DCA)'s nature of generic data analysis.
