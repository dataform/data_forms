The scope of this research is to study whether the usage of machine learning techniques can be useful in dealing with this problem. Subsequently, an attempt was made to identifying the most appropriate learning algorithm for the prediction of students' dropout. A number of experiments have taken place with data provided by the 'informatics' course of the Hellenic Open University and a quite interesting conclusion is that the Naive Bayes algorithm. can be successfully used. A prototype web based support tool, which can automatically recognize students with high probability of dropout, has been constructed by implementing this algorithm.

Most existing data clustering algorithms need the number of clusters as an input. The present paper introduces a graphical method that outputs the number of clusters. Once the number of clusters is calculated, other clustering algorithms may use it. This method is cubic in the number of input data. Given that most of the databases axe extremely big, it is convenient to choose a random sample to make a faster detection of the clusters. However, not only is speed important but the level of confidence in this method is as well. So the level of accuracy is calculated for each run of the algorithm. Three different sampling algorithms have been used in order to choose the random sample. The efficiency of the three algorithms has been compared based on the number of clusters that they detect and the running time. In addition, depending on the number of points in each cluster, central points or spies that cover the clusters are assigned to each cluster. In order to have a complete vision of the evolution of data clustering and the future tendencies of the clusters, a time series analysis was conducted as well. All the tests have been conducted using datasets from the UCI Machine learning repository and artificially generated datasets. We present the experimental results and show the effect of sampling algorithms and the number of clusters.

However, due to the great amount and diversity of users, some kind of adaptation is needed. In this paper present a user model constructed from users' interaction data and we will specially designed to provide a general framework for adaptation tasks in an open web-based adaptive collaborative environment. The user model proposed should be explicit and flexible and to this end we claim that a combination of knowledge based and machine learning techniques is adequate. Finally we will briefly present the adaptation tasks proposed up to now and the results obtained from a first preliminary empirical evaluation.

It started in 1997 with the aim to build a self-learning auto pilot for a single handed sailing yacht. The goal was to make an adaptive system that would help a single handed sailor to go faster on average in a race. Presently, after five years of development and a number of sea trials, we have a commercial system available (wvvrw.robosail.com). It is a hybrid system using agent technology, machine learning, data mining and rule-based reasoning. Apart from describing the system we try to generalize our findings, and argue that sailing is an interesting paradigm for a class of hybrid systems that one could call Skill-based Systems.

They often perform well even in domains where this assumption is not really true. However, they may fail badly when the degree of attribute dependencies becomes critical. In this paper, we examine methods for detecting deviations from independence. These dependencies give rise to "interactions" between attributes which affect the performance of learning algorithms. We first formally define the degree of interaction between attributes through the deviation of the best possible "voting" classifier from the true relation between the class and the attributes in a domain. Then we propose a practical heuristic for detecting attribute interactions, called interaction gain. We experimentally investigate the suitability of interaction gain for handling attribute interactions in machine learning. We also propose visualization methods for graphical exploration of interactions in a domain.

We derive multiplicative updates for these problems that converge monotonically to the desired solutions for hard and soft margin classifiers. The updates differ strikingly in form from other multiplicative updates used in machine learning. In this paper, we provide complete proofs of convergence for these updates and extend previous work to incorporate sum and box constraints in addition to nonnegativity.

Natl ICT Australia, Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Univ Maryland Inst Adv Comp Studies				The application of statistical methods to natural language processing has been remarkably successful over the past two decades. But, to deal with recent problems arising in this field, machine learning techniques must be generalized to deal with uncertain data, or datasets whose elements are distributions over sequences, such as weighted automata. This paper reviews a number of recent results related to this question. We discuss how to compute efficiently basic statistics from a weighted automaton such as the expected count of an arbitrary sequence and higher moments of that distribution, by using weighted transducers. Both the corresponding transducers and related algorithms are described. We show how general classification techniques such as Support Vector Machines can be extended to deal with distributions by using general kernels between weighted automata. We describe several examples of positive definite kernels between weighted automata such as kernels based on counts of common n-gram sequences, counts of common factors or suffixes, or other more complex kernels, and describe a general algorithm for computing them efficiently. We also demonstrate how machine learning techniques such as clustering based on the edit-distance can be extended to deal with unweighted and weighted automata representing distributions.

S	Renaux, P		Bourcier, D		Renaux, P			CATMInE - Computer Assisted Trade-Mark Infringement Evaluation	LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS	Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual JURIX Conference	DEC 11-12, 2003	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS	Utrecht Fac Law, CNRS, Pluridisciplinary Network Law & Informat Syst				In forensic Machine Learning, information systems are not easy to use due to many constraints. Knowledge generally comes from laws and their use is represented by decisions. The whole data requires several parses in order to obtain a structured database on which decision tools can be applied. This study presents the use of machine learning tools to assist the lawyer in nominative trade-mark infringement evaluation. The domain formalism and database are obtained from the JURINPI database which regroups thousands of cases in the trade-mark domain. The use of a neural network and of Sammon's non-linear mapping provides a development of datas with designed decision tools for trade-mark infringement evaluation: CATMInE (Computer Assisted Trade-Mark Infringement Evaluation). This web-oriented application requires little technical knowledge on machine learning and displays a readable and concise information.

J	Jamnik, M; Kerber, M; Pollet, M; Benzmuller, C				Jamnik, Mateja; Kerber, Manfred; Pollet, Martin; Benzmueller, Christoph			Automatic learning of proof methods in proof planning	LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL			English	Article						automated reasoning; theorem proving; proof planning; knowledge acquisition; machine learning		In this paper we present an approach to automated learning within mathematical reasoning systems. In particular, the approach enables proof planning systems to automatically learn new proof methods from well-chosen examples of proofs which use a similar reasoning pattern to prove related theorems. Our approach consists of an abstract representation for methods and a machine learning technique which can learn methods using this representation formalism. We present an implementation of the approach within the Omega MEGA proof planning system, which we call LEARN Omega MATIC. We also present the results of the experiments that we ran on this implementation in order to evaluate if and how it improves the power of proof planning systems.

However, almost all of these methods are based on the assumption that the objects under consideration are represented in terms of feature vectors, or collections of attribute values. In the present paper we argue that symbolic representations, such as strings, trees or graphs, have a representational power that is significantly higher than the representational power of feature vectors. On the other hand, operations on these data structure that are typically needed in data mining and machine learning are more involved than their counterparts on feature vectors.

Many practical and useful combination techniques work by using the output of several classifiers as the input of a second layer classifier. The problem of this and other multi-classifier approaches is that huge amounts of memory are required to store a set of multiple classifiers and, more importantly, the comprehensibility of a single classifier is lost and no knowledge or insight can be acquired from the model. In order to overcome these limitations, in this work we analyse the idea of "mimicking" the semantics of an ensemble of classifiers. More precisely, we use the combination of classifiers for labelling an invented random dataset, and then, we use this artificially labelled dataset to re-train one single model. This model has the following advantages: it is almost similar to the highly accurate combined model, as a single solution it requires much fewer memory resources, no additional validation test must be reserved to do this procedure and, more importantly, the resulting model is expressed as a single classifier in terms of the original attributes and, hence, it can be comprehensible. First, we illustrate this methodology using a popular data-mining package, showing that it can spread into common practice, and then we use our system SMILES, which automates the process and takes advantage of its ensemble method.

This model allows us to simultaneously take into account structure and content information. It is used here for classifying XML documents. We adopt a machine learning approach and the model parameters are learned from a labeled training set of representative documents. We discuss the role of structural information for classification and describe experiments on a small collection of class labeled structured documents. We also present preliminary results showing how this model could classify documents with DTDs not represented in the training set.

On the other hand, current information retrieval systems have been developed for flat document representations and cannot be easily extended to cope with more complex document types. Only a few models have been proposed for handling structured documents, and the design of such systems is still an open problem. We present here a new model for structured document retrieval which allows to compute and to combine the scores of document parts. It is based on bayesian networks and allows for learning the model parameters in the presence of incomplete data. We present an application of this model for ad-hoc retrieval and evaluate its performances on a small structured collection. The model can also be extended to cope with other tasks such as interactive navigation in structured documents or corpus.

It started in 1997 with the aim to build a self-learning auto pilot for a single handed sailing yacht. The goal was to make an adaptive system that would help a single handed sailor to go faster on average in a race. Presently, after five years of development and a number of sea trials, we have a commercial system available (www.robosail.com). It is a hybrid system using agent technology, machine learning, data mining and rule-based reasoning. Apart from describing the system we try to generalize our findings, and argue that sailing is an interesting paradigm for a class of hybrid systems that one could call Skill-based Systems.

As an extension of class dependent costs, we consider costs that are example, i.e. feature and class dependent. We present a natural cost-sensitive extension of the support vector machine (SVM) and discuss its relation to the Bayes rule. We also derive an approach for including example dependent costs into an arbitrary cost-insensitive learning algorithm by sampling according to modified probability distributions.

Using automatic word sense disambiguation as an example task, we show that with the methodology currently used in comparative machine learning experiments, the results may often not be reliable because of the role of and interaction between feature selection and algorithm parameter optimization. We propose genetic algorithms as a practical approach to achieve both higher accuracy within a single approach, and more reliable comparisons.

By ranking, we refer to categorizing examples into one of K categories. On the other hand, sorting refers to coming up with the ordering of the data that agrees with some ground truth preference function. As against standard approaches of treating ranking as a multiclass classification problem, in this paper we argue that ranking/sorting problems can be solved by exploiting the inherent structure present in data. We present efficient formulations that enable the use of standard binary classification algorithms to solve these problems, however the structure is still captured in our formulations. We further show that our approach subsumes the various approaches that were developed in the past. We evaluate our algorithm on both synthetic datasets and for a real world image processing problem.

Consistency of numerical predictions with a given qualitative model is helpful when a numerical model is used for explanation of phenomena in the modelled domain, but can also considerably improve numerical accuracy. In this paper we present a novel approach to numerical machine learning called Qfilter. Qfilter is a numerical regression method that can take into account qualitative background knowledge to give qualitatively faithful numerical prediction. The results on a set of domains including population dynamics show considerable prediction accuracy improvements compared to the usual numerical learners. As qualitative domain knowledge is often available in practice, Qfilter's ability to exploit such knowledge should be beneficial in many applications.

The design of rules for control comprises the following two steps: (1) determination of muscle activation patterns by using a fully customized spatial (3D) model of paraplegic walking, and (2) learning of rules, that is, correlation between the muscle activation patterns and kinematics of walking by means of an artificial neural network. The adopted FES system activated eight muscle groups with surface electrodes. The only joints allowing movement in the coronal plane were the hips, and externally controlled joints in sagittal plane were ankles, knees and hips. The simulation minimized the tracking error of the joint angles and the total activation of all eight muscles being stimulated. A radial-basis function artificial neural network was applied for learning of rules. Three automatically controlled modes (slow, near-normal, and near-ballistic) and hand-controlled walking were evaluated in six subjects with a complete spinal cord lesion (T8-T10). The performance of walking was assessed by the following: (1) energy consumption based on oxygen uptake, (2) physiological cost index, (3) maximum speed of walking, and (4) a questionnaire. The results showed that all modes of walking are achievable and that automatic control leads to more efficient and faster walking. The speed of walking achieved by automatic control was almost three times bigger compared with the speed of hand-controlled walking. The energy cost and rate decreased significantly when automatic control was applied; yet, they were still much bigger than the values measured in able-bodied subjects. The objective outcome measures suggest that the near-ballistic walking was the most effective, yet a questionnaire shows that most subjects preferred slow walking. The most likely reason for the preference of lower efficiency walking over the faster end energy efficient near-ballistic walking was that paraplegic patients had difficulties in synchronizing the voluntary movement of the trunk and arms to the artificially controlled movements of legs.

This allows pathologists to image specimens over a full spectrum, thereby revealing (often subtle) distinctions between different types of tissue. With this type of data, the spectral content of the specimens, combined with quantitative spatial feature characterization may make it possible not only to identify the presence of an abnormality, but also to classify it accurately. However, such are the quantities and complexities of these data, that without new automated techniques to assist in the data analysis, the information contained in the data will remain inaccessible to those who need it. We investigate the application of a recently developed system for the automated analysis of multi-/hyper-spectral satellite image data to the problem of cancer detection from multispectral histopathology image data. The system provides a means for a human expert to provide training data simply by highlighting regions in an image using a computer mouse. Application of these feature extraction techniques to examples of both training and out-of-training-sample data demonstrate that these, as yet unoptimized, techniques already show promise in the discrimination between benign and malignant cells from a variety of samples.

Mainstream content-based image retrieval methods, however, do not satisfy the complex demands created by biomedical images. The success of content-based biomedical image retrieval hinges on the consideration of domain-specific-image characteristics. We strive for image retrieval with a high-level of content understanding, a high degree of query completion and integral user-computer interaction. Departing from the view that user interaction is mandatory for query completion and that query completion is mandatory for content-understanding, we explore the prospects of incrementally and interactively learning concepts during image retrieval for precise formalization of the user's perception of image information. As concepts closely relate to a user's preferences and subjectivity, and in addition can be considered as generalizations of a query instance, they are expected to allow more accurate and reliable image retrieval. In this paper, we discuss a method for concept-based image retrieval by population-based incremental learning of multi-feature image segmentations using query-by-example and relevance feedback. Image retrieval is demonstrated using digitized vertebral X-ray images from the NHANES 11 database.

Yet array data are noisy, and have very small sample-to-variable ratios. What is the explanation for such exemplary, yet counter-intuitive, classification performance? Answering this question has significant implications (a) for the broad acceptance of such models by the medical and biostatistical community, and (b) for gaining valuable insight on the properties of this domain. To address this problem we build several models for three classification tasks in a gene expression array dataset with 12,600 oligonucleotides and 203 patient cases. We then study the effects of. classifier type (kernel-based/non-kernel-based, linear/non-linear), sample size, sample selection within cross-validation, and gene information redundancy. Our analyses show that gene redundancy and classifier choice have the strongest effects on performance. Linear bias in the classifiers, and sample size (as long as kernel classifiers are used) have relatively small effects; train-test sample ratio, and the choice of cross-validation sample selection method appear to have small-to-negligible effects.

The Support Vector (SV) Machine regression is one of the powerful machine learning methods developed for this purpose in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) Analysis. A procedure based on linear programming is proposed for feature selection of SV regression.

It will be beneficial for the prompt and correct diagnosis of the disease to discover those important and relevant features and discard the irrelevant and redundant ones. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) based system is proposed to discover the important diagnostic features of the heart diseases. Here the chromosome of GA is numerically encoded, and the GA is enhanced with a back propagation (BP) algorithm to improve the local search capability of GA. The heart disease database used in this study includes 352 cases, and each case has 40 diagnostic features. Using the hybrid genetic algorithm, 24 critical features have been identified, and their corresponding diagnosis weights for each heart disease have been determined. The critical diagnostic features and their clinic meanings are in sound agreement with those used by the doctors in making their clinic decisions.

The system uses the WEBSOM method to arrange marked-up documents on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) such that semantically similar documents are placed close to each other. Then, by using the inductive learning algorithm, C5.0, the system automatically extracts and applies markup rules from the nearest SOM neighbours of an unmarked document. The system is designed to be adaptive, so that once a document is marked-up, its behaviour is modified to improve accuracy. Our approach has been applied to a number of different document domains and the results indicate that the approach is feasible and practical.

Until very recently, specialized evolvable hardware was needed, e.g. [1], to evolve these modules at speeds compatible with human patience. However, due to recent breakthroughs in knowledge-based/machine-learning-based evolutionary algorithms, such as Michalski's "LEM" [2], the usual evolution time of several/many hours of evolution time per module can now be accelerated by a factor of hundreds. This breakthrough allows brain builders to evolve hundreds of software-based neural net modules in a reasonable time on a PC and to build their own artificial brains. Such techniques can be taught at universities, hopefully stimulating the growth of brain building as a research field.

The uncertainty to explore if other machine learning algorithms can demonstrate better performance compared to the ones already employed constitutes the motivation for the study reported herein. Specifically, exploration of if certain algorithms perform better for certain attack classes and consequently, if a multi-expert classifier design can deliver desired performance measure is of high interest. This paper evaluates performance: of a comprehensive set of pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms on four attack categories as found in the KDD 1999 Cup intrusion detection dataset. Results of simulation study implemented to that effect indicated that certain classification algorithms perform better for certain attack categories: a specific algorithm specialized for a given attack category. Consequently, a multi-classifier model, where a specific detection algorithm is associated with an attack category for which it is the most promising, was built. Empirical results obtained through simulation indicate that noticeable performance improvement was achieved for probing, denial of service, and user-to-root attacks.

We study the results after training the system with different recurring times to find the appropriate training time. We find that the system with four financial ratios as inputs will get better results after being trained appropriate time.

In such an environment, where security and authorized use of the network may be of great importance, employment of an efficient and on-going vulnerability assessment process is highly desirable. It is assumed that severe constraints in bandwidth and other network resources prevent comprehensive vulnerability detection, and that only a subset of vulnerability assessment tests can be applied to a specific node at any given time [1]. Furthermore, vulnerabilities can occur in any sequence and at any time. This requires that adaptive methods of applying assessment techniques be developed to gain knowledge of such patterns of occurrence with a minimal application of vulnerability tests. In the following sections, we introduce a reinforcement-learning approach to attain this goal.

One difficulty in this area is dealing with problems which contain hidden-state. TRACA solves hidden-state tasks using a novel method to build Markov-k memory chains where k may be of arbitrary length. The seemingly simple strategy employed by TRACA presents a number of hidden complexities. Some important issues that arise are the need to direct and restrict search and to distinguish different types of hidden-state in order to correctly evaluate the usefulness of internal structures. These problems and others are discussed along with the various techniques for addressing them that have been implemented in TRACA. The techniques hinge on TRACA's ability to distinguish two different types of hidden-state. The success of TRACA's implementation is demonstrated on some difficult hidden-state problems and its performance is compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

We assume that a set of linguistic terms has been given for each variable. Thus our modelling task is to find a small number of fuzzy rules from possible combinations of the given linguistic terms. First we formulate a three-objective optimization problem, which simultaneously minimizes the total squared error, the number of fuzzy rules, and the total rule length. Next we show how fuzzy GBML algorithms can be applied to our problem in the framework of multi-objective optimization as well as single-objective optimization. Then we point out a Possibility that misleading fuzzy rules can be generated when general and specific fuzzy rules are simultaneously used in a single linguistic model. Finally we show that non-standard inclusion-based fuzzy reasoning removes such an undesirable possibility.

The sparse grids analysis system models the functional relationship between a set of predictor variables and a response variable by using a combination of easily computable functions defined on grids of varying mesh sizes in attribute space. The approach circumvents the so-called "curse of dimensionality" by using, instead of a costly high-dimensional grid a with a fine mesh size in every dimension, a collection of grids that are coarse along some dimensions but fine along others. Adaptive sparse grid regression and classification methods select combinations of grids that suit a particular data set. One advantage of the sparse grids approach from an environmental analysis perspective is that it uses machine learning approaches, and so can deal with correlated data, as are common in environmental problems. One advantage of the sparse grids approach from an environmental analysis perspective is that it uses machine learning approaches, and so can deal with correlated data, as is commonly the case with geographic data. They also require fewer degrees of freedom than do full grid models, allowing them to be applied to more datasets. The parameters defining the adaptive sparse grids can be used to interpret relationships in terms of scale and resolution. For example, the distribution of mesh points used in the set of lattices describes the complexity of the relationships present. It can be used to understand if the system is responding to fine scale variations (many mesh points used) or to gross patterns (few mesh points used). This is valuable information for environmental modelling.

Also, customers buying over the Internet look for added value. This paper proposes a distributed multi-agent system for e-insurance brokering where customers axe grouped together, exploiting user modelling and machine learning techniques, as an approach to better match customers and insurance product offers. Particular attention is paid to the interpretation of the generated communities. For this purpose, we use a metric to identify the representative insurance product configuration of each community. To improve broker's evaluation of received insurers' bids we propose the automatic construction of the customer's profile, reflecting its preferences on all the attributes of an insurance product.

Although there have been several approaches to data mining, we focus on mathematical programming (in particular, multi-objective and goal programming; MOP/GP) approaches in this paper. Among them, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is gaining popularity as a method for machine learning. In pattern classification problems with two class sets, its idea is to find a maximal margin separating hyperplane which gives the greatest separation between the classes in a high dimensional feature space. This task is performed by solving a quadratic programming problem in a traditional formulation, and can be reduced to solving a linear programming in another formulation. However, the idea of maximal margin separation is not quite new: in 1960's the multi-surface method (MSM) was suggested by Mangasarian. In 1980's, linear classifiers using goal programming were developed extensively. This paper presents a survey on how effectively MOP/GP techniques can be applied to machine learning such as SVM, and discusses their problems.

For many applications, the information available from any individual sensor may be incomplete, inconsistent or imprecise. However, other sources may provide complementary and/or additional data. Thus, for an application such as image feature extraction or classification, it may be that fusing the mulitple data sources can lead to more consistent and reliable results. Unfortunately, with the increased complexity of the fused data, the search space of feature-extraction or classification algorithms also greatly increases. With a single data source, the determination of a suitable algorithm may be a significant challenge for an image analyst. With the fused data, the search for suitable algorithms can go far beyond the capabilities of a human in a realistic time frame, and becomes the realm of machine learning, where the computational power of modern computers can be harnessed to the task at hand. We describe experiments in which we investigate the ability of a suite of automated feature extraction tools developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to make use. of multiple data sources for various feature extraction tasks. We compare and contrast this software's capabilities on 1) individual data sets from different data sources 2) fused data sets from multiple data sources and 3) fusion of results from multiple individual data sources.

SVMs approach binary classification by attempting to find a hyperplane that separates the two categories of training vectors. This hyperplane is expressed as a function of a subset of the training vectors. These vectors are called support vectors. In this paper, we present a method of fuzzifying support vectors based off of the results of an SVM induction. We then propose a method of enhancing SVM induction using these fuzzy support vectors. We finish by presenting a computational example using the IRIS data set.

Due to this, numerous studies or research has been made to look into various methods of analysis, detection and mitigation. In general, these methods would involve either complex computation for accurate results but suffers from high computation time. Some methods may also be simple and fast but then has the disadvantage of inaccuracy. This paper presents an alternative method of analysing the voltage stability problem by incorporating machine learning techniques, i.e. Fuzzy Decision Tree method. The author proposed a general overview on how the algorithm is created. The Algorithm is then tested using an IEEE 300 bus test system to test the algorithm's capability. Results presented show that the proposed FDT has a lot of future potential as an online tool for voltage stability analysis.

However, a time and cost effective technique for interactome analysis is still lacking. Lots of methods for the predicion of protein-protein interacions have been developed: some of them are based on high quality alignment of sequences, others are based on the tridimensional features of proteins, but they all bear strong limitations that make impossible their large scale application. Recently, an SVM-based machine learning approach has been used to address this topic. Although the method was able to correctly classify 80% of the test samples, it was not applied to the prediction of yet unknown interactions. In this work, we address this topic and show that an optimized, SVM-based machine learning approach trained with combinations of shuffled sequences as examples of lack of interaction is unable to make large scale predictions of interaction.

Words do not convey exact meanings but act as soft constraints over possible meanings. LCR is based on this principle: a failure to recognize is an opportunity to learn. A rule-making language, RML, has been implemented to facilitate problem representation and experimentation with constraint relaxation problems. LCR has been used to extract knowledge from texts containing medical descriptions and informatics codes.

Our data consists Of polarized color images of scallop and other bivalve larvae (between 2 and 17 days old) collected from the ocean by a shipboard optical imaging system of our design. Larvae of scallops, clams, and oysters are small (100 microns) with few distinguishing features when observed under standard light microscopy. However the use of polarized light with a full wave retardation plate produces a vivid color bi-refringence pattern. The patterns display very subtle differences between species, often not discernable to human observers. We show that a soft-margin support vector machine with Gaussian RBF kernel is a good discriminator on a feature set extracted from Gabor wavelet transforms and color distribution angles of each image. By constraining the Gabor center frequencies to be low, the resulting system can attain classification accuracy in excess of 90% for vertically oriented images, and in excess of 80% for randomly oriented images.

IV&V is a unique aspect of the software lifecycle, and different methods are necessary to produce quick and accurate results. If quality code indicators could be produced on a per-project basis, then IV&V could proceed in a more straight-forward fashion, saving time and money. This article presents one case study on just such a project, showing that by using the proper metrics and machine learning algorithms, quality indicators can be found as early as 3 months into the IVV process.

The SVM is based on the theory of structural risk minimization [26] and as such has good generalisation properties that have been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. The flexibility of the SVM is provided by the use of kernel functions that implicitly map the data to a higher, possibly infinite, dimensional space. A solution linear in the features in the higher dimensional space corresponds to a solution non-linear in the original features. This flexibility does not however lead to overfitting since the SVM performs automatic capacity control. A remaining problem with SVMs is the selection of the kernel and regularizaton parameters. The commonly used Gaussian RBF kernel benefits from a good choice of the scaling parameter sigma. This is usually chosen by training an SVM for a range of values of sigma and using an estimate of the generalization error to do model selection. The standard approach of validation or cross-validation becomes impractical for large data sets as SVMs can perform "abysmally slow in prediction" [4]. A heuristic suggested by Jaakkola et al. [11] is used to initialize sigma and this heuristic is then used to update sigma during training. On benchmark data sets from the UCI Repository this algorithm achieves a cross-validated error not significantly different from the optimal value. It is also more computationally efficient than a line search for sigma.

This paper first introduces ontologies in general and subsequently, in particular, shortly outlines the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates "atomic" conceptual relations from "predicative" domain rules. In the main part of the paper, we describe and experimentally evaluate work in progress on a potential method to automatically derive the atomic conceptual relations mentioned above from a corpus of English medical texts. Preliminary outcomes are presented based on the clustering of nouns and compound nouns according to co-occurrence frequencies in the subject-verb-object syntactic context.

The major drawbacks with respect to kNN are (1) its low efficiency - being a lazy learning method prohibits it in many applications such as dynamic web mining for a large repository, and (2) its dependency on the selection of a "good value" for k. In this paper, we propose a novel kNN type method for classification that is aimed at overcoming these shortcomings. Our method constructs a kNN model for the data, which replaces the data to serve as the basis of classification. The value of k is automatically determined, is varied for different data, and is optimal in terms of classification accuracy. The construction of the model reduces the dependency on k and makes classification faster. Experiments were carried out on some public datasets collected from the UCI machine learning repository in order to test our method. The experimental results show that the kNN based model compares well with C5.0 and kNN in terms of classification accuracy, but is more efficient than the standard kNN.

This paper explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods in comparison with standard statistical regression techniques for developing automated identification methods. In this work, the ML task is broken into two sub-tasks, data reduction and prediction. In well-conditioned data, the number of samples should be much larger than the number of attributes per sample, to limit the degrees of freedom in predictive models. In this spectroscopy data, the opposite is normally true. Predictive models based on such data have a high number of degrees of freedom, which increases the risk of models over-fitting to the sample data and having poor predictive power. In the work described here, an approach to data reduction based on Genetic Algorithms is described. For the prediction sub-task, the objective is to estimate the concentration of a component in a mixture, based on its Raman spectrum and the known concentrations of previously seen mixtures. Here, Neural Networks and k-Nearest Neighbours are used for prediction. Preliminary results are presented for the problem of estimating the concentration of cocaine in solid mixtures, and compared with previously published results in which statistical analysis of the same dataset was performed. Finally, this paper demonstrates how more accurate results may be achieved by using an ensemble of prediction techniques.

From the viewpoint of low power consumption, we have been developing a reflectivity modulating communication module composed of a liquid crystal light modulator and a corner-reflecting mirror sheet. We installed a corner-reflecting sheet instead of light scattering sheet in a handheld videogame machine with a display screen with a reflection-type liquid crystal. Infrared (IR) LED illuminator attached next to the IR camera of a base station illuminates all the room, and the terminal send their data to the base station by switching ON and OFF of the reflected IR beam. Intensity of reflected light differs with the position and the direction of the terminal, and sometimes the intensity of OFF signal at a certain condition is brighter than that of ON signal at another condition. To improve the communication quality, use of machine learning technique is a possibility of the solution. In this paper, we compare various machine learning techniques for the purpose of free space optical communication, and propose a new algorithm that improves the robustness of the data link. Evaluation using an actual free-space communication system is also described.

Our approach consists of Web pages structure analysis and semantic clustering for intra-page semantic analysis, and machine learning based link semantic analysis for inter-page analysis. Based on the automatic repetitive patterns discovery in structure level and clustering in semantic level, we explore the intra-page semantic structure of Web pages and extend the processing unit from the whole page to a finer granularity, i.e., semantic information blocks within pages. After observing the various hyperlinks, we synthesize the Web inter-page semantic and define an information organizing oriented hyperlink semantic category. Considering the presentation of the hyperlink carrier and intra-page semantic structure, we propose corresponding feature selection and quantification methods, and then exploit the C4.5 decision-tree method to classify hyperlink semantic type and analyze the inter-page semantic structure. In our experiments, the results suggest that our approch is feasible for machine processing.

DATABASE SEARCHES; ALIGNMENT	A Procedure for fast pattern matching in protein sequences is presented. It uses a biological metric, based on the substitution matrices as PAM or BLOSUM, to compute the matching. Biological sensitive pattern matching does pattern detection according to the available empirical data about similarity and affinity relations between amino acids in protein sequences. Sequence alignments is a string matching procedure used in Genomic; it includes insert/delete operators and dynamic programming techniques; it provides more sophisticate results that other pattern matching procedures but with higher computational cost. Heuristic procedures for local alignments as FASTA or BLAST are used to reduce this cost. They are based on some successive tasks; the first one uses a pattern matching procedure with very short sequences, also named k-tuples This paper shows how using the L-1 metric this matching task can be efficiently computed by using SIMD instructions. To design this procedure, a table that maps the substitution matrices is needed. This table defines a representation of each amino acid residue in a n-dimensional space of lower dimensionality as possible; this is accomplished by using techniques of Multidimensional Scaling used in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning for dimensionality reduction. Based on the experimental tests, the proposed procedure provides a favorable ration of cost vs matching quality.

Under the conditions of the industrial production a decision is required within seconds with a high selectivity. The introduced concept consists of classic elements of image processing, classification, and machine learning. The components are not optimized but as a whole, yielding a high performance system. It also contains individually a statistical preprocessing for change detection in image sequences. The event hypotheses generated by the algorithm are classified frame-wise by an object classifier. The optimization of recognition performance is based on a feature selection by a modified sequential forward selection. We use the properties of the polynomial classifier for the efficient computation of cross validations.

The problem of selecting a good data source is difficult because some peers may not be encountered more than once, and many peers are on low-bandwidth connections. Despite these facts, information obtained about peers just prior to the download can help guide peer selection. A client can gain additional time savings by aborting bad download attempts until an acceptable peer is discovered. We denote as peer selection the entire process of switching among peers and finally settling on one. Our main contribution is to use the methodology of machine learning for the construction of good peer selection strategies from past experience. Decision tree learning is used for rating peers based on low-cost information, and Markov decision processes are used for deriving a policy for switching among peers. Preliminary results with the Gnutella network demonstrate the promise of this approach.

This is an important problem for scientists to use signal peptides as a vehicle to find new drugs or to reprogram cells for gene therapy (see, e.g. [7] K.C. Chou, Current Protein and Peptide Science 2002;3:615-22). In this paper, support vector machines (SVMs), a new machine learning method, is applied to approach this problem. The overall rate of correct prediction for 1939 secretary proteins and 1440 nonsecretary proteins was over 91%. It has not escaped our attention that the new method may also serve as a useful tool for further investigating many unclear details regarding the molecular mechanism of the ZIP code protein-sorting system in cells.

This paper describes research into the understanding of such tacit control skills. Understanding tacit skills has practical motivation in respect of communicating skill to other operators, operator training, and also mechanising and optimising human skill. This paper is concerned with approaches to the understanding of human operators' skill by analysing operators' traces using techniques of machine learning (ML). The paper gives a review of ML-based approaches to skill reconstruction. Recent work is presented with particular emphasis on understanding human tacit skill qualitatively, and automatically generating explanation of how it works. This includes qualitative machine learning to extract from operator's control traces his subconscious sub-goals and control strategies described in qualitative terms.

Since site properties also vary across crop fields (i.e. spatially) they could be related to the heterogeneous weed distribution. The proposed approach assumes a complex relationship among site properties and weed density that can be modelled as a rule set. Then a learning process based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) discovers the rules; performing a search procedure based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. GA searches the best rules that accurately explain weed density in terms of soil properties.	CSIC, IAI, Madrid 28500, Spain	Diaz, B (reprint author), CSIC, IAI, Madrid 28500, Spain.

One is symbolic approach and another is sub-symbolic approach. Decision tree (DT) is a typical model for symbolic learning, and neural network (NN) is a popular model for sub-symbolic learning. Neural network tree (NNTree) is a DT with each non-terminal node being an expert NN. NNTree is a learning model that may combine the advantages of both DT and NN. Through experiments we found that the size of an NNTree is usually proportional to the number of training data. Thus, we can produce small trees by using partial training data. In most cases, however, this will decrease the performance of the tree. In this paper, we propose a two step algorithm to produce small NNTrees. The first step is to get a small NNTree using partial data, and the second step is to increase the performance through retraining. The effectiveness of this algorithm is verified through experiments with public databases.

In this paper we describe a solution based on multi-fidelity computation supported by predictive resource management. We show that such an approach can substantially reduce both the mean and the variance of response time. On a benchmark representative of augmented reality, we demonstrate a 60% reduction in mean latency and a 30% reduction in the coefficient of variation. We also show that a history-based approach to demand prediction is the key to this performance improvement: by applying simple machine learning techniques to logs of measured resource demand, we are able to accurately model resource demand as a function of fidelity.

Aggressive destabilisation/restabilisation sequences are used for training, such that a wide state space envelope is covered during training. Both feedforward neural networks and fuzzy associative memories (FAM) are tested; only FAM are found to be suitable for online learning. The performance of velocity, height and heading controllers is presented in simulation. Experimental helicopter results for heading control are presented. Furthermore, as an intermediate step toward velocity control, attitude control learning results on the real helicopter are also presented.

Software metrics are collected at various points during software development, in order to monitor and control the quality of a software product. We use fuzzy clustering-to examine three collections of software metrics. This is one of the very few attempts to use unsupervised learning in the software metrics domain, even though unsupervised learning seems more appropriate for this application domain. Some characteristics of this application domain that have significant implications for machine learning are highlighted and discussed. Our results illustrate how unsupervised learning can be used in software quality control.

One such divide and conquer method is learning from soft partitions of data. By examining the decomposition of classifier error into bias and variance terms, we see that learning from smaller partitions of data introduces higher variance. In this paper, we investigate the use of a particular variance reduction technique, randomized C4.5, when learning from soft partitions of data. This approach maintains the distributed nature of the learning algorithm while boosting the overall classification accuracy. Experiments on six machine learning datasets demonstrate the improved accuracy gains by reducing classifier variance. In particular, learning from soft partitions of data can produce more accurate classifiers than using an ensemble of randomized decision trees constructed from the entire dataset, which in turn results in a more accurate classifier than building a single decision tree.

This can potentially preclude their use on problems such as coreference resolution that lack an obvious feature split. To bootstrap coreference classifiers, we propose and evaluate a single-view weakly supervised algorithm that relies on two different learning algorithms in lieu of the two different views required by co-training. In addition, we investigate a method for ranking unlabeled instances to be fed back into the bootstrapping loop as labeled data, aiming to alleviate the problem of performance deterioration that is commonly observed in the course of bootstrapping.

Besides morpho-syntactic, recency, and semantic features based on existing lexical knowledge resources, our algorithm obtains additional semantic knowledge from the Web. We search the Web via lexico-syntactic patterns that are specific to other-anaphors. Incorporating this innovative feature leads, to an 11.4 percentage point improvement in the classifier's F-measure (25% improvement relative to results without this feature).

B	Isozaki, H; Hirao, T		Collins, M; Steedman, M		Isozaki, H; Hirao, T			Japanese zero pronoun resolution based on ranking rules and machine learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2003 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing	JUL 11-12, 2003	Sapporo, JAPAN					Anaphora resolution is one of the most important research topics in Natural Language Processing. In English, overt pronouns such as she and definite noun,phrases such as the company are anaphors that refer to preceding entities (antecedents). In Japanese, anaphors are often omitted, and these omissions are called zero pronouns. There are two major approaches to zero pronoun resolution: the heuristic approach and the machine learning approach. Since we have to take various factors into consideration, it is difficult to find a good combination of heuristic rules. Therefore, the machine learning approach is attractive, but it requires a large amount of training data. In this paper, we propose a method that combines ranking rules and machine learning. The ranking rules are simple and effective, while machine learning can take more factors into account. From the results of our experiments, this combination gives better performance than either of the two previous approaches.

The main point of this paper is that by adding linguistic knowledge to the representation (such as syntactic features), rather than relying only on statistics (such as term frequency and n-grams), a better result is obtained as measured by keywords previously assigned by professional indexers. In more detail, extracting NP-chunks gives a better precision than n-grams, and by adding the PoS tag(s) assigned to the term as a feature, a dramatic improvement of the results is obtained, independent of the term selection approach applied.

B	Syeda-Mahmood, T			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Syeda-Mahmood, T			Clustering time-varying gene expression profiles using scale-space signals	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2003 IEEE BIOINFORMATICS CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Computational Systems Bioinformatics Conference	AUG 11-14, 2003	STANFORD, CA	IEEE Comp Soc TC Bioinformat, ACM	STANFORD UNIV		CELL-CYCLE	The functional state of an organism is determined largely by the pattern of expression of its genes. The analysis of gene expression data from gene chips has primarily revolved around clustering and classification of the data using machine learning techniques based on the intensity of expression alone with the time-varying pattern mostly ignored. In this paper, we present a pattern recognition-based approach to capturing similarity by finding salient changes in the time-varying expression patterns of genes. Such changes can give clues about important events, such as gene regulation by cell-cycle phases, or even signal the onset of a disease. Specifically, we observe that dis-similarity between time series is revealed by the sharp twists and bends produced in a higher-dimensional curve formed from the constituent signals. Scale-space analysis is used to detect the sharp twists and turns and their relative strength with respect to the component signals is estimated to form a shape similarity measure between time profiles. A clustering algorithm is presented to cluster gene profiles using the scale-space distance as a similarity metric. Multi-dimensional curves formed from time series within clusters are used as cluster prototypes or indexes to the gene expression database, and are used to retrieve the functionally similar genes to a query gene profile. Extensive comparison of clustering using scale-space distance in comparison to, traditional Euclidean distance is presented on the yeast genome database.

As the volume of literature continues to grow there is a need to sort through this information in a more efficient manner. Mapping the pathways of genes and proteins of interest is one goal that requires frequent reference to the literature. Pathway databases can help here and scientists currently have a choice between buying access to externally curated pathway databases or building their own in house. However such databases are either expensive to license or slow to populate manually. Building upon easily available, open-source tools we have developed a pipeline to automate the collection, structuring and storage of gene and protein interaction data from the literature. As a team of both biologists and computer scientists we integrated our natural language processing (NLP) software with the Gene Ontology (GO) to collect and translate unstructured text data into structured interaction data. For NLP we used a machine learning approach with a rule induction program, RAPIER (http://www.cs.utexas.eduluserslmllrapier.html). RAPIER was modified to learn rules from tagged documents, and then it was trained on a corpus tagged by expert curators. The resulting rules were used to extract information from a test corpus automatically. Extracted Genes and Proteins were mapped onto Locuslink, and extracted interactions were mapped onto GO. Once information was structured in this way it was stored in a pathway database and this formal structure allowed us to perform advanced data mining and visualization..

Based on the Assembly Process Modeling Methodology (APM) developed at the Assembly Automation Laboratory, where the product definition includes both logical and physical building blocks, and the dependencies between them, the development of an Intelligent Task Planning system built upon a Collaborative Web-based environment will enable the integration of the product design process and the assembly system design process. The Product Model definition will consist of a network or hierarchy of interrelated items, where each item has an interface, which contains all the necessary information to verify the item's compliance with the other items in the product definition. The relationships are defined as configuration rules, which can be formally specified in a syntax language. Based on the principle that all intelligent assembly task-planning systems can be structured as a typical knowledge-based system, the use of a software environment that allows the re-use of components, and database independency increases the robustness of the system. The integration of object-oriented and machine learning techniques for intelligent task planning into the system, adds the capability of using complex entities such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) models. The system will serve as an integration point between the product design phase and the assembly system deployment, embracing the capabilities of a web environment, enabling the development team to work remotely over the Internet on one framework, with zero-latency sharing of information. The system enables direct connectivity to Product Data Management (PDM) or Requirements Management (RM) systems, though the use of Java and Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. The scope of this research is the final assembly activities in the Electronics and Photonics Industries.

The system should support the classification of documents in several languages and aims to assist users in locating relevant IPC symbols by providing them with a convenient web-based service. The approach taken for developing such a system relies on powerful machine learning algorithms that are trained on manually classified documents to recognise IPC topics. We detail in-house results of applying a custom-built state-of-the-art computer-assisted categorises to English, French, Russian, and German-language patent documents. We find that reliable computer-assisted categorisation at IPC subclass level is an achievable goal for the statistical methods employed here. A categorisation system suggesting three IPC symbols for each document can predict the main IPC class correctly for around 90% of documents, and the main IPC subclass for about 85% of documents. The accuracy of the system at main group level is enhanced if the user first validates the correct IPC class.

We examined data from both open-loop off-line and close-loop online motor control tasks: Given multineuron recordings of action potentials, determine rats' paddle press intentions as they respond to the onset of light cues. We systematically evaluated two classes of machine learning classification techniques, the self-organizing maps (SOM), and the support vector machines (SVM). The SOM based algorithm was augmented by a Bayesian decision model for classification of control commands. To circumvent the difficulty of large number of data variables and relatively low number of data samples, principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) were used as dimension reduction techniques associated with the classifiers. We demonstrated using recordings from 5 rats that the proposed algorithms provide much more accurate control decisions than those by chance. Our results provided validation of the feasibility of real-time brain control with feedback using predictive models between cortical firing patterns and control commands. Our real-time brain control does not require desired target information in decoding as some other algorithms did. In addition, careful comparisons and evaluations are provided for several different implementations of the decoding techniques.

The backscatter from normal and apoptotic cells, using a high frequency ultrasound instrument are modeled through an Autoregressive (AR) modeling technique. The proper model order is calculated by tracking the error criteria in the reconstruction of the original signal. The AR model coefficients, which are assumed to contain the main statistical features of the signal, are passed as the input to Linear and Nonlinear machine classifiers (Fisher Linear Discriminant, Conditional Gaussian Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Neural Networks with nonlinear activation functions). In addition, an adaptive signal segmentation method (Least Squares Lattice Filter) is used to differentiate the data from layers of different cell types into stationary parts ready for modeling and classification.

In this area, the recognition scheme has to offer a particular high generalization performance and should often allow for the inclusion prior knowledge about the waveforms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid machine learning scheme as general approach to waveform recognition in the biomedical area. Our hybrid scheme is based on feature extractions by adapted filter banks and support vector machines or kernel based novelty detectors. It allows for the inclusion of a priori knowledge such as local instabilities in time and shift-variance of bioelectric waveforms. We apply our scheme for the classification of endocardial waveforms and the detection of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. For both applications, we show that our scheme outperforms conventional methods used before.

We have investigated the effect of feature extraction and feature selection on clustering of the expression data on two different data sets for ovarian cancer. One data set consisted of 2176 transcripts from 30 samples, nine from normal ovarian epithelial cells and 21 from cancerous ones. The other data set had 7129 transcripts coming from 27 tumor and four normal ovarian tissues. Hierarchical clustering algorithms employing complete-link, average-link and Ward's method were implemented for comparative, evaluation. Principal component analysis was applied for feature extraction and resulted in 100% segregation. Feature selection was performed to identify the most distinguishing genes using CARTS software. Selected features were able to cluster the data with 100% success. The results suggest that adoption of feature extraction and selection enhances the quality of clustering of gene expression data for ovarian cancer. Identification of distinguishing genes is a more complex problem that requires incorporating pathway knowledge with statistical and machine learning methods.

Fuyu, cv. Matsumoto wase Fuyu, cv. Hanna Fuyu, cv. Oku Gosho and cv. II-IQ-12) was investigated. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the FTIR spectral data to 20 variables. Machine learning models classified the cultivars into five groups. Three of the cultivars, Oku Gosho, Hanna Fuyu and II-IQ-12 were readily distinguished from each other and from Fuyu and Matsumoto wase Fuyu. However, the leaf wax data was unable to distinguished between two closely related persimmon genotypes, Fuyu and the early maturing L1 mutation of Fuyu, Matsumoto wase Fuyu. Here, epicuticular wax biosynthesis appears unaffected by the L1 mutation found in Matsumoto wase Fuyu. When the classification was based on four groups, where Fuyu and Matsumoto wase Fuyu samples were combined, the best performing machine learning model correctly classified 98.7% of the samples.

It is offering new possibilities and benefits in real-world applications, helping us understand better mechanisms of our own methods of knowledge acquisition. Genetic programming (GP) posses certain advantages that make it suitable for discovering the classification rule for data mining applications, such as convenient structure for rule generation. This paper, intended to discover classification rules for the Egytian sock market return by applying GP. Since the Egyptian stock market return data have a large number of specific properties that together makes the generalized classification rules unusual. The process behaves very much like a random-walk process and regime shift in the sense that the underlying process is time varying. These reasons cause greats problems for the traditional classification algorithms. Experiments presenting a preliminary result to demonstrate the capability of GP to mine accurate classification rules suitable for prediction, comparable to traditional machine learning algorithms i.e., C4.5.

The policies are learned over an extensive generic image processing operator library. One of the principal weaknesses of the method lies with the large size of such libraries which can make machine learning process intractable. In this paper we demonstrated how evolutionary algorithms can be used to reduce the size of the operator library thereby speeding up learning of the policy while still keeping the human experts out of the development loop. Initial experiments in a challenging domain of forestry image interpretation demonstrated a 50% reduction in the operator set size leading to a 16-fold acceleration of the policy learning. At the same time the image interpretation accuracy of over 97% of the optimal was maintained.

By applying machine learning to the Genethon human genetic map, we determine the factors that may affect the polymorphism (heterozygosity) of dinucleotide tandem repeats. We then use a hybrid approach to predict the polymorphism of a given dinucleotide tandem repeat. Wet lab validation results on 3 human chromosomes show that our approach achieves a high accuracy of 93% in predicting high-polymorphic DTRs (whose heterozygosity is higher that 50%). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application of machine learning to the problem of computationally selecting candidate DTRs for validation as genetic markers.

The new assembler covers all stages of the assembly process, from sequencing to reordering and orienting contigs. VEDA is a generic procedure with a number of initially undetermined numeric and algorithmic parameters which are "learned" by a learning algorithm, VEDA, through the post-processing of previously sequenced DNAs. Testing on diverse DNA sequences of lengths of up to 5 million base pairs shows that VEDA correctly assembles approximately 97% of the DNA. Our experiments are performed on two types of input data: real, comprised of the system of Anthrax fragments that was made public on the TIGR site; and synthetic, comprised of systems of fragments generated by the program frag, which is applied to real DNA strings. The latter includes a fraggenerated input formed from the Anthrax DNA. At the last stage, VEDA uses mate-pair information in order to finish labeling and reordering the contigs. According to our experiments, VEDA correctly restores the order of the contigs and determines the lengths of the gaps between them within 5% of the true answer, even if the the input lengths of the mate-pairs are given with the 10% error rate.

Using expression data from 108 known breast cancer-related genes for 75 patients with various diseases of the breast, we are able to induce decision trees with 89% accuracy in separating cancer from non-cancer patients in a cross-validation test. We also show that by inducing a separate decision tree for each cancer-related gene, and using the expression level of the individual gene as the decision variable, it is possible to obtain decision trees which aid the understanding of signaling pathways involved in breast cancer. In addition, we also show that the C4.5 algorithm is able to identify key breast cancer genes when decision trees are induced on expression data sets containing randomly selected genes. This result indicates that it is possible to make biological discoveries when applying decision tree algorithms to large sets of gene expression data in diseases where the genetic basis is not well characterised.

An unknown image is analysed through interactions between a Visual Feature Detector and a Semantic Analyser with the help of knowledge bases and a suitable reasoning mechanism. The extracted semantic content of the image is transformed into a form of Papillon, which has been designed as an intermediate semantic representation scheme. The system translates the content in Papillon into a textual annotation. Due to the complicated nature of interpreting medical images and the limitation of image processing, our previous system [I] was not able always to produce an accurate result. In this revised system we provide users interactive functionalities to help the system learn to generate more accurate. annotations. When a user finds the textual image annotation automatically generated by the machine is wrong, he/she can input the key prompt as feedback into the system. The system will analyse the feedback, compare it with previous machine generated annotation, and decide whether to trigger the re-analysis process based on the new knowledge extracted from the feedback. Through this process, the machine gradually will learn to generate annotations with better precision.

The ROC curve provides information on the tradeoff between the hit rate (true positives) and the false alarm rates (false positives). In order to draw the ROC curve both positive and negative examples are needed. In some applications, for example, machine condition monitoring, cancer detection, there are plenty of negative examples. However the positive examples are either rare, or do not fully describe the overall set of the possible positive examples. However, instead of the positive examples, some rules about the positive examples are available. For example, in machine condition monitoring, if a sensor drifts off from the set of observed states by a certain amount, we know that a fault has occurred. In order to use the ROC curve to evaluate classifiers, we artificially create the positive examples based on the application dependent rules and the existing negative examples. Then we draw the ROC curve using this set of positive and negative examples.

RULES-5 is a 'covering' algorithm that extracts IF-THEN rules from examples presented to it. The paper first reviews existing methods of rule extraction and dealing with continuous attributes. It then describes the techniques adopted for RULES-5 and gives a step-by-step example to illustrate their operation. The paper finally gives the results of applying RULES-5 and other algorithms to benchmark problems. These clearly show that RULES-5 generates rule sets that are more accurate than those produced by its immediate predecessor RULES-3 Plus and by a well-known commercially available divide-and-conquer machine learning algorithm.

Unfortunately early diagnosis of HCC is almost mandatory in terms of patient survival, but it represents a very difficult task. Detailed histological characteristics of small HCC and precursor lesions in histological diagnosis are needed to refine the contribution of histopathology to the management of patients with HCC. In this context a possible approach regards the implementation of knowledge extraction process based on a labeled data set of cases. Our data set is made of 212 cases, including early malignant nodules, benign ones, and some uncertain cases. A set of 11 histopathological and morphological features describes each case. We applied statistical and machine learning algorithms both for feature selection and classification of nodules. In particular, we implemented an ensemble of classifiers in a straightforward way. Moreover, this ensemble provides physicians with a rough level of confidence of the proposed diagnoses, taking into account the importance of the interpretability of automated output. Feature selection approach was validated; actually. a subset of four histological features performed at least as the whole set of features in the classification of the malignant and benign nodules. Ensemble of learning machines can be a tool to extract new knowledge from a set of data and improve comprehensibility of computerized output.

The parameters to be adjusted using genetic approach are weights between input layer and functional nodes, and parameters, i.e., center and width, of Gaussian functions (radial basis functions) in the functional nodes. Genetic coding is used for combining evolution of weights and Gaussian parameters in a single chromosome. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for computing the weights in the output layer. The proposed approach is efficient in terms of computational efficiency and time complexity as demonstrated with several benchmark datasets. The simulations indicate that proposed approach yields consistent results and near optimal solution, which is superior to previous approaches.

The goal of machine learning is minimizing the true risk (or general error) for the whole distribution of sample space, not just a set of training samples. However, the true risk can not be estimated accurately with the finite number of samples. In this sense, we derive the form of true risk bounds which may provide the useful guideline for the optimization of learning models. Through the simulation for the function approximation, we have shown that the prediction of true risk bounds based on the suggested functional form is well fitted to the empirical data.

Logically, a linear model will not be able to perform restoration satisfactorily if a blurring function is strongly nonlinear. This paper aims to develop a technique for nonlinear image restoration using a machine learning approach, where no prior knowledge and assumptions about the blurring process and the additive noise are required. Although some similar learning image restoration methods exist, no one has explored the mechanism to determine why a mapping neural network can be used in modeling the degradation process, and why it works well for some images but does not behave properly for others. In this work, we try to get a better understanding about these. A generic nonlinear image restoration model is considered in this paper. Based on our previous study, a standard radial basis function (RBF) network is employed to realize the functional mapping from the degraded image space to the original image space, which is dynamically structured to ensure good generalization in restoration. The proposed adaptive RBF network is implemented in a dynamic component-based software framework, which can run in either sequential or parallel modes. Primary simulation results indicate that our proposed method perform well in restoring spatially invariant images degraded by nonlinear distortion and noise.

These feature patterns were originally extracted by sequence alignment algorithms, which measure similarity between an unseen protein sequence and identified protein sequences. Neural network approaches, while reasonably accurate at classification, give no information about the relationship between the unseen case and the classified items that is useful to biologist. In contrast, in this paper we use a generalized radial basis function (GRBF) neural network architecture that generates fuzzy classification rules that could be used for further knowledge discovery. Our proposed techniques were evaluated using protein sequences with ten classes of super-families downloaded from a public domain database, and the results compared favorably with other standard machine learning techniques.

One problem in this area is input-generalisation. Input generalisation requires learning a small set of internal states which represent useful abstractions of the much larger set of actual states. As such, the input-generalisation problem is fundamentally similar to the classical problems of classification, concept learning and discrimination. The priorities when evaluating a system for on-line robot learning include a small number of trials, predictive accuracy and minimal parameter tuning. Other requirements are the ability to learn without predefined classes (i.e classes must be learned during training) and an efficient and adaptable representation. This paper evaluates the performance of TRACA, a new learning algorithm, on a number of common classification tasks. The same set of parameters is used to obtain all TRACA's results, which are then compared to the results obtained by other well-known algorithms. On most tasks, TRACA's predictive accuracy is within a few percent of the best performing systems compared. Furthermore, TRACA's result is often achieved with less training experience. In a final experiment TRACA is trialled on a robot navigation task that requires discrimination of a number of discrete locations.

In this paper, we will provide a proof to show that Fuzzy ART augmented with a single layer of perceptrons is a universal approximator. Moreover, the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network architecture, by itself, will be shown to be a universal approximator.

If the points in the dataset are perfectly fitted, the,generalization performance is usually bad. We propose to take profit of overtraining, together with Feature Selection, to improve the performance of a learning system. The main idea lies in the hypothesis that when the dataset is as fitted as possible, the system is forced to use all the available variables as much as possible. Noisy and useless variables can be detected if generalization improves when the system is not allowed to use them. Forcing overtraining, noisy and useless variables should be more outstanding. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed several Feature Selection experiments using Feed-forward Neural Networks. The particular Feature Selection procedure used was Sequential Backward Selection. Experimental results with several real-world problems suggest that our hypothesis seems to be well-founded. Ironically, forcing overtraining may help to achieve good performance.

The game of FreeCell was selected as a suitable benchmark domain, in which "knowledge based heuristics" and "neural heuristics" were employed to find solutions for randomly generated games. An amalgamation of the two, in which the neural network developed a heuristic from several knowledge based heuristics, was also used. Of the neural derived heuristics, the best-case architecture did not employ the "knowledge based heuristics." Moreover, neural heuristics were not able to improve upon those defined a priori.

Support vector machines are applied in this context to a set of simulated and historic U.S. presidential elections. The decision surface can best be modelled by a separating hyperplane where the weights of the hyperplane represent a scaled level of importance for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. For 100 simulations of 100 elections, in which Democrats and Republicans had a 50% probability of winning each state, support vector machines appear to retrieve a large-state bias. For a historic dataset covering the last 22 U.S. presidential elections no large-state bias could be detected.

We have developed a Distributed Diagnostic Agent System, DDAS that detects faults of a device based on signal analysis and machine learning. The CBR techniques presented here are used to find root cause of vehicle faults based on the information provided by the signal agents in DDAS. Two CBR methods are presented, one used directly the diagnostic output from the signal agents and another uses the signal segment features. We present experiments conducted on real vehicle cases collected from auto dealers and the results show that both method are effective in finding root causes of vehicle faults.

This involves repeatedly selecting a hypothesis class, searching the hypothesis class by minimizing a given objective function over the model's parameter space, and evaluating the generalization performance of the resulting model. This search can be computationally intensive as training data continuously arrives, or as one needs to tune hyperparameters; in the hypothesis class and the objective function. In this paper, we present a framework for exact incremental learning and adaptation of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The approach is general and allows one to learn and unlearn individual or multiple examples, adapt the current SVM to changes in regularization and kernel parameters, and evaluate generalization performance through exact leave-one-out error estimation.

We are developing methods to automatically and unobtrusively learn the social network structure that arises within a human group based on wearable sensors. Computational models of group interaction dynamics are derived from data gathered using wearable sensors. The questions we are exploring are: Can we tell who influences whom? Can we quantify this amount of influence? How can we modify group interactions to promote better information diffusion? The goal is real-time learning and modification of social network relationships by applying statistical machine learning techniques to data obtained from unobtrusive wearable sensors.

Latencies in head-motion compensation cause virtual objects to swim around instead of being stable in space. This results in an unnatural feel, disorientation, and simulation sickness in addition to errors in fitting/matching of virtual and real objects. Visual update delays are a critical technical obstacle for implementation of head-mounted displays in a wide variety of applications. To address this problem, we propose to use machine learning techniques to define a forward model of head movement based on angular velocity information. In particular, we utilize recurrent neural network to capture the temporal pattern of pitch and yaw motion. Our results demonstrate an ability, to predict head motion up to 40 ins. ahead thus eliminating the main source of latencies. The accuracy of the system is tested for conditions akin to those encountered in virtual environments. These results demonstrate successful generalization by the learning system.

We compare conventional k-nearest neighbor techniques with generalized linear models and multilayer perceptrons using confidence intervals and McNemar's test.

Watson and Crick invented the secret of life (the DNA) in 1953, but it took us about 40 years to build the infrastructure to start unraveling the mysteries of human life, all encoded in the Genome. Today Drug Discovery is dominated by Biology. We now discover drugs bottom-up with more preciseness than ever by first identifying the target (protein) that manifests the disease and then searching for a compound (drug) that can directly act on the target. High throughput technologies based on robots parallel process thousands of experiments generating large quantities of data. This special session deep dives into specific requirements, current solutions using data and text mining as well as intelligent agents, and open problems in successfully analyzing this data to accelerate drug discovery.

Existing knowledge about the environment is incrementally updated by new observations, and performance improves as a consequence of better knowledge about the environment. The model aims at bridging the gap between machine learning and cognitive science by adopting the bounded rationality framework (Simon, 1956), which assumes that cognition tends to exploit the characteristics of the environment without engaging in psychologically implausible computations. Empirical studies were conducted when human subjects learned to find the fastest path in a simple map (only one was reported in this paper). The model fit the human learning and performance well and provided insights into the mechanisms behind learning and performance in problem solving.

Nevertheless in many real-user modeling systems, where the data is collected over an extended period of time, the learning task can be complicated by changes in the distribution underlying the data. This problem is known in machine learning as concept drift. The main idea behind Statistical Quality Control is to monitor the stability of one or more quality characteristics in a production process which generally shows some variation over time. In this paper we present a method for handling concept drift based on Shewhart P-Charts in an on-line framework for supervised learning. We explore the use of two alternatives P-charts, which differ only by the way they estimate the target value to set the center line. Experiments with simulated concept drift scenarios in the context of a user modeling prediction task compare the proposed method with other adaptive approaches. The results show that, both P-Charts consistently recognize concept changes, and that the learner can adapt quickly to these changes to maintain its performance level.

To this end, this paper looks into the operation of a traffic network with distributed, intelligent agents. In particular, it casts the task of operating a traffic network as a distributed, stochastic game in which the agents solve reinforcement-learning problems. Results from computational experiments show that these agents can yield substantial gains with respect to the performance achieved by two other control policies for traffic lights. The paper ends with an outline of future research to deploy machine-learning technology in real-world traffic networks.

The accuracies of the six predictors used in this experiment ranged from 77% to 91% for the ordered regions and from 56% to 78% for the disordered segments. The average of the order and disorder predictions ranged from 73% to 77%. The prediction of disorder in the shorter segments was poor, from 25% to 66% correct, while the prediction of disorder in the longer segments was better, from 75% to 95% correct. Four of the predictors were composed of ensembles of neural networks. This enabled them to deal more efficiently with the large asymmetry in the training data through diversified sampling from the significantly larger ordered set and achieve better accuracy on ordered and long disordered regions. The exclusive use of long disordered regions for predictor training likely contributed to the disparity of the predictions on long versus short disordered regions, while averaging the output values over 61-residue windows to eliminate short predictions of order or disorder probably contributed to the even greater disparity for three of the predictors. This experiment supports the predictability of intrinsic disorder from amino acid sequence. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This matching process accounts for the most resource intensive task of an IDS. Many systems perform the matching by comparing each input event to all rules sequentially. This is far from being optimal. Although sometimes ad-hoc optimizations axe utilized, no general solution to this problem has been proposed so far. This paper describes an approach where machine learning clustering techniques are applied to improve the matching process. Given a set of signatures (each dictating. a number of constraints the input data must fulfill to trigger it) an algorithm generates a decision tree that is used to find malicious events using as few redundant comparisons as possible. This general idea has been applied to a network-based IDS. In particular, a system has been implemented that replaces the detection engine of Snort [14,16]. Experimental evaluation shows that the speed of the detection process has been significantly improved, even compared to Snort's recently released, fully revised detection engine.

However, as with most machine learning techniques, feature and case subset selection can be extremely influential on the quality of the predictions generated. Unfortunately, both are NP-hard search problems which are intractable for non-trivial data sets. Using all features frequently leads to poor prediction accuracy and pre-processing methods (filters) have not generally been effective. In this paper we consider two different real world project effort data sets. We describe how using simple search techniques, such as hill climbing and sequential selection, can achieve major improvements in accuracy. We conclude that, for our data sets, forward sequential selection, for features, followed by backward sequential selection, for cases, is the most effective approach when exhaustive searching is not possible.

The problem can be dealt with by incorporating domain knowledge about samples being recognized into the learning process. We present a method that allows to perform this task using a rough approximation framework. We show how human expert's domain knowledge expressed in natural language can be approximately translated by a machine learning recognition system. We present in details how the method performs on a system recognizing handwritten digits from a large digit database. Our approach is an extension of ideas developed in the rough mereology theory.

In this paper, an algorithm for finding multiple reducts is developed. The algorithm has been used to find the multi-reducts in data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments show that many databases in the real world have multiple reducts. Using the multi-reducts, multi-knowledge is defined and an approach for extraction is presented. It is shown that a robot with multi-knowledge has the ability to identify a changing environment. Multi-knowledge can be applied in many application areas in machine learning or data mining domain.

The high computational complexity of this algorithm is a well-known problem. The B&B algorithm constructs a search tree, and then searches for the optimal feature subset in the tree. Previous work on the B&B algorithm was focused on how to simplify the search tree in order to reduce the search complexity. Several improvements have already existed. A detailed analysis of basic B&B algorithm and existing improvements is given under a common framework in which all the algorithms are compared. Based on this analysis, an improved B&B algorithm, BBPP+, is proposed. Experimental comparison shows that BBPP+ performs best.

This paper describes how the design of AIS. based IDSs can be improved through the use of a genetic red team (GRT) to discover holes (in the form of type II errors) found in the immune system. GRTs are just one component of an interactive tool for the design and analysis of immunity-based intrusion detection systems named GENERTIA. Although the research presented in this paper focuses on AIS-based IDSs, the concept of a GRT can be applied to any IDS that uses machine learning techniques to develop models of self and non-self.

Developing rules manually through incorporation of attack signatures results in meaningful but weak rules as it is difficult to define thresholds. This paper utilizes a hybrid procedure for developing rules by combining signature analysis with automated techniques to improve readability, comprehensibility, and maintainability of rules. Through the proposed rule-formulation technique, heuristic rules were developed for two remote-to-local (R2L) attacks using the KDD intrusion detection features and dataset. Empirical results show that high detection rates with low false alarms are observed for the warezmaster and warezclient attacks in the KDD data set. The utilized technique also highlighted a mislabeling problem in the KDD dataset for the two R2L attacks considered.

To our knowledge, a general answer to this question is not known. We conjecture that if the components of the mixture have the same covariance matrix (or the same covariance matrix up to a scaling factor), then the number of modes cannot exceed the number of components. We demonstrate that the number of modes can exceed the number of components when the components are allowed to have arbitrary and different covariance matrices. We will review related results from scale-space theory, statistics and machine learning, including a proof of the conjecture in ID. We present a convergent, EM-like algorithm for mode finding and compare results of searching for all modes starting from the centers of the mixture components with a brute-force search. We also discuss applications to data reconstruction and clustering.

A typical information that is not available in these stages is software size metrics, such as lines of code (LOC). Models for LOC estimation are obtained from historical data and statistical regression methods are usually applied. These characteristics make this estimation problem especially interesting for the application of machine learning techniques. To explore this fact, this work applies Genetic Programming and Neural Networks techniques for LOC estimation. Two different data sets were used to obtain two models using respectively the metrics function points and number of components. The models are analysed and the machine learning techniques are compared.

On the one hand, Perceptual Learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, Perceptual Learning and Cognitive Learning are both necessary for learning and often depends on each other On the other hand, many works in Machine Learning are concerned with "Abstraction" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the Abstraction framework, Perceptual Learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically-inspired Perceptual Learning mechanisms could be used to build efficient lowlevel Abstraction operators that deal with real world data.

Web Services would greatly simplify the development of many kinds of data integration and knowledge management applications. Unfortunately, this vision requires that services describe themselves with large amounts of semantic metadata "glue". We explore a variety of machine learning techniques to semiautomatically create such metadata. We make three contributions. First, we describe a Bayesian learning and inference algorithm for classifying HTML forms into semantic categories, as well as assigning semantic labels to the form's fields. These techniques are important as legacy HTML interfaces are migrated to Web Services. Second, we describe the application of the Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms to the task of Web Service classification. We show that an ensemble approach that treats Web Services as structured objects is more accurate than an unstructured approach. Finally, we describe a clustering algorithm that automatically discovers the semantic categories of Web Services. All of our algorithms are evaluated using large collections of real HTML forms and Web Services.

Since images are an essential component of the Web, this work focuses on an intelligent approach to semantic annotation of images. We propose a three-layer architecture, in which the bottom layer organizes visual information extracted from the raw image contents, which are mapped to semantically meaningful keywords in the middle layer, which are then connected to schemas and ontologies on the top layer. Our key contribution is the use of machine learning algorithms for user-assisted, semi-automatic image annotation, in such a way that the knowledge of previously annotated images - both at metadata and visual levels - is used to speed up the annotation of subsequent images within the sane domain (ontology) as well as to improve future query and retrieval of annotated images.

We designed, implemented and evaluated a wearable system which can determine typical user context and context transition probabilities online and without external supervision. The system relies on techniques from machine learning, statistical analysis and graph algorithms. It can be used for online classification and prediction. Our results indicate the power of our method to determine a meaningful user context model while only requiring data from a comfortable physiological sensor device.

Layout analysis is the process of extracting a hierarchical structure describing the layout of a page. In our approach, the layout analysis is performed in two steps: firstly, the global analysis determines possible areas containing paragraphs, sections, columns, figures and tables, and secondly, the local analysis groups together blocks that possibly fall within the same area. The result of the local analysis process strongly depends on the quality of the results of the first step. We investigate the possibility of supporting the user during the correction of the results of the global analysis. This is done by allowing the user to correct the results of the global analysis and then by learning rules for layout correction from the sequence of user actions. Experimental results on a set of multi-page documents are reported and commented.

Analyzing diagrams will be important for building comprehensive document retrieval systems. This paper focuses on the extraction and classification of diagrams from PDF documents. We study diagrams available in vector (not raster) format in online research papers. PDF files are parsed and their vector graphics components installed in a spatial index. Subdiagrams are found by analyzing white space gaps. A set of statistics is generated for each diagram, e.g., the number of horizontal lines and vertical lines. The statistics form a feature vector description of the diagram. The vectors are used in a kernel-based machine learning system (Support Vector Machine). Separating a set of bar graphs from non-bar-graphs gathered from 20,000 biology research papers gave a classification accuracy of 91.7%. The approach is directly applicable to diagrams vectorized from images.

However, computers see everything as numbers. We present a computational algorithm for machine classification of written languages using the method of vector quantization. For a language document, each word is converted to a sequence of numbers and forms as a vector of numerical values according to its characters. This collection of vectors is then represented by a codebook that contains a number of template vectors for classification. The proposed method is more effective for machine learning than the n-gram based method, which has been widely used for written language identification. Experimental results of classifying a set of five closely roman-typed scripts show the promising application of the proposed method.

The generalization performance of a machine learner depends oil how much it avoids the overfitting. The main idea of this algorithm is to reduce the complexity of ensemble networks according to overfitting oil progress toward training. DEPA emphasizes oil avoiding "overfitting" by dynamically deleting individual neural networks and their hidden nodes starting from a large number of individual neural networks. DEPA has been tested on several standard benchmark problems in machine learning and neural networks, including breast cancer, diabetes and heart disease problems. The experimental results show that DEPA can produce neural network ensembles with good generalization ability.

A machine has to learn techniques by trial and error when there are no training examples. Reinforcement learning is a powerful machine learning system, which is able to learn without giving training examples to a learning unit. But it is impossible for the reinforcement learning to support large environments because the number of if-then rules is a huge combination of a relationship between one environment and one action. We have proposed new reinforcement learning system for the large environment, Fuzzy Environment Evaluation Reinforcement Learning (FEERL). In this paper, we proposed to reuse of the acquired rules by FEERL.

To realize a solution, we apply such a method where jobs are to be dispatched by applying a set of rules (rule-set), and propose an approach in which a rule-set is generated and improved by using the genetics-based machine learning technique. Through some computational experiments, the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed approach are investigated.

For this purpose, we applied two methodologies: a decision tree approach utilising Quinlan's See5 machine learning environment was compared with a modification of Cox's regression, a statistical approach and the two systems evaluated for classification accuracy. Data from 747 lower limb and 487 upper limb cases were analysed, with the model being extracted from key parameters, which were retrieved from the original database. We also used information from the medical personnel involved and indicators of significance from preliminary studies. Exactly the same model and parameters were utilised in both approaches to ensure comparability. Results are given for the classification performance for both approaches, with respect to the length of stay.

This paper investigates ways to extract emotion from spontaneous speech, aiming at transferring emotions to appropriate facial expressions of the speaker's virtual representatives. Hence, this paper presents one step towards an emotional speech-driven facial animation system, promises to be the first true non-human animation assistant. Different classifier-algorithms (support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees) were compared in extracting emotion from speech features. Results show that these machine-learning algorithms outperform human subjects extracting emotion from speech alone if there is no access to additional cues onto the emotional state.

This model has been constructed using a machine learning approach. It is based on the use of a subclass of probabilistic finite automata which can be used for variable-order Markov processes. This model allows us to represent the different relationships and the representative information observed in the hourly series of global radiation; the variable-order Markov process can be used as a natural way to represent different types of days, and to take into account the "variable memory" of cloudiness. A method to generate new series of hourly global radiation, which incorporates the randomness observed in recorded series, is also proposed. As input data this method only uses the mean monthly value of the daily solar global radiation. We examine if the recorded and simulated series are similar. It can be concluded that both series have the same statistical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

" The fundamental issue under consideration is optimization over time by using learning and approximation to handle problems that severely challenge conventional methods due to their very large scale and/or lack of sufficient prior knowledge. In this chapter we discuss the relationships, results, and challenges of various approaches under the theme of ADP. We also introduce the fundamental principles of our direct neural dynamic programming (NDP). We demonstrate its application for a continuous state control problem using an industrial scale Apache helicopter model. This is probably one of the first studies where an ADP type of algorithm has been applied to a complex, realistic, continuous state problem, which is a major challenge in machine learning when dealing with scalability or generalization.

This paper describes how depth maps can be highly compressed and transmitted alongside 2D images with minimal additional bandwidth. The authors have previously described a rapid 2D to 3D conversion system for generating depth maps. This system, which relies on Machine Learning algorithms, effectively encodes the relationships between a 2D source image and the associated depths of objects within the image. These relationships, which are expressed in terms of the colour and position of objects, may be exploited to provide an effective compression mechanism. This paper describes the practical implementation of this technology in an integrated 2D to 3D conversion system. We demonstrate the advantages of the encoding scheme relative to other industry standard compression techniques,: examining issues relating to bandwidth, decoding performance and the effect of compression artifacts on stereoscopic image quality.

Learning and classification techniques are increasingly relevant to the state of the art content management systems. From relevance feedback to semantic detection, there is a shift in the amount of supervision that precedes retrieval from light weight classifiers to heavy weight classifiers. In this paper we compare the performance of some popular classifiers for semantic video indexing. We mainly compare among other techniques, one technique for generative modeling and one for discriminant learning and show how they behave depending on the number of examples that the user is willing to provide to the system. We report results using the NIST TREC Video Corpus.

Although unavoidable and necessary, manual annotation of dynamic multimedia becomes even less feasible when multimedia quickly changes in complexity, i.e. in volume, modality, and usage context. The latter context could be set by learning or other purposes of the multimedia material. This multimedia dynamics calls for categorisation systems that index, query and retrieve multimedia objects on the fly in a similar way as a human expert would. We present and demonstrate such a supervised dynamic multimedia object categorisation system. Our categorisation system comes about by continuously gauging it to a group of human experts who annotate raw multimedia for a certain domain ontology given a usage context. Thus effectively our system learns the categorisation behaviour of human experts. By inducing supervised multi-modal content and context-dependent potentials our categorisation system associates field strengths of raw dynamic multimedia object categorisations with those human experts would assign. After a sufficient long period of supervised machine learning we arrive at automated robust and discriminative multimedia categorisation. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our multimedia categorisation system in retrieving semantically meaningful soccer-video fragments, in particular by taking advantage of multimodal and domain specific information and knowledge supplied by human experts.

This notation may also include some higher level information such as variations in the dynamics, tempo and timing. Famous performers are characterised by their expressive interpretation, the ability to convey structural and emotive information within the given framework. The majority of work on audio content analysis focusses on retrieving score-level information; this paper reports on the extraction of parameters describing the performance, a task which requires a much higher degree of accuracy. Two systems are presented: BeatRoot, an off-line beat tracking system which finds the times of musical beats and tracks changes in tempo throughout a performance, and the Performance Worm, a system which provides a real-time visualisation of the two most important expressive dimensions, tempo and dynamics. Both of these systems are being used to process data for a large-scale study of musical expression in classical and romantic piano performance, which uses artificial intelligence (machine learning) techniques to discover fundamental patterns or principles governing expressive performance.

Many host-based intrusion detector systems - especially those that use anomaly detection - use training data to synthesize detectors automatically, that is, the detectors are classifiers created by machine learning algorithms. Regularization, which often improves the performance of machine learning algorithms, has not previously been applied to intrusion detector synthesis. This paper discusses regularization for machine learning-based intrusion detectors, showing how regularization can be accomplished for such systems and providing the results of an empirical evaluation.

One such method, vocal tract length normalization (VTLN), is especially useful when the system has to work reliably for males, females and children. It is just this situation with our phonological awareness teaching system, the "SpeechMaster", which aims at real-time phoneme recognition and feedback. As most VTLN algorithms work off-line, this poses the additional problem of real-time operation. This paper examines how a well-known off-line algorithm can be approximated on-line by machine learning regression techniques. We conclude that, by employing a real-time estimation of VTLN parameters, the recognition error can be reduced by some 14-24%.

J	Pichler, R				Pichler, R			Explicit versus implicit representations of subsets of the Herbrand universe	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						implicit generalizations; negation elimination; Herbrand universe; complexity	ELIMINATION; COMPLEXITY; NEGATION	In Lassez and Marriott (J. Automat. Reson. 3 (3) (1987) 301-317), explicit and implicit generalizations were studied as representations of subsets of some fixed Herbrand universe H. An explicit generalization E = r(1) V... V r(1) represents all ground terms that are instances of at least one of the terms t(i), whereas an implicit generalization I = t/t(1) V...V t(m) represents all H-ground instances of t that are not instances of any term t(i). More generally, a disjunction P = I-1 V...V I-n of implicit generalizations contains all ground terms that are contained in at least one of the implicit generalizations I-j. Implicit generalizations have applications to many areas of Computer Science like machine learning, unification, specification of abstract data types, logic programming, functional programming, etc. In these areas, the so-called finite explicit representability problem plays an important role, i.e. given a disjunction of implicit generalizations P = I-1 V...VIn, does there exist an explicit generalization E, s.t. P and E are equivalent? We shall prove the coNP-completeness of this decision problem. Implicit generalizations can be represented as equational formulae, i.e., first-order formulae whose only predicate symbol is syntactic equality. Closely related to the finite explicit representability problem is the so-called negation elimination problem of equational formulae, i.e. given an arbitrary equational formula P is P semantically equivalent to an equational formula without universal quantifiers and negation. In this work we study the negation elimination problem of equational formulae with purely existential quantifier prefix. We prove the coNP-completcness for such formulae in DNF and the II2p-hardness in case of CNF. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However to date the formal relationship between learning algorithms and their impact on these two metrics remains unexplored. This paper proposes a formalization of precision and recall of extraction and investigates the complexity-theoretic aspects of learning algorithms for multi-attribute data extraction based on this formalism. We show that there is a tradeoff between precision/recall of extraction and computational efficiency and present experimental results to demonstrate the practical utility of these concepts in designing scalable data extraction algorithms for improving recall without compromising on precision.

Accordingly, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is nowadays considered a relevant learning criterion, accommodating imbalanced data, misclassification costs and noisy data. This paper shows how a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the AUC criterion can be exploited for impact studies and sensitivity analysis. The approach is illustrated on the Atherosclerosis Identification problem, PKDD 2002 Challenge.

In this paper we present 4 contact-map prediction algorithm that employs Support Vector Machines as the machine learning tool and incorporates various features such as sequence profiles and their conservation, correlated mutation analysis based on various amino acid physicochemical properties, and secondary structure. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the different features on contact map prediction for different fold classes. On average, our predictor achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.2238 with an improvement over a random predictor of a factor 11.7, which is better than reported studies. Our study showed that predicted secondary structure features play an important roles for the proteins containing beta structures. Models based on secondary structure features and CMA features produce different sets of predictions. Our study also suggests that models learned separately for different protein fold families may achieve better performance than a unified model.

Such an open framework is powerful since different sub-methods can be plugged into the framework to generate different specific Multiple Instance Learning algorithms. In our proposed framework, the Multiple Instance Learning problem is first converted to an unconstrained optimization problem by the Minimum Square Error (MSE) criterion, and then the framework can be constructed with an open form of hypothesis and gradient search method. The proposed Multiple Instance Learning framework is applied to the drug activity problems in bioinformatics applications. Specifically, experiments are conducted on the Musk-1 dataset to predict, the binding activity of drug molecules. In the experiments, an algorithm with the exponential hypothesis model and the Quasi-Newton method is embedded into,our proposed framework. We compare,our proposed framework with other existing algorithms and the experimental, results show that our proposed framework yields a good accuracy of classification, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework.

When people make E-commerce decisions, they are most challenged by more and more semi-structured or unstructured digital information resources all over the world. Because of the inefficiency and imperfection of extant techniques to extract and integrate data, systematic and intelligent web-based data warehouse is expected by both governments and corporations. Here we analyze the extant techniques to gather resources firstly, then we introduce the XML data warehouse system. Our system uses agents to crawl on the web to search for specific information. and can find the wanted but deep and hidden web pages by our multi-knowledge description and form auto-submission algorithms. Our system can gather information on many different web pages and integrate them into a systematic data warehouse based on XML. Powerful XML APIs such as DOM and SOAP are also used in our system in the process of storing or loading database based on XML. At the same time our system are multi-threaded and error-resilient. FLEX and BISON help making a module of parsing of our system, which parses the pages and creates a parsing tree, therefore the ability of our system to extract specific information is excellent. Machine learning and intelligent adaptive algorithms are also equipped by our system and are the basis of the knowledge library of our system. Our data warehouse can also be upgraded day by day and use an information ranking system to maintain our huge database. Users can access to our data warehouse easily by http-supported browsers. Finally we discuss the implementation of our system and test its performance.

Logic programming and specially extended logic programming provides a powerful tool for achieving such goal; i.e., besides being mathematically correct it makes the prototyping phase easier. However, although no simple methodology had yet been stated to address the complexity present in this approach, it not only addresses problems of architecture development and analysis, but also looks at problems of knowledge representation and reasoning, and machine learning.

At the same time that analytical techniques are expanding, new conceptual approaches to the modeling of travel are emerging in an effort to improve travel demand forecasting and better assess the impacts of emerging transportation policy. In particular, the shift toward activity-based travel analysis has led to the development of activity scheduling models. One of the key features of emerging models of this type is the attempt to simulate the order in which activities are added during a continuous process of schedule construction. In practice, a fixed order by activity type is often assumed; for example, work activities are planned first, followed by the planning of more discretionary activity types. By using observed data on the scheduling process from a small sample of households from Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, a neural network model that classifies activities according to the order in which they were planned, the planning time horizon (preplanned, planned, or impulsive), was developed. A variety of explanatory variables were used in the model related to individual-, household-, and activity-based characteristics such as spatial and temporal fixities. The model developed exhibited a relatively high degree of prediction with the test data, especially for the preplanned and impulsive categories of the planning time horizon. These results suggest that machine-learning algorithms could be used to predict the order in which activities are selected in emerging activity scheduling process models, thereby avoiding static assumptions related purely to activity type.

To avoid users browsing through the whole list of results, search engines use ranking algorithms to order the list according to predefined criteria. In this paper, we present Toogle, a front-end to the Google search engine for both desktop browsers and mobile phones. For a given search query, Toogle first ranks results using Google's algorithm and, as the user browses through the result list, uses machine learning techniques to infer a model of her search goal and to adapt accordingly the order in which the results are presented. We describe preliminary experimental results that show the effectiveness of Toogle.

The large number of very different users using these systems make user model construction difficult. The solution is to use machine learning techniques that dynamically update the models by monitoring user behavior. However, the design of machine learning tasks for user modeling is static. This poses a problem in adaptive learning environments based on virtual communities. Each virtual community has its own administrators, and each administrator may prefer to include some more information on the user model. Another problem in the application of machine learning techniques for user model construction is the need to retrain the machine learning algorithms when new user interaction data become available. To face these problems, in this paper we present a multiagent adaptive module set in an adaptive learning collaborative environment. Our goal is two fold: (i) we want each administrator to be able to define new machine learning attributes in the user model (ii) we want to provide a mechanism to dynamically retrain the algorithms.

Since the student's preferences can change over time, this task is related to a problem known as concept drift in the machine learning community. For this class of problems an adaptive predictive model, able to adapt quickly to the user's changes, is desirable. The results from conducted experiments show that Adaptive Bayes seems to be a fine and simple choice for this kind of prediction task in user modeling.

J	Chen, WC; Chang, NB; Chen, JC				Chen, WC; Chang, NB; Chen, JC			Rough set-based hybrid fuzzy-neural controller design for industrial wastewater treatment	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						optimal control; rough set; genetic algorithm; neural network; fuzzy logic control; wastewater treatment; artificial intelligence; soft computing; knowledge discovery; machine learning	ACTIVATED-SLUDGE PROCESS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CONTROL STRATEGIES; NETWORK; SYSTEM; OPERATION; DYNAMICS; RULES; LOGIC	Recent advances in control engineering suggest that hybrid control strategies, integrating some ideas and paradigms existing in different soft computing techniques, such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, rough set theory, and neural networks, may provide improved control performance in wastewater treatment processes. This paper presents an innovative hybrid control algorithm leading to integrate the distinct aspects of indiscernibility capability of rough set theory and search capability of genetic algorithms with conventional neural-fuzzy controller design. The methodology proposed in this study employs a three-stage analysis that is designed in series for generating a representative state function, searching for a set of multi-objective control strategies, and performing a rough set-based autotuning for the neural-fuzzy logic controller to make it applicable for controlling an industrial wastewater treatment process. Research findings in the case study clearly indicate that the use of rough set theory to aid in the neural-fuzzy logic controller design can produce relatively better plant performance in terms of operating cost, control stability, and response time simultaneously, which is effective at least in the selected industrial wastewater treatment plant. Such a methodology is anticipated to be capable of dealing with many other types of process control problems in waste treatment processes by making only minor modifications.

The approach was initially inspired to a previous works of Haritaoglou et al. [2] that uses histogram projections to classify people's posture. We modify and improve the generality of the approach by adding a machine learning phase in order to generate probability maps. A statistic classifier has then defined that compares the probability maps and the histogram profiles extracted from each moving people. The approach results to be very robust if the initial constraints are satisfied and exhibits a very low computational time so that it can be used to process live videos with standard platforms.

The images acquired by the camera may be viewed as an implicit topological representation of the environment. The environment is a priori unknown and the topological representation is derived by unsupervised neural network architecture. The architecture includes a self-organising neural network, and is constituted by a Growing Neural Gas, which is well known for its topology preserving quality. The growth depends on the topology that is not a priori defined, and on the need of discovering it, by the neural network, during the learning. The implemented system is able to rightly recognise the input frames and to reconstruct a topological map of the environment. Each node of the neural network identifies a single zone of the environment and the connections between the nodes correspond to the real space connections in the environment.

Path prediction allows the network and services to further enhance the quality of service levels that the user enjoys. In this paper we present a path prediction algorithm that exploits the machine learning algorithm of learning automata. The decision of the learning automaton is driver by the movement patterns of a single user but is also affected by the aggregated patterns demonstrated by all users. Simulations of the algorithm, performed using a Realistic Mobility Pattern Generator, show increased prediction accuracy.

Some are too specific to their application, or are prototypes not suitable for general use. More general tools often are not capable of processing large volumes of data. We have created a Textual Data Mining Infrastructure (TMI) that incorporates both existing and new capabilities in a reusable framework conductive to developing new tools and components. TMI adheres to strict guidelines that allow it to run in a wide range of processing environments - as a result, it accommodates the volume of computing and diversity of research occurring in TDM. A unique capability of TMI is support for optimization. This facilitates text mining research by automating the search for optimal parameters in text mining algorithms. In this article we describe a number of applications that use the TMI. We present several novel results that have not been published elsewhere. We also discuss how the TMI utilizes existing machine-learning libraries, thereby enabling researchers to continue and extend their endeavors with minimal effort. Towards that end, TMI is available on the web at hddi.cse.lehigh.edu.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) offer a natural way to solve this problem. In this paper we present a special Genetic Algorithm, which especially takes into account the existing bounds on the generalization error for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This new approach is compared to the traditional method of performing cross-validation and to other existing algorithms for feature selection.

One main goal of research is to help patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities by substituting normal motor outputs. Various cortical processes were identified which are suitable for implementing such a system on basis of scalp recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), e.g., slow cortical potentials (SCP) and event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of 10-20 Hz brain rhythms. Until quite recently BCI systems used only few EEG channels but by use of advanced machine learning techniques it became possible to exploit the spatial information provided by multi-channel EEG. While the use of such high density spatial sampling increases the accuracy of the system it may-depending on the computational effort of the signal processing-pose a problem for the implementation of the feedback in real-time. Here we propose a method that offers a substantial speed-up for classification of SCP features as used in the Berlin Brain computer interface (BBCI) [1]. Instead of applying the time consuming low-pass filtering to all, say 120, EEG channels a suitable spatial projection extracts only 2 or 4 new channels which can be used without any loss of classification accuracy in our experiments. Our approach is based on the technique of common spatial patterns (CSP) which were suggested in [2] to extract ERD features from EEG. While in its original form CSP is only applicable to oscillatory features we present a new variant which allows to use CSP for SCP features without regularisation even in case of large channel numbers or few training samples.

We have designed and built a software tool (expert system shell) called MeESE (McMaster Expert System Environment) that processes a set of production (decision) rules of a very general form. Such a production (decision) set can be equivalently symbolized as a decision tree. In real life, even if the logical structure of a production system (decision tree) is provided, the knowledge engineer may be faced with the lack of knowledge of other important parameters of the tree. For instance, in our system McESE, the weights, threshold, and the certainty propagation functions - all of these are a part of the machinery handling the certainty/uncertainty of decisions - have to be designed according to a set of training (representative) events, observations, and examples. One possible way of deriving these parameters is to employ machine learning (ML) or data mining (DM) algorithms. However, 'traditional' algorithms in both fields select immediate (usually local) optimal values in the context of a whole decision set such algorithms select optimal values for each rule without regard to optimal values for the whole knowledge base. Genetic algorithms comprise a long process of evolution of a large population of objects (chromosomes) before selecting (usually global) optimal values, and so giving a chance' to weaker, worse objects, that nevertheless may prove to be optimal in the context of the whole knowledge base. In this methodology case study, we expect that a set of McESE decision rules (or more precisely, the topology of a decision tree) is given. The paper discusses a simulation of an application of genetic algorithms to generate parameters of the given tree that can be then used in the rule-based expert system shell McESE.

The task of the sensor node is to collect data points (examples) at regular time intervals and communicate them to the central base station (BS) using wireless links. Since sensor nodes have limited battery power, it is necessary to minimize their energy consumption. One way is to reduce the amount of sensor data packets transmitted. In this paper, we incorporate machine learning strategies to intelligently reduce the amount of transmitted data, in order to increase life-span of the sensors and thus profitability of the system. In our proposed approach, after a short initialization period, the sensors obtain a classification model from the BS based upon which they detect interesting (positive) data points. Positive examples are, together with selected negative examples, then reported to the BS. In time, BS will have stored an abundant number of negatives and a limited number of positives causing what is termed as a class-imbalance problem in learning. In order to understand the impact of network architecture on learning performance, two different architectures are studied: cluster-based (LEACH) and tiered (UNPF). With the aid of experiments using generated data sets, the paper analyzes the tradeoffs between prediction success, learning cost, packets transmitted and energy consumed.

ASE uses onboard continuous planning, robust task and goal-based execution, model-based mode identification and reconfiguration, and onboard machine learning and pattern recognition to radically increase science return by enabling intelligent downlink selection and autonomous retargeting. In this paper we discuss how these AI technologies are synergistically integrated in a hybrid multi-layer control architecture to enable a virtual spacecraft science agent. Demonstration of these capabilities in a flight environment will open up tremendous new opportunities in planetary science, space physics, and earth science that would be unreachable without this technology.

This process requires users to identify: goals and objectives to be achieved (and their relative priorities), the various risks to achieving those goals and objectives, and options for risk mitigation (prevention, detection ahead of time, and alleviation). Risks are broadly defined to include the risk of failing to design a system with adequate performance, compatibility and robustness in addition to more traditional implementation and operational risks. The options for mitigating these different kinds of risks can include architectural and design choices, technology plans and technology back-up options, test-bed and simulation options, engineering models and hardware/software development techniques and other more traditional risk reduction techniques. Each of these risk mitigations has resource costs associated with them. The sum of all these mitigations is almost always unaffordable. Furthermore, there may be a variety of other constraints (mass, power, funding profile, leveraged programs, etc.) that further constrain acceptable selections. The challenge is therefore to emerge with an "optimal" selection of mitigations that makes best use of available resources to reduce risk to the fullest extent possible. For non-trivial design spaces, the search space of possible selections is huge. This precludes exhaustive search for the optimum, and therefore necessitates the adoption of heuristic search techniques. At JPL, we have explored application of several heuristic techniques for searching for, and refining, collections of risk mitigations, notably: genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and machine learning. The results of research and pilot applications of these techniques for finding best combinations of life cycle risk management solutions are discussed.

The method was based on Soft Margin AdaBoost (SMA) algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm has been used with great success as a high-level learning procedure to obtain strong classifiers from weak classifiers, but it tends to overfit in the presence of highly noisy data. Recent studies show that a regularised AdaBoost algorithm, such as SMA, can achieve better results for noisy data. In this paper we propose two new techniques for classifying the image as frontal (face is within +/-25degrees) or profile, one based on the original Adaboost algorithm, the other based on SMA. It is shown that SMA based technique is more robust than original AdaBoost based technique, and L yields better results. All the techniques were trained and tested on four databases. Experimental results show that the classification error of the SMA method is less than 2% for suitable parameters, regardless of the conditions associated with the face. In addition, the method performs extremely well even when some facial features become partially or wholly occluded.

This, in conjunction with the introduction of new linear classification methods such as the Support Vector Machines has produced significant progress. The successes of such algorithms is now spreading as they are applied to more and more domains. Many Signal Processing problems, by their non-linear and high-dimensional nature may benefit from such techniques. We give an overview of kernel methods and their recent applications.

Our algorithm requires a Mercer kernel together with the corresponding feature space. A stationarity index is designed in the feature space, and consists of comparing two circles corresponding to two v-SV novelty detectors via a Fisher-like ratio. An abrupt change corresponds to a large distance between the circles centers (w.r.t. their radii). We show that the index can be computed in the input space, and simulation results show its efficiency in front of real data.

A drawback of inductive logic programs is their demanding computational requirements. We present an FPGA-based multi-processor architecture aimed at fast execution of such programs. The architecture exploits both coarse-grained parallelism at the query level, and fine-grained parallelism in the unification algorithm. Instructions are not required, and the components are customised for a hypothesis space referring only to ground unit clauses in the background knowledge. It also benefits from a distributed memory hierarchy, with a method for including background knowledge to eliminate instructions. The effectiveness of this architecture is demonstrated using a large organic chemistry data set. The proposed architecture is faster and smaller than our previous design based on multiple instruction processors. A single customised processor at 38MHz can run times faster than a Pentium 4 processor at 1.8GHz; a Xilinx XCV2000E device can accommodate 24 processors running in parallel.

Therefore, vision systems need to be recalibrated whenever lighting conditions change, otherwise they fail to recognize objects or classify them incorrectly. This paper describes experiments aimed at overcoming the problem of vision recalibration. We use Sony ERS210A robots, which are used in RoboCup, the international robot soccer competition. These robots are equipped with colour cameras. The robots are trained to recognize colours under different lightning conditions using machine learning. Learned knowledge is then used for object recognition. In addition, the robots are trained to recognize objects using colour and other object attributes. Incorporating leaning into the vision system facilitates object recognition and provides the ability to automatically adapt vision to new environments.

For many applications in the pattern recognition, the classifier is desirous to have. a higher sensitivity. Considering that the current methods for improving the sensitivity of SVM possess some deficiencies, we present a new method based on data optimization in this paper Its scheme is to control the sensitivity of SVM by optimizing the training data with other statistical model. Test results with the identification of translation initiation site of Eukaryotic gene show that data optimization based method can improve the sensitivity and overall prediction accuracy of SVM effectively, and composed with other method will get better effect.

Firstly, the paper presents object-oriented architecture of micro-operation robot. Basing on intelligent robot typical hierarchy model, the concept of primitive control is brought foward, modules are further encapsulated into primitive methods, and a robot task is simply abstracted into a sequence of task primitive. By primitive control, simple machine learning and online task plan of micro-operation robot are implemented. Experiments prove the method could effectively improve intelligence, automation and adaptation of micro-operation robot.

In this case, emphasis is placed on illustrating the combined effect that both feature level and classifier decision fusion has on improving overall performance for each of the data sets. Several different types of classifiers are trained using the UCI data sets. Results are shown by estimating the probability of error on independent evaluation data using cross-validation. Classifier fusion is based on majority voting and the Mean-Field BDRA. Results demonstrate that for a given data set relative performance of the various classifier types differs greatly, and that the estimated probability of error for the fused classifier, based on the Mean-Field BDRA, is lower than the best performing individual feature based classifier.

We used direct kernel methods to separate abnormal MCG heart patterns from normal ones. For unsupervised learning, we introduced Direct Kernel based Self-Organizing Maps. For supervised learning we used Direct Kernel Partial Least Squares and (Direct) Kernel Ridge Regression. These results are then compared with classical Support Vector Machines and Kernel Partial Least Squares. The hyperparameters for these methods were tuned on a validation subset of the training data before testing. We also investigated the most effective pre-processing, using local, vertical, horizontal and two-dimensional (global) Mahanalobis scaling, wavelet transforms and experimented with variable selection by filtering. The results, similar for all three methods, were encouraging, exceeding the quality of classification achieved by the trained experts.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		discrete event systems; supervisory control; control logic; machine learning; temporal logic; formal methods		Vast majority of manufacturing devices and systems are controlled by programmable software logic controllers. The primary issues in design, development, and operation of such systems are related to the relative complexity of involved control logic. The focus for DES in supervisor), control is how to deal to with uncontrollable events, blocking in the controlled system and unobservable events. This paper presents a new methodology, for mapping operational pattern of States-Events-Times during control logic execution. This approach enables identification of conflicts, such as blockings or bottlenecks, which may occur due to exceptions (such as sensor failures). Proposed approach, relying on the historical data, pre-determined operational pattern, and relations of states-events-times, generates a virtual supervisor which not only enables return of the process to deterministic behavior, but also run-time verification of its properties. This new approach offers the flexibility, to perform engineering changes, add new specifications, and facilitates future system modifications.

As a first step, to identify the representative terms given a set of classes, we compute the product of term frequency and document frequency. Secondly, the information gain of each term prioritizes it based on the possibility of classification. We compile the selected terms and classification into rules using machine learning algorithms. The compiled rules classify any Web page into categories defined on a domain ontology. In the experiments, 11 terms out of 1, 700 terms were identified as representative features given a set of Web pages. The resulting accuracy of the classification was, on the average, 95.2%.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		machine learning; natural language; randomization; translation		This paper addresses the problem of mapping natural language to its semantics. It presupposes that the input is in random (compressed) form and proceeds to detail a methodology for extracting the semantics from that normal form. The idea is to enumerate contextual cues and learn to associate those cues with meaning. The process is inherently fuzzy and for this reason is also inherently adaptive in nature. It is shown that the influence of context on meaning grows exponentially with the length of a word sequence. This suggests that rule-based randomization plays a key role in rendering a field-effect natural language semantic mapping tractable. An example of rule-based randomization for semantic normalization is as follows. Suppose that two commands to a robot are deemed to be equivalent; namely, "Grasp and pick up the glass" and "Hold the cup and raise it"'. Their mutual normalization might then be, "Grab container. Lift container." Clearly, the randomization process can be effected by rules. Also, the normalized syntax makes the result of any semantic mapping process - such as detailed herein - more efficient. A natural language front-end is described, which is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. Most significantly, the effective translation of natural language semantics is shown to critically depend on an accelerated capability for learning.

Data with hierarchical attribute values are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. In this paper, we thus propose a new algorithm to deal with the problem of producing a set of maximally general rules for coverage of training examples with hierarchical attribute values using rough sets. A rule is maximally general if no other rule exists that is both more general and with larger confidence than it. All the coverage rules gathered together must cover all the given training examples. The rules derived can then be used to build a prototype knowledge base.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		object recognition; online robots; neural networks		Within the context of online robots, a considerable amount of research has traditionally focused on the global system functionality, including the way of interaction between the user and the robot. Recent results in different robotics areas have demonstrated the potential of a number of techniques from the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning domains, although very few work has been specifically addressed to online robots, where the object recognition is directly performed by the user. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using a neural network approach to object recognition in the context of online robots, and discuss the main advantages over the application of statistical learning methods. Some experiments with the UJI (Universitat Jaume I) online robot evaluate the performance of different neural network implementations, comparing it to that of some distance-based object recognition algorithms.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		neural networks; natural language processing; machine learning	NEURAL NETWORKS	Nowadays, most connectionist models are more oriented to computational efficiency instead of neurophysiological inspiration. Classical learning algorithms, like the largely employed back-propagation, is argued to be biologically implausible. This paper aims to prove that a biologically inspired connectionist architecture and algorithm is not only capable of dealing with a high level cognitive task, like a natural language processing application, but also be more computationally efficient. It is presented a comparison between a standard simple recurrent network using backpropagation with a physiologically inspired system. Symbolic data, extracted from connectionist architectures, show that the physiologically plausible model displays more expectable semantic features about thematic relations between words than the conventional one.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		cultural algorithms; genetic algorithms; genetic programming; version space; evolutionary programining; machine learning; web services		Cultural algorithms, a form of evolutionary programming, employ a dual inheritance mechanism at population and knowledge levels to support problem solving, reasoning, and knowledge extraction. Domain knowledge is extracted and separated from individuals within a population and is placed in a belief space. Hierarchical structures employed in the belief space help to accelerate and guide population evolution. The structure of the Cultural Algorithm lends itself well to a data rich, but knowledge poor distributed environment. Current research, as reported in this paper, is directed toward implementing the belief and population space components as agents interacting with Web Services Web pages, and users. The Cultural Algorithm framework becomes a mechanism to evolve and refine meaningful search queries that extract significant and useful primary and peripheral information.

This model is based on Piaget's schema theory, which is well known theory in developmental psychology. In our model, we divide Piaget's original schema into two parts; one is a perceptional schema and the other is an intentional schema. By this division, we can describe both adaptation and learning processes of a human and/or of an autonomous robot more simply and more effectively. Further, we show a series of experiments, in which a facial-robot with our Dual-Schemata model attempts to chase movements of a colored ball, and then we present that a robot gets to obtain some inner symbols concerning with those ball movements.

The natural phenomenon to be animated is recorded using a video camera, and its characteristic behavior is captured. A data sequence representing the subject behavior is obtained from the captured video. By learning the inherent structure in the feature space of some sample data, the learned model can synthesize a novel data sequence from the existing sequences. The generated sequences of behavioral patterns could differ from every original data sequence but preserve characteristics of the subject behavior. We demonstrate the natural animation synthesis through such behavioral pattern sequences, and produce some realistic animation which depict the subject.

Recent progress of AI technology makes it possible to build business models with human- and software-agents participation. This paper describes a novel business simulator development for educational use in marketing domains. Our approach consists of (i) gaming experiments among human players, (ii) home-made simulation models by the students themselves using a business model description language (BMDL), a business model development system (BMDS), and corresponding decision rules of the agents, and (iii) machine learning agents with classifier systems (LCSs) to improve the decision knowledge and the game balance.

At the costs of limited expected circle of applications a priori known, uniform. lucid structure of reduced size can replace the normally enormous structures of traditional soft computing. Furthermore, traditional deterministic, semi-stochastic or stochastic machine learning can be replaced by simple and short explicit algebraic procedures especially fit to real time applications since in this way considerable computational advantages can be achieved. The key element of the approach the Modified Renormalization Transformation supported by the application of a simple linear transformations, and the use of some simple interpolation or prediction technique. It is analysed how the quality of control is influenced by the backlash of the robot's joints and by the noise of the joint acceleration measurements in the presence of unmodeled internal mechanical and electric degrees of freedom. Simulation examples are presented for the control of a DC electric motors driven 3 DOF SCARA arm by the use of a special family of symplectic transformations. It Is concluded that the method is surprisingly robust against considerable noise and backlash.

This linear transformation method is used for feature extraction for a machine learning approach to the protein secondary structure prediction problem. PSI-Blast profiles, built on NCBI's Nonredundant Protein database, have their dimensionality reduced through ICA method. The resulting components are used as input data to three artificial neural networks with 30, 35 or 40 nodes in the hidden layer. Those classifiers are trained with the RPROP algorithm and five rules are used for combine their outputs. The results achieved are compared with the best ones recently obtained in similar conditions, including experiments using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as feature extraction method, presenting the best result. The performance of each network individually achieved a Q(3) accuracy of 74.1% on average, using only 120 independents components. When the networks are combined with the product rule the performance achieved is 75.2%. This result is overcome only when the raw data are informed to the networks, when an accuracy of 75.9% is achieved.

In this paper we expose the challenges that these techniques face. Using support vector machine (SVM) classification we build models for 34 semantic concepts for the TREC 2002 benchmark corpus. We study the effect of number of examples available for training with respect to their impact on detection. We also examine low level feature fusion as well as parameter sensitivity with SVM classifiers.

Most red-eye reduction systems need the user to outline the red eyes by hand, but this approach doesn't scale up. Instead, we propose an Automatic Red-Eye Detection System. The system contains a red-eye detector that finds red eye-like candidate image patches; a state of the art face detector used to eliminate most false positives (image regions that look but red eyes but are not); and a red-eye outline detector. All three detectors are automatically learned from data, using Boosting. Our system can be combined with a red-eye reduction module to yield a fully automatic red eye corrector.

Recently, machine-learning-based inverse halftoning techniques have been proposed. Decision-tree learning has been applied with success to various machine-learning applications for quite some time. In this paper, we propose to use decision-tree learning to solve the inverse halftoning problem. This allows us to reuse a number of algorithms already developed. Especially, the maximization of entropy gain is a powerful idea that makes the learning algorithm to automatically select the ideal window as the decision-tree is constructed. The new technique has generated gray images with PSNR numbers, which are several dB above those previously reported in the literature. Moreover, it possesses very fast implementation, lending itself useful for real time applications.

We have developed a system, the Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures (ALIP) system, using a 2D multiresolution hidden Markov model. The evaluation of such approaches opens up challenges and interesting research questions. The goals of linguistic indexing are often different from those of other fields including image retrieval, image classification, and computer vision. In many application domains, computer programs that can provide semantically relevant keyword annotations are desired, even if the predicted annotations are different from those of the gold standard. In this paper, we discuss evaluation strategies for automatic linguistic indexing of pictures. We provide both objective and subjective evaluation methods. Finally, we report experimental results using our ALIP system.	Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA	Wang, JZ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

The algorithm applies to discrete-valued attributes. So the case of knowledge representation system with some discrete-valued condition attributes and one discrete-valued decision attribute is considered. Firstly, we select a condition attribute based on information gain; secondly, we use rough set theory to establish equivalence classes with respect to the selected condition attribute and decision attribute; finally, classification rules can be extracted from the equivalence classes. Furthermore, we can prove the RSE algorithm valid compared with ID3 algorithm.

This method not only endows those crabbed parameters actual meaning, but also has more prominent advantages than the method of the traditional neural network. According to the simulation of an instance, the paper has compared WKBNN with classical BP algorithm, and then found that WKBNN has shortened the calculating time and improved calculating accuracy greatly. Obviously, it is a beneficial attempt to extent application of the neural network.

Three reduced regular conditions, which are more convenient to be used than Walker's and Heyde's, are presented. The theorem, which shows under certain regular condition the poster distribution is not only, consistent, but also approximately normal, is proved. Since the computation of normal distribution is relatively simpler, then the results can become the theoretic foundation for further study, for instance, assigning resultful prior distribution and simplifying the computation in Bayesian learning.

Firstly, we analyzed the properties of filter and pointed out that it can be regarded as a semantical model of hypothetical syllogism. Secondly, we discussed the closeness of inference rule with respect to value. of reliability and shown some inference rules which closed with respect to filter. Then we studied the feature of reliability changing dynamically in a running reasoning through the paradox of bald man. Finally, we presented an uncertainty reasoning method based on-filter.

When the subprocesses have nonlinear characteristics, it Is difficult to turn these control parameters manually. To solve this problem, a distributed immune algorithm for controling the complex industrial process is designed on the basis of theory of immune network, which is able to learn control knowledge of different operators online and optimize the existing control knowledge by immune evolution and learning in terms of control results. Experiments and simulations show that it has the ability of distributed learning and its control results are superior to that of manual.

According to the prior knowledge or the clustering of the training examples, the training data reorganized with granularity to form new instances, and to learn from the new instances. The different sorts of instances, which are combined in granularity, will be classified through different layers of classifiers. By this way, the difficulty of the learning is reduced, and the capacity of the learning from the instances is increased, and the classifying accuracy is improved. At the same time, the method can recognize the different sorts of instances, which features are very similar, and improve its generalization of recognition, and reduce the complicacy of calculating. The detailed procedures of the method using covering algorithm and its experimental results are presented. The results show that the method is effective.

In this paper, we designe a genetic-based classifier system (CS) and apply it to recognize the underwater target. This is an attempt to solve this problem with machine learning way. Compared with traditional CS, the proposed Comparing and Matching Algorithm will give the fitness value more explicit statistical meaning, which will make us easier to explain the rules with background knowledge. The proposed Hyperplasia Operator can handle those instances which are not emerged before. It gives the system persistent learning abilities, so the system may be more compatible with the surroundings. The proposed Refining Classifier merges those redundant rules and shrinks the rule set. In addition, we give and discuss an alterable mutation probability to the genetic algorithm in the CS, which increases the speed and the accuracy of the classifying operation. At last, the experiments to examine the system with the sample data which are collected from sonar echo samples. Experiments showe that the recognizing results are satisfying.

Recently, machine learning techniques have been shown to provide a computational framework to map, low level features to high level semantics. In this paper we expose these techniques to the challenge of supporting a moderately large lexicon of semantic concepts. Using the TREC 2002 benchmark corpus for training and validation we investigate a support vector machine based learning system for modeling 34 visual concepts. the detection results show excellent performance for a set of concepts with moderately large training samples. Promising performance is also observed for concepts with few training concepts.

To be effective, a relevance feedback approach must be able to efficiently capture the user's query concept from a very limited number of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive classification method using random forests, which is a machine learning algorithm with proven good performance on many traditional classification problems. With random forests, our method reduces the relevance feedback to a two-class classification problem and classifies database objects as relevant or irrelevant. From the relevant object set, our approach returns the top k nearest neighbors of the query to the user. Briefly speaking, our relevance feedback method has the following dominant features. First, our method is able to address the multimodal distribution of relevant points, because it trains a nonparametric and nonlinear classifier, i.e., random forests, for relevance feedback. Second, it does not overfit training data because it uses an ensemble of tree classifiers to classify multimedia objects. Experiments on a Corel image set (with 31,438 images) show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art relevance feedback approaches.

Methods are then proposed to reduce the detrimental effects of compression in searching schemes. These proposed methods include multi-frame searching and machine learning derived prediction. The proposed mechanisms greatly reduce the effect of compression on the set of MPEG-7 descriptors, however, future scope is identified to develop new audio descriptors that account for compression effects in their structure.

The drawback of these approaches is we can only take advantage of one single statistical test (optionally in association with simple frequency threshold), even though we often calculate the values of several statistical tests. Manually exploring a scheme to combine two or more different tests is out of the question. This paper reports experiments with machine learning for collocation identification using a variety of statistical association measurements. In particular, we develop a new decision tree learning algorithm based on C4.5 to be used for learning tasks with unbalanced data. The experiment results are presented and briefly discussed.

The system of automatic term recognition includes two phases: learning stage and application stage. In the stage of learning, we use a series of machine learning methods to get various kinds of integrated knowledge for automatic term recognition from a large-scale corpus and a term bank. These knowledge Includes the inner structural knowledge of terms. the statistical domain features of term component, the statistical Mutual information between the components of terms, the outer environment features of terms and the distinct text-level features of term recognition etc.. In the stage of application, through an efficient model, we use all these various types of knowledge into automatic term recognition. The experiments show that the system can give great help to the expert of term standardization to discover new term.

This dependent degree based on the Extension Theory represents the extent to which the element belongs to the predefined categories. The "closeness degree" between the input document vector and standard range of each predefined category can be calculated. The new method is conceptually simple; it can be used with relatively low complexity, and high flexibility: The algorithm is highly scalable. It can be effectively applied to text categorization, of which various features are consecutive values. Furthermore, this algorithm can be widely applied to computational linguistics.

Relying on a bootstrapping mechanism, our system starts with one single linguistic expression of a given target, semantic relationship. It then samples the Web so as to progressively accumulate a corpus of potential examples of the same relationship. Sampling steps alternate with filtering steps, making it possible to keep the corpus thematically focused. The corpus is finally analysed to search for potential paraphrases of the initial expression of the semantic relationship. These paraphrases will eventually be used to improve our question-answering system. This paper focuses on the learning aspect of the system and reports experimental results regarding the effectiveness of our filtering strategy.

Machine learning methods offer robust and adaptable automatic metadata extraction. We describe a Support Vector Machine classification-based method for metadata extraction from header part of research papers and show that it outperforms other machine learning methods on the same task. The method first classifies each line of the header into one or more of 15 classes. An iterative convergence procedure is then used to improve the line classification by using the predicted class labels of its neighbor lines in the previous round Further metadata extraction is done by seeking the best chunk boundaries of each line. We found that discovery and use of the structural patterns of the data and domain based word clustering can improve the metadata extraction performance. An appropriate feature normalization also greatly improves the classification performance. Our metadata extraction method was originally designed to improve the metadata extraction quality of the digital libraries Citeseer[17] and EbizSearch[24]. We believe it can be generalized to other digital libraries.

However they were not frequently used mainly due to the poor user interface and the lack in learning new knowledge. However the solutions of these two problems have been introduced since 1990s. For the latter problem, machine learning methods have provided several solutions, and for the former problem, the rapid progress of web technologies enables us to implement a good user interface. Furthermore, recent advances in computer resources strengthen these two solusions. In this paper, we focus on the interface problem. The recent advances in web technologies were used for an efficient interface of medical expert system. Then, the system was put on the internet to provide an intelligent decision support in telemedicine and is now being evaluated by,region medical home doctors. The results show that such an internet-based medical decision support enables home doctors to take a quick action to, the applied domain.

In this paper we introduce a general framework for the initialization of the student model in Web-based educational applications. According to the framework, the student modeler makes initial estimations of the new student's knowledge level and error proneness based on the models of other similar students. This is done by applying a machine learning technique. The similarity between students is calculated taking into account different student characteristics for different teaching domains. We have implemented the proposed methodology in two different tutoring domains, namely language learning and mathematics. An evaluation study conducted in the case of the Web-based language learning system, showed that the use of the framework can initialize student models in a sufficiently accurate way, given the little information about individuals available.

We show that syntactic head-modifier relations are a high precision feature for metonymy recognition but suffer from data sparseness. We partially overcome this problem by integrating a thesaurus and introducing simpler grammatical features, thereby preserving precision and increasing recall.

Traditionally, supervised machine learning approaches adopt the single-candidate model. Nevertheless the preference relationship between the antecedent candidates cannot be determined accurately in this model. By contrast, our approach adopts a twin-candidate learning model. Such a model can present the competition criterion for antecedent candidates reliably, and ensure that the most preferred candidate is selected. Furthermore, our approach applies a candidate filter to reduce the computational cost and data noises during training and resolution. The experimental results on MUC-6 and MUC-7 data set show that our approach can outperform those based on the single-candidate model.

In this paper, we describe our efforts to create a robust, large-scale lexical-semantic resource for the recognition and classification of expressions of commonsense psychology in English Text. We achieve high levels of precision and recall by hand-authoring sets of local grammars for commonsense psychology concepts, and show that this approach can achieve classification performance greater than that obtained by using machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this resource for large-scale corpus analysis by identifying references to adversarial and competitive goals in political speeches throughout U.S. history.

It proposes a new measure for representing the degree of uncertainty correlation of the two classifiers in collaborative bootstrapping and uses the measure in analysis of collaborative bootstrapping. Furthermore, it proposes a new algorithm of collaborative bootstrapping on the basis of uncertainty reduction. Experimental results have verified the correctness of the analysis and have demonstrated the significance of the new algorithm.

In the partially free word-order languages such as Korean and Japanese, a small number of rules dominate the performance due to their well-developed postpositions and endings. Thus, the proposed method is primarily based on the rules, and then the residual errors are corrected by adopting a memory-based machine learning method. Since the memory-based learning is an efficient method to handle exceptions in natural language processing, it is good at checking whether the estimates are exceptional cases of the rules and revising them. An evaluation of the method yields the improvement in F-score over the rules or various machine learning methods alone.

Good and A.M. Turing considered the problem of estimating a probability distribution from a sample of data. They derived a surprising and unintuitive formula that has since been used in a variety of applications and studied by a number of researchers. Borrowing an information-theoretic and machine-learning framework, we define the attenuation of a probability estimator as the largest possible ratio between the per-symbol probability assigned to an arbitrarily-long sequence by any distribution, and the corresponding probability assigned by the estimator. We show that some common estimators have infinite attenuation and that the attenuation of the Good-Turing estimator is low, yet larger than one. We then derive an estimator whose attenuation is one, namely, as the length of any sequence increases, the per-symbol probability assigned by the estimator is at least the highest possible. Interestingly, some of the proofs use celebrated results by Hardy and Ramanujan on the number of partitions of an integer. To better understand the behavior of the estimator, we study the probability it assigns to several simple sequences. We show that for some sequences this probability agrees with our intuition, while for others it is rather unexpected.

This paper presents a word vector linear association model to solve this problem. The method indicates that LSI achieves the best performance when a sum of total dot products between all word vectors reaches a maximum value at a particular number of dimensions for a given dataset. The performance evaluations have demonstrated that this method can choose an appropriate number of dimensions for LSI.

The system uses the techniques of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm in conjunction with an inductive learning algorithm, C5.0. The SOM algorithm clusters the XML marked-up documents on a two-dimensional map such that documents having similar content are placed close to each other. The C5.0 algorithm learns and applies markup rules derived from the nearest SOM neighbours of an unmarked document. The system is designed to be adaptive so that it learns from errors in order to improve the markup of resulting document. Experiments shows that our system provides high accuracy and demonstrate that our approach is practical and feasible.

When the database is complete, they provide an efficient and scalable solution to classification problems. In this paper we introduce an efficient simple Bayesian classifier algorithm to analyze a set of irises data and generate a set of grouping rules, which can be used to classify future data. The proposed algorithm uses a discriminate function, which can be calculated through a number of different formulas. The most important feature in the proposed algorithm for making the formulas easier is using Bayes' rule. Also an example of how the proposed algorithm can be applied in practical situations is presented. The algorithm is evaluated using real data of 150 samples of irises data. The ratio of the correct classification of new cases compared with a will-known Decision tree classifier is high.

The major goals of such a data model are describing the application domain of the AWS and capturing data about the user in order to support the "adaptation effect". There have been many proposals for data models, principally based on knowledge representation, machine learning, logic and reasoning, and, recently, ontologies. These models are focused on the implementation of the core layer of the AWS, that is realizing the adaptation of the contents and the presentations of the system, but sometimes them are poor with respect to the application domain design. In this paper we present an extension of XAHM (called OO-XAHM) that supports the application domain modeling using an object-oriented approach. We also provide the formal definition of the model and its implementation using XML Schema.

We employ a simple Markov chain classifier and show through exhausted tests on data sets from the UCI machine-learning repository how to use the worthwhile index to significantly reduce the incidence of misclassification false positives. We hypothesize our approach to calibration may be applied to other classifier systems with few or no changes since the method involves observing the classifier's external behavior, not its internal mechanisms.

In turn, this enables the analyst to reduce hidden variables, build low bias and generalized process models, and achieve high prediction performance for process operations. This presentation demonstrates benefits and limits of applying neural networks and decision trees to the diagnosis and optimization of the high volume automotive lost foam aluminum casting process. It also emphasizes the necessity of incorporating as much domain knowledge as possible to guide the knowledge exploration and the interpretation of the resulting patterns/relationships uncovered by machine learning techniques.

The Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion is generally used to create HMM topologies. However, it has an over-fitting problem. Information criteria have been used to overcome this problem, but theoretically they cannot be applied to complicated models like HMMs. Recently, to avoid these problems, a VB approach has been developed in the machine-learning field. The Successive State Splitting (SSS) algorithm is a method of creating contextual and temporal variations for HMMs. We introduce the VB approach to the SSS algorithm, and define the prior and posterior probability densities and free energy as split and stop criteria. Experimental results show that the proposed method can automatically create the proper model and obtain better performance, especially for vowels, than the original method.

Experimental results show a significant tendency in the relationship between speaking style and linguistic information. According to the analysis results, a word's acoustic likelihood calculated from the spontaneous speech acoustic model is higher, or more suitable, than that from the read speech acoustic model in case the word is an interjection or an auxiliary verb. On the other hand, even in human-to-human conversation, a word's acoustic likelihood calculated from the read speech acoustic model can be higher than that from the spontaneous speech acoustic model in case the word is a noun. Applying this knowledge along with machine learning, post-processing experiments of the results of ASR using these two acoustic models are carried out. In this set of experiments, post-processing based on an SVM is applied. The experimental results show that the selection scheme based on word category reduces word error rate by 1.62 points over the single system.

However, the problem is that it is prohibitively expensive to build the vital resource, a large-scale corpus of bilingual dialogues covering many domains. We propose to substitute a combination of two different types of bilingual corpora: (1) a large-scale collection of basic sentences that covers many domains and (2) a small-scale collection of spoken dialogues that reflects the characteristics of the spoken utterances for the large-scale corpus of dialogues. With these two corpora, we have been building a translation module for a speech-to-speech translation system. By using the basic sentence corpus, we have achieved high-quality translations with several machine-learning approaches. Based on an analysis of the spoken dialogue corpus, we found that splitting utterances into parts and concatenating the translated parts is an effective way to translate the longer utterances that are inherent in a spoken dialogue.

It describes a synergistic conjunction of intelligent technologies with a view towards that goal. In particular, this paper shows that knowledge acquisition is to be properly viewed as a symbiotic activity of human and machine. The role of the human is to provide the novel or random information and the role of the machine is to reuse it and all of its symmetric derivations. As more and more knowledge is acquired, the number of symmetries that can be related to an arbitrary piece of knowledge necessarily increases. This means that system intelligence, that is, utility, is necessarily a phenomenon of scale given the proposed architecture. A natural language front-end interface is described-which is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. Most significantly, the effective translation of natural language semantics is shown to critically depend on an accelerated capability for learning. Next, conversational natural language is mapped onto a set of procedures which effect directed mining and linking operations on a relational database. Finally, projected and restricted database views are analyzed by a distinct high-level knowledge base to generate natural language reports. Most importantly, these reports provide the analyst with immediate feedback that serves to catalyze the generation of subsequent queries.

In such problems intervals of measured seria (signals) are to be attributed a class so that the constraint of contiguity have to be considered and standard classification methods could be inadequate. Classification in this case needs involvement of an expert who observes the magnitude and trends of the signals in addition to any a priori information that might be available. In this paper an approach for automating this classification procedure is presented. Firstly, a segmentation algorithm is applied to segment the measured signals. Secondly, the salient features of these segments are extracted using boundary energy method. Based on the measured data and extracted features classifiers to assign class values to the segments were built; they employ decision trees and artificial neural networks. The algorithm was tested in a case-study for classifying sub-surface soil using measured data from cone penetration testing and satisfactory results were obtained.

The generic architecture of the system enables it to be used with semi-structured product ontologies. The buying behavior model consists of the following fundamental trading agent-mediated stages: Product Brokering, Merchant Brokering and Negotiation Brokering. The Product and Merchant Brokering stages involve three agents: the Indexing Agent and the Retrieval Agent, that collaborate through machine learning, text classification techniques and fuzzy logic to match potential buyers with products and merchants, and the Profile Agent that creates the buyer's profile using his/her relevance feedback. Finally, the Negotiation stage includes two transaction agents: the Buyer Negotiator Agent and the Merchant Negotiator Agent, that participate in an auction between the buyers and the "suggested" merchant acting according to the transaction strategies of the buyers and merchant respectively.

Also, the learning from examples paradigm requires a training session in which a teacher, rather than the end-user, manually labels the training set of example documents. This is labor intensive, particularly for rare categories: and essentially all categories on the Internet are rare. We propose the use of a speedup-learning algorithm in which a user interacts directly with the machine learning algorithm, and thereby greatly reduces the amount of training documents that must be labeled for optimal performance of the system. It also places the training capability directly into the hands of end-users, which opens up new applications, e.g. to track breaking news events on the Internet. Other researchers have previously identified the speedup learning strategy; we extend the concept, implement an algorithm, and apply it to Intelligent Internet Agents and law enforcement.

The Khiops* discretization method, based on chi-square statistics, optimizes the chi-square criterion in a global manner on the whole discretization domain. In this paper, we propose a major evolution of the Khiops algorithm, that provides guarantees against overfitting and thus significantly improve the robustness of the discretizations. This enhancement is based on a statistical modeling of the Khiops algorithm, derived from the study of the variations of the chi-square value during the discretization process. This modeling, experimentally checked, allows to modify the algorithm and to bring a true control of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity of the approach and show that the Khiops method builds high quality discretizations, both in terms of accuracy and of small interval number.

We posited that risk neutral calibration could be applied to other classifier systems with few or no changes and observe possibly even better classification performance. In this paper, we confirm these ideas for decision trees and show that, indeed, decision tree classifiers respond very well to risk neutral analysis. In most cases, we observe W>>1 which implies a substantial reduction in empirical misclassifications, pi(e\alpha). In other words, for every 1% of classifications we reject at or above the risk neutral error threshold, a; decision trees compensate us by reducing the error rate >>1%. By implication the covariance structure between the false positive distribution, P(e\alpha) and the Bernoulli error distribution, e, is not only positive but consistently large for most a's. We measured these, results on exhaustive tests using several benchmark datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository.

The resulting fuzzy models can be used for emulating expert decision behavior or modelling of static as well as dynamic systems. The input - output data collected from the system or expert behavior is converted into linguistic examples using fuzzy sets. The resulting linguistic examples are the basis of the machine learning process for rule production (ID3/C4.5 from Quinlan). The center of gravity method is used for defuzzification and the min-method for the inference machine. The fuzzy sets are optimized in order to minimize the mean square error between the model and the system output. The way this method works is illustrated by a simulation example.

These networks will be characterized by the heterogeneity of the access technologies including ad hoc wireless network extensions. In these network scenarios in which the links are error-prone, their capacity is extremely variable and even the topology can change due to handovers and mobility of the nodes, it is unrealistic to think of traditional network-layer QoS mechanisms alone, as a means to offer strict end-to-end QoS guarantees. As a complement to the network-layer QoS protocols, this paper presents an intelligent adaptation middleware allowing multimedia applications to dynamically adapt their internal settings. This intelligence enables the applications to minimize the impact of the adverse and changing network conditions in the QoS level perceived by the user. We use a machine learning technique to model the user's perception of QoS from a large set of QoS scores given by real users. We present some results demonstrating that our proposal clearly outperforms traditional multimedia internetworking..

The upper reach of the Huai River in China is used as a case study. It is shown that machine learning techniques could be an efficient tool in the problem of flood forecasting. M5 model trees, being analogous to piece-wise linear functions, have certain advantages compared to ANNs - they are more transparent and hence acceptable by decision makers, very fast in training and always converge. The accuracy of M5 trees is similar to that of ANNs. The improved accuracy in predicting high floods was achieved by building a modular model, in it the flood samples with special hydrological characteristics are split into groups for which separate M5 and ANN models are built.

By interpreting tasks such as POS tagging and shallow parsing as classification tasks, the advantages of MBL (implicit smoothing of sparse data, automatic integration and relevance weighting of information sources, handling exceptional data) contribute to state-of-the-art accuracy. However, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) typically achieve higher accuracy than MBL (and other Machine Learning approaches) for tasks such as POS tagging and chunking. In this paper, we investigate how the advantages of MBL, such as its potential to integrate various sources of information, come to play when we compare our approach to HMMs on two Information Extraction (IE) datasets: the well-known Seminar Announcement data set and a new German Curriculum Vitae data set.

In this paper, we propose lattice structure based signal-adapted filter banks and time-scale atoms, respectilvely, for the construction of morphological local discriminant bases and hybrid wavelet-support vector classifiers. The first mentioned method is a more powerful construction of the recently introduced local discriminant bases algorithm which employs, additionally to the conventional wavelet-packet tree adjustment, an adaptation of the analyzing time-scale atoms. The latter mentioned method utilizes adapted wavelet decompositions which are tailored for support vector classifiers with radial basis functions as kernels. For both methods, we present applications in biomedical signal processing.	Key Numer, Saarbrucken, Germany	Strauss, DJ (reprint author), Key Numer, Saarbrucken, Germany.

However, like most machine learning algorithms, neural networks are adversely affected by sparse training sets, especially with respect to generalization performance. Several approaches to improve generalization performance when only sparse training data are available have been suggested. These include adding noise to training data or to weight updates. One recent method by Karystinos and Pados first clusters the training data and then generates new training data using a probability density function estimated from the clusters. This paper investigates this method further, especially with respect to the sensitivity of the method to the clustering procedure. We investigate the sensitivity to the number of clusters used by the clustering method, the sensitivity to the clustering method (K-Means) itself, and also the use of the minimum differential entropy as an indicator for good cluster choices.

Audio keyword is a middle-level representation that can bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. Audio keywords are created from low-level audio features by using support vector machine learning. The created audio keywords can be used to detect semantic events in soccer video by applying a heuristic mapping. Experiments of audio keywords creation and event detection based on audio keywords have illustrated promising results.

This is because the composition and effective presentation of even the most useful information must be tailored to constantly changing circumstances. Our objective is to not only achieve an adaptive human-machine interface, but to imbue the software with a significant portion of the responsibility for effectively controlling the adaptation, freeing the user from unnecessary distraction and making the human-machine relationship more collaborative in nature. The foundational concepts of interface adaptation are discussed and a specific logistics application is described as an example.

The hierarchical nature of object (buildings, bridges, etc) development in two dimensional imagery readily lends itself to a more rigorous mathematical modeling with prediction capabilities. This paper presents a new approach to the classification of hierarchical (time and space) object classification based upon an innovative Evidence-based Regression Tree (ERT) prediction mechanism. Typical regression trees, based on classical Bayesian probability theory, require the specification of a complete probabilistic model, and assume certain knowledge of all prior probabilities. Our ERT approach is based on logistical constraints founded on evidence and uncertainty principles; it exploits probability intervals measuring both the level of belief and the amount of information extracted from imager sources. We believe our system will facilitate the production of anticipatory intelligence from diverse information sources into the new products needed for the changing threat environment.

The approach builds on the assumption that data compression can be used as a metaphor for cognition and intelligence. The proof-of-concept system is evaluated on sequence prediction problems. Inspired by Solomonoff's induction methods,,the general method outlined takes an information theoretical view on automatic model building. Even though much work on theory and evaluation is still needed, the firm theoretical foundation holds promise for an efficient method and advantageous scaling properties.

In this paper, we describe an automatic system that learns from text interaction verbs; these verbs can then form the core of automatically retrieved patterns which model classes of biological interactions. We investigate text features relating verbs with genes and proteins, and apply statistical tests and a logistic regression statistical model to determine whether a given verb belongs to the class of interaction verbs. Our system, AVAD, achieves over 87% precision and 82% recall when tested on an I I million word corpus of journal articles. In addition, we compare the automatically obtained results with a manually constructed database of interaction verbs and show that the automatic approach can significantly enrich the manual list by detecting rarer interaction verbs that were omitted from the database.

J	Zweigenbaum, P; Grabar, N				Zweigenbaum, P; Grabar, N			Restoring accents in unknown biomedical words: application to the French MeSH thesaurus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Natural Language Processing for Biomedical Applications	MAR, 2002	NICOSIA, CYPRUS			natural language processing; machine learning; controlled vocabulary; language; France; algorithms		In languages with diacritic marks, such as French, there remain instances of textual or terminological resources that are available in electronic form without diacritic marks, which hinders their use in natural language interfaces. In a specialized domain such as medicine, it is often the case that some words are not found in the available electronic lexicons. The issue of accenting unknown words then arises: it is the theme of this work. We propose two internal methods for accenting unknown words, which both learn on a reference set of accented words the contexts of occurrence of the various accented forms of a given letter. One method is adapted from part-of-speech tagging, the other is based on finite state transducers. We show experimental results for letter e on the French version of the Medical Subject Headings thesaurus. With the best training set, the tagging method obtains a precision-recall breakeven point of 84.2 +/- 4.4% and the transducer method 83.8 +/- 4.5% (with a baseline at 64%) for the unknown words that contain this letter. A consensus combination of both increases precision to 92.0 +/- 3.7% with a recall of 75%. We perform an error analysis and discuss further steps that might help improve over the current performance.

A simple generalization can be obtained by instead maximizing a weighted sum of the elements of B boolean AND X-. While polynomial for any fixed n, the maximum box problem is NP-hard in general. We construct an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for this problem and apply it to a standard problem in data analysis. We test this method on nine data sets, seven of which are drawn from the UCI standard machine learning repository.

The model performances for two different mills are evaluated covering a whole range of operating conditions. The simulation results show a satisfactory agreement between the model responses and measured data. The appropriate data can be obtained without recourse to extensive mill tests, and the model can be constructed without difficulty in computation. Thus, the work is of general applicability.

SVM is a machine-learning method, based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which performs well when applied to data outside the training set. We formulate MC detection as a supervised-learning problem and apply SVM to develop the detection algorithm. We use the SVM to detect at each location in the image whether an MC is present or not. We tested the proposed method using a database of 76 clinical mammograms containing 1120 MCs. We use free-response receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate detection performance, and compare the proposed algorithm with several existing methods. In our experiments, the proposed SVM framework outperformed all the other methods tested. In particular, a sensitivity as high as 94% was achieved by the SVM method at an error rate of one false-positive cluster per image. The ability of SVM to outperform several well-known methods developed for the widely studied problem of MC detection suggests that SVM is a promising technique for object detection in a medical imaging application.

J	Paliouras, G; Papatheodorou, C; Karkaletsis, V; Spyropoulos, CD				Paliouras, G; Papatheodorou, C; Karkaletsis, V; Spyropoulos, CD			Discovering user communities on the Internet using unsupervised machine learning techniques	INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS			English	Article						user communities; collaborative filtering; user modelling; machine learning; Web mining	SYSTEMS	Interest in the analysis of user behaviour on the Internet has been increasing rapidly, especially since the advent of electronic commerce. In this context, we argue here for the usefulness of constructing communities of users with common behaviour, making use of machine learning techniques. In particular, we assume that the users of any service on the Internet constitute a large community and we aim to construct smaller communities of users with common characteristics. The paper presents the results of three case studies for three different types of Internet service: a digital library, an information broker and a Web site. Particular attention is paid on the different types of information access involved in the three case studies: query-based information retrieval, profile-based information filtering and Web-site navigation. Each type of access imposes different constraints on the representation of the learning task. Two different unsupervised learning methods are evaluated: conceptual clustering and cluster mining. One of our main concerns is the construction of meaningful communities that can be used for improving information access on the Internet. Analysis of the results in the three case studies brings to surface some of the important properties of the task, suggesting the feasibility of a common methodology for the three different types of information access on the Internet.

J	Suzuki, E				Suzuki, E			Undirected discovery of interesting exception rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	OCT 23-26, 2001	MAEBASHI CITY, JAPAN			knowledge discovery; rule discovery; exception rule; objective evaluation of interestingness; probabilistic estimation	INDUCTION	This paper presents an efficient algorithm for discovering exception rules from a data set without domain-specific information. An exception rule, which is defined as a deviational pattern to a strong rule, exhibits unexpectedness and is sometimes extremely useful. Previous discovery approaches for this type of knowledge can be classified into a directed approach, which obtains exception rules each of which deviates from a set of user-prespecified strong rules, and an undirected approach, which typically discovers a set of rule pairs each of which represents a pair of an exception rule and its corresponding strong rule. It has been pointed out that unexpectedness is often related to interestingness. In this sense, an undirected approach is promising since its discovery outcome is free from human prejudice and thus tends to be highly unexpected. However, this approach is prohibitive due to extra search for strong rules as well as unreliable patterns in the output. In order to circumvent these difficulties we propose a method based on sound pruning and probabilistic estimation. The sound pruning reduces search time to a reasonable amount, and enables exhaustive search for rule pairs. The normal approximations of the multinomial distributions are employed as the method for evaluating reliability of a rule pair. Our method has been validated using two medical data sets under supervision of a physician and two benchmark data sets in the machine learning community.

Using mutation-based alternative testing criteria it is possible to reduce the number of mutants but it is still necessary to determine the equivalent ones. In this paper the Bayesian Learning(one of the Artificial Intelligence techniques used in machine learning) is investigated to define the Bayesian Learning-Based Equivalent Detection Technique (BaLBEDeT), which provides guidelines to help the tester to analyze the live mutants in order to determine the equivalent ones.

J	Tong, S; Koller, D				Tong, S; Koller, D			Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classification	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						active learning; selective sampling; support vector machines; classification; relevance feedback		Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.

However, recent studies have illustrated that the laboratory environment has a robust effect on behavioral traits. Given that environmental factors can interact with trait-relevant genes, some have questioned the reliability and generalizability of behavior genetic research designed to identify those genes. This problem might be alleviated by the identification of the most relevant environmental factors, but the task is hindered by the large number of factors that typically vary between and within laboratories. We used a computational approach to retrospectively identify and rank sources of variability in nociceptive responses as they occurred in a typical research laboratory over several years. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to an archival data set of 8034 independent observations of baseline thermal nociceptive sensitivity. This analysis revealed that a factor even more important than mouse genotype was the experimenter performing the test, and that nociception can be affected by many additional laboratory factors including season/humidity, cage density, time of day, sex and within-cage order of testing. The results were confirmed by linear modeling in a subset of the data, and in confirmatory experiments, in which we were able to partition the variance of this complex trait among genetic (27%), environmental (42%) and genetic X environmental (18%) sources.

These new approaches integrate chemical information and knowledge into a graph-theoretic framework. Two sources of chemical information that we investigate are mass tagging and dissociation chemistry in the tandem MS process itself. We describe machine learning techniques that are used to classify peaks according to ion types based on known dissociation chemistry. We describe the algorithms that are implemented in a software code called PepSUMS. Using PepSUMS, we give results on the effectiveness of the new methods on the ultimate goal of improved protein identification.

J	Chinnam, RB				Chinnam, RB			Support vector machines for recognizing shifts in correlated and other manufacturing processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; NEURAL NETWORKS; CONTROL CHARTS	Traditional statistical process control (SPC) techniques of control charting are not applicable in many process industries where the data from the facilities are often autocorrelated. This is often true in piece-part manufacturing industries that are highly automated and integrated. Several attempts have been made in the literature to extend traditional SPC techniques to deal with autocorrelated parameters. However, these extensions pose several serious limitations. The literature discusses several machine-learning methods based on radial basis function (RBF) networks and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks to address the limitations, with some success. This paper demonstrates that support vector machines (SVMs) can be extremely effective in minimizing both Type-I errors (probability that the method would wrongly declare the process to be out of control or generate a false alarm) and Type-II errors (probability that the method will be unable to detect a true shift or trend present in the process) in these autocorrelated processes. Even while employing the simplest type of polynomial kernels, the SVMs were extremely good at detecting shifts in papermaking and viscosity datasets (available in the literature) and performed as well or better than traditional as well as machine learning methods. It was also observed that SVMs are good at minimizing both Type-I and Type-II errors even in monitoring non-correlated processes. When tested on datasets available in the literature, they once again performed as well or better than the classical Shewhart control charts and other machine learning methods.

Improvements of its generalization ability can be achieved by incorporating prior knowledge of the task at hand. We propose a new hybrid algorithm consisting of signal-adapted wavelet decompositions and hard margin SVMs for waveform classification. The adaptation of the wavelet decompositions is tailored for hard margin SV classifiers with radial basis functions as kernels. It allows the optimization of the representation of the data before training the SVM and does not suffer from cornputationally expensive validation techniques. We assess the performance of our algorithm against the background of current concerns in medical diagnostics, namely the classification of endocardial electrograms and the detection of otoacoustic emissions. Here the performance of hard margin SVMs can significantly be improved by our adapted preprocessing step. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We used this tool to characterize ecologic differentiation of Triatoma brasiliensis populations, the most important Chagas' disease vector in northeastern Brazil. The species' ecologic niche was modeled based on data from the Fundaca (o) over tilde Nacional de Saude of Brazil (1997-1999) with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). This method involves a machine-learning approach to detecting associations between occurrence points and ecologic characteristics of regions. Four independent "ecologic niche models" were developed and used to test for ecologic differences among T. brasiliensis populations. These models confirmed four ecologically distinct and differentiated populations, and allowed characterization of dimensions of niche differentiation. Patterns of ecologic similarity matched patterns of molecular differentiation, suggesting that T brasiliensis is a complex of distinct populations at various points in the process of speciation.

The cardiovascular functional ability (FA) is a reliable parameter, which may define the lesion of the cardiovascular system following myocardial infarction. We have applied the Cubist machine learning tool to set up a model that defines the residual cardiovascular functional ability after a myocardial infarction by means of the maximal CPK in the acute phase of the disease. Cubist models numeric data and generates values by means of a collection of rules associated with the linear expression for computing target values. Based on the literature data set of Miric et al.,(1) we have derived and tested a reliable and accurate Cubist model for acute inferior and anteroseptal myocardial infarction consisting of three simple rules. The rules enable simple prediction of the expected cardiovascular functional ability in myocardial infarction following recovery. The model is based on two clinical parameters related to the disease, maximal CPK in the acute phase of the myocardial lesion, and anteroseptal or inferior cardial localisation of the infarction. Strong correlation (r anteroseptal = 1.00, r inferior = 0.94, n = 56), insignificant differences of real and predicted values, and low average error of the leave-one-out test (anteroseptal 1.72, inferior 3.54) confirm the accuracy of the method and its applicability in clinical medicine. In addition to the prognostic and diagnostic application, the extracted rules enable more efficient evaluation of new drugs and therapeutic procedures in Cardiology.

The aim of this study was to analyse biochemical, morphologic and anamnestic parameters that may be relevant for the onset and developement of dialysis related amyloidosis. In addition to standard statistical procedures, we also applied the machine-learning based methods of data mining to quantify the risk factors for asymptomatic patients. Extraction of: risk factors for the onset of the dialysis related amyloidosis syndrome could enable the clinician to predict the symptoms and consider medical procedures to prevent the onset of the disease. The C4.5 machine learning algorithm extracted a simple and highly accurate tree for discrimination of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients suffering from dialysis related amyloidosis. It remains an open question if our findings may contribute to the problem of accurately predicting the onset of dialysis related arthropathy in the asymptomatic patient group.

A flood of large-scale genomic and postgenomic data means that many of the challenges in biomedical research are now challenges in computational science. Clinical informatics has long developed methodologies to improve biomedical research and clinical care by integrating experimental and clinical information systems. The informatics revolution in both bioinformatics and clinical informatics will eventually change the current practice of medicine, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostics. Postgenome informatics, powered by high-throughput technologies and genomic-scale databases, is likely to transform our biomedical understanding forever, in much the same way that biochemistry did a generation ago. This paper describes how these technologies will impact biomedical research and clinical care, emphasizing recent advances in biochip-based functional genomics and proteomics. Basic data preprocessing with normalization and filtering, primary pattern analysis, and machine-learning algorithms are discussed. Use of integrative biochip informatics technologies, including multivariate data projection, gene-metabolic pathway mapping, automated biomolecular annotation, text mining of factual and literature databases, and the integrated management of biomolecular databases, are also discussed.

This has been demonstrated by unsupervised clustering of co-expressed genes and, more importantly, by supervised learning algorithms. Using prior knowledge, these algorithms can assign functional annotations based on more complex expression signatures found in existing functional classes. Previously, support vector machines (SVMs) and other machine-learning methods have been applied to a limited number Of functional classes for this purpose. Here we present, for the first time, the comprehensive application of supervised neural networks (SNNs) for functional annotation. Our study is novel in that we report systematic results for -100 classes in the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) functional catalog. We found that only -10% of these are learnable (based on the rate of false negatives). A closer analysis reveals that false positives (and negatives) in a machine-learning context are not necessarily "false" in a biological sense. We show that the high degree of interconnections among functional classes confounds the signatures that ought to be learned for a unique class. We term this the "Borges effect" and introduce two new numerical indices for its quantification. Our analysis indicates that classification systems with a lower Borges effect are better suitable for machine learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learning procedure for combining false positives with the original class. We show that in a few iterations this process converges to a gene set that is learnable with considerably low rates of false positives and negatives and contains genes that are biologically related to the original class, allowing for a coarse reconstruction of the interactions between associated biological pathways. We exemplify this methodology using the well-studied tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Instead of relying on an external feature extractor, the SVM receives the gray-level values of the raw pixels, as SVMs can generalize well even in high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that SVMs can incorporate conventional texture feature extraction methods within their own architecture, while also providing solutions to problems inherent in these methods. One-against-others decomposition is adopted to apply binary SVMs to multitexture classification, plus a neural network is used as an arbitrator to make final classifications from several one-against-others SVM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in texture classification.

In this paper, we attempt to explore extensive features and classifiers through a comparative study of the most promising feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. The gene information from a patient's marrow expressed by DNA microarray, which is either the acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is used to predict the cancer class. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Backpropagation neural network, self-organizing map, structure adaptive self-organizing map, support vector machine, inductive decision tree and k-nearest neighbor have been used for classification. Experimental results indicate that backpropagation neural network with Pearson's correlation coefficients produces the best result, 97.1% of recognition rate on the test data.

J	Liu, HF; Johnson, SB; Friedman, C				Liu, HF; Johnson, SB; Friedman, C			Automatic resolution of ambiguous terms based on machine learning and conceptual relations in the UMLS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LANGUAGE	Motivation. The UMLS has been used in natural language processing applications such as information retrieval and information extraction systems. The mapping of free-text to UMLS concepts is important for these applications. To improve the mapping, we need a method to disambiguate terms that possess multiple UMLS concepts. In the general English domain, machine-learning techniques have been applied to sense-tagged corpora, in which senses (or concepts) of ambiguous terms have been annotated (mostly manually). Sense disambiguation classifiers are then derived to determine senses (or concepts) of those ambiguous terms automatically However, manual annotation of a corpus is an expensive task. We propose an automatic method that constructs sense-tagged corpora for ambiguous terms in the UMLS using MEDLINE abstracts. Methods. For a term W that represents multiple UMLS concepts, a collection of MEDLINE abstracts that contain W is extracted. For each abstract in the collection, occurrences of concepts that have relations with W as defined in the UMLS are automatically identified. A sense-tagged corpus, in which senses of Ware annotated, is then derived based on those identified concepts. The method was evaluated on a set of 35 frequently occurring ambiguous biomedical abbreviations using a gold standard set that was automatically derived. The quality of the derived sense-tagged corpus was measured using precision and recall. Results. The derived sense-tagged corpus had an overall precision of 92.9% and an overall recall of 47.4%. After removing rare senses and ignoring abbreviations with closely related senses, the overall precision was 96.8% and the overall recall was 50.6%. Conclusions.

HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task, Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Boyan, JA				Boyan, JA			Technical update: Least-squares temporal difference learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						reinforcement learning; temporal difference learning; value function approximation; linear least-squares methods	REINFORCEMENT	TD(lambda) is a popular family of algorithms for approximate policy evaluation in large MDPs. TD(lambda) works by incrementally updating the value function after each observed transition. It has two major drawbacks: it may make inefficient use of data, and it requires the user to manually tune a stepsize schedule for good performance. For the case of linear value function approximations and lambda = 0, the Least-Squares TD (LSTD) algorithm of Bradtke and Barto (1996, Machine learning, 22:1-3, 33-57) eliminates all stepsize parameters and improves data efficiency. This paper updates Bradtke and Barto's work in three significant ways. First, it presents a simpler derivation of the LSTD algorithm. Second, it generalizes from lambda = 0 to arbitrary values of lambda; at the extreme of lambda = 1, the resulting new algorithm is shown to be a practical, incremental formulation of supervised linear regression. Third, it presents a novel and intuitive interpretation of LSTD as a model-based reinforcement learning technique.

J	Mooney, SD; Klein, TE				Mooney, SD; Klein, TE			Structural models of osteogenesis imperfecta-associated variants in the COL1A1 gene	MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS			English	Article							COLLAGEN-MUTATION-DATABASE; POINT MUTATIONS; TRIPLE-HELIX; PEPTIDES; SUBSTITUTIONS; ALPHA-2(I); GLYCINE; ACIDS	Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease in which the most common mutations result in substitutions for glycine residues in the triple helical domain of the chains of type I collagen. Currently there is no way to use sequence information to predict the clinical OI phenotype. However, structural models coupled with biophysical and machine learning methods may be able to predict sequences that, when mutated, would be associated with more severe forms of OI. To build appropriate structural models, we have applied a high throughput molecular dynamic approach. Homotrimeric peptides covering 57 positions in which mutations are associated with OI were simulated both with and without mutations. Our models revealed structural differences that occur with different substituting amino acids. When mutations were introduced, we observed a decrease in helix stability, as caused by fewer main chain backbone hydrogen bonds, and an increase in main chain root mean square deviation and specifically bound water molecules.

J	Milano, M; Koumoutsakos, P				Milano, M; Koumoutsakos, P			Neural network modeling for near wall turbulent flow	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						neural networks; turbulent flows; machine learning; adaptive systems	COHERENT STRUCTURES; BOUNDARY-LAYER; DRAG REDUCTION; CHANNEL FLOW; DYNAMICS; REGION; UNIT	A neural network methodology is developed in order to reconstruct the near wall field in a turbulent flow by exploiting flow fields provided by direct numerical simulations. The results obtained from the neural network methodology are compared with the results obtained from prediction and reconstruction using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Using the property that the POD is equivalent to a specific linear neural network, a nonlinear neural network extension is presented. It is shown that for a relatively small additional computational cost nonlinear neural networks provide us with improved reconstruction and prediction capabilities for the near wall velocity fields. Based on these results advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are discussed with an outlook toward the development of near wall models for turbulence modeling and control.

The system was designed during the CoMMA European project ( Corporate Memory Management through Agents) and aims at helping users in the management of a corporate memory, facilitating the creation, dissemination, transmission, and reuse of knowledge in an organization. The implementation integrated several emerging technologies: multi-agent system technology ( using the JADE FIPA-compliant platform), knowledge modeling and XML technology for information retrieval ( using the CORESE semantic search engine), and machine learning techniques. Here, we describe the agent roles and interactions, we explain the design rationale for the agent societies, and we discuss the configuration and implementation issues.

J	Vilalta, R; Drissi, Y				Vilalta, R; Drissi, Y			A perspective view and survey of meta-learning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						classification; inductive learning; meta-knowledge		Different researchers hold different views of what the term meta-learning exactly means. The first part of this paper provides our own perspective view in which the goal is to build self-adaptive learners (i.e. learning algorithms that improve their bias dynamically through experience by accumulating meta-knowledge). The second part provides a survey of meta-learning as reported by the machine-learning literature. We find that, despite different views and research lines, a question remains constant: how can we exploit knowledge about learning (i.e. meta-knowledge) to improve the performance of learning algorithms? Clearly the answer to this question is key to the advancement of the field and continues being the subject of intensive research.

The motivation of this work is to generate a system for automated annotation of data we are particularly interested in, namely proteins related to the Mycoplasmataceae family. Following previous works on automatic annotation using symbolic machine learning techniques, the present work proposes a method of automatic annotation of keywords (a part of the SWISS-PROT annotation procedure), and the validation, by an expert, of the annotation rules generated. The aim of this procedure is twofold: to complete the annotation of keywords of those proteins which is far from adequate, and to produce a prototype of the validation environment, which is aimed at an expert who does not have a deep knowledge of the structure of the current databases containing the necessary information s/he needs. Results: As for the first objective, a rate of correct keywords annotation of 60% is reported in the literature. Our preliminary results show that with a slightly different method, applied this method to data related to Mycoplasmataceae only, we are able to increase that rate of correct annotation.

This complements the mRNA profiles provided by microarrays, and the protein profiles provided by proteomics. To test the power of metabolome analysis we selected the problem of discrimating between related genotypes of Arabidopsis. Specifically, the problem tackled was to discrimate between two background genotypes (Col0 and C24) and, more significantly, the offspring produced by the crossbreeding of these two lines, the progeny (whose genotypes would differ only in their maternally inherited mitichondia and chloroplasts). Overview: A gas chromotography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) profiling protocol was used to identify 433 metabolites in the samples. The metabolomic profiles were compared using descriptive statistics which indicated that key primary metabolites vary more than other metabolites. We then applied neural networks to discriminate between the genotypes. This showed clearly that the two background lines can be discrimated between each other and their progeny, and indicated that the two progeny lines can also be discriminated. We applied Euclidean hierarchical and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to help understand the basis of genotype discrimination. PCA indicated that malic acid and citrate are the two most important metabolites for discriminating between the background lines, and glucose and fructose are two most important metabolites for discriminating between the crosses. These results are consistant with genotype differences in mitochondia and chloroplasts.

The functions are constructed in the disjunctive normal form (DNF) or the conjunctive normal form (CNF) and emphasis is placed in inferring functions with as few clauses as possible. This incremental algorithm can be combined with any existing algorithm that infers a Boolean function from examples. In this paper it is combined with the one clause at a time (OCAT) approach (Comput. Oper. Res. 21(2) (1994) 185) and (J. Global Optim. 5(1) (1994) 64) which is a non-incremental learning approach. An extensive computational study was undertaken to assess the performance characteristics of the new approach. As examples, we used binary vectors that represent text documents from different categories from the TIPSTER collection. The computational results indicate that the new algorithm is considerably more efficient and it derives more accurate Boolean functions. As it was anticipated, the Boolean functions (in DNF or CNF form) derived by the new algorithm are comprised by more clauses than the functions derived by the non-incremental approach.

This paper focuses on design and configuration of high-level optimization systems (wrappers) for relevance determination and constructive induction, and on integrating these wrappers with elicited knowledge on attribute relevance and synthesis. In particular, we discuss decision support issues for the application (cost prediction for automobile insurance markets in several states) and report experiments using D2K, a Java-based visual programming system for data mining and information visualization, and several commercial and research tools. We describe exploratory clustering, descriptive statistics, and supervised decision tree learning in this application, focusing on a parallel genetic algorithm (GA) system, Jenesis, which is used to implement relevance determination (attribute subset selection). Deployed on several high-performance network-of-workstation systems (Beowulf clusters), Jenesis achieves a linear speedup, due to a high degree of task parallelism. Its test set accuracy is significantly higher than that of decision tree inducers alone and is comparable to that of the best extant search-space based wrappers.

J	Liu, H; Hussain, F; Tan, CL; Dash, M				Liu, H; Hussain, F; Tan, CL; Dash, M			Discretization: An enabling technique	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						discretization; continuous feature; data mining; classification	ATTRIBUTES; SELECTION	Discrete values have important roles in data mining and knowledge discovery. They are about intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify, easier to use and comprehend as they are closer to a knowledge-level representation than continuous values. Many studies show induction tasks can benefit from discretization: rules with discrete values are normally shorter and more understandable and discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy. Furthermore, many induction algorithms found in the literature require discrete features. All these prompt researchers and practitioners to discretize continuous features before or during a machine learning or data mining task. There are numerous discretization methods available in the literature. It is time for us to examine these seemingly different methods for discretization and find out how different they really are, what are the key components of a discretization process, how we can improve the current level of research for new development as well as the use of existing methods. This paper aims at a systematic study of discretization methods with their history of development, effect on classification, and trade-off between speed and accuracy. Contributions of this paper are an abstract description summarizing existing discretization methods, a hierarchical framework to categorize the existing methods and pave the way for further development, concise discussions of representative discretization methods, extensive experiments and their analysis, and some guidelines as to how to choose a discretization method under various circumstances. We also identify some issues yet to solve and future research for discretization.

J	Kushchu, I				Kushchu, I			Genetic programming and evolutionary generalization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						generalization; genetic programming; machine learning; robustness		In genetic programming (GP), learning problems can be classified broadly into two types: those using data sets, as in supervised learning, and those using an environment as a source of feedback. Recently, an increasing amount of research has concentrated on the robustness or generalization ability of the programs evolved using GP. While some of the researchers report on the brittleness of the solutions evolved, others proposed methods of promoting robustness/generalization. It is important that these methods are not ad hoc and are applicable to other experimental setups. In this paper, learning concepts from traditional machine learning and a brief review of research on generalization in GP are presented. The paper also identifies problems with brittleness of solutions produced by GP and suggests a method for promoting robustness/generalization of the solutions in simulating learning behaviors using GP.

In this paper, we present G-Net, a distributed evolutionary algorithm able to infer classifiers from precollected data. The main features of the system include robustness with respect to parameter settings, use of the minimum description length criterion coupled with a stochastic search bias, coevolution as a high-level control strategy, ability to face problems requiring structured representation languages, and suitability to parallel implementation on a network of workstations (NOW). Its parallel version, NOW G-Net, also described in this paper, is able to profitably exploit the computing power delivered by these platforms by incorporating a set of dynamic load distribution techniques that allow it to adapt to the variations of computing power arising typically in these systems. A proof-of-concept implementation is used in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of NOW G-Net on a variety of datasets.

Arterial endothelium play a primary role in processes leading to the development of atherosclerotic plaque and cardiovascular disease in general. Determination of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of brachial arteries from B-mode ultrasound image sequences offers a noninvasive surrogate index of endothelial function. A highly automated method for analysis of brachial ultrasound image sequences is reported and its performance assessed. The method overcomes the variability of brachial ultrasound images across subjects by incorporating machine learning and quality control steps. The automated method outperformed conventional manual analysis by providing a decreased analysis bias, increased reproducibility, and improved measurement accuracy.

J	Freedman, D				Freedman, D			Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; differentiable manifold; simplicial complex	SKELETON; CRUST	A new algorithm for manifold learning is presented. Given only samples of a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifold's geometry or topology except for its dimension, the goal is to find a description of the manifold. The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well, both geometrically and topologically, when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold, rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane, curves in space, and surfaces in space; in addition, a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed.

Annotated genomic data is also rapidly pouring into public databases. Our goal is to develop automated ways of combining these two sources of information to produce insight into the operation of cells under various conditions. Our approach is to use machine-learning techniques to identify characteristics of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in a particular microarray experiment. We seek models that are (a) accurate, (b) easy to interpret, and (c) stable to small variations in the training data. This paper explores the effectiveness of two standard machine-learning algorithms for this task: Naive Bayes (based on probability) and PFOIL (based on building rules). Although we do not anticipate using our learned models to predict expression levels of genes, we cast the task in a predictive framework, and evaluate the quality of the models in terms of their predictive power on genes held out from the training. The paper reports on experiments using actual E coli microarray data, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the two algorithms and demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy, comprehensibility, and stability.

In this review, we summarize the differences and similarities of these models from a technical point of view, and compare them with other machine learning algorithms. We provide considerations useful for critically assessing the quality of the models and the results based on these models. Finally, we summarize our findings on how quality criteria for logistic regression and artificial neural network models are met in a sample of papers from the medical literature.

J	Caldas, CH; Soibelman, L; Han, JW				Caldas, CH; Soibelman, L; Han, JW			Automated classification of construction project documents	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						construction management; documentation; information management; classification; information retrieval; information systems	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	The number of documents generated in a construction project and stored in interorganizational information systems is significant. Since a large percentage of these project documents are generated in text format, methods for organizing and improving access to the information contained in these types of documents become essential to construction information management. Information classification schemes can be used for this purpose. They provide a common framework to enact document organization and information exchange among project members. Current systems for document management rely on manual classification methods controlled by human experts. Due to the widespread use of information technologies for construction, the increasing availability of electronic documents, and the development of systems based on project object models, manual classification becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a unique way to improve information organization and access in interorganizational systems based on automated classification of construction project documents according to their related project components. Machine learning methods were used for this purpose. A prototype of a document classification system was developed to provide easy deployment and scalability to the classification process.

J	Cristianini, N; Scholkopf, B				Cristianini, N; Scholkopf, B			Support vector machines and kernel methods - The new generation of learning machines	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								Kernel methods, a new generation of learning algorithms, utilize techniques from optimization, statistics, and functional analysis to achieve maximal generality, flexibility, and performance. These algorithms are different from earlier techniques used in machine learning in many respects: For example, they are explicitly based on a theoretical model of learning rather than on loose analogies with natural learning systems or other heuristics. They come with theoretical guarantees about their performance and have a modular design that makes it possible to separately implement and analyze their components. They are not affected by the problem of local minima because their training amounts to convex optimization. In the last decade, a sizable community of theoreticians and practitioners has formed around these methods, and a number of practical applications have been realized. Although the research is not concluded, already now kernel methods are considered the state of the art in several machine learning tasks. Their ease of use, theoretical appeal, and remarkable performance have made them the system of choice for many learning problems. Successful applications range from text categorization to handwriting recognition to classification of gene-expression data.

In the study, we compared different methods of measuring pressure-volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our aim was to show that inductive machine learning can be used to gain insights into differences and similarities among these methods. We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure-volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure-volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.

Coordination is needed especially in those cases in which hospitals have structured healthcare into specialty-oriented units, while a substantial portion of patient care is not limited to single units. From a logistic point of view, this multi-disciplinary patient care creates a tension between controlling the hospital's units, and the need for a control of the patient flow between units. A possible solution is the creation of new units in which different specialties work together for specific groups of patients. A first step in this solution is to identify the salient patient groups in need of multi-disciplinary care. Grouping techniques seem to offer a solution. However, most grouping approaches in medicine are driven by a search for pathophysiological homogeneity. In this paper, we present an alternative logistic-driven grouping approach. The starting point of our approach is a database with medical cases for 3603 patients with peripheral arterial vascular (PAV) diseases. For these medical cases, six basic logistic variables (such as the number of visits to different specialist) are selected. Using these logistic variables, clustering techniques are used to group the medical cases in logistically homogeneous groups. In our approach, the quality of the resulting grouping is not measured by statistical significance, but by (i) the usefulness of the grouping for the creation of new multi-disciplinary units; (ii) how well patients can be selected for treatment in the new units. Given a priori knowledge of a patient (e.g. age, diagnosis), machine learning techniques are employed to induce rules that can be used for the selection of the patients eligible for treatment in the new units. In the paper, we describe the results of the above-proposed methodology for patients with PAV diseases. Two groupings and the accompanied classification rule sets are presented. One grouping is based on all the logistic variables, and another grouping is based on two latent factors found by applying factor analysis. On the basis of the experimental results, we can conclude that it is possible to search for medical logistic homogenous groups (i) that can be characterized by rules based on the aggregated logistic variables; (ii) for which we can formulate rules to predict to which cluster new patients belong.

For a single adaptive agent facing fixed-strategy opponents, ordinary Q-learning is guaranteed to find the optimal policy. However, for a population of agents each trying to adapt in the presence of other adaptive agents, the problem becomes non-stationary and history dependent, and it is not known whether any global convergence will be obtained, and if so, whether such solutions will be optimal. In this paper, we study simultaneous Q-learning by two competing seller agents in three moderately realistic economic models. This is the simplest case in which interesting multi-agent phenomena can occur, and the state space is small enough so that lookup tables can be used to represent the Q-functions. We find that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, simultaneous convergence to self-consistent optimal solutions is obtained in each model, at least for small values of the discount parameter. In some cases, exact or approximate convergence is also found even at large discount parameters. We show how the Q-derived policies increase profitability and damp out or eliminate cyclic price "wars" compared to simpler policies based on zero lookahead or short-term lookahead. In one of the models (the "Shopbot" model) where the sellers' profit functions are symmetric, we find that Q-learning can produce either symmetric or broken-symmetry policies, depending on the discount parameter and on initial conditions.

This system is capable to provide suitable separation conditions even for analytes for which no electrophoretic experiments have been published so far. The system works with a database of components of anionic character the analyses of which have been performed, published in reviewed scientific journals, and included into a database created by an expert. Moreover, the system learned to search also in abstracts or complete scientific articles to find articles dealing with the determination of a substance in a given sample matrix. When no experiments have been published so far for a defined substance in a specific matrix, Xemic shows the separation conditions for determination of the substance regardless of the matrix. When no response can be found for the analyte of interest at all, the system Xemic works like an expert in the field and searches chemically similar substances and offers a series of substances the physicochemical properties of which are close to the followed analyte with respect to the behavior in the electric field, and shows working conditions for their analysis. Thus, the analyst puts only the order in the form of a given analyte in a given matrix and obtains a recommendation of a separation system that should enable to perform a successful separation. The system is not rigid and enables the operator to change the importance of individual attributes used in similarity search so as to obtain a broader or narrower group of similar components. With a certain probability the analyte of interest can be successfully analyzed under separation conditions that suited for the analysis of the most similar substances in the given matrix.

The visual-field sensitivity test is commonly used in a clinical setting to evaluate glaucoma. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is a common computerized visual-field test whose output is amenable to machine learning. We compared the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms with STATPAC indexes mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and corrected pattern standard deviation. The machine learning algorithms studied, included multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via Bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.

This result, once interpreted in the machine learning/pattern recognition context, puts new light on the probabilistic interpretation of the output of a trained classifier. A learning machine, or more generally a model, is usually trained by minimizing a criterion-the expectation of the cost function-measuring the discrepancy between the model output and the desired output. In this letter, we first show that, for the binary classification case, training the model with any "reasonable cost function" can lead to Bayesian a posteriori probability estimation. Indeed, after having trained the model by minimizing the criterion, there always exists a computable transformation that maps the output of the model to the Bayesian a posteriori probability of the class membership given the input. Then, necessary conditions allowing the computation of the transformation mapping the outputs of the model to the a posteriori probabilities are derived for the multioutput case. Finally, these theoretical results are illustrated through some simulation examples involving various cost functions.

J	Chakraborty, B				Chakraborty, B			Genetic algorithm with fuzzy operators for feature subset selection	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Letter						feature subset selection; genetic algorithm; fuzzy measure; fuzzy fitness function		Feature subset selection is an important preprocessing task for pattern recognition, machine learning or data mining applications. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a fuzzy fitness function has been proposed here for finding out the optimal subset of features from a large set of features. Genetic algorithms are robust but time consuming, specially GA with neural classifiers takes a long time for reasonable solution. To reduce the time, a fuzzy measure for evaluation of the quality of a feature subset is used here as the fitness function instead of classifier error rate. The computationally light fuzzy fitness function lowers the computation time of the traditional GA based algorithm with classifier accuracy as the fitness function. Simulation over two data sets shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient for selection of near optimal solution in practical problems specially in case of large feature set problems.

J	Son, CM				Son, CM			Optimal control planning strategies with fuzzy entropy and sensor fusion for robotic part assembly tasks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						part assembly (part-bringing and part insertion); optimality criterion (fuzzy entropy); uncertainty(=fuzziness); machine learning; planning; decision-making; sensor fusion; pressure; vision; optical sensors	PROCESS MODEL; ENVIRONMENT	Optimal control planning techniques for a robotic part assembly, part-bringing (macro-assembly) and part insertion (micro-assembly), with a fuzzy entropy and a sensor fusion are introduced. The part-bringing task, in an environment that contains obstacles, is accomplished using a learning algorithm that coordinates with a fuzzy optimal process model for the purpose of part insertion. By connecting the learning algorithm to information obtained by fused pressure and vision systems, the assembly conditions that the part confronts can be identified. The part insertion task is accomplished using a fuzzy control that coordinates with a fuzzy optimal process model, based on measured force and moment information, to avoid jamming related to a quasi-static part insertion. Fuzzy set theory, well-suited to the management of uncertainty, is introduced to address the uncertainty problem associated with the part assembly procedure. The degree of uncertainty associated with the part assembly is used as an optimality criterion, or cost function, e.g. minimum fuzzy entropy, for a specific task execution. The proposed technique is applicable to a wide range of robotic tasks including pick and place operations, part mating with various shaped parts, and other manufacturing tasks.

We show connectionist models can be used to learn software effort when the available data set is small. We use a connectionist model to learn software effort from a small training data set of several software projects and validate the model on a holdout sample. Several design issues associated with developing connectionist models on a small training data set are described. Our research indicates that connectionist models, whenever carefully designed, could help knowledge discovery and software effort estimation.

J	Wang, JQ; Tao, Q; Wang, J				Wang, JQ; Tao, Q; Wang, J			Kernel projection algorithm for large-scale SVM problems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						SVM; NPP; MNP; feature mapping; projection; fixed-point; universal kernel		Support Vector Machine (SVM) has become a very effective method in statistical machine learning and it has proved that training SVM is to solve Nearest Point pair Problem (NPP) between two disjoint closed convex sets. Later Keerthi pointed out that it is difficult to apply classical excellent geometric algorithms directly to SVM and so designed a new geometric algorithm for SVM. In this article, a new algorithm for geometrically solving SVM, Kernel Projection Algorithm, is presented based on the theorem on fixed-points of projection mapping. This new algorithm makes it easy to apply classical geometric algorithms to solving SVM and is more understandable than Keerthi's. Experiments show that the new algorithm can also handle large-scale SVM problems. Geometric algorithms for SVM, such as Keerthi's algorithm, require that two closed convex sets be disjoint and. otherwise the algorithms are meaningless. In this article, this requirement will be guaranteed in theory by using the theoretic result on universal kernel functions.

J	Zhang, XL; Numao, M				Zhang, XL; Numao, M			Toward effective knowledge acquisition with first-order logic induction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						knowledge acquisition; inductive logic programming; theory revision; the MDL principle; the Laplace estimate; noisy data		Knowledge acquisition with machine learning techniques is a fundamental requirement for knowledge discovery from databases and data mining systems. Two techniques in particular - inductive learning and theory revision - have been used toward this end. A method that combines both approaches to effectively acquire theories (regularity) from a set of training examples is presented. Inductive learning is used to acquire new regularity from the training examples; and theory revision is used to improve an initial theory. In addition, a theory preference criterion that is a combination of the MDL-based heuristic and the Laplace estimate has been successfully employed in the selection of the promising theory. The resulting algorithm developed by integrating inductive learning and theory revision and using the criterion has the ability to deal with complex problems, obtaining useful theories in terms of its predictive accuracy.

The complexity of the task makes Machine Learning an attractive option in comparison to the handcrafting of rules. On the other hand, because of the same task complexity, shallow parsing makes an excellent benchmark problem for evaluating machine learning algorithms. We sketch the origins of shallow parsing as a specific task for machine learning of language, and introduce the articles accepted for this special issue, a representative sample of current research in this area. Finally, future directions for machine learning of shallow parsing are suggested.

The task EFD performs, scanning a large population of health insurance claims in search of likely fraud, has never been done manually. Furthermore, the available database has few positive examples. Thus, neither existing knowledge engineering techniques nor statistical methods are sufficient for designing the identification process. To overcome these problems, EFD uses knowledge discovery techniques on two levels. First, EFD integrates expert knowledge with statistical information assessment to identify cases of unusual provider behavior. The heart of EFD is 27 behavioral heuristics, knowledge-based ways of viewing and measuring provider behavior. Rules operate on them to identify providers whose behavior merits a closer look by the investigative consultants. Second, machine learning is used to develop new rules and improve the identification process. Pilot operations involved analysis of nearly 22,000 providers in six metropolitan areas. The pilot is implemented in SAS Institute's SAS System, AlCorp's Knowledge Base Management System, and Borland International's Turbo Prolog.

As a starting point for our analysis, we identified a large number of examples of protein flexibility from a comprehensive set of structural alignments of the proteins in the PDB. Each example consisted of a pair of proteins that were considerably different in structure given their sequence similarity. On each pair, we performed geometric comparisons and adiabatic-mapping interpolations in a high-throughput pipeline, arriving at a final list of 3,814 putative motions and standardized statistics for each. We then computed the normal modes of each motion in this list, determining the linear combination of modes that best approximated the direction of the observed motion. We integrated our new motions and normal mode calculations in the Macromolecular Motions Database, through a new ranking interface at http://molmovdb.org. Based on the normal mode calculations and the interpolations, we identified a new statistic, mode concentration, related to the mathematical concept of information content, which describes the degree to which the direction of the observed motion can be summarized by a few modes. Using this statistic, we were able to determine the fraction of the 3,814 motions where one could anticipate the direction of the actual motion from only a few modes. We also investigated mode concentration in comparison to related statistics on combinations of normal modes and correlated it,with quantities characterizing protein flexibility (e.g., maximum backbone displacement or number of mobile atoms). Finally, we evaluated the ability of mode concentration to automatically classify motions into a variety of simple categories (e.g., whether or not they are "fragment-like"), in comparison to motion statistics. This involved the application of decision trees and feature selection (particular machine-learning techniques) to training and testing sets derived from merging the "list" of motions with manually classified ones.

The classification task consisted of identifying an individual cow's milk-yield test as being either outlier or non-outlier Experiments were carried out to explore the importance of deriving predictive attributes and choice of machine-learning technique. Data consisted of 1080 milk yield tests, of which 108 had been classified as outliers by a dairy nutrition specialist and 972 cases had been classified as non-outliers. Two different approaches to machine learning were applied to these data: decision-tree induction and naive-Bayes classification. Performance of the classifiers was estimated through ten-fold cross-validation, while relative operating characteristic curves were used to visualize the achieved trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Use of an initial set of derived attributes significantly improved the performance compared to limiting attributes to those available to the domain specialist. However, adding even more complex attributes did not necessarily improve the classification performance. Overall, the naive-Bayes approach showed significantly better performance than decision-tree induction. For each machine-learning approach, three final classifiers, associated with a low, medium, and high filtering intensity, were generated from the 1080 cases. The expected true positive rate varied from 41% to 78% for false positive rates between 1.1% and 4.6%. However, due to the low prevalence of outlier tests, this performance was associated with a large number of false positives. The domain specialist considered the final classifiers of both approaches as plausible, but found the decision trees easier to understand than the naive-Bayes classifiers. Machine learning was considered to be a promising approach to assist knowledge acquisition.

In many cases, the fitness function is composed of several aspects. Simple implementation to cope with the multiple fitness functions is a weighted summation. This paper presents an adaptive fitness function for the evolutionary computation to obtain the purposive behaviors through changing the weights for the fitness function. As an example task, a basic behavior in a simplified soccer game (shooting a ball into the opponent goal) is selected to show the validity of the adaptive fitness function. Simulation results and real experiments are shown, and a discussion is given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this research, we focused on the switching problem of FES, which is one of the obstacles that prevent FES from further practical uses. An adaptive switching for FES control for the lower limbs' activities of hemiplegic patients was developed, based on the consideration that, lower limbs' activities need the synchronization of limbs of both sides. Electromyogram (EMG) signals detected from normal side of hemiplegic patients were used to recognize the activities that the patients intend to do. The recognition results were utilized as the switching signals. However, motion patterns represented and analyzed by EMG are distinctive of individual variations and characteristic alternation, which inevitably result in classification errors in EMG analyzing. To overcome these problems, a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) was embedded in an on-line process to form an analyzing system that can adapt to individual characteristics and trace the nonstationary factor. Furthermore, in order to enable the analyzing system to recognize right timings from the EMG-described dynamical processes of activities, such as standing-up and walking, a practical training-set construction method that utilizes additional reference data was proposed. The proposed switching system was applied to a FES system that supports standing-up and walking for a hemiplegics subject, to verify the effectiveness. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Different kernel functions and sliding window sizes have been explored to find how they affect the prediction performance. Using a cut-off threshold of 15% that splits the dataset evenly (an equal number of exposed and buried residues), this method was able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 70.1% for single sequence input and 73.9% for multiple alignment sequence input, respectively. The prediction of three and more states of solvent accessibility was also studied and compared with other methods. The prediction accuracies are better than, or comparable to, those obtained by other methods such as neural networks, Bayesian classification, multiple linear regression, and information theory. In addition, our results further suggest that this system may be combined with other prediction methods to achieve more reliable results, and that the Support Vector Machine method is a very useful tool for biological sequence analysis.

J	Gora, G; Wojna, A				Gora, G; Wojna, A			RIONA: A new classification system combining rule induction and instance-based learning	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						machine learning; instance-based learning; rule induction; nearest neighbour method		The article describes a method combining two widely-used empirical approaches to learning from examples: rule induction and instance-based learning. In our algorithm (RIONA) decision is predicted not on the basis of the whole support set of all rules matching a test case. but the support set restricted to a neighbourhood of a test case. The size of the optimal neighbourhood is automatically induced during the learning phase. The empirical study shows the interesting fact that it is enough to consider a small neighbourhood to achieve classification accuracy comparable to an algorithm considering the whole learning set. The combination of k-NN and a rule-based algorithm results in a significant acceleration of the algorithm using all minimal rules. Moreover, the presented classifier has high accuracy for both kinds of domains: more suitable for k-NN classifiers and more suitable for rule based classifiers.

J	Lam, W; Keung, CK; Liu, DY				Lam, W; Keung, CK; Liu, DY			Discovering useful concept prototypes for classification based on filtering and abstraction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						prototype learning; classification; instance abstraction; machine learning; data mining	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; NEAREST; DESIGN	The nearest-neighbor algorithm and its derivatives have been shown to perform well for pattern classification. Despite their high classification accuracy, they suffer from high storage requirement, computational cost, and sensitivity to noise. We develop a new framework, called ICPL (Integrated Concept Prototype Learner), which integrates instance-filtering and instance-abstraction techniques by maintaining a balance of different kinds of concept prototypes according to instance locality. The abstraction component, based on typicality, employed in our ICPL framework is specially designed for concept integration. We have conducted experiments on a total of 50 real-world benchmark data sets. We find that our ICPL framework maintains or achieves better classification accuracy and gains a significant improvement in data reduction compared with existing filtering and abstraction techniques as well as some existing techniques.

To compare the ability of several machine learning classifiers to predict development of abnormal fields at follow-up in ocular hypertensive (OHT) eyes that had normal visual fields in baseline examination. METHODS. The visual fields of 114 eyes of 114 patients with OHT with four or more visual field tests with standard automated perimetry over three or more years and for whom stereophotographs were available were assessed. The mean (+/-SD) number of visual field tests was 7.89 +/- 3.04. The mean number of years covered (+/-SD) was 5.92 +/- 2.34 (range, 2.81-11.77). Fields were classified as normal or abnormal based on Statpac-like methods (Humphrey Instruments, Dublin, CA) and by several machine learning classifiers. The machine learning classifiers were two types of support vector machine (SVM), a mixture of Gaussian (MoG) classifier. a constrained MoG, and a mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). Specificity was set to 96% for all classifiers, using data from 94 normal eyes evaluated longitudinally. Specificity, cutoffs required confirmation of abnormality. RESULTS. Thirty-two percent (36/114) of the eves converted to abnormal fields during follow-up based on the Statpac-like methods. All 36 were identified by at least one machine classifier. In nearly, all cases, the machine learning classifiers predicted the confirmed abnormality, on average, 3.92 +/- 0.55 years earlier than traditional Statpac-like methods. CONCLUSIONS. Machine learning classifiers can learn complex patterns and trends in data and adapt to create a decision surface without the constraints imposed by statistical classifiers. This adaptation allowed the machine learning classifiers to identify abnormality in visual field converts much earlier than the traditional methods.

Although prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters are adaptive and, given time, will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud and computer intrusion, to name but a few.

J	Fine, S; Gilad-Bachrach, R; Shamir, E				Fine, S; Gilad-Bachrach, R; Shamir, E			Query by committee, linear separation and random walks	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference on Computational Learning Theory	MAR 29-31, 1999	NORDKIRCHEN, GERMANY	Deutsch Forsch Gemeinsch, IFIP, Univ Dortmund, Dept Comp Sci		selective sampling; active learning; experimental design; volume approximation; labeled and unlabelled data	ALGORITHM; VOLUME	A long-standing goal in the realm of Machine Learning is to minimize sample-complexity, i.e. to reduce as much as possible the number of examples used in the course of learning. The Active Learning paradigm is one such method aimed at achieving this goal by transforming the learner from a passive participant in the information gathering process to an active one. Vaguely speaking, the learner tries to minimize the number of labeled instances used in the course of learning, relaying also on unlabelled instances in order to acquire the needed information whenever possible. The reasoning comes from many real-life problems where the teacher's activity is an expensive resource (e.g. text categorization, part of speech tagging). The Query By Committee (QBC) (Seung et al., Query by committee, Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Computational Learning theory, Morgan Kaufman, San Mateo, CA, 1992, pp. 287-294) is an Active Learning algorithm acting in the Bayesian model of concept learning (Haussler et al., Mach. Learning 14 (1994) 83), i.e. it assumes that the concept to be learned is chosen according to some fixed and known distribution. Trying to apply the QBC algorithm for learning the class of linear separators, one faces the problem of implementing the mechanism of sampling hypotheses (the Gibbs oracle). The major problem is computational-complexity, since the straightforward Monte Carlo method takes exponential time. In this paper we address the problems involved in the implementation of such a mechanism. We show how to convert them to questions about sampling from convex bodies or approximating the volume of such bodies. Similar problems have recently been solved in the field of computational geometry based on random walks. These techniques enable us to device efficient implementations of the QBC algorithm. We also give few improvements and corrections to the QBC algorithm, the most important one is dropping the Bayes assumption when the concept classes possess a sort of symmetry property (which holds for linear separators). We draw attention to a useful geometric lemma which bounds the maximal radius of a ball contained in a convex body. Finally, this paper exhibits a connection between random walks and certain Machine Learning notions such as e-net and support vector machines. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A human subject is first recorded using a videocamera as he/she utters a predetermined speech corpus. After processing the corpus automatically, a visual speech module is learned from the data that is capable of synthesizing the human subject's mouth uttering entirely novel utterances that were not recorded in the original video. The synthesized utterance is re-composited onto a background sequence which contains natural head and eye movement. The final output is videorealistic in the sense that it looks like a video camera recording of the subject. At run time, the input to the system can be either real audio sequences or synthetic audio produced by a text-to-speech system, as long as they have been phonetically aligned. The two key contributions of this paper are 1) a variant of the multidimensional morphable model (MMM) to synthesize new, previously unseen mouth configurations from a small set of mouth image prototypes; and 2) a trajectory synthesis technique based on regularization, which is automatically trained from the recorded video corpus, and which is capable of synthesizing trajectories in MMM space corresponding to any desired utterance.

A relationship was found between indoor radon concentrations, rock type, tectonic faults and age of buildings. Indoor radon concentrations were elevated in buildings that were older than 50 years and in those with a fault under foundations. When these data were eliminated, elevated indoor radon levels were found only in buildings built on limestone. Our conclusions were confirmed by using the machine learning methods: clustering and multiple regression.

J	Nolan, JR				Nolan, JR			Computer systems that learn: an empirical study of the effect of noise on the performance of three classification methods	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						classification algorithms; learning from examples; feature noise	SOFTWARE	Classification learning systems are useful in many domain areas, One problem with the development of these systems is feature noise, Learning from examples classification methods from statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, and connectionist theory are applied to synthetic data sets possessing a known percentage of feature noise. Linear discriminant analysis, the C5.0 tree classification algorithm, and a backpropagation neural network tool are used as representative techniques from these three categories. k-Fold cross-validation is used to estimate the sensitivity of the true classification accuracy to level of feature noise present in the data sets. Results indicate that the backpropagation neural network outperforms both linear discriminant analysis and C5.0 tree classification when appreciable (10% or more of the cases) feature noise is present. These results are confirmed when the same type of empirical analysis is applied to a real-world data set previously analyzed and reported in the statistical and machine learning literature.

There is tremendous potential for effective use of multimedia content through intelligent analysis. Diverse application areas are increasingly relying on multimedia understanding systems. Advances in multimedia understanding are related directly to advances in signal processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, multimedia databases, and smart sensors. We review the state-of-the-art techniques in multimedia retrieval. In particular we discuss how multimedia retrieval can be viewed as a pattern recognition problem. We discuss, how reliance on powerful pattern recognition and machine learning techniques is increasing in the field of multimedia retrieval. We review state-of-the-art multimedia understanding systems with particular emphasis on a system for semantic video indexing centered around multijects and multinets. We discuss how semantic retrieval is centered around concepts and context and also discuss various mechanisms for modeling concepts and context.

J	Guo, GD; Jain, AK; Ma, WY; Zhang, HJ				Guo, GD; Jain, AK; Ma, WY; Zhang, HJ			Learning similarity measure for natural image retrieval with relevance feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						AdaBoost; constrained similarity measure; content-based image retrieval; feature selection; learning; relevance feedback; support vector machine (SVM)		A new scheme of learning similarity measure is proposed for content-based image retrieval (CBIR). It learns a boundary that separates the images in the database into two clusters. Images inside the boundary are ranked by their Euclidean distances to the query. The scheme is called constrained similarity measure (CSM), which not only takes into consideration the perceptual similarity between images, but also significantly improves the retrieval performance of the Euclidean distance measure. Two techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost from machine learning, are utilized to learn the boundary. They are compared to see their differences in boundary learning. The positive and negative examples used to learn the boundary are provided by the user with relevance feedback. The CSM metric is evaluated in a large database of 10 009 natural images with an accurate ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure for image retrieval.

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's algorithm. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.

Key problems on the topic of imitation have, emerged in various areas close to artificial intelligence, including the cognitive and social sciences, animal behavior, robotics, human-computer interaction, embodied intelligence, software engineering, programming by example and machine learning. Artificial systems used to study imitation can both test models of imitation derived from observational or neurobiological data on imitation in. animals and then apply them to different kinds of nonbiological systems ranging from robots to software agents. A crucial problem in imitation is the correspondence problem, mapping action sequences of the demonstrator and the imitator agent. This problem becomes particularly obvious when the two agents do not share the same embodiment and affordances. This paper describes a new general imitation mechanism called Action Learning for Imitation via Correspondence between embodiments (ALICE) that specifically addresses the correspondence problem. The mechanism is implemented and its efficacy illustrated on the "chessworld" testbed that was created to study imitation from an agent-based perspective, i.e., by a particular agent in a particular environment.

J	Tan, CM; Wang, YF; Lee, CD				Tan, CM; Wang, YF; Lee, CD			The use of bigrams to enhance text categorization	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information retrieval.; text categorization; text classification; machine learning		In this paper, we present an efficient text categorization algorithm that generates bigrams selectively by looking for ones that have an especially good chance of being useful. The algorithm uses the information gain metric, combined with various frequency thresholds. The bigrams, along with unigrams, are then given as features to two different classifiers: Naive Bayes and maximum entropy. The experimental results suggest that the bigrams can substantially raise the quality of feature sets, showing increases in the break-even points and F I measures. The McNemar test shows that in most categories the increases are very significant. Upon close examination of the algorithm, we concluded that the algorithm is most successful in correctly classifying more positive documents, but may cause more negative documents to be classified incorrectly.

J	Sanchez, SN; Triantaphyllou, E; Kraft, D				Sanchez, SN; Triantaphyllou, E; Kraft, D			A feature mining based approach for the classification of text documents into disjoint classes	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						document classification; document indexing; vector space model; data mining; One Clause At a Time (OCAT) algorithm; machine learning	LOGICAL CLAUSES; EXAMPLES	This paper proposes a new approach for classifying text documents into two disjoint classes. The new approach is based on extracting patterns. in the form of two logical expressions, which are defined on various features (indexing terms) or the documents. The pattern extraction is aimed at providing descriptions (in the form of two logical expressions) of the two classes of positive and negative examples. This is achieved by means or a data mining approach, called One Clause At a Time (OCAT), which is based on mathematical logic, The application of a logic-based approach to text document classification is critical when one wishes to be able to justify why a particular document has been assigned to one class versus the other class. This situation occurs, for instance, in declassifying documents that have been previously considered important to national security and thus are currently being kept as secret. Some Computational experiments have investigated the effectiveness of the OCAT-based approach and compared it to the well-known vector space model (VSM). These tests also have investigated finding the best indexing terms that could be used in making these classification decisions. The results of these computational experiments on a sample of 2897 text documents from the TIPSTER collection indicate that the first approach hits many advantages over the VSM approach for solving this type of text document classification problem. Moreover, a guided strategy for the OCAT-based approach is presented for deciding which document one needs to consider next while building the training example sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Handwriting samples of 1500 individuals, representative of the U.S. population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features from scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by forensic document examiners (FDEs), were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of handwriting and very few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court. The mathematical approach and the resulting software also have the promise of aiding the FDE.

We compare different nonparametric machine learning techniques with parametric likelihood estimations commonly employed in population genetics for purposes of assigning individuals to their population of origin ("assignment tests"). Classifier accuracy was compared across simulated data sets representing different levels of population differentiation (low and high F-ST), number of loci surveyed (5 and 10), and allelic diversity (average of three or eight alleles per locus). Empirical data for the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibiting levels of population differentiation comparable to those used in simulations were examined to further evaluate and compare classification methods. Classification error rates associated with artificial neural networks and likelihood estimators were lower for simulated data sets compared to k-nearest neighbor and decision tree classifiers over the entire range of parameters considered. Artificial neural networks only marginally outperformed the likelihood method for simulated data (0-2.8% lower error rates). The relative performance of each machine learning classifier improved relative likelihood estimators for empirical data sets, suggesting an ability to "learn" and utilize properties of empirical genotypic arrays intrinsic to each population. Likelihood-based estimation methods provide a more accessible option for reliable assignment of individuals to the population of origin due to the intricacies in development and evaluation of artificial neural networks.

These images, if analyzed, can reveal useful information to the human users. Image mining deals with the extraction of implicit knowledge, image data relationship, or other patterns not explicitly stored in the images. Image mining is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. It is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws upon expertise in computer vision, image processing, image retrieval, data mining, machine learning, database, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we will examine the research issues in image mining, current developments in image mining, particularly, image mining frameworks, state-of-the-art techniques and systems. We will also identify some future research directions for image mining.

J	Chen, YQ; Gao, W; Zhu, TS; Ling, C				Chen, YQ; Gao, W; Zhu, TS; Ling, C			Learning prosodic patterns for mandarin speech synthesis	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						TTS; clustering; Rough Set; ANN; Decision tree; Beyesian network	TEXT-TO-SPEECH; SYSTEM	Higher quality synthesized speech is required for widespread use of text-to-speech (TTS) technology, and the prosodic pattern is the key feature that makes synthetic speech sound unnatural and monotonous, which mainly describes the variation of pitch. The rules used in most Chinese TTS systems are constructed by experts, with weak quality control and low precision. In this paper, we propose a combination of clustering and machine learning techniques to extract prosodic patterns from actual large mandarin speech databases to improve the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech. Typical prosody models are found by clustering analysis. Some machine learning techniques, including Rough Set, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision tree, are trained for fundamental frequency and energy contours, which can be directly used in a pitch-synchronous-overlap-add-based (PSOLA-based) TTS system. The experimental results showed that synthesized prosodic features greatly resembled their original counterparts for most syllables.

J	Dolsak, B				Dolsak, B			Finite element mesh design expert system	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st SGES International Conference on Knowledge Based Systems and Applied Artificial Intelligence	DEC, 2001	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Specialist Grp Knowledge Based Syst & Appl Artificial Intelligence		finite element analysis; artificial intelligence; expert system shell		The paper presents a consultative rule-based expert system for finite element mesh design. The aim of the expert system presented is to propose the appropriate type of the finite elements and determine the resolution values for the finite element mesh to be used for the analysis. The extensive knowledge base, comprising about 1900 rules, was built mainly by the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. Several examples will confirm that an expert system shell written in Prolog enables efficient use of the knowledge base and adequate communication between the system and the user. The system has the ability to explain the inference process. Thus, it can also be used as a teaching tool for inexperienced users-students. The results of the experimental use of the system are encouraging and can be used as guidelines for further developments and improvements of the system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Previous classical results for linear regression are based on an asymptotic analysis. We present a new penalization method for performing model selection for regression that is appropriate even for small samples. Our penalization is based on an accurate estimator of the ratio of the expected training error and the expected generalization error, in terms of the expected eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix.

J	Gunn, SR; Kandola, JS				Gunn, SR; Kandola, JS			Structural modelling with sparse kernels	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Kernel methods; transparency; model interpretability; sparse structure; ANOVA	REGULARIZATION THEORY; NEURAL NETWORKS	A widely acknowledged drawback of many statistical modelling techniques, commonly used in machine learning, is that the resulting model is extremely difficult to interpret. A number of new concepts and algorithms have been introduced by researchers to address this problem. They focus primarily on determining which inputs are relevant in predicting the output. This work describes a transparent, advanced non-linear modelling approach that enables the constructed predictive models to be visualised, allowing model validation and assisting in interpretation. The technique combines the representational advantage of a sparse ANOVA decomposition, with the good generalisation ability of a kernel machine. It achieves this by employing two forms of regularisation: a 1-norm based structural regulariser to enforce transparency, and a 2-norm based regulariser to control smoothness. The resulting model structure can be visualised showing the overall effects of different inputs, their interactions, and the strength of the interactions. The robustness of the technique is illustrated using a range of both artifical and "real world" datasets. The performance is compared to other modelling techniques, and it is shown to exhibit competitive generalisation performance together with improved interpretability.

J	Vincent, P; Bengio, Y				Vincent, P; Bengio, Y			Kernel matching pursuit	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						kernel methods; matching pursuit; sparse approximation; support vector machines; radial basis functions; boosting	VECTOR MACHINES; SUPPORT VECTOR	Matching Pursuit algorithms learn a function that is a weighted sum of basis functions, by sequentially appending functions to an initially empty basis, to approximate a target function in the least-squares sense. We show how matching pursuit can be extended to use non-squared error loss functions, and how it can be used to build kernel-based solutions to machine learning problems, while keeping control of the sparsity of the solution. We present a version of the algorithm that makes an optimal choice of both the next basis and the weights of all the previously chosen bases. Finally, links to boosting algorithms and RBF training procedures, as well as an extensive experimental comparison with SVMs for classification are given, showing comparable results with typically much sparser models.

J	Abdel-Aal, RE				Abdel-Aal, RE			Comparison of algorithmic and machine learning approaches for the automatic fitting of Gaussian peaks	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						abductive networks; Gaussian peaks; least squares fit; machine learning; peak fitting; spectral analysis; spectroscopy	GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA; NEURAL NETWORK; SPECTROSCOPY	Fitting Gaussian peaks to experimental data is important in many disciplines, including nuclear spectroscopy. Nonlinear least squares fitting methods have been in use for a long time, but these are iterative, computationally intensive, and require user intervention. Machine learning approaches automate and speed up the fitting procedure. However, for a single pure Gaussian, there exists a simple and automatic analytical approach based on linearisation followed by a weighted linear Least Squares (LS) fit. This paper compares this algorithmic method with an abductive machine learning approach based on AIM(1) (Abductory Induction Mechanism). Both techniques are briefly described and their performance compared for analysing simulated and actual spectral peaks. Evaluated on 500 peaks with statistical uncertainties corresponding to a peak count of 100, average absolute errors for the peak height, position and width are 4.9%, 2.9% and 4.2% for AIM, versus 3.3%, 0.5% and 7.7% for the LS. AIM is better for the width, while LS is more accurate for the position. LS errors are more biased, under-estimating the peak position and overestimating the peak width. Tentative CPU time comparison indicates a five fold speed advantage for AIM, which also has a constant execution time, while LS time depends upon the peak width.

The two integration methods differ in the filtering granularity as well as the degree of coupling of the techniques. In order to characterize the behavior of the effect of integration, we categorize instance-filtering techniques into three kinds, namely, (1) removing border instances. (2) retaining border instance, (3) retaining center instances. The effect of using different kinds of filtering in different variants of our PGF framework are investigated. We have conducted experiments on 35 real-world benchmark data sets. We found that our PGF framework maintains or achieves better classification accuracy and gains a significant improvement in data reduction compared with pure filtering and pure abstraction techniques as well as KNN and C4.5.

J	Kramer, S; Frank, E; Helma, C				Kramer, S; Frank, E; Helma, C			Fragment generation and support vector machines for inducing SARs	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						SARs; fragments; support vector machines; machine learning; data mining	GRAPH-THEORY; PROGRAM; CARCINOGENICITY; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY	We present a new approach to the induction of SARs based on the generation of structural fragments and support vector machines (SVMs). It is tailored for bio-chemical databases, where the examples are two-dimensional descriptions of chemical compounds. The fragment generator finds all fragments (i.e. linearly connected atoms) that satisfy user-specified constraints regarding their frequency and generality. In this paper, we are querying for fragments within a minimum and a maximum frequency in the dataset. After fragment generation, we propose to apply SVMs to the problem of inducing SARs from these fragments. We conjecture that the SVMs are particularly useful in this context, as they can deal with a large number of features. Experiments in the domains of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity prediction show that the minimum and the maximum frequency queries for fragments can be answered within a reasonable time, and that the predictive accuracy obtained using these fragments is satisfactory. However, further experiments will have to confirm that this is a viable approach to inducing SARs.

J	Bao, L; Sun, ZR				Bao, L; Sun, ZR			Identifying genes related to drug anticancer mechanisms using support vector machine	FEBS LETTERS			English	Article						drug activity; gene expression; anticancer mechanism; support vector machine	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY; CANCER; EXPRESSION; NETWORKS	In an effort to identify genes related to the cell line chemosensitivity and to evaluate the functional relationships between genes and anticancer drugs acting by the same mechanism, a supervised machine learning approach called support vector machine was used to label genes into any of the five predefined anticancer drug mechanistic categories. Among dozens of unequivocally categorized genes, many were known to be causally related to the drug mechanisms. For example, a few genes were found to be involved in the biological process triggered by the drugs (e.g. DNA polymerase epsilon was the direct target for the drugs from DNA antimetabolites category). DNA repair-related genes were found to be enriched for about eight-fold in the resulting gene set relative to the entire gene set. Some uncharacterized transcripts might be of interest in future studies. This method of correlating the drugs and genes provides a strategy for finding novel biologically significant relationships for molecular pharmacology.

Whereas phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments in terms of the prediction error. We found prediction errors of 9.6-15.5% for all drugs except for zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine, with prediction errors between 25.4% and 32.0%.

A diverse range of unprocessed, industrial fed-batch fermentation broths containing the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi producing the natural product gibberellic acid, were analyzed directly without a priori chromatographic separation. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to all of the information-rich spectra obtained by each of the methods to obtain quantitative information on the gibberellic acid titer. These estimates were of good precision, and the typical root-mean-square error for predictions of concentrations in an independent test set was <10% over a very wide titer range from 0 to 4925 ppm. However, although PLSR and ANNs are very powerful techniques they are often described as "black box" methods because the information they use to construct the calibration model is largely inaccessible. Therefore, a variety of novel evolutionary computation-based methods, including genetic algorithms and genetic programming, were used to produce models that allowed the determination of those input variables that contributed most to the models formed, and to observe that these models were predominantly based on the concentration of gibberellic acid itself. This is the first time that these three modern analytical spectroscopies, in combination with advanced chemometric data analysis, have been compared for their ability to analyze a real commercial bioprocess. The results demonstrate unequivocally that all methods provide very rapid and accurate estimates of the progress of industrial fermentations, and indicate that, of the three methods studied, Raman spectroscopy is the ideal bioprocess monitoring method because it can be adapted for on-line analysis.

J	Ellis, DI; Broadhurst, D; Kell, DB; Rowland, JJ; Goodacre, R				Ellis, DI; Broadhurst, D; Kell, DB; Rowland, JJ; Goodacre, R			Rapid and quantitative detection of the microbial spoilage of meat by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and machine learning	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							PYROLYSIS MASS-SPECTROMETRY; POULTRY MEAT; CHICKEN; HACCP; IDENTIFICATION; VALIDATION; REGRESSION; CARCASSES; PRODUCTS; BACTERIA	Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a rapid, noninvasive technique with considerable potential for application in the food and related industries. We show here that this technique can be used directly on the surface of food to produce biochemically interpretable "fingerprints." Spoilage in meat is the result of decomposition and the formation of metabolites caused by the growth and enzymatic activity of microorganisms. FT-IR was exploited to measure biochemical changes within the meat substrate, enhancing and accelerating the detection of microbial spoilage. Chicken breasts were purchased from a national retailer, comminuted for 10 s, and left to spoil at room temperature for 24 h. Every hour, FT-IR measurements were taken directly from the meat surface using attenuated total reflectance, and the total viable counts were obtained by classical plating methods. Quantitative interpretation of FT-IR spectra was possible using partial least-squares regression and allowed accurate estimates of bacterial loads to be calculated directly from the meat surface in 60 s. Genetic programming was used to derive rules showing that at levels of 10(7) bacteria.g(-1) the main biochemical indicator of spoilage was the onset of proteolysis. Thus, using FT-IR we were able to acquire a metabolic snapshot and quantify, noninvasively, the microbial loads of food samples accurately and rapidly in 60 s, directly from the sample surface. We believe this approach will aid in the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point process for the assessment of the microbiological safety of food at the production, processing, manufacturing, packaging, and storage levels.

J	Zopounidis, C; Doumpos, M				Zopounidis, C; Doumpos, M			Multi-group discrimination using multi-criteria analysis: Illustrations from the field of finance	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1998 EURO Conference	JUL 12-16, 1998	BRUSSELS, BELGIUM			discrimination; multicriteria decision aid; preference disaggregation; financial decision making	ROUGH SET APPROACH; PREDICTION	The primary objective in the discrimination problem is to assign a set of alternatives into predefined classes. During the last two decades several now approaches, such as mathematical programming, neural networks, machine learning, rough sets, multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA), etc., have been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional, statistical and econometric techniques that have dominated this field since the 1930s This paper focuses on the MCDA approach. A new method to achieve multi-group discrimination based on an iterative binary segmentation procedure is proposed. Five real world applications from the field of finance (credit cards assessment, country risk evaluation, credit risk assessment, corporate acquisitions, business failure prediction) are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method as opposed to discriminant analysis.

J	Gutierrez-Osuna, R				Gutierrez-Osuna, Ricardo			Pattern Analysis for Machine Olfaction: A Review	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Classification; clustering; dimensionality reduction; electronic nose; multicomponent analysis; pattern analysis; preprocessing; validation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GAS SENSOR ARRAY; PREDICTING ORGANOLEPTIC SCORES; SIGNAL-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES; ELECTRONIC NOSE DATA; PPM FLAVOR NOTES; ODOR-RECOGNITION; COMPUTATIONAL PARALLELS; TEMPERATURE MODULATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS	Pattern analysis constitutes a critical building block in the development of gas sensor array instruments capable of detecting, identifying, and measuring volatile compounds, a technology that has been proposed as an artificial substitute of the human olfactory system. The successful design of a pattern analysis system for machine olfaction requires a careful consideration of the various issues involved in processing multivariate data: signal-preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, regression, clustering, and validation. A considerable number of methods from statistical pattern recognition, neural networks, chemometrics, machine learning, and biological cybernetics has been used to process electronic nose data. The objective of this review paper is to provide a summary and guidelines for using the most widely used pattern analysis techniques, as well as to identify research directions that are at the frontier of sensor-based machine olfaction.

J	Pardo, M; Sberveglieri, G				Pardo, Matteo; Sberveglieri, Giorgio			Learning From Data: A Tutorial With Emphasis on Modern Pattern Recognition Methods	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Boosting; data analysis; electronic nose; ensemble methods; learning; pattern recognition		The purposes of this tutorial are twofold. First, it reviews the classical statistical learning scenario by highlighting its fundamental taxonomies and its key aspects. The second aim of the paper is to introduce some modern (ensembles) methods developed inside the machine learning field. The tutorial starts by putting the topic of supervised learning into the broader context of data analysis and by reviewing the classical pattern recognition methods: those based on class-conditional density estimation and the use of the Bayes theorem and those based on discriminant functions. The fundamental topic of complexity control is treated in some detail. Ensembles techniques have drawn considerable attention in recent years: a set of learning machines increases classification accuracy with respect to a single machine. Here, we will introduce boosting, in which classifiers adaptively concentrate on the harder examples located near to the classification boundary and output coding, where a set of independent two-class machines solves a multiclass problem. The first successful applications of these methods to data produced by the Pico-2 electronic nose (EN), developed at the University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy, will also be briefly shown.

J	de Castro, LN; Von Zuben, FJ				de Castro, LN; Von Zuben, FJ			Learning and optimization using the clonal selection principle	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						clonal selection principle; evolutionary algorithms; optimization; pattern recognition	CROSS-REACTIVITY; MATURATION; MEMORY	The clonal selection principle is used to explain the basic features of an adaptive immune response to an antigenic stimulus. It establishes the idea that only those cells that recognize the antigens (Ag's) are selected to proliferate. The selected cells are subject to an affinity maturation process, which improves their affinity to the selective Ag's. This paper proposes a computational implementation of the clonal selection principle that explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The general algorithm, named CLONALG, is derived primarily to perform machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks and then it is adapted to solve optimization problems, emphasizing multimodal and combinatorial optimization. Two versions of the algorithm are derived, their computational cost per iteration is presented, and a sensitivity analysis in relation to the user-defined parameters is given. CLONALG is also contrasted with evolutionary algorithms. Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the performance of CLONALG and it is also compared to a niching method for multimodal function optimization.

The system adaptively restores the ultrasonic image using approximators based on neural networks. Neural networks are also applied to perform object classification and a grasp planning task. Since the grasp planning is not unique, we developed a novel learning scheme that uses the expectation maximization approach. The resulting system works precisely and reliably. The underlying methodology can be extended to other low-quality data problems.

Antigens (epitopes/ids) and antibodies (paratopes/anti-ids) are represented here as sequences of single letter amino acid codes. The model effectively simulates dynamic affinity maturation, memory and associativity. Specific age-function is derived here based on recent experimental findings and is used to incorporate self and non-self antigens. Computational experiments using real data on Type-1 Diabetes and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus offer quantitative elucidation of autoimmunity. The results also provide applications towards vaccine design and possible solution to the therapeutic difficulties in the autoimmune diseases and disorders of the above kind.

This theory can be viewed as a decomposition of classifier design into two components; the first component is a restriction to a data dependent hypothesis class and the second is empirical risk minimization within that class. We define a measure of complexity for data dependent hypothesis classes and provide data dependent versions of bounds on error deviance and estimation error. We also provide a structural risk minimization procedure over data dependent hierarchies and prove consistency. We use this theory to provide a framework for studying the trade-offs between performance and computational complexity in classifier design. As a consequence we obtain a new family of classifiers with dimension independent performance bounds and efficient learning procedures.

J	Meek, C; Thiesson, B; Heckerman, D				Meek, C; Thiesson, B; Heckerman, D			The learning-curve sampling method applied to model-based clustering	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						learning-curve sampling method; clustering; scalability; decision theory; sampling		We examine the learning-curve sampling method, an approach for applying machine-learning algorithms to large data sets. The approach is based on the observation that the computational cost of learning a model increases as a function of the sample size of the training data, whereas the accuracy of a model has diminishing improvements as a function of sample size. Thus, the learning-curve sampling method monitors the increasing costs and performance as larger and larger amounts of data are used for training, and terminates learning when future costs outweigh future benefits. In this paper, we formalize the learning-curve sampling method and its associated cost-benefit tradeoff in terms of decision theory. In addition, we describe the application of the learning-curve sampling method to the task of model-based clustering via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In experiments on three real data sets, we show that the learning-curve sampling method produces models that are nearly as accurate as those trained on complete data sets, but with dramatically reduced learning times. Finally, we describe an extension of the basic learning-curve approach for model-based clustering that results in an additional speedup. This extension is based on the observation that the shape of the learning curve for a given model and data set is roughly independent of the number of EM iterations used during training. Thus, we run EM for only a few iterations to decide how many cases to use for training, and then run EM to full convergence once the number of cases is selected.

Functional annotation currently relies almost exclusively on inter-species sequence comparison and is restricted in cases of limited data from related species and widely divergent sequences with no known homologs. Here, we demonstrate that codon composition, a fusion of codon usage bias and amino acid composition signals, can accurately discriminate, in the absence of sequence homology information, cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes from all other genes of known function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an implementation of support vector machines, SVMlight. Analysis of these codon composition signals is instructive in determining features that confer individuality to ribosomal protein genes. Each of the sets of positively charged, negatively charged and small hydrophobic residues, as well as codon bias, contribute to their distinctive codon composition profile. The representation of all these signals is sensitively detected, combined and augmented by the SVMs to perform an accurate classification. Of special mention is an obvious outlier, yeast gene RPL22B, highly homologous to RPL22A but employing very different codon usage, perhaps indicating a non-ribosomal function. Finally, we propose that codon composition be used in combination with other attributes in gene/protein classification by supervised machine learning algorithms.

J	Laender, AHF; Ribeiro-Neto, BA; da Silva, AS; Teixeira, JS				Laender, AHF; Ribeiro-Neto, BA; da Silva, AS; Teixeira, JS			A brief survey of Web data extraction tools	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article							INFORMATION EXTRACTION; SEMISTRUCTURED DATA; WRAPPER INDUCTION	In the last few years, several works in the literature have addressed the problem of data extraction from Web pages. The importance of this problem derives from the fact that, once extracted, the data can be handled in a way similar to instances of a traditional database. The approaches proposed in the literature to address the problem of Web data extraction use techniques borrowed from areas such as natural language processing, languages and grammars, machine learning, information retrieval, databases, and ontologies. As a consequence, they present very distinct features and capabilities which make a direct comparison difficult to be done. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for characterizing Web data extraction tools, briefly survey major Web data extraction tools described in the literature, and provide a qualitative analysis of them. Hopefully, this work will stimulate other studies aimed at a more comprehensive analysis of data extraction approaches and tools for Web data.

However, large-scale random libraries have yielded only a low number of quality lead molecules. To address this shortcoming researchers have paid more attention to the concept of "drug-likeness" of molecules in combinatorial and screening libraries. Database profiling and analysis methods have been employed to identify the structural features of known drug molecules. Neural networks and machine learning methods help to distinguish between drugs and nondrugs. More recently, database-independent pharmacophore filters have been introduced that provide simple intuitive rules to classify potential drugs.

The scheme is based on a sample re-weighting strategy. The very basic idea is in fact to add to the training set new replicas of samples which are not classified with a sufficient margin. As a study case, we present a new algorithm, namely TVQ, which is an instance of the proposed scheme and involves a tangent distance based 1-NN classifier implementing a sort of quantization of the tangent distance prototypes. The tangent distance models created in this way have shown a significant improvement in generalization power with respect to standard tangent models. Moreover, the obtained models were able to outperform other state of the art algorithms, such as SVM, in an OCR task. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, ZH; Wu, JX; Tang, W				Zhou, ZH; Wu, JX; Tang, W			Ensembling neural networks: Many could be better than all	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IJCAI 2001 Conference	2001	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON	IJCAI		neural networks; neural network ensemble; machine learning; selective ensemble; boosting; bagging; genetic algorithm; bias-variance decomposition	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Neural network ensemble is a learning paradigm where many neural networks are jointly used to solve a problem. In this paper, the relationship between the ensemble and its component neural networks is analyzed from the context of both regression and classification, which reveals that it may be better to ensemble many instead of all of the neural networks at hand. This result is interesting because at present, most approaches ensemble all the available neural networks for prediction. Then, in order to show that the appropriate neural networks for composing an ensemble can be effectively selected from a set of available neural networks, an approach named GASEN is presented. GASEN trains a number of neural networks at first. Then it assigns random weights to those networks and employs genetic algorithm to evolve the weights so that they can characterize to some extent the fitness of the neural networks in constituting an ensemble. Finally it selects some neural networks based on the evolved weights to make up the ensemble. A large empirical study shows that, compared with some popular ensemble approaches such as Bagging and Boosting, GASEN can generate neural network ensembles with far smaller sizes but stronger generalization ability. Furthermore, in order to understand the working mechanism of GASEN, the bias-variance decomposition of the error is provided in this paper, which shows that the success of GASEN may lie in that it can significantly reduce the bias as well as the variance.

J	Ribeiro, C				Ribeiro, C			Reinforcement learning agents	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						adaptive systems; artificial life; autonomous agents; intelligent robotics; machine learning; optimization; optimal control	MARKOV DECISION-PROCESSES; ROBOTS	Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning through direct experimentation. It does not assume the existence of a teacher that provides examples upon which learning of a task takes place. Instead, in RL experience is the only teacher. With historical roots on the study of biological conditioned reflexes, RL attracts the interest of Engineers and Computer Scientists because of its theoretical relevance and potential applications in fields as diverse as Operational Research and Intelligent Robotics. Computationally, RL is intended to operate in a learning environment composed by two subjects: the learner and a dynamic process. At successive time steps, the learner makes an observation of the process state, selects an action and applies it back to the process. Its goal is to find out an action policy that controls the behavior of the dynamic process, guided by signals (reinforcements) that indicate how badly or well it has been performing the required task. These signals are usually associated to a dramatic condition - e.g., accomplishment of a subtask (reward) or complete failure (punishment), and the learner tries to optimize its behavior by using a performance measure (a function of the received reinforcements). The crucial point is that in order to do that, the learner must evaluate the conditions (associations between observed states and chosen actions) that led to rewards or punishments. Starting from basic concepts, this tutorial presents the many flavors of RL algorithms, develops the corresponding mathematical tools, assess their practical limitations and discusses alternatives that have been proposed for applying RL to realistic tasks.

This is a process akin to perceptual organization. We therefore employ the simplicity principle from perceptual organization to propose a simplicity model of unconstrained spontaneous grouping. The simplicity model predicts that people would prefer the categories for a set of novel items that provide the simplest encoding of these items. Classification predictions are derived from the model without information either about the number of categories sought or information about the distributional properties of the objects to be classified. These features of the simplicity model distinguish it from other models in unsupervised categorization (where, for example, the number of categories sought is determined via a free parameter), and we discuss how these computational differences are related to differences in modeling objectives. The predictions of the simplicity model are validated in four experiments. We also discuss the significance of simplicity in cognitive modeling more generally.

J	Brusilovsky, P; Maybury, MT				Brusilovsky, P; Maybury, MT			From adaptive hypermedia to the adaptive web	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM			English	Editorial Material								Web systems suffer from an inability to satisfy the heterogeneous needs of many users. For example, Web courses present the same static learning material to students with widely differing knowledge of the subject. Web e-stores offer the same selection of "featured items" to customers with different needs and preferences. Virtual museums on the Web offer the same "guided tour" to visitors with very different goals and interests. Health information sites present the same information to readers with different health problems. A remedy for the negative effects of the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach is to develop systems with an ability to adapt their behavior to the goals, tasks, interests, and other features of individual users and groups of users. The Adaptive Web is a relatively young research area. Starting with a few pioneering works on adaptive hypertext in early 1990, it now attracts many researchers from different communities such as hypertext, user modeling, machine learning, natural language generation, information retrieval, intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive science, and Web-based education.

J	Chaib-Draa, B; Dignum, F				Chaib-Draa, B; Dignum, F			Trends in agent communication language	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						agent communication language; KQML; FIPA-ACL; semantics; speech acts; conversations		Agent technology is an exciting and important new way to create complex software systems. Agents blend many of the traditional properties of AI programs-knowledge-level reasoning, flexibility, proactiveness, goal-directedness,and so forth-with insights gained from distributed software engineering, machine learning, negotiation and teamwork theory, and the social sciences. An important part of the agent approach is the principle that agents (like humans) can function more effectively in groups that are characterized by cooperation and division of labor. Agent programs are designed to autonomously collaborate with each other in order to satisfy both their internal goals and the shared external demands generated by virtue of their participation in agent societies. This type of collaboration depends on a sophisticated system of inter-agent communication. The assumption that inter-agent communication is best handled through the explicit use of an agent communication language (ACL) underlies each of the articles in this special issue. In this introductory article, we will supply a brief background and introduction to the main topics in agent communication.

Recent innovations that facilitate such comprehensive analyses are highlighted. Several developments enable the study of the relationships between newly derived experimental information, such as biological activity in chemical screens or gene expression studies, and prior information, such as physical descriptors for small molecules or functional annotation for genes. The way in which global analyses can be applied to both chemical screens and transcription profiling experiments using a set of common machine learning tools is discussed.

Most learning approaches derive rules from complete data sets. If some attribute values are unknown in a data set, it is called incomplete. Learning from incomplete data sets is usually more difficult than learning from complete data sets. In the past, the rough-set theory was widely used in dealing with data classification problems. In this paper, we deal with the problem of producing a set of certain and possible rules from incomplete data sets based on rough sets. A new learning algorithm is proposed, which can simultaneously derive rules from incomplete data sets and estimate the missing values in the learning process. Unknown values are first assumed to be any possible values and are gradually refined according to the incomplete lower and upper approximations derived from the given training examples. The examples and the approximations then interact on each other to derive certain and possible rules and to estimate appropriate unknown values. The rules derived can then serve as knowledge concerning the incomplete data set. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Iliadis, LS; Papastavrou, AK; Lefakis, PD				Iliadis, LS; Papastavrou, AK; Lefakis, PD			A computer-system that classifies the prefectures of Greece in forest fire risk zones using fuzzy sets	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						forest fire risk zones expert systems; fuzzy logic; fuzzy sets; fuzzy expected intervals; supervised machine learning; algorithm		All of the Mediterranean countries face a serious forest fire problem. The main factors that affect the problem of forest fires in Greece are vegetation, climate conditions and most of all, arson (Proceedings of Forest Fires in Greece, Thessaloniki, 1990, p. 97). In Greece, after 1974, the number of forest fires and the total burned areas have risen dramatically. The design of an effective fight and prevention policy is a very important matter, as it can minimize the destruction. This paper describes an expert system that classifies the prefectures of Greece into forest fire risk zones, using a completely new methodology. The concept of fuzzy expected intervals (F.E.I.) was defined by Kandel and Byatt (Proc. IEEE, 66, 1978, 1619) and offered a very good approach towards forest fire risk classification. Fuzzy expected intervals are narrow intervals of values that best describe the forest fire problem in the country or a part of the country for a certain time period. Fuzzy logic was applied to produce a F.E.I. for each prefecture of the country. A successful classification of the prefectures of Greece (in forest fire risk zones) was performed by the expert system by comparing the produced fuzzy expected intervals to each other and by using a supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns a certain weight of forest fire risk to each prefecture (Machine Learning, John Wiley and Sons, 1995).

A method is presented that can discover recurrent patterns from multiple flows of events, such as alarms and configuration events, as well as discrete information, such as traffic and usage, taking into account static and dynamic information concerning observed objects and their environments. This method can filter out theoretically useless patterns, using a novel technique for detecting chaos in sequences of events. The prediction accuracy of the discovered patterns has been measured using objects with dynamic behavior controlled by known and complex differential equations. The proposed mining method has been used for discovering and predicting alarms in a computer network composed of several Internet servers taking into account the alarm and configuration events history, as well as static information about these servers.

ACIRD consists of a knowledge acquisition process, document classifier, and two-phase search engine, The knowledge acquisition process of ACIRD automatically learns classification knowledge from classified Internet documents. The document classifier applies learned classification knowledge to classify newly collected Internet documents into one or more classes. Experimental results indicate that ACIRD performs as well or better than human experts in both knowledge acquisition and document classification. By using the learned classification knowledge and the given class lattice, the ACIRD two-phase search engine responds to user queries with hierarchically structured navigable results (instead of a conventional flat ranked document list), which greatly aids users in locating information from numerous, diversified Internet documents.

It is shown that if both this weak dependence is low and the expected margins are large, then decison rules based on linear Combinations of these classifiers can achieve error rates that decrease exponentially fast. Empirical results with randomized trees and trees constructed via boosting and bagging show that weak dependence is present in these type of trees. Furthermore, these results also suggest that there is a trade-off between weak dependence and expected margins, in the sense that to compensate for low expected margins, there should be low mutual dependence between the classifiers involved in the linear combination.

J	Stewart, B				Stewart, B			Predicting project delivery rates using the Naive-Bayes classifier	JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article						software effort estimation; Bayesian networks; machine learning; model trees; neural networks	SOFTWARE	The importance of accurate estimation of software development effort is well recognized in software engineering. In recent years, machine learning approaches have been studied as possible alternatives to more traditional software cost estimation methods. The objective of this paper is to investigate the utility of the machine learning algorithm known as the Naive-Bayes classifier for estimating software project effort. We present empirical experiments with the Benchmark 6 data set from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group to estimate project delivery rates and compare the performance of the Naive-Bayes approach to two other machine learning methods model trees and neural networks. A project delivery rate is defined as the number of effort hours per function point. The approach described is general and can be used to analyse not only software development data but also data on software maintenance and other types of software engineering. The paper demonstrates that the Naive-Bayes classifier has a potential to be used as an alternative machine learning tool for software development effort estimation.

For a long time, biologists gathered these primary structures in large databases. Now, they focus on analyzing these primary structures in order to extract useful knowledge. Data mining approaches can be helpful to reach this goal. In this paper, we present a data mining approach based on machine learning techniques to do classification of biological sequences. By using our approach, we use four steps as follows. (1) In the first step, we construct the set of the discriminant substrings, called discriminant descriptor (DD), associated with each family of primary structures. This construction is made thanks to an adaptation of the Karp, Miller and Rosenberg (KMR) algorithm. (2) In the second step, we use the DDs constructed during the first step to code the families of primary structures by a table of examples vs attributes, called 'context'. (3) In the third step, we extract knowledge from the context constructed during the second step and represent it by production rules. This extraction is made by using an incremental production rules approach. (4) Finally, during the last step, we use the obtained production rules to do classification of primary structures.

J	Galleske, I; Castellanos, J				Galleske, I; Castellanos, J			Optimization of the kernel functions in a probabilistic neural network analyzing the local pattern distribution	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								This article proposes a procedure for the automatic determination of the elements of the covariance matrix of the gaussian kernel function of probabilistic neural networks. Two matrices, a rotation matrix and a matrix of variances, can be calculated by analyzing the local environment of each training pattern. The combination of them will form the covariance matrix of each training pattern. This automation has two advantages: First, it will free the neural network designer from indicating the complete covariance matrix, and second, it will result in a network with better generalization ability than the original model. A variation of the famous two-spiral problem and real-world examples from the UCI Machine Learning Repository will show a classification rate not only better than the original probabilistic neural network but also that this model can outperform other well-known classification techniques.

J	De Stefano, C; Della Cioppa, A; Marcelli, A				De Stefano, C; Della Cioppa, A; Marcelli, A			Learning handwriting by evolution: a conceptual framework for performance evaluation and tuning	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International-Graphonomics-Society Conference (IGS)	JUN 28-30, 1999	SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE	Int Graphon Soc, Nanyang Technol Univ		on-line handwriting recognition; machine learning; evolutionary algorithms; niching methods; performance evaluation	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	In this paper we propose a method for evaluating the performance of an evolutionary learning system aimed at producing the optimal set of prototypes to be used by a handwriting recognition system. The trade-off between generalization and specialization embedded into any learning process is managed by iteratively estimating both consistency and completeness of the prototypes, and by using such an estimate for tuning the learning parameters in order to achieve the best performance with the smallest set of prototypes. Such estimation is based on a characterization of the behavior of the learning system, and is accomplished by means of three performance indices. Both the characterization and the indices do not depend on either the system implementation or the application, and therefore allow for a truly blackbox approach to the performance evaluation of any evolutionary learning system.

J	Sun, Y; Zhu, QM; Chen, ZX				Sun, Y; Zhu, QM; Chen, ZX			An iterative initial-points refinement algorithm for categorical data clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						data clustering; pattern classification; refinement algorithm; data mining	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; EXTENSIONS	The original k-means clustering algorithm is designed to work primarily on numeric data sets. This prohibits the algorithm from being directly applied to categorical data clustering in many data mining applications. The k-modes algorithm [Z. Huang, Clustering large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical value, in: Proceedings of the First Pacific Asia Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Conference. World Scientific, Singapore, 1997, pp. 21-34] extended the k-means paradigm to cluster categorical data by using a frequency-based method to update the cluster modes versus the k-means fashion of minimizing a numerically valued cost. However, as is the case with most data clustering algorithms, the algorithm requires a pre-setting or random selection of initial points (modes) of the clusters. The differences on the initial points often lead to considerable distinct cluster results. In this paper we present an experimental study on applying Bradley and Fayyad's iterative initial-point refinement algorithm to the k-modes clustering to improve the accurate and repetitiveness of the clustering results [cf. P. Bradley, U. Fayyad, Refining initial points for k-mean clustering, in: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, CA, 1998]. Experiments show that the k-modes clustering algorithm using refined initial points leads to higher precision results much more reliably than the random selection method without refinement, thus making the refinement process applicable to many data mining applications with categorical data.

DNA microarrays measure genome-wide gene expression patterns and are an important tool for pharmacogenomic applications, such as the identification of molecular targets for drugs, toxicological studies and molecular diagnostics. Genome-wide investigations generate vast amounts of data and there is a need for computational methods to manage and analyze this information. Recently, several supervised methods, in which other information is utilized together with gene expression data, have been used to characterize genes and samples. The choice of analysis methods will influence the results and their interpretation, therefore it is important to be familiar with each method, its scope and limitations. Here, methods with special reference to applications for pharmacogenomics are reviewed.

Many of the input variables may be correlated, and it is therefore often desirable to select an optimal subset of the input variables that results in the most predictive model. In this paper we describe an optimization technique for variable selection based on artificial ant colony systems. The algorithm is inspired by the behavior of real ants, which are able to find the shortest path between a food source and their nest using deposits of pheromone as a communication agent. The underlying basic self-organizing principle is exploited for the construction of parsimonious QSAR models based on neural networks for several classical QSAR data sets.	3 Dimens Pharmaceut Inc, Exton, PA 19341 USA	Izrailev, S (reprint author), 3 Dimens Pharmaceut Inc, 665 Stockton Dr, Exton, PA 19341 USA.

J	Holmes, JH; Lanzi, PL; Stolzmann, W; Wilson, SW				Holmes, JH; Lanzi, PL; Stolzmann, W; Wilson, SW			Learning classifier systems: New models, successful applications	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						classifier systems; robotics; data mining; generalization; internal models; complexity		Rules are an accepted means of representing knowledge for virtually every domain. Traditional machine learning methods derive rules by exploring sets of examples using statistical or information theoretic techniques. Alternatively, rules can be discovered through methods of Evolutionary Computation such as genetic algorithms and learning classifier systems. In recent years, new models of learning classifier systems have been developed which have resulted in successful applications in a wide variety of domains (e.g., autonomous robotics, classification, knowledge discovery, modeling). These models have led to a resurgence of this area which for a certain period appeared almost at a dead end. This paper overviews the recent developments in learning classifier systems research, the new models, and the most interesting applications, suggesting some of the most relevant future research directions.

In this paper, we introduce GBI for general graph structured data, which can handle directed/undirected, colored/uncolored graphs with/without (self) loop and with colored/uncolored links. We show that its time complexity is almost linear with the size of graph. We, further, show that GBI can effectively be applied to the extraction of typical patterns from DNA sequence data and organochlorine compound data from which are to be generated classification rules, and that GBI also works as a feature construction component for other machine learning tools.

The user can tailor the presentation of the search results to his or her preferences by changing the settings of various parameters on the screen. In this paper, we report on a prototype implementation of a user profiling device that learns to predict appropriate settings for these parameters for the current search results based on previous experiences. In a preliminary study, we evaluated several off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms on parts of the problem. The final implementation required the flexibility of handling both regression and classification problems, being able to deal with set-valued input and output attributes, as well as incorporating Melvil's ontologies for the respective application domain. Thus, we selected a nearest-neighbor approach for the prototype implementation. An evaluation on off-line data collected from several users showed a satisfactory performance.

The program automatically identifies morphological relations in a small word-based lexicon, literally learning its morphology, and uses the knowledge it acquires to generate new words. It is based on a model of the mental lexicon in which all entries are whole, entire, fully fledged words and relies solely on basic cognitive principles (differentiation and generalization) for the automatic acquisition of morphological relations and the population of the lexicon.

J	Malyscheff, AM; Trafalis, TB; Raman, S				Malyscheff, AM; Trafalis, TB; Raman, S			From support vector machine learning to the determination of the minimum enclosing zone	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						coordinate metrology; support vector machines; optimization; minimum enclosing zone	FLATNESS	The verification of form tolerances requires the determination of the minimum enclosing zone according to the ANSI Y14.5M National Standard on Dimensioning and Tolerancing. However, to date many coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) still employ the least-squares method, which has the economic disadvantage of sometimes rejecting good parts. Support vector machines represent a new approach in the area of machine learning, which has been implemented successfully in pattern recognition and regression estimation problems. This article outlines, how the support vector algorithm, as used in classification problems, can be modified in order to identify the minimum enclosing zone for straightness and flatness tolerances. A gradient ascent approach is proposed to identify the solution of the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results for evaluating the minimum enclosing zone suggest rather promising properties of the employed gradient ascent method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adaptive and standard versions of the two algorithms are used to solve novel applications in search and rule extraction. Simulations and analysis show that while both algorithms may look similar in many ways their performance may differ for some applications. Mathematical modeling helps in gaining better understanding for GA and EP applications. Proper tuning and loading is a key for acceptable results. The ability to instantly adapt within an unpredictable and unstable search or learning environment is the most important feature of evolution-based techniques such as GAs and EP.

J	Inagaki, Y				Inagaki, Y			On synchronized evolution of the network of automata	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						evolutionary programming; finite automaton; genetic algorithm; genetic programming; sequence prediction problem		One of the tasks in machine learning is to build a device that predicts each next input symbol of a sequence as it takes one input symbol from the sequence. We studied new approaches to this task. We suggest that deterministic finite automata (DFA) are good building blocks for this device together with genetic algorithms (GAs), which let these automata "evolve" to predict each next input symbol of the sequence. Moreover, we studied how to combine these highly fit automata so that a network of them would compensate for each others' weaknesses and predict better than any single automaton. We studied the simplest approaches to combine automata: building trees of automata with special-purpose automata, which may be called switchboards. These switchboard automata are located on the internal nodes of the tree, take an input symbol from the input sequence just as do other automata, and predict which subtree will make a correct prediction on each next input symbol. GAs again play a crucial role in searching for switchboard automata. We studied various ways of growing trees of automata and tested them on sample input sequences, mainly note pitches, note duration, and up/down notes of Bach's Fugue IX. The test results show that DFAs together with GAs seem to be very effective for this type of pattern learning task.

It presents a domain-related structuring of the representation and incorporation of semantic restrictions for GP-based search of trading decision models. A defined symmetry property provides a basis for the semantics of FX trading models. The symmetry properties of basic indicator types useful in formulating trading models are defined, together with semantic restrictions governing their use in trading model specification. The semantics for trading model specification have been defined with respect to regular arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. This study also explores the use of two fitness criteria for optimization, showing more robust performance with a risk-adjusted measure of returns.

J	Huang, HJ; Hsu, CN				Huang, HJ; Hsu, CN			Bayesian classification for data from the same unknown class	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						classification; machine learning; naive Bayes classifier; speaker recognition		In this paper, we address the problem of how to classify a set of query vectors that belong to the same unknown class. Sets of data known to be sampled from the same class are naturally available in many application domains, such as speaker recognition. We refer to these sets as homologous sets. We show how to take advantage of homologous sets in classification to obtain improved accuracy over classifying each query vector individually. Our method, called homologous naive Bayes (HNB), is based on the naive Bayes classifier, a simple algorithm shown to be effective in many application domains. HNB uses a modified classification procedure that classifies multiple instances as a single unit. Compared with a voting method and several other variants of naive Bayes classification, HNB significantly outperforms these methods in a variety of test data sets, even when the number of query vectors in the homologous sets is small. We also report a successful application of HNB to speaker recognition. Experimental results show that HNB can achieve classification accuracy comparable to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the most widely used speaker recognition approach, while using less time for both training and classification.

The decisions of these rules can be straight-forwardly explained as the conclusions drawn by a case-based reasoner. Our system is named FAN, an acronym for finding accurate inductions. It starts from a collection of training examples and produces propositional rules able to classify unseen cases following a minimum-distance criterion in their evaluation procedure. In this way, we combine the advantages of instance-based algorithms and the conciseness of rule (or decision-tree) inducers, The algorithm followed by FAN can be seen as the result of successive steps of pruning heuristics. The main tool employed is that of the impurity level, a measure of the classification quality of a rule, inspired by a similar measure used in IB3. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted with standard benchmark datasets of the UCI repository to test the performance of our system, successfully comparing FAN with a wide collection of machine-learning algorithms.

J	Van der Merwe, FJ; Kourie, DG				Van der Merwe, FJ; Kourie, DG			Compressed pseudo-lattices	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Concept Lattice-Based Theory, Methods and Tools for KDD	JUL, 2001	STANFORD, CA		STANFORD UNIV	sublattice; compressed pseudo-lattice; concept removal; intent representative operations		This paper introduces the notion of a compressed pseudo-lattice and suggests its use as a data structure in areas of application related to Formal Concept Analysis. It is closely related to the line diagram of a lattice and its use as a computational tool in applications such as machine learning, information retrieval and knowledge discovery in databases is discussed. The data structure-essentially a bipartite graph that incorporates an embedded sublattice-combines desirable features of concept lattices in a structure that allows for a flexible mechanism of scaling the size of the embedded sublattice, using defined operations that compress and expand it by removing or adding atoms and coatoms. A compressed pseudo-lattice essentially represents a complete sublattice from which a number of atoms and/or coatoms have been removed. Additionally the relation of the sublattice to the context from which it was derived is preserved. An application-dependent compression strategy or criterion is required to guide this process. The intent operations of a lattice are defined as substitutes for the infimum and supremum operations in compressed pseudo-lattices. It is argued that the removal of concepts from a concept lattice may hold advantages over traditional approaches.

This model exploits a statistical test of relative certainty gain, used in a forward selection algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show that the MST can be replaced by the 1 nearest-neighbor graph without challenging the statistical framework. This leads to a feature selection algorithm belonging to a new category of hybrid models (filter-wrapper). Experimental results on readily available synthetic and natural domains are presented and discussed. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Along with these advances has come a need for automated methods of determining which compounds from a library should be synthesized and screened. These methods range from simple counting schemes to sophisticated machine learning techniques such as neural networks. While many of these methods have performed well in validation studies, the field is still in its formative stage. This paper reviews a number of computational techniques for identifying drug-like molecules and examines challenges facing the field. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we report the first proteome-scale analysis of protein localization within any eukaryote. Using directed topoisomerase I-mediated cloning strategies and genome-wide transposon mutagenesis, we have epitope-tagged 60% of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. By high-throughput immunolocalization of tagged gene products, we have determined the subcellular localization of 2744 yeast proteins. Extrapolating these data through a computational algorithm employing Bayesian formalism, we define the yeast localizome (the subcellular distribution of all 6100 yeast proteins). We estimate the yeast proteome to encompass -5100 soluble proteins and >1000 transmembrane proteins. Our results indicate that 47% of yeast proteins are cytoplasmic, 13% mitochondrial, 13% exocytic (including proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles), and 27% nuclear/nucleolar. A subset of nuclear proteins was further analyzed by immunolocalization using surface-spread preparations of meiotic chromosomes. Of these proteins, 38% were found associated with chromosomal DNA. As determined from phenotypic analyses of nuclear proteins, 34% are essential for spore viability-a percentage nearly twice as great as that observed for the proteome as a whole. In total, this study presents experimentally derived localization data for 955 proteins of previously unknown function: nearly half of all functionally uncharacterized proteins in yeast. To facilitate access to these data, we provide a searchable database featuring 2900 fluorescent micrographs at http://ygae.med.yale.edu.

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.

J	Zhang, JNJ				Zhang, JNJ			Introducing IVSA: A new concept learning algorithm	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; iterated version space learning; concept learning; over-fitting		The iterated version space algorithm (IVSA) has been designed and implemented to learn disjunctive concepts that have multiple classes. Unlike a traditional version space algorithm, IVSA first locates the critical attribute values using a statistical approach and then generates the base hypothesis set that describes the most significant features of the target concept. With the base hypothesis, IVSA continues to learn less significant and more specific hypothesis sets until the system is satisfied with its own performance. During the process of expanding its hypothesis space, IVSA dynamically partitions the search space of potential hypotheses of the target concept into contour-shaped regions until all training instances are maximally correctly classified. Over-fitting is not a problem for IVSA because it does not generate over-fitted candidate hypotheses during the learning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Leigh, W; Purvis, R; Ragusa, JM				Leigh, W; Purvis, R; Ragusa, JM			Forecasting the NYSE composite index with technical analysis, pattern recognizer, neural network, and genetic algorithm: a case study in romantic decision support	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						technical analysis; neural networks; forecasting; genetic algorithms; pattern recognition; heuristics; financial decision support; market efficiency	MARKETS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTIONS; SELECTION; DOMAINS; TIME	The 21st century is seeing technological advances that make it possible to build more robust and sophisticated decision support systems than ever before. But the effectiveness of these systems may be limited if we do not consider more eclectic (or romantic) options. This paper exemplifies the potential that lies in the novel application and combination of methods, in this case to evaluating stock market purchasing opportunities using the "technical analysis" school of stock market prediction. Members of the technical analysis school predict market prices and movements based on the dynamics of market price and volume, rather than on economic fundamentals such as earnings and market share. The results of this paper support the effectiveness of the technical analysis approach through use of the "bull flag" price and volume pattern heuristic. The romantic approach to decision support exemplified in this paper is made possible by the recent development of: (1) high-performance desktop computing, (2) the methods and techniques of machine learning and soft computing, including neural networks and genetic algorithms, and (3) approaches recently developed that combine diverse classification and forecasting systems. The contribution of this paper lies in the novel application and combination of the decision-making methods and in the nature and superior quality of the results achieved.

J	Boccorh, RK; Paterson, A				Boccorh, RK; Paterson, A			An artificial neural network model for predicting flavour intensity in blackcurrant concentrates	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						blackcurrant; artificial neural networks; multivariate statistical analyses; flavour modelling; fruit flavour	TRIGLYCERIDE COMPOSITION; PLS; REGRESSION	Artificial neural networks (ANNs)-machine learning acquiring knowledge in training and using deduced relationships to predict responses - were studied to rationalise concentrate use in fruit drinks production. Sets of ANNs were developed for predicting flavour intensity in blackcurrant concentrates from gas chromatographic data on flavour components (37) in 133 sorbent extracts from blackcurrant concentrates varying in season, geographical origin and processing technology. Sensory data was collected using ratio scaling on flavour intensities in drinks from concentrates. Relationships between chromatographic and sensory data for concentrates of three seasons (1989, 1990 and 1992) were modelled by ANNs with back propagation using principal component regression scores as input. Predictions were compared with a global model from random concentrates from all three seasons. In predicting overall flavour intensity, ANN models were better fitted than partial least square regression. Ability of artificial neural networks to simulate non-linear relationships observed in human perceptions could explain such improvements. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Down, TA; Hubbard, TJP				Down, TA; Hubbard, TJP			Computational detection and location of transcription start sites in mammalian genomic DNA	GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							PROMOTER SEQUENCES; RECOGNITION	Transcription, the process whereby RNA copies are made from sections of the DNA genome, is directed by promoter regions. These define the transcription start site, and also the set of cellular conditions under which the promoter is active. At least in more complex species, it appears to be common for genes to have several different transcription start sites, which may be active under different conditions. Eukaryotic promoters are complex and fairly diffuse structures, which have proven hard to detect in sillco. We show that a novel hybrid machine-learning method is able to build useful models of promoters for >50% of human transcription start sites. We estimate specificity to be >70%, and demonstrate good positional accuracy. Based on the structure of our learned models, we conclude that a signal resembling the well known TATA box, together with flanking regions of C-G enrichment, are the most important sequence-based signals marking sites of transcriptional initiation at a large class of typical promoters.

J	Fritsche, HA				Fritsche, HA			Tumor markers and pattern recognition analysis: A new diagnostic tool for cancer	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LIGAND ASSAY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Tumor Markers - New Era	MAR 02-06, 2001	SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA			neural network; support vector machine; pattern recognition; prostate cancer detection; breast cancer	PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; 4.0 NG/ML; MEN	Pattern recognition analysis refers to the use of computer derived algorithms to identify complex relationships between input variables that will define a particular clinical status. Input variables can consist of blood analyte concentrations, clinical parameters such as symptoms, and digitized x-ray or ultrasound images. Thus, the pattern recognition tool is the basis for a new approach to diagnostic testing. In non-supervised machine learning, subjects are grouped into specific disease states on the basis of similarity of input variables. In supervised learning, the computer derived algorithm is trained with data from known classes of subjects with the goal of recognizing a specific disease state. The artificial neural network (ANN) is currently the most widely used method for pattern recognition, but the support vector machine (SVM) is the most recent advance in this field. Unlike the neural network, the SVM is not limited by the number of input parameters, is not subject to training errors, and guarantees a best solution. Both of these pattern recognition methods are under investigation as diagnostic approaches for early cancer detection and for use in the clinical management of cancer patients.

J	Chen, CC; Chen, MC; Sun, Y				Chen, CC; Chen, MC; Sun, Y			PVA: A self-adaptive personal view agent	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; automatic classification; personalization; agent; WWW		In this paper, we present PVA, an adaptive personal view information agent system for tracking, learning and managing user interests in Internet documents. PVA consists of three parts: a proxy, personal view constructor, and personal view maintainer. The proxy logs the user's activities and extracts the user's interests without user intervention. The personal view constructor mines user interests and maps them to a class hierarchy (i.e., personal view). The personal view maintainer synchronizes user interests and the personal view periodically. When user interests change, in PVA, not only the contents, but also the structure of the user profile are modified to adapt to the changes.

J	Yang, YM; Slattery, S; Ghani, R				Yang, YM; Slattery, S; Ghani, R			A study of approaches to hypertext categorization	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						hypertext classification; machine learning; web mining; text mining	TEXT	Hypertext poses new research challenges for text classification. Hyperlinks, HTML tags, category labels distributed over linked documents, and meta data extracted from related Web sites all provide rich information for classifying hypertext documents. How to appropriately represent that information and automatically learn statistical patterns for solving hypertext classification problems is an open question. This paper seeks a principled approach to providing the answers. Specifically, we define five hypertext regularities which may (or may not) hold in a particular application domain, and whose presence (or absence) may significantly influence the optimal design of a classifier. Using three hypertext datasets and three well-known learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and First Order Inductive Learner), we examine these regularities in different domains, and compare alternative ways to exploit them. Our results show that the identification of hypertext regularities in the data and the selection of appropriate representations for hypertext in particular domains are crucial, but seldom obvious, in real-world problems. We find that adding the words in the linked neighborhood to the page having those links (both inlinks and outlinks) were helpful for all our classifiers on one data set, but more harmful than helpful for two out of the three classifiers on the remaining datasets. We also observed that extracting meta data from related Web sites was extremely useful for improving classification accuracy in some of those domains. Finally, the relative performance of the classifiers being tested provided insights into their strengths and limitations for solving classification problems involving diverse and often noisy Web pages.

Indeed, kernels are positive definite functions and thus also covariances. After discussing key properties of kernels, as well as a new formula to construct kernels, we present several important classes of kernels: anisotropic stationary kernels, isotropic stationary kernels, compactly supported kernels, locally stationary kernels, nonstationary kernels, and separable nonstationary kernels. Compactly supported kernels and separable nonstationary kernels are of prime interest because they provide a computational reduction for kernel-based methods. We describe the spectral representation of the various classes of kernels and conclude with a discussion on the characterization of nonlinear maps that reduce nonstationary kernels to either stationarity or local stationarity.

By allowing the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the molecular variations among tumors and hence to a finer and more informative classification. The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification. This article compares the performance of different discrimination methods for the classification of tumors based on gene expression data. The methods include nearest-neighbor classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees. Recent machine learning approaches, such as bagging and boosting, are also considered. The discrimination methods are applied to datasets from three recently published cancer gene expression studies.

J	Ari, B; Guvenir, HA				Ari, B; Guvenir, HA			Clustered linear regression	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering linear regression; machine learning algorithm; eager approach		Clustered linear regression (CLR) is a new machine learning algorithm that improves the accuracy of classical linear regression by partitioning training space into subspaces. CLR makes some assumptions about the domain and the data set. Firstly, target value is assumed to be a function of feature values. Second assumption is that there axe some linear approximations for this function in each subspace. Finally, there are enough training instances to determine subspaces and their linear approximations successfully. Tests indicate that if these approximations hold, CLR outperforms all other well-known machine-learning algorithms. Partitioning may continue until linear approximation fits all the instances in the training set-that generally occurs when the number of instances in the subspace is less than or equal to the number of features plus one. In other case, each new subspace will have a better fitting linear approximation. However, this will cause over fitting and gives less accurate results for the test instances. The stopping situation can be determined as no significant decrease or an increase in relative error. CLR uses a small portion of the training instances to determine the number of subspaces. The necessity of high number of training instances makes this algorithm suitable for data mining applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Several studies suggest that aberrant methylation occurs in a tumour type-specific manner. However, large-scale analysis of candidate genes has so far been hampered by the lack of high throughput assays for methylation detection. We have developed the first microarray-based technique which allows genome-wide assessment of selected CpG dinucleotides as well as quantification of methylation at each site. Several hundred CpG sites were screened in 76 samples from four different human tumour types and corresponding healthy controls. Discriminative CpG dinucleotides were identified for different tissue type distinctions and used to predict the tumour class of as yet unknown samples with high accuracy using machine learning techniques. Some CpG dinucleotides correlate with progression to malignancy, whereas others are methylated in a tissue-specific manner independent of malignancy. Our results demonstrate that genome-wide analysis of methylation patterns combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques constitute a powerful novel tool to classify human cancers.

J	Borra, S; Di Ciaccio, A				Borra, S; Di Ciaccio, A			Improving nonparametric regression methods by bagging and boosting	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting on Nonlinear Methods and data Mining_(NMDM2000)	SEP 25-26, 2000	ROME, ITALY			nonparametric regression; DART; MARS; PPR; bagging; boosting	DECISION	Recently, many authors have proposed new algorithms to improve the accuracy of certain classifiers by assembling a collection of individual classifiers obtained resampling on the training sample. Bagging and boosting are well-known methods in the machine learning context and they have been proved to be successful in classification problems. In the regression context, the application of these techniques has received little investigation. Our aim is to analyse, by simulation studies, when boosting and bagging can reduce the training set error and the generalization error, using nonparametric regression methods as predictors, In this work, we will consider three methods: projection pursuit regression (PPR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), local learning based on recursive covering (DART).

J	Pan, KH; Lih, CJ; Cohen, SN				Pan, KH; Lih, CJ; Cohen, SN			Analysis of DNA microarrays using algorithms that employ rule-based expert knowledge	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						GABRIEL; machine learning	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; 3T3 CELLS; C-FOS; FIBROBLASTS; CONSULTANT; PROGRAM	The ability to investigate the transcription of thousands of genes concurrently by using DNA microarrays offers both major scientific opportunities and significant analytical challenges. Here we describe GABRIEL, a rule-based system of computer programs designed to apply domain-specific and procedural knowledge systematically and uniformly for the analysis and interpretation of data from DNA microarrays. GABRIEL'S problem-solving rules direct stereotypical tasks, whereas domain-specific knowledge pertains to gene functions and relationships or to experimental conditions. Additionally, GABRIEL can learn novel rules through genetic algorithms, which define patterns that best match the data being analyzed and can identify groupings in gene expression profiles preordered by chromosomal position or by a nonsupervised algorithm such as hierarchical clustering. GABRIEL subsystems explain the logic that underlies conclusions and provide a graphical interface and interactive platform for the acquisition of new knowledge. The present report compares GABRIEL'S output with published findings in which expert knowledge has been applied post hoc to microarray groupings generated by hierarchical clustering.

J	Helmer, G; Wong, JSK; Honavar, V; Miller, L				Helmer, G; Wong, JSK; Honavar, V; Miller, L			Automated discovery of concise predictive rules for intrusion detection	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						intrusion detection; machine learning; feature subset selection	COMPUTER	This paper details an essential component of a multi-agent distributed knowledge network system for intrusion detection. We describe a distributed intrusion detection architecture, complete with a data warehouse and mobile and stationary agents for distributed problem-solving to facilitate building, monitoring, and analyzing global, spatio-temporal views of intrusions on large distributed systems. An agent for the intrusion detection system, which uses a machine learning approach to automated discovery of concise rules from system call traces, is described. We use a feature vector representation to describe the system calls executed by privileged processes. The feature vectors are labeled as good or bad depending on whether or not they were executed during an observed attack. A rule learning algorithm is then used to induce rules that can be used to monitor the system and detect potential intrusions. We study the performance of the rule learning algorithm on this task with and without feature subset selection using a genetic algorithm. Feature subset selection is shown to significantly reduce the number of features used while improving the accuracy of predictions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This is achieved by a DNA analysis technique (genotyping), called spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping). In this paper, we investigated data analysis methods to discover intelligible knowledge rules from spoligotyping, that has not yet been applied on such representation. This processing was achieved by applying the C4.5 induction algorithm and knowledge rules were produced. Finally, a Prototype Selection (PS) procedure was applied to eliminate noisy data. This both simplified decision rules, as well as the number of spacers to be tested to solve classification tasks. In the second part of this paper, the contribution of 25 new additional spacers and the knowledge rules inferred were studied from a machine learning point of view. From a statistical point of view, the correlations between spacers were analyzed and suggested that both negative and positive ones may be related to potential structural constraints within the DR locus that may shape its evolution directly or indirectly. Results: By generating knowledge rules induced from decision trees, it was shown that not only the expert knowledge may be modeled but also improved and simplified to solve automatic classification tasks on unknown patterns. A practical consequence of this study may be a simplification of the spoligotyping technique, resulting in a reduction of the experimental constraints and an increase in the number of samples processed.

J	Azuaje, F				Azuaje, F			Advancing post-genome data and system integration through machine learning	COMPARATIVE AND FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS			English	Article						intelligent data integration; artificial intelligence; semantic web; post-genome bioinformatics		Research on biological data integration has traditionally focused on the development of systems for the maintenance and interconnection of databases. In the next few years, public and private biotechnology organisations will expand their actions to promote the creation of a post-genome semantic web. It has commonly been accepted that artificial intelligence and data mining techniques may support the interpretation of huge amounts of integrated data. But at the same time, these research disciplines are contributing to the creation of content markup languages and sophisticated programs able to exploit the constraints and preferences of user domains.

The support vector machine method is performed based on the database derived from SCOP which is based upon domains of known structure and the evolutionary relationships and the principles that govern their 3D structure. As a result, high rates of both self-consistency and jackknife test are obtained. This indicates that the structural class of a protein inconsiderably correlated with its amino acid composition, and the support vector machine can be referred as a powerful computational tool for predicting the structural classes of proteins.

J	Almeida, JS				Almeida, JS			Predictive non-linear modeling of complex data by artificial neural networks	CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review							RECOGNITION; SEQUENCES	An artificial neural network (ANN) is an artificial intelligence tool that identifies arbitrary nonlinear multiparametric discriminant functions directly from experimental data. The use of ANNs has gained increasing popularity for applications where a mechanistic description of the dependency between dependent and independent variables is either unknown or very complex. This machine learning technique can be roughly described as a universal algebraic function that will distinguish signal from noise directly from experimental data. The application of ANNs to complex relationships makes them highly attractive for the study of biological systems. Recent applications include the analysis of expression profiles and genomic and proteomic sequences.

J	Stockwell, DRB; Peterson, AT				Stockwell, DRB; Peterson, AT			Effects of sample size on accuracy of species distribution models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						ecological niche; species distribution; GARP; sample size	WILDLIFE HABITAT; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; BIODIVERSITY; ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION; SPECIMENS; BIRDS; WEB; LBS	Given increasing access to large amounts of biodiversity information, a powerful capability is that of modeling ecological niches and predicting geographic distributions. Because, sampling species' distributions is costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90% of maximum within ten sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic distribution was the only significant ecological factor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ong, YS; Keane, AJ				Ong, YS; Keane, AJ			A domain knowledge based search advisor for design problem solving environments	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						domain knowledge base; optimization; engineering design exploration; knowledge modelling methodology	MACHINE	This paper proposes an automatic and adaptive Domain Knowledge Based (DKB) Search Advisor for use with Design Exploration Systems (DES)-a form of design Problem Solving Environment (PSE). The advisor contains domain knowledge of search routine performance on design problems built using a knowledge modelling methodology. These help designers working on complex engineering problems to decrease the cost of design-space search and improve the quality of the resulting designs. This paper introduces this field, beginning with a view of some of the problems and inefficiencies of present design processes. This is followed by the description of a knowledge modelling methodology that may be used to build knowledge models of search routine performance on design domains. One focus of the paper is the use of machine learning to automate the process of knowledge discovery. The practicability of the DKB Search Advisor is then demonstrated with a case study taken from the aircraft wing design domain. The results presented help provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various optimization routines. More importantly, they also illustrate that an advisor containing knowledge of search routine performance on design domains can support design engineers in their search activities. The Search Advisor helps to decrease the cost of aircraft wing design search while at the same time increasing the quality of the resulting designs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Klopotek, MA				Klopotek, MA			A new Bayesian tree learning method with reduced time and space complexity	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						machine learning; Bayesian networks; Chow/Liu algorithm; time and space complexity		Bayesian networks have many practical applications due to their capability to represent joint probability distribution in many variables in a compact way. There exist efficient reasoning methods for Bayesian networks. Many algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from empirical data have been developed. A well-known problem with Bayesian networks is the practical limitation for the number of variables for which a Bayesian network can be learned in reasonable time. A remarkable exception here is the Chow/Liu algorithm for learning tree-like Bayesian networks. However, its quadratic time and space complexity in the number of variables may prove also prohibitive for high dimensional data. The paper presents a novel algorithm overcoming this limitation for the tree-like class of Bayesian networks. The new algorithm space consumption grows linearly with the number of variables n while the execution time is proportional to n . ln(n), hence both are better than those of Chow/Liu algorithm.

The basic idea is to first map the input space into a feature space via nonlinear mapping and then compute the principal components in that feature space. This letter adopts the kernel PCA as a mechanism for extracting facial features. Through adopting a polynomial kernel, the principal components can be computed within the space spanned by high-order correlations of input pixels making up a facial image, thereby producing a good performance.

Since only the structure of the data dictates the grouping (unsupervised learning), information theory is an obvious criteria to establish the clustering rule. This paper describes a novel valley seeking clustering algorithm using an information theoretic measure to estimate the cost of partitioning the data set The information theoretic criteria developed here evolved from a Renyi's entropy estimator that was proposed recently and has been successfully applied to other machine learning applications. An improved version of the k-change algorithm is used in optimization because of the stepwise nature of the cost function and existence of local minima. Even when applied to nonlinearly separable data, the new algorithm performs well, and was able to find nonlinear boundaries between clusters. The algorithm is also applied to the segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI) with very promising results.

J	Rueda, L; Oommen, BJ				Rueda, L; Oommen, BJ			On optimal pairwise linear classifiers for normal distributions: The two-dimensional case	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						pattern classification; statistical pattern recognition; optimal Bayesian classification; linear classifiers	STATISTICAL CLASSIFIERS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; SINGLE NEURON; SAMPLE-SIZE; EVOLUTION	Optimal Bayesian linear classifiers have been studied in the literature for many decades. In this paper, we demonstrate that all the known results consider only the scenario when the quadratic polynomial has coincident roots. Indeed, we present a complete analysis of the case when the optimal classifier between two normally distributed classes is pairwise and linear. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work for the use of such classifiers in any area of statistical Pattern Recognition (PR). We shall focus on some special cases of the normal distribution with nonequal covariance matrices. We determine the conditions that the mean vectors and covariance matrices have to satisfy in order to obtain the optimal pairwise linear classifier. As opposed to the state of the art, in all the cases discussed here, the linear classifier is given by a pair of straight lines, which is a particular case of the general equation of second degree. One of these cases is when we have two overlapping classes with equal means, which resolves the general case of the Minsky's paradox for the perceptron, We have also provided some empirical results, using synthetic data for the Minsky's paradox case, and demonstrated that the linear classifier achieves very good performance. Finally, we have tested our approach on real life data obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The empirical results that we obtained show the superiority of our scheme over the traditional Fisher's discriminant classifier.

J	Braha, D; Shmilovici, A				Braha, D; Shmilovici, A			Data mining for improving a cleaning process in the semiconductor industry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						composite classifiers; data mining; laser cleaning; machine learning	YIELD	As device geometry continues to shrink, micro-contaminants have an increasingly negative impact on yield. By diminishing the contamination problem, semiconductor manufacturers will significantly improve the wafer yield. This paper presents a comprehensive and successful application of data mining methodologies to the refinement of a new dry cleaning technology that utilizes a laser beam for the removal of micro-contaminants. Experiments with three classification-based data mining methods (decision tree induction, neural networks, and composite classifiers) have been conducted. The composite classifier architecture has been shown to yield higher accuracy than the accuracy of each individual classifier on its own. The paper suggests that data mining methodologies may be particularly useful when data is scarce, and the various physical and chemical parameters that affect the process exhibit highly complex interactions. Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the cleaning process using data mining may be highly effective.

J	Kim, KI; Kim, JH; Jung, K				Kim, KI; Kim, JH; Jung, K			Face recognition using support vector machines with local correlation kernels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						support vector machines; face recognition; machine learning; image classification; feature extraction; pattern recognition	TEMPLATES	This paper presents a real-time face recognition system. For the system to be real time, no external time-consuming feature extraction method is used, rather the gray-level values of the raw pixels that make up the face pattern are fed directly to the recognizer. In order to absorb the resulting high dimensionality of the input space, support vector machines (SVMs), which are known to work well even in high-dimensional space, are used as the face recognizer. Furthermore, a modified form of polynomial kernel (local correlation kernel) is utilized to take account of prior knowledge about facial structures and is used as the alternative feature extractor. Since SVMs were originally developed for two-class classification, their basic scheme is extended for multiface recognition by adopting one-per-class decomposition. In order to make a final classification from several one-per-class SVM outputs, a neural network (NN) is used as the arbitrator. Experiments with ORL database show a recognition rate of 97.9% and speed of 0.22 seconds per face with 40 classes.

It was found competitive with the best available machine learning algorithms in classifying high-dimensional data sets. This paper gives an introduction to the theoretical development of the SVM and an experimental evaluation of its accuracy, stability and training speed in deriving land cover classifications from satellite images. The SVM was compared to three other popular classifiers, including the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), neural network classifiers (NNC) and decision tree classifiers (DTC).

J	Felix, R; Ushio, T				Felix, R; Ushio, T			Binary encoding of discernibility patterns to find minimal coverings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						discernibility patterns; minimal coverings; rough set; uncertainty	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; RULES	Rough set based methods have been applied successfully in many real world applications such as data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning, and control. The rough set theory is used to deal with imperfect data and to eliminate dispensable, superfluous and redundant information as to obtain a simplified set of decision rules. Thus, several approaches and methods have been proposed to find minimal coverings, from which the decision rules can be induced. In many of these approaches, an improvement in the utilization of computational resources is encouraged. In this paper, a binary encoding for attribute sets and a discernibility matrix is proposed. Such a binary representation of sets and sets operations in the implementation of algorithms provides a machine-oriented approach to the utilization of computational memory and allow parallel processing among groups of attributes. The discernibility matrix is reduced to its minimal size through the identification of main patterns in order to eliminate redundancies. Bit-wise operations replace sets operations, thus the search for minimal coverings is performed in an efficient way. Resulting improvement is shown in the analysis of medium-sized data sets using two generic methods to obtain minimal coverings.

LSA induces a high-dimensional semantic space from reading a very large amount of texts. The meaning of words and texts can be represented as vectors in this space and hence can be compared automatically and objectively. Psychological theory: A generative theory of the mental lexicon based on LSA is described. The word vectors LSA constructs are context free, and each word, irrespective of how many meanings or senses it has, is represented by a single vector. However, when a word is used in different contexts, context appropriate word senses emerge. Current applications: Several applications of LSA to educational software are described, involving the ability of LSA to quickly compare the content of texts, such as an essay written by a student and a target essay. Potential medical applications: An LSA-based software tool is sketched for machine grading of clinical case summaries written by medical students. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Liong, SY; Sivapragasam, C				Liong, SY; Sivapragasam, C			Flood stage forecasting with support vector machines	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						structural risk minimization; support vector machines; flood forecasting; neural networks		Machine learning techniques are finding more and more applications in the field of forecasting. A novel regression technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this study. SVM is based on the principle of Structural Risk Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization espoused by conventional regression techniques. The flood data at Dhaka, Bangladesh, are used in this study to demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of SVM. The result is compared with that of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model for one-lead day to seven-lead day forecasting. The improvements in maximum predicted water level errors by SVM over ANN for four-lead day to seven-lead day are 9.6 cm, 22.6 cm, 4.9 cm and 15.7 cm, respectively. The result shows that the prediction accuracy of SVM is at least as good as and in some cases (particularly at higher lead days) actually better than that of ANN, yet it offers advantages over many of the limitations of ANN, for example in arriving at ANN's optimal network architecture and choosing useful training set. Thus, SVM appears to be a very promising prediction tool.

J	Meidan, A; Levin, B				Meidan, A; Levin, B			Choosing from competing theories in computerised learning	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article								In this paper we refer to a machine learning method that reveals all the if-then rules in the data, and on the basis of these rules issues predictions for new cases. When issuing predictions this method faces the problem of choosing from competing theories. We dealt with this problem by calculating the probability that the rule is accidental. The lower this probability, the more the rule can be 'trusted' when issuing predictions. The method was tested empirically and found to be accurate. On a broader scope this approach demonstrates how the dialog between researchers in machine learning and the philosophy of science can be beneficial for both sides.

Application to thermolysin inhibitors and glycogen phosphorylase b inhibitors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GLUCOSE ANALOG INHIBITORS; TRANSITION-STATE ANALOGS; GOLPE VARIABLE SELECTION; X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; GRID FORCE-FIELD; DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; DIPEPTIDE INHIBITORS; CONVERTING ENZYME; 4D-QSAR ANALYSIS; NEURAL NETWORKS	A key problem in QSAR is the selection of appropriate descriptors to form accurate regression equations for the compounds under study. Inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithms are a class of machine-learning algorithms that have been successfully applied to a number of SAR problems. Unlike other QSAR methods, which use attributes to describe chemical structure, ILP uses relations. This gives ILP the advantages of not requiring explicit superimposition of individual compounds in a dataset, of dealing naturally with multiple conformations, and of using a language much closer to that used normally by chemists. We unify ILP and standard regression techniques to give a QSAR method that has the strength of ILP at describing steric structure with the familiarity and power of regression methods. Complex pharmacophores, correlating with activity, were identified and used as new indicator variables, along with the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) prediction, to form predictive regression equations. We compared the formation of 3D-QSARs using standard CoMFA with the use of ILP on the well-studied thermolysin zinc protease inhibitor dataset and a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor dataset. In each case the addition of ILP variables produced statistically better results (P < 0.01 for thermolysin and P < 0.05 for GP datasets) than the CoMFA analysis. Moreover, the new ILP variables were not found to increase the complexity of the final QSAR equations and gave possible insight into the binding mechanism of the ligand-protein complex under study.

The entire COMAPS-system is an online decision support system to control dynamically changing industrial production processes. This paper focuses on the adoption of production rules produced by decision tree techniques to the cognitive model of expert's control practice. The applied algorithms to obtain a quasi-optimal rule set as a model of the intentional representation of the expert knowledge is presented and tested on real world applications (printed circuit board, foil and brake pad production). The results of one application are shown. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However. the need to formally describe correct behavior or errors is a major barrier to the widespread adoption of program verification, since programmers historically have been reluctant to write formal specifications. Automating the process of formulating specification, would remove a barrier to program verification and enhance its practicality. This paper describes specification mining, a machine learning approach to discovering formal specification, of the protocols that code must obey when interacting with an application program interface or abstract data type. Starting from the assumption that a working program is well enough debugged to reveal strong hints of correct protocols, our tool infers a specification by observing program execution and concisely summarizing the frequent interaction patterns as state machines that capture both temporal and data dependences. These state machines can be examined by a programmer, to refine the specification and identity errors, and can be utilized by automatic verification tools, to find bugs. Our preliminary experience with the mining tool has been promising. We were able to learn specifications that not only captured the correct protocol, but also discovered serious bugs.

However, it is still a very important problem how to determine or tune the PID parameters, because these parameters have a great influence on the stability and the performance of the control system. On the other hand, in the last twenty years, a genetic algorithm(GA) is attracted as one method which gives us suitable answers for search, optimization and machine learning problems. In this paper, a new evolutuinary tuning algorithm of PID parameters is proposed, in which the search area of PID parameters is sharply reduced by considering an effective parameters' area from the viewpoint of the control engineering. Finally, the newly proposed scheme is numerically evaluated on a simulation example. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

In this paper we discuss basic functionality and technologies for an adaptive messaging system. Potentially, messaging systems could be utilized in a number of different modes. They help users to distribute information based on certain explicit or implicit criterions. They can help to find the recipient or a group of recipients for a message to be sent. Proactive information delivery based on information semantics and user profiles is another feature. In this paper we concentrate on just one component of the system - clustering of users based on their educational background.

The focus is on machine learning applications for which the individuals that are the subject of learning have complex structure. To represent such individuals, a rich knowledge representation language based on higher-order logic is introduced. The logic is also employed to construct comprehensible hypotheses that one might want to learn about the individuals. The tutorial introduces the main ideas of this approach to knowledge representation in a mostly informal way and gives a number of illustrations. The application of the ideas to decision-tree learning is also illustrated with an example.

This classifier is based on the not always realistic assumption that class-conditional distributions can be factorized in the product of their marginal densities. On the other side, one of the most common ways of estimating the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) representation for a given random vector consists in minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between the joint density and the product of the marginal densities (mutual information). From this that ICA provides a representation where the independence assumption can be held on stronger grounds. In this paper we propose class-conditional ICA as a method that provides an adequate representation where Naive Bayes is the classifier of choice. Experiments on two public databases are performed in order to confirm this hypothesis.

It has seen that even Naive Bayes classifier performs well in many cases, it may be improved by introducing some dependency relationships among variables (Augmented Naive Bayes). Naive Bayes is incremental in nature but, up to now, there are no incremental algorithms for learning Augmented classifiers. When data is presented in short chunks of instances, there is an obvious need for incrementally improving the performance of the classifiers as new data is available. It would be too costly, in computing time and memory space, to use the batch algorithms processing again the old data together with the new one. We present in this paper an incremental algorithm for learning Tree Augmented Naive classifiers. The algorithm rebuilds the network structure from the branch which is found to be invalidated, in some sense, by data. We will experimentally demonstrate that the heuristic is able to obtain almost optimal trees while saving computing time.

This type of examples makes the Machine Learning Systems produce not adequate rules. In this paper we present an algorithm that filters noisy continuous labeled examples, whose computational cost is O(N-logN+NA(2)) for N examples and A attributes. Besides, it is shown experimentally to be better than the embedded algorithms of the state-of-the art of the Machine Learning Systems.

Accuracy can be improved by ensemble methods which combine the predictions of a set of different trees. However, a large amount of resources is necessary to generate the ensemble. In this paper, we introduce a new ensemble method that minimises the usage of resources by sharing the common parts of the components of the ensemble. For this purpose, we learn a decision multi-tree instead of a decision tree. We call this new approach shared ensembles. The use of a multi-tree produces an exponential number of hypotheses to be combined, which provides better results than boosting/bagging. We performed several experiments, showing that the technique allows us to obtain accurate models and improves the use of resources with respect to classical ensemble methods.

The Phe-Q learning technique combines Q-learning with synthetic pheromone to improve on the speed of convergence. The Phe-Q update equation includes a belief factor that reflects the confidence the agent has in the pheromone (the communication) deposited in the environment by other agents. With the Phe-Q update equation, speed of convergence towards an optimal solution depends on a number parameters including the number of agents solving a problem, the amount of pheromone deposited, and the evaporation rate. In this paper, work carried out to optimise speed of learning with the Phe-Q technique is described. The objective was to to optimise Phe-Q learning with respect to pheromone deposition rates, evaporation rates.

Therefore, some discretization process is needed in order to teal with realvalued attributes. There are several methods to discretize real-valued attributes into a finite number of intervals, however none of them can efficiently solve all the possible problems. The alternative of a high number of simple uniform-width intervals usually expands the size of the search space without a clear performance gain. This paper proposes a rule representation which uses adaptive discrete intervals that split or merge through the evolution process, finding the correct discretization intervals at the same time as the learning process is done.

The linearity makes the method inadequate to forecast real time series, which could present irregular behavior. On the other hand, in artificial intelligence FeedForward Artificial Neural Networks and Continuous Machine Learning Systems are robust handlers of data in the sense that they are able to reproduce nonlinear relationships. Their main disadvantage is the selection of adequate inputs or attributes better related with the output or category. In this paper, we present a methodology that employs Box-Jenkins Time Series as feature selector to Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks inputs and Continuous Machine Learning Systems attributes. We also apply this methodology to forecast some real time series collected in a power plant. It is shown that Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks performs better than Continuous Machine Learning Systems, which in turn performs better than Box-Jenkins Time Series.

Dynamic simulation is properly emulated by training SVM and MLP models, with a small amount of information. The experiments show that although both models produce reasonable predictions, the performance indexes of the SVM models are better than those of the MLP models. However the MLP models are of considerably reduced complexity.

The methods considered, (Support Vector Machine, Growing Grid and Kohonen Feature Map) were compared in their capacity to model the surface of several synthetic and experimental 3D objects. The preliminary experimental results show that with slight modifications these learning algorithms can be very well adapted to the task of object modeling. In particular the Support Vector Machine Kernel method seems to be a very promising tool.

As most of them pointed out, this task requires learning algorithms that should work on-line, incorporate new information incrementality, and should exhibit the capacity to deal with concept-drift. In this paper we present Adaptive Bayes, an extension to the well-known naive-Bayes, one of the most common used learning algorithms for the task of user modeling. Adaptive Bayes is an incremental learning algorithm that could work on-line. We have evaluated Adaptive Bayes on both frameworks. Using a set of benchmark problems from the UCI repository [2], and using several evaluation statistics, all the adaptive systems show significant advantages in comparison against their non-adaptive versions.

Recent research works on extractive-summary generation employ some heuristics, but few works indicate how to select the relevant features. We will present a summarization procedure based on the application of trainable Machine Learning algorithms which employs a set of features extracted directly from the original text. These features are of two kinds: statistical - based on the frequency of some elements in the text; and linguistic - extracted from a simplified argumentative structure of the text. We also present some computational results obtained with the application of our summarizer to some well known text databases, and we compare these results to some baseline summarization procedures.

The SVM is a new machine learning technique for pattern recognition. In our proposed system, modal frequencies of a structure are used for pattern recognition. As our system does not require modal shapes, typically only two vibration sensors detecting an input signal and an output signal for a structural system are enough to define damage. Changes in moral frequencies normalized by original modal frequencies before suffering any damage are used as feature vectors for feeding into the SVMs. The proposed system is capable of identifying the damaged locations even when multiple stories suffered damages.

In an attempt to model the behavior of salespeople, AI research has been focussed on the so called recommender agents. Such agents draw on previous results from machine learning and other advances in AI technology to develop user models and to anticipate and predict user preferences. In this paper we introduce a new approach to recommendation, based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). CBR is a paradigm for learning and reasoning through experience, as salesmen do. We present a user model based on cases in which we try to capture both explicit interests (the user is asked for information) and implicit interests (captured from user interaction) of a user on a given item. Retrieval is based on a similarity function that is constantly tuned according to the user model. Moreover, in order to cope with the utility problem that current CBR system suffer from, our approach includes a forgetting mechanism (the drift attribute) that can be extended to other applications beyond e-commerce.

Particularly, when employing utility-based similarity measures rather than pure distance-based measures one is confronted with a difficult knowledge engineering task. In this paper we point out some problems of the state-of-the-art procedure to defining similarity measures. To overcome these problems we propose an alternative strategy to acquire the necessary domain knowledge based on a Machine Learning approach. To show the feasibility of this strategy several application scenarios are discussed and some results of an experimental evaluation for one of these scenarios are presented.

The present study explores coupling of SVM method with techniques inspired by chaos theory, to yield higher prediction accuracy. The new algorithm is developed and applied to a runoff time series of Tryggevaelde catchment, Denmark. For a one day forecast horizon, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of the prediction data using traditional approach was 0.444. For the approach proposed here the NRMSE is reduced to 0.347, i.e. about 22% improvement was achieved. Moreover, the prediction improvement was also observed for peak values and the recession parts of hydrograph.

The incremental multiplexer problem is an extended version of the multiplexer problem, a well-known test problem for data mining systems that do classification. The multiplexer problem has been one of the testbed problems driving the development of classifier systems in the last 15 years, but it has one drawback: the number of different multiplexer problems that are interesting and solvable with current computers is very small. This paper describes a generalization of the multiplexer problem that has many instances that are accessible to today's researchers. The paper contains results showing how the performance of a classifier system with fixed parameter settings changes as the size of the message generated by incremental multiplexers increases, suggesting that the incremental multiplexer provides machine learning problems that "fill in the gaps" between the standard multiplex er problems.

Excellent results have been reported already on one such problem by Wilson, while other work by Saxon and Barry on a tunable collection of machine learning problems has also pointed to the strong potential of XCS in this area. In this paper we test a modified XCS implementation oil twelve benchmark machine learning problems, all real-world derived. XCS is compared on these benchmarks with C4.5 and with HIDER (a new and sophisticated GA for machine learning developed elsewhere). Results for both C4.5, HIDER and XCS on each problem were tenfold cross-validated, and in the case of HIDER and XCS a modest amount of preliminary parameter investigation was done to find good results in each case. We find that XCS outperforms the other techniques in eight of the twelve problems, and is second-best in two of the remaining three. Some investigation is then done of the variance in XCS performance, and we find this to be verging on significant, either when varying the data fold composition, or the algorithmic random seed. We also investigate variation of several XCS parameters around well-known default settings. We find the default settings to be generally robust, but find the mutation rates and GA selection scheme to be particularly worthy of exploration with a view to improved performance. We conclude that XCS has the potential to be a powerful general data mining tool, at least for databases without too many fields, but that considerable research is warranted to identify rules and guidelines for parameter and strategy setting.

One of these aspects is related to the difference between the numbers of examples belonging to each class. When this difference is large, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work, we discuss several issues related to learning with skewed class distributions, such as the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and class distributions, and the limitations of accuracy and error rate to measure the performance of classifiers. Also, we survey some methods proposed by the Machine Learning community to solve the problem of learning with imbalanced data sets, and discuss some limitations of these methods.

Based on calculated features, support vector machines are applied to obtain the optimal class boundaries between vocal music and pure music by learning from training data.

This quantity captures the degree of agreement between a kernel and a given learning task, and has very natural interpretations in machine learning, leading also to simple algorithms for model selection and learning. We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy. Hence, the approach provides a principled method of performing transduction.			nello@support-vector.net; john@cs.rhul.ac.uk					Cristianini N., 2000, INTRO SUPPORT VECTOR; CRISTIANINI N, 2000, NCTR00080; Devroye L., 1996, APPL MATH; MCDIARMID C, 1989, LOND MATH S, V141, P148	4	69	71	M I T PRESS	CAMBRIDGE	FIVE CAMBRIDGE CENTER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA	1049-5258	0-262-04208-8	ADV NEUR IN			2002	14						367	373				7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BV95T	WOS:000180520100046

In such domains a cascade of simple classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of I in a 1,000,000.

We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers.

We describe a situation in a real-world business application of machine-learning prediction in which an additional constraint is placed on the nature of the solution: that the classifier achieve a specified correct acceptance or correct rejection rate (i.e., that it achieve a fixed accuracy on members of one class or the other). Our domain is predicting chum in the telecommunications industry. Chum refers to customers who switch from one service provider to another. We propose four algorithms for training a classifier subject to this domain constraint, and present results showing that each algorithm yields a reliable improvement in performance. Although the improvement is modest in magnitude, it is nonetheless impressive given the difficulty of the problem and the financial return that it achieves to the service provider.

J	Ragg, T				Ragg, T			Bayesian learning and evolutionary parameter optimization	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint German/Austrian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (KI-2001)	SEP 19-21, 2001	VIENNA, AUSTRIA			evolutionary search; Bayesian learning; mutual information; feature selection		In this paper I want to argue that the combination of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks can be fruitful in several ways. When estimating a functional relationship on the basis of empirical data we face three basic problems. Firstly, we have to deal with noisy and finite-sized data sets which is usually done be regularization techniques, for example Bayesian learning. Secondly, for many applications we need to encode the problem by features and have to decide which and how many of them to use. Bearing in mind the empty space phenomenon, it is often an advantage to select few features and estimate a non-linear function in a low-dimensional space. Thirdly, if we have trained several networks, we are left with the problem of model selection. These problems can be tackled by integrating several stochastic methods into an evolutionary search algorithm. The search can be designed such that it explores the parameter space to find regions corresponding to networks with a high posterior probability of being a model for the process, that generated the data. The benefits of the approach are demonstrated in detail on a regression and a classification problem. On a larger benchmark set the results are compared to other machine learning methods as Support Vector Machines.

The aim of this investigation was to provide starting points for an analysis that could be used to enhance the educational offer in this area in general, and knowledge transfer from academia to industry and business sector in particular. In addition to general findings concerning the collected materials such as contents, target audience, and teaching materials, we discuss issues such as connections with real-world problems. The work has been done as part of the activities of SolEuNet, a network of expert teams from academia and business sponsored by the European Commission, offering tools and expertise designed to meet customized data mining and decision support needs. For SolEuNet, the aim of the analysis of educational programs was to enhance its own educational offer by finding prospective market niches and by identifying useful guidelines for seminar and courses design. In this paper we report on these investigations with the aim of providing readers with insight into state of the art and trends of education in machine learning, data mining and decision support as reflected on the web, and to give useful links to materials that could help when designing and preparing courses.

The reformulation uses the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle as a way of costing each hyperplane via a two-part message. This message defines a separating hyperplane. The length of this message is used as an objective function for a search through the hypothesis space of possible hyperplanes used to dichotomise a set of data points. Two preliminary MML implementations are presented here, which differ in the (Bayesian) coding schemes used and the search procedures. The generalisation ability of these two reformulations on both artificial and real data sets are compared against current implementations of Support Vector Machines-namely SVMlight, the Lagrangian Support Vector Machine and SMOBR. It was found that, in general, all implementations improved as the size of the data sets increased. The MML implementations tended to perform best on the inseparable data sets and the real data set. Our preliminary MML scheme showed itself to be a strong competitor against the classical SVM, despite inefficiencies in the current scheme.

But in the area of supervised learning, decision trees have their limitations. Two notable problems are those of replication and fragmentation. One way of solving these problems is to introduce decision graphs, a generalization of the decision tree, which address the above problems by allowing for disjunctions, or joins. While various decision graph systems are available, all of these systems impose some forms of restriction on the proposed representations, often leading to either a new redundancy or the original redundancy not being removed. In this paper, we propose an unrestricted representation called the decision graph with multi-way joins, which has improved representative power and is able to use training data efficiently. An algorithm to infer these decision graphs with multi-way joins using the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle is also introduced. On both real-world and artificial data with only discrete attributes (including at least five UCI data-sets), and in terms of both "right"/"wrong" classification accuracy and I.J. Good's logarithm of probability "bit-costing" predictive accuracy, our novel multi-way join decision graph program significantly out-performs both C4.5 and C5.0. Our program also out-performs the Oliver and Wallace binary join decision graph program on the only data-set available for comparison.

We consider here the application of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a clustering problem of Gaussian and t distributions. Earlier work in the MML clustering was conducted in regards to the multinomial and Gaussian distributions (Wallace and Boulton, 1968) and in addition, the von Mises circular and Poisson distributions (Wallace and Dowe, 1994, 2000). Our current work extends this by applying the Gaussian distribution to the more general t distribution. Point estimation of the t distribution is performed using the MML approximation proposed by Wallace and Freeman (1987). A comparison of the MML estimations of the t distribution to those of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in terms of their Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances is also provided. Within each component, our application also performs a model selection on whether a particular group of data is best modelled as a Gaussian or a t distribution. The proposed modelling method is then applied to several artificially generated datasets. The modelling results are compared to the results obtained when using the MML clustering of Gaussian distributions. Our modelling method compares quite well to an alternative clustering program (EMMIX) which uses various modelling criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

ASE uses onboard continuous planning, robust task and goal-based execution, model-based mode identification and reconfiguration, and onboard machine learning and pattern recognition to radically increase science return by enabling intelligent downlink selection and autonomous retargeting. In this paper we discuss how these AI technologies are synergistically integrated in a hybrid multi-layer control architecture to enable a virtual spacecraft science agent. Demonstration of these capabilities in a flight environment will open up tremendous new opportunities in planetary science, space physics, and earth science that would be unreachable without this technology.

S	Cornforth, D		Mckay, B; Slaney, J		Cornforth, D			Evolution in the orange box - A new approach to the sphere-packing problem in CMAC-based neural networks	AL 2002: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	DEC 02-06, 2002	CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA					The sphere-packing problem is the task of finding an arrangement to achieve the maximum density of identical spheres in a given space. This problem arises in the placement of kernel functions for uniform input space quantisation in machine learning algorithms. One example is the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC), where the problem arises as the placement of overlapping grids. In such situations, it is desirable to achieve a uniform placement of grid vertices in input space. This is akin to the sphere-packing problem, where the grid vertices are the centres of spheres. The nature of space quantisation inherent in such algorithms imposes constraints on the solution and usually requires a regular tessellation of spheres. The sphere-packing problem is difficult to solve analytically, especially with these constraints. The current approach in the case of CMAC-based methods is to rely on published tables of grid spacings, but this has two shortcomings. First, no analytical solution has been published for the calculation of such tables - they were arrived at by exhaustive search. Second, the tables include input spaces of only ten dimensions or less. Many data mining problems now rely upon machine learning techniques to solve problems in higher dimensional spaces. A new approach to obtaining suitable grid spacings, based on a Genetic Algorithm, is described, which is potentially faster than exhaustive search. The resulting grid spacings are very similar to the published tables, and empirical trials show that where they differ, the performance on an automated classifier problem is unchanged. The new approach is also feasible for more than ten dimensions, and tables are presented for grid spacings in higher dimensional spaces. The results are applicable to any application where a regular division of input space is required. They allow the investigation of space quantising algorithms for solving problems in high dimensional spaces.

Using a unique cleaned and linked administrative health dataset we address the problem of empirically defining episodes of care. An episode of care is a time interval containing medical services relating to a particular medical situation. In this paper the medical situation is a hospital admission. The medical services of interest are pathology tests, diagnostic imaging and non-invasive investigative procedures performed before or after the hospital admission, but 'associated' with the hospital admission. The task can be viewed as detecting a signal in a time series relating to a hospital admission, distinct from the background noise of on-going medical care. Our approach uses an ensemble (panel of experts) paradigm where we implement multiple agents (alternative predictive models) to separately estimate intervals and then choose a robust interval estimate using a voting scheme. The results have been used in a study for the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing.

This paper reviews some recent work that applies novel techniques of machine learning (broadly interpreted) to extract information from plain text, and puts it in the context of digital library applications. We describe three areas: hierarchical phrase browsing, including efficient methods for inferring a phrase hierarchy from a large corpus of text; text mining using adaptive compression techniques, giving a new approach to generic entity extraction, word segmentation, and acronym extraction; and keyphrase extraction.

It has been shown recently that TCM is well-calibrated. when used in the on-line mode: at any confidence level 1 - delta, the long-run relative. frequency of errors. is guarantee d not to exceed delta provided the examples are generated independently from the same probability distribution P. Therefore, the number of "uncertain" predictive regions (i.e., those containing more than one label) becomes the sole measure of performance. The main result of this paper is that for any probability distribution P (assumed to generate the examples), it is possible to construct a TCM (guaranteed to be well-calibrated even if the assumption is wrong) that performs asymptotically as well as the best region predictor under P.

The primary goal of this study was to develop machine learning models that classify non-small Lung Cancers according to histopathology types and to compare several machine learning methods in this learning task. DNA from tumors of 37 patients (21 squamous carcinomas, and 16 adenocarcinomas) were extracted and hybridized onto a 452 BAC clone array. The following algorithms were used: KNN, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machines and Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Performance was measured via leave-one-out classification accuracy. The best multi-gene model found had a leave-one-out accuracy of 89.2%. Decision Trees performed poorer than the other methods in this learning task and dataset. We conclude that gene copy numbers as measured by array CGH are, collectively, an excellent indicator of histological subtype. Several interesting research directions are discussed.
