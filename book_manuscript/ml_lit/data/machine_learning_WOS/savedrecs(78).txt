However, the SC-based feature selection requires the complete pair-wise comparisons of the members of the different classes in a dataset, and this renders the meritorious SC principle impracticable for selecting support features from a large number of data. Introducing the notion of implicit SC-based feature selection, this paper presents a feature selection procedure that is equivalent to the standard SC-based feature selection procedure in supervised learning but with the memory requirement that is multiple orders of magnitude less than the counterpart. With experiments on six large machine learning datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed implicit SC-based feature selection scheme in large-scale supervised data analysis.

Much work has been done to filter spam from legitimate emails using machine learning algorithm and substantial performance has been achieved with some amount of false positive (FP) tradeoffs. In the case of spam detection FP problem is unacceptable sometimes. In this paper, an adaptive spam filtering model has been proposed based on Machine learning (ML) algorithms which will get better accuracy by reducing FP problems. This model consists of individual and combined filtering approach from existing well known ML algorithms. The proposed model considers both individual and collective output and analyzes them by an analyzer. A dynamic feature selection (DFS) technique also proposed in this paper for getting better accuracy.

Changes that are due to environmental differences (illumination, atmospheric distortion, etc.) or sensor differences (focus, contrast, etc.) will be widespread throughout the image, and the aim is to avoid these changes in favor of changes that occur in only one or a few pixels. Formal outlier detection schemes (such as the one-class support vector machine) can identify rare occurrences, but will be confounded by pixels that are C equally rare" in both images: they may be anomalous, but they are not changes. We describe a resampling scheme we have developed that formally addresses both of these issues, and reduces the problem to a binary classification, a problem for which a large variety of machine learning tools have been developed. In principle, the effects of misregistration will manifest themselves as pervasive changes, and our method will be robust against them - but in practice, misregistration remains a serious issue.

First. a dual window technique is used to separate the local area around each pixel into two regions - an inner-window region (IWR) and an outer-window region (OWR). Pixel spectra from each region are projected onto a subspace which is defined by projection bases that can be generated in several ways. Here we use three common pattern classification techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) Analysis, and the Eigenspace Separation Transform (EST)) to generate projection vectors. In addition to these three algorithms, the well-known Reed-Xiaoli (RX) anomaly detector is also implemented. Each of the four linear methods is then implicitly defined in a high- (possibly infinite-) dimensional feature space by using a nonlinear mapping associated with a kernel function. Using a common machine-learning technique known as the kernel trick all dot products in the feature space are replaced with a Mercer kernel function defined in terms of the original input data space. To determine how anomalous a given pixel is, we then project the current test pixel spectra and the spectral mean vector of the OWR onto the linear and nonlinear projection vecotrs in order to exploit the statistical differences between the IWR and OWR pixels. Anomalies are detected if the separation of the projection of the current test pixel spectra and the OWR mean spectra are greater than a certain threshold. Comparisons are made using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.	Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA	Goldberg, H (reprint author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Ranking as function approximation	Algorithms for Approximation, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Algorithms for Approximation	JUL 17-21, 2005	Chester, ENGLAND					An overview of the problem of learning to rank data is given. Some current machine learning approaches to the problem are described. The cost functions used to assess the quality of a ranking algorithm present particular difficulties: they are non-differentiable (as a function of the scores output by the ranker) and multivariate (in the sense that the cost associated with one ranked object depends on its relations to several other ranked objects). I present some ideas on a general framework for training using such cost functions; the approach has an appealing physical interpretation. The paper is tutorial in the sense that it is not assumed that the reader is familiar with the methods of machine learning; my hope is that the paper will encourage applied mathematicians to explore this topic.

To get successful results of analyzing dependency relation, this task has been the target of various machine learning methods including SVM. Especially, kernel methods are usually used to analyze dependency relation and it is reported that they show high performance. This paper proposes an expression for dependency analysis of Korean clauses. The proposed expression adopts a composite kernel to obtain the similarity among clauses. The composite kernel consists of a parse tree kernel and a liner kernel. A parse tree kernel is used for treating structure information and a liner kernel is applied for using lexical information. The proposed expression is defined as three types. One is a expression of layers in clause, another is relation expression between clause and the other is an expression of inner clause. The expriment is processed by two steps that first is a relation expression between clauses and the second is a expression of inner clauses. The experimental results show that the proposed expression achieves 82.12% of accuracy.

This paper presents the importance of surface linguistic features in predicting the quality of user generated documents. A machine learning approach to incorporating surface linguistic features in predicting of document quality is tested on a collection of answers gathered from a community-driven knowledge search service that allows users to ask and answer questions posed by other users. Experimental results show that the features are useful for predicting the quality of answers.

Ideally students should be able to expand on their knowledge, assess their progress and receive feedback from a remote location, outside the classroom. This research presents a graphically-based methodology to model the semantic structure of textual exchanges in the form of question and answer (Q/A). A machine learning approach is then presented which classifies questions and answers based on the similarities of their semantic structures. Because the methodology is graphically based, similarities between graphs can be identified to establish context-free-relationships/ associations between answers, or between questions and possible answers. By these means the relevant textual exchanges can be systematically analyzed and classified.

The work presented in this paper is intended to fill the apparent gap in research. Based on a hybrid algorithm that combines manually knowledge-engineered antecedent filtering rules with machine-learned preference criteria, it is investigated what can be achieved by employing backpropagation networks for the corpus-based acquisition of preference strategies for pronoun resolution. Thorough evaluation will be carried out, thus systematically addressing the numerous experimental degrees of freedom, among which are sources of evidence (features, feature vector signatures), training data generation settings, number of hidden layer nodes, and number of training epochs. According to the evaluation results, the neural network approach performs at least similar to a decision-tree-based ancestor system that employs the same general hybrid strategy.

Through the application of a selection of linguistically-motivated negative and positive filters, which we apply in isolation and combined, we study the effect of these filters on precision and recall using two different learning techniques: memory-based learning and maximum entropy modeling. Our results show that by using the hybrid approach, we can reduce up to 92 % of the training material without performance loss. We also show that the filters improve the overall precision of the classifiers leading to higher F-scores on the test set.

These applications have to deal with unrestricted input which is difficult to process with symbolic anaphora resolution methods. If trained on unrestricted input, machine learning based anaphora resolution methods can robustly deal with a wide variety of input documents. Those methods are mostly implemented as binary classification realizing models of local inference. While this makes the task accessible to standard machine learning techniques, it has the drawback that knowledge about the context is lost. Based on a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art, models of global inference are introduced as a possible alternative.

There is direct relation between species of workpiece material and final results obtained after AWJ cutting. Thus there is a need to have a tool for right material setting, choosing optimal cutting parameters and finding relations between each variables of cutting process. Using of information technology especially machine learning methods should be the right way. From all methods the Receptive Field Weighted Regression (RFWR) can be used as a function approximator for different mapping tasks like learning the value function for reinforcement learning.

Two-sample comparison based on prediction error, with applications to candidate gene association studies	ANNALS OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						classification tree; haplotype; candidate gene association studies; prediction error; bootstrap	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; FAMILY-BASED TESTS; TRANSMISSION/DISEQUILIBRIUM TEST; HAPLOTYPE FREQUENCIES; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; FOUNDER HETEROGENEITY; CROSS-VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; POPULATION	To take advantage of the increasingly available high-density SNP maps across the genome, various tests that compare multilocus genotypes or estimated haplotypes between cases and controls have been developed for candidate gene association studies. Here we view this two-sample testing problem from the perspective of supervised machine learning and propose a new association test. The approach adopts the flexible and easy-to-understand classification tree model as the learning machine, and uses the estimated prediction error of the resulting prediction rule as the test statistic. This procedure not only provides an association test but also generates a prediction rule that can be useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex disease. Under the set-up of a haplotype-based transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) type of analysis, we find through simulation studies that the proposed procedure has the correct type I error rates and is robust to population stratification. The power of the proposed procedure is sensitive to the chosen prediction error estimator. Among commonly used prediction error estimators, the .632+ estimator results in a test that has the best overall performance. We also find that the test using the .632+ estimator is more powerful than the standard single-point TDT analysis, the Pearson's goodness-of-fit test based on estimated haplotype frequencies, and two haplotype-based global tests implemented in the genetic analysis package FBAT. To illustrate the application of the proposed method in population-based association studies, we use the procedure to study the association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the IL10 gene.

We analyse the extent to which TimeBank, the reference corpus for TimeML, supports development of TimeML-compliant analytics. The first release of the corpus exhibits challenging characteristics: small size and some noise. Nonetheless, a particular design of a time annotator trained on TimeBank is able to exploit the data in an implementation which deploys a hybrid analytical strategy of mixing aggressive finite-state processing over linguistic annotations with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique capable of leveraging large amounts of unannotated data. We present our design, in light of encouraging performance results; we also interpret these results in relation to a close analysis of TimeBank's annotation 'profile'. We conclude that even the first release of the corpus is invaluable; we further argue for more infrastructure work needed to create a larger and more robust reference corpus.

This book provides an overarching view on anticipatory mechanisms in cognition, learning, and behavior. It connects the knowledge from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics with that of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive robotics, and others. This introduction offers an overview over the contributions in this volume highlighting their interconnections and interrelations from an anticipatory behavior perspective. We first clarify the main foci of anticipatory behavior research. Next, we present a taxonomy of how anticipatory mechanisms may be beneficially applied in cognitive systems. With relation to the taxonomy, we then give an overview over the book contributions. The first chapters provide surveys on currently known anticipatory brain mechanisms, anticipatory mechanisms in increasingly complex natural languages, and an intriguing challenge for artificial cognitive systems. Next, conceptualizations of anticipatory processes inspired by cognitive mechanisms are provided. The conceptualizations lead to individual, predictive challenges in vision and processing of event correlations over time. Next, anticipatory mechanisms in individual decision making and behavioral execution are studied. Finally, the book offers systems and concept ualizations of anticipatory processes related to social interaction.

The adaptive acquisition of visual forward models in robotic applications is plagued by the high dimensionality of visual data which is not handled well by most machine learning and neural network algorithms. Moreover, the forward model has to learn which parts of the visual output are really predictable and which are not because they lack any corresponding part in the visual input. In the present study, a learning algorithm is proposed which solves both problems. It relies on predicting the mapping between pixel positions in the visual input and output instead of directly forecasting visual data. The mapping is learned by matching corresponding regions in the visual input and output while exploring different visual surroundings. Unpredictable regions are detected by the lack of any clear correspondence. The proposed algorithm is applied successfully to a robot camera head under additional distortion of the camera images by a retinal mapping. Two future applications of the final visual forward model are proposed, saccade learning and a task from the domain of eye-hand coordination.

The classifier combination consists of a new optimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm applied to FKNN's, that differ in the kind of similarity used. We tested the integration techniques in the case of N = 5 similarities that have been recently introduced to face with categorical data sets. The assessment of the method has been carried out on two public data set, the Masquerading User Data (www.schonlau.net) and the badges database on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://www.ics.uci.edu/-mlearn/). Preliminary results show the better performance obtained by the fuzzy integration respect to the crisp one.

We use no deep analysis of the meaning to try to see if it is humorous, instead we rely on a combination of simple features to see if these are enough to detect humor. Features such as word overlap with other jokes, presence of words common in jokes, ambiguity and word overlap with common idioms turn out to be useful. When training and testing on equal amounts of jokes and sentences from the British National Corpus, a classification accuracy of 85% is achieved.

This paper proposes a new combination approach between Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) by typical sample extraction based on a UBM/GMM system for SVM in protein secondary structure prediction. Our hybrid model achieved a good performance of three-state overall per residue accuracy Q(3) = 77.6% which is comparable to the best techniques available.

This paper presents a cost-sensitive approach feature selection that focuses on two fundamental requirements: (1) the quality of the features in order to promote the classifier accuracy and (2) the cost of computation due to the complexity that occurs during training and testing the classifier. The paper describes the approach in detail and includes a case study for a publicly available micro-array dataset. Results show that the proposed process yields state-of-art performance and uses only a small fraction of features that are generally used in competitive approaches on the same dataset.

More recently, Machine Learning algorithms have been developed that try avoid the use of a priori information, with partial success. Here we approach the prediction of Alternative Splicing as a time series analysis problem and we show that it is possible to obtain results similar or better than the state of the art without any explicit modeling of homology, positions in the splice site, nor any use of other local features. As a consequence, our method has a better generality and a broader and simpler applicability with respect to previous ones. Results on pre-mRNA sequences in C.Elegans are reported.

Indeed, unraveling complex interactions among genes is a crucial step in order to understand their role in cellular processes. High-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays or ChIP on chip have in principle opened the door to network inference from data. However the size of available data is still limited compared to their dimension. Machine learning methods have thus to be worked out in order to respond to this challenge. In this work we focused our attention on modeling gene regulatory networks with Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks offer a probabilistic framework for the reconstruction of biological interactions networks using data, but the structure learning problem is still a bottleneck. In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms to stochastically evolve a set of candidate Bayesian networks structures and find the model that best explains the small number of available observational data. We propose different, kinds of recombination strategies and an appropriate technique of niching that ensure diversity among candidate solutions. Tests are carried out on simulated data drawn from a biorealistic network. The effect of deterministic crowding, a niching method, is compared to mutation for different kinds of recombination strategies and is shown to improve significantly the performances. Enhanced by deterministic crowding, our evolutionary approach outperforms K2, Greedy-search and MCMC, for training sets whose size is small compared to the standard in machine learning.

Machine learning symbolic approaches have been applied to automatically discover local structural signatures and relate these to the concept of fold in SCOP. However, most of these methods cannot handle uncertainty being therefore not able to solve multiple prediction problems. In this paper we present an application of the symbolic-statistical framework PRISM to a multi-class protein fold recognition problem. We compare the proposed approach to a symbolic-only technique and show that the hybrid framework outperforms the symbolic-only one in terms of predictive accuracy in the multiple prediction problem.

These methods include Support Vector Machine (SVM), kNN (Nearest Neighbor), kNN model-based approach (kNNM), and Rocchio. We first present a general representation of the outputs of different classifiers, in particular, modeling it as a piece of evidence by using a novel evidence structure called focal element triplet. Furthermore, we investigate an effective method for combining pieces of evidence derived from classifiers generated by a 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we evaluate our methods on the 20-newsgroup and Reuters-21578 benchmark data sets and perform the comparative analysis with majority voting in combining multiple classifiers along with the previous result. Our experimental results show that the best combined classifier can improve the performance of the individual classifiers and Dempster's rule of combination outperforms majority voting in combining multiple classifiers.

J	Tsakonas, A; Dounias, G				Tsakonas, Athanasios; Dounias, Georgios			Evolving neural-symbolic systems guided by adaptive training schemes: Applications in finance	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								The article presents a hybrid and adaptive intelligent methodology, based on neural logic networks and grammar-guided genetic programming. The aim of the study is to demonstrate how to generate efficient neural logic networks with the aid of genetic programming methods trained adaptively through an innovative scheme. The proposed adaptive training scheme of the genetic programming mechanism leads to the generation of high-diversity solutions and small-sized individuals. The overall methodology is advantageous due to the adaptive training scheme proposed for offering both accurate and interpretable results in the form of expert rules. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis study is provided within the article, comparing the performance of the proposed evolutionary neural logic networks methodology with well-known competitive inductive machine learning approaches. Two financial domains of application have been selected to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed methodology: ( a) classification of credit applicants for consumer loans of a German bank and ( b) the credit-scoring decision-making process in an Australian bank. Results seem encouraging since the proposed methodology outperforms a number of competitive existing statistical and intelligent methodologies, while it also produces handy decision rules, short in length and transparent in meaning and use.

In many current workflow applications, staff assignment is still performed manually by resource assigners like process initiator or process monitor. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach intended to ease the burden of staff assigner. Our approach applies a machine learning algorithm to workflow event log to learn various kinds of activities each actor undertakes. When a new process is initiated, the classifiers generated by the machine learning technique suggest a suitable actor to undertake the specified activities. With this approach, we have achieved an average prediction accuracy of 85.8% and 80.1% on two car manufacturing enterprises respectively. We report on the result of our experiment and discuss issues and improvement of our approach.

However it often suffers from the inductive bias or model misfit incurred by its assumption. In order to address this issue, training-set errors as well as training-set margins are regarded as training criterions. Based on these two criterions, an overall (or global) objective function over all training examples is constructed, and optimized to produce a refined Centroid classification model. The empirical assessment conducted on four benchmark collections evidence that proposed method performs comparably to state-of-the-art SVM classifier in classifying performance, as well as beats it in running time.

For instance, in the context of text retrieval, in contrast to traditional web search engines retrieving the same results for all users, major commercial search engines are starting to support personalization, improving the search quality by adapting to the user-specific retrieval contexts, e.g., prior search history or other application contexts. This paper studies how to enable such personalization in the context of structured data retrieval. In particular, we adopt context-sensitive ranking model to formalize personalization as a cost-based optimization over context-sensitive rankings collected. With this formalism, personalization is essentially retrieving the context-sensitive ranking matching the specific user's retrieval context and generating a personalized ranking accordingly. In particular, we adopt a machine learning approach, to effectively and efficiently identify the ideal personalized ranked results for this specific user. Our empirical evaluations over real-life data validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

However, despite considerable work on automated negotiation, few research efforts have aimed at software engineering facilities such a reuse and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a novel computation environment for building agents with flexible negotiation strategies to function in various virtual business domains. Regarding the negotiation strategies, some decision taking assistance techniques may be used in group, e.g. rule-based reasoning and techniques to machine learning. Considering the flexibility of acting in various business domains, a specific agent can be, programmed to work in as many business domains as necessary, and essentially, it will also be possible to reconfigure the agent's business domains at execution time. All the experiments in this work were idealized in the terms of a tourism negotiation package. Results from these experiments demonstrate effectiveness of our proposal.

In this paper, we first analyse the features of the gaps using mutual information. We then investigate the underlying data distribution by using visualisation methods. These suggest that a complicated structure exists, which makes them difficult to be separated into two distinct classes. We apply five different supervised classification algorithms from the machine learning field on both the original dataset and a dataset with the best features selected using mutual information. Moreover, we improve the classification result with the aid of a set of feature variables of strokes preceding and following each gap. The classifiers are compared by employing McNemar's test. We find that SVMs and MLPs outperform the other classifiers and that preprocessing to select features works well. The best classification result attained suggests that the technique we employ is particularly suitable for digital ink manipulation at the level of words. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine learning for frequency estimation of power systems	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						power systems; dynamic security assessment; machine learning; decision trees; entropy trees; neural networks and energy management systems		In this paper the application of machine learning techniques for on-line dynamic security assessment of power systems is presented. Decision trees (DT), artificial neural networks ( ANN) and entropy networks ( EN) are developed and applied on the power system of Crete, the largest Greek island. Comparison of these methods reveals their relative advantages and disadvantages. These methods have been integrated in the dynamic security assessment module of the advanced control system of Crete island, helping to identify the operating conditions and parameters that lead to a less robust operation of the system. The results are considered very satisfactory, both in accuracy that increases the reliability of the method and in computational time, which is a necessity for real time applications.

Random sketches formed by the inner product of the frequency vector f(1),..., f(n) with a suitably chosen random vector were pioneered by Alon, Matias and Szegedy [1], and have since played a central role in estimating F. and for data stream computations in general. The concept of p-stable sketches formed by the inner product of the frequency vector with a random vector whose components are drawn from a p-stable distribution, was proposed by Indyk [I I I for estimating Er, for 0 < p < 2, and has been further studied in Li [13]. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating F-p for 0 < p < 2. A disadvantage of the stable sketches technique and its variants is that they require O(1/epsilon(2)) inner-products of the frequency vector with dense vectors of stable (or nearly stable [14,13]) random variables to be maintained. This means that each stream update can be quite time-consuming. We present algorithms for estimating F,, for 0 < p < 2, that does not require the use of stable sketches or its approximations. Our technique is elementary in nature, in that, it uses simple randomization in conjunction with well-known summary structures for data streams, such as the COUNT-MIN sketch [7] and the COUNTSKETCH structure [5]. Our algorithms require space O(1/epsilon(2)+p)(1) to estimate F-p to within 1 +/-epsilon factors and requires ex- pected time O(log F-1 log 1/delta) to process each update. Thus, our technique trades an O(1/epsilon(p)) factor in space for much more efficient processing of stream updates. We also present a stand-alone iterative estimator for F-1.

S	Dichy, J; Farghaly, A		Soudi, A; VandenBosch, A; Neumann, G		Dichy, Joseph; Farghaly, Ali			Grammar-Lexis Relations in the Computational Morphology of Arabic	ARABIC COMPUTATIONAL MORPHOLOGY: KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND EMPIRICAL METHODS	Text Speech and Language Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter							HEBREW	Grammar-lexis rules and relations ensuring correct insertion of major lexical entries (nouns, verbs and deverbals) play an essential part in the computational morphology of Arabic. This chapter, which is based on the experiences of the DIINAR.1 Arabic lexical resource and related software, and on that of the first version of the SYSTRAN Arabic-English MT system, outlines previous approaches of the computational morphology of the language (Section 2): root and pattern (shortly recalled); lexeme-based; machine learning and statistical; stems, based on roots and patterns, and finally, the stem-based approach, including root and pattern as well as grammar-lexis information. The latter, which is the most compliant to the requirements of machine-translation and other high-level applications, is further developed in Section 3. Authors go on presenting the structure of the Arabic word-form and a mapping of rules and relations accounting for grammar-lexis relations operating within the boundaries of that complex unit. In the Word-Formatives Grammar, rules and relations involving the lexical nucleus of the word-form play a crucial part and are formalised in a computational perspective. The stem either coincides with, or is the core of the nucleus, because lexical entries include two overall categories: in the first, stem and entry coincide; in the second, the lexical entry corresponds to a morphological compound encompassing the stem and a lexicalized extension ( in most cases, a suffix which is part of the entry). Correct relations between the lexical nucleus and the other formatives included in the word-form are ensured through morphosyntactic specifiers associated to each entry of the lexical database. These relations, which have been included in the DIINAR.1 database, are both finite in number and exhaustive in coverage. They also allow computational morphology and other applications to rely on a good restriction of the generated lexica: only cliticized or affixed formatives that can effectively be associated with a given lexical nucleus are added, and 'illegal' ones are ruled out. In the DIINAR.1 resource, the effective number of inflected word-forms is 7,774,938 (about nine times less than one would obtain through 'blind' generation). A comprehensive mapping of examples is given. Their compatibility with applications going beyond computational morphology is also outlined	[Dichy, Joseph] Univ Lyon 2, ICAR Res Lab CNRS Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Farghaly, Ali] Oracle USA, Redwood Shores, CA 94065 USA	Dichy, J (reprint author), Univ Lyon 2, ICAR Res Lab CNRS Lyon 2, 86 Rue Pasteur, F-69365 Lyon 07, France.

Identifying the root of a given word in a Semitic language is an important task, in some cases a crucial part of morphological analysis. It is also a non-trivial task, which many humans find challenging. We present a machine learning approach to the problem of extracting roots of Semitic words. Given the large number of potential roots (thousands), we address the problem as one of combining several classifiers, each predicting the value of one of the root's consonants. We show that when these predictors are combined by enforcing some fairly simple linguistics constraints, high accuracy, which compares favorably with human performance on this task, can be achieved	[Daya, Ezra; Wintner, Shuly] Univ Haifa, Dept Comp Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Roth, Dan] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA	Daya, E (reprint author), Univ Haifa, Dept Comp Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.

In terms of the latter, the drive for engineering applications has led to a diluted interpretation of the immunological models. Research inspired by theoretical immunology has produced compelling models of self-organised tolerance and immunity, but currently fail to have any practical engineering applicability. In this paper, we briefly discuss the engineering applicability of "self-affirming" idiotypic networks, leading to a suggestion that the "Third Generation" network models represent a way forward in this re spect. Results obtained by implementing and extending a discrete model of this type of network suggest that the extended prototype is capable of two context-dependent modes of immune response, readily applicable to unsupervised machine-learning.

Training and validation data were collected from the sensors in a learning session with AutoTutor, after which the affective states of the learner were rated by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. Machine learning experiments with several standard classifiers indicated that the dialogue and posture features could individually discriminate between the affective states of boredom, confusion, flow (engagement), and frustration. Our results also indicate that a combination of the dialogue and posture features does improve classification accuracy. However, the incremental gains associated with the combination of the two sensors were not sufficient to exhibit superadditivity (i.e., performance superior to an additive combination of individual channels). Instead, the combination of posture and dialogue reflected a modest amount of redundancy among these channels.

The interactions of a group of students using, under realistic circumstances, an ILE were recorded and replayed to them during post-task walkthroughs. With the help of machine learning we determine patterns that contribute to the overall task of diagnosing learners' affective states based on observable student-system interactions. Apart from the specific rules brought forward, we present our work as a general method of deriving predictive rules or. when there is not enough evidence, generate at least hypotheses that can guide further research.

Using Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze and Support Mediation of Student E-Discussions	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION: BUILDING TECHNOLOGY RICH LEARNING CONTEXTS THAT WORK	Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2007)	JUL 09-13, 2007	Los Angeles, CA	Int Artificial Intelligence Educ Soc, Univ So Calif, Informat Sci Inst				Students are starting to use networked visual argumentation tools to discuss, debate, and argue with one another about topics presented by a teacher. However, this development gives rise to an emergent issue for teachers: how do they support students during these e-discussions? The ARGUNAUT system aims to provide the teacher (or moderator) with tools that will facilitate effective moderation of several simultaneous e-discussions. Awareness Indicators, provided as part of a moderator's user interface, help monitor the progress of discussions on several dimensions (e.g., critical reasoning). In this paper we discuss preliminary steps taken in using machine learning techniques to support the Awareness Indicators. Focusing on individual contributions (single objects containing textual content, contributed in the visual workspace by students) and sequences of two linked contributions (two objects, the connection between them, and the students' textual contributions), we have run a series of machine learning experiments in an attempt to train classifiers to recognize important student actions, such as using critical reasoning and raising and answering questions. The initial results presented in this paper are encouraging, but we are only at the beginning of our analysis.

Predicting Students' Performance with SimStudent: Learning Cognitive Skills from Observation	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION	Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2007)	JUL 09-13, 2007	Los Angeles, CA	Int Artificial Intelligence Educ Soc, Univ So Calif, Informat Sci Inst		Cognitive modeling; programming by demonstration; inductive logic programming; Cognitive Tutor; intelligent authoring		SimStudent is a machine-learning agent that learns cognitive skills by demonstration. SimStudent was originally built as a building block for Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools to help an author build a cognitive model without significant programming. In this paper, we evaluate a second use of SimStudent, viz., student modeling for Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The basic idea is to have SimStudent observe human students solving problems. It then creates a cognitive model that can replicate the students' performance. If the model is accurate, it would predict the human students' performance on novel problems. An evaluation study showed that when trained on 15 problems, SimStudent accurately predicted the human students' correct behavior on the novel problems more than 80% of the time. However, the current implementation of SimStudent does not accurately predict when the human students make errors.

The rules we learn concern the tutor's attitude, the domain concepts to focus on, and the tutor moves. These rules have very good accuracy. They will be incorporated in the feedback generator of an Intelligent Tutoring System.

One method is mixed-effects statistical modelling. The other uses a Bayesian networks machine learning approach. We compare the prediction results to identify benefits and drawbacks of either method and to find out if the two results agree. We report that both methods showed compelling similarity which support the use of fine grained skill models.

However, relatively little effort has gone into investigating how new knowledge can be validated. Knowledge validation is important in dealing with imperfect data collected over time, because inconsistencies in data do occur and adversely affect the performance of a diagnostic system. Methods: This paper consists of two parts. First, it describes methods that enable the domain expert, who may not be familiar with machine learning, to interactively validate knowledge base of a Web-based teledermatology system. The validation techniques involve decision tree classification and format concept analysis. Second, it describes techniques to discover unusual relationships hidden in the dataset for building and updating a comprehensive knowledge base, because the diagnostic performance of the system is highly dependent on the content thereof. Therefore, in order to classify different kinds of diseases, it is desirable to have a knowledge base that covers common as well as uncommon diagnoses. Results and conclusion: Evaluation results show that the knowledge validation techniques are effective in keeping the knowledge base consistent, and that the query refinement techniques are useful in improving the comprehensiveness of the case base.

Haemodialysis machines combine a therapeutic treatment system integrated with sophisticated monitoring equipment. A large array of parameters can be collected including cardiovascular measures such as heart rate and blood pressure together with treatment related data including relative blood volume, ultrafiltration rate and small molecule clearance. A small subset of this information is used by clinicians to monitor treatment and plan therapeutic strategies but it is not usually analysed in any detail. The focus of this paper is the analysis of data collected over a number of treatment sessions with a view to predicting patient physiological behaviour whilst on dialysis and correlating this with clinical characteristics of individual patients. One of the commonest complications experienced by patients on dialysis is symptomatic hypotension. We have taken real time treatment data and outline a program of work which attempts to predict when hypotension is likely to occur, and which patients might be particularly prone to haemodynamic instability. This initial study has investigated: the rate of change of blood pressure versus rate of change of heart rate, rate of fluid removal, and rate of uraemic toxin clearance. We have used a variety of machine learning techniques (including hierarchical clustering, and Bayesian Network analysis algorithms). We have been able to detect from this dataset, 3 distinct groups which appear to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore we have investigated whether it is possible to predict changes in blood pressure in terms of other parameters with some encouraging results that merit further study.

In the clinical setting, coronary artery disease diagnostics is typically performed in a sequential manner. The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of (1) signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, (2) ECG testing during a controlled exercise, (3) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and (4) finally coronary angiography (which is considered as the "gold standard" reference method). In our study we focus on improving diagnostic performance of the third diagnostic level (myocardial perfusion scintigraphy). This diagnostic level consists of series of medical images that are easily obtained and the imaging procedure represents only a minor threat to patients' health. In clinical practice, these images are manually described (parameterized) and subsequently evaluated by expert physicians. In our paper we present an innovative alternative to manual image evaluation - an automatic image parametrization on multiple resolutions, based on texture description with specialized association rules, and image evaluation with machine learning methods. Our results show that multi-resolution image parameterizations equals the physicians in terms of quality of image parameters. However, by using both manual and automatic image description parameters at the same time, diagnostic performance can be significantly improved with respect to the results of clinical practice.

We ask the question whether aspects of TCM theories can be reconstructed through modern day data analysis. We have recently analyzed a TCM data set using a machine learning method and found that the resulting statistical model matches the relevant TCM theory well. This is an exciting discovery because it shows that, contrary to common perception, there are scientific truths in TCM theories. It also suggests the possibility of laying a statistical foundation for TCM through data analysis and thereby turning it into a modern science.

In our work we address this issue through stylistic corpus analysis and application of machine learning algorithms. Our hypothesis is that this distinction can be observed on the basis of a little number of criteria and that such criteria can be language and domain independent. The used criteria have been acquired in source corpus (Russian) and then tested on source and target (French) corpora. The method shows up to 90% precision and 93% recall, and 85% precision and 74% recall in source and target corpora.

Our specific aims are : (1) to provide a statistical profile of the recruited population, (2) to help indentify the important environmental risk factors involved in NPC, and (3) to gain insight on the applicability and limitations of BN methods on small epidemiological data sets obtained from questionnaires. We discuss first the novel BN structure learning algorithm called Max-Min Parents and Children Skeleton (MMPC) developped by Tsamardinos et al. in 2005. MMPC was proved by extensive empirical simulations to be an excellent trade-off between time and quality of reconstruction compared to most constraint based algorithms, especially for the smaller sample sizes. Unfortunately, MMPC is unable to deal with datasets containing approximate functional dependencies between variables. In this work, we overcome this problem and apply the new version of MMPC on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma data in order to shed some light into the statistical profile of the population under study.

Based upon state-of-the-art technology in the areas of semantic web, content analysis and quality labelling, the MedIEQ project, integrates existing technologies and tests them in a novel application: the automation of the labelling process in health-related web content. MedIEQ provides tools that crawl the web to locate unlabelled health web resources, to label them according to pre-defined labelling criteria, as well as to monitor them.

We hypothesize that machine learning methods can play an important role in learning CPGs automatically from data. Automatically induced CPGs can then be used for further manual refinement and deployment, for automated guideline compliance checking, for better understanding of disease processes, and for improved physician education. We discuss why learning CPGs is a special form of computational causal discovery and why simply predictive (i.e., non-causal) methods may not be appropriate for this task.

One possible strategy for circumventing these difficulties is to attempt to predict the high frequency performance measures using measurements taken at lower, more accessible, frequencies. This paper investigates the effectiveness of machine learning based classification techniques at predicting the gain of the amplifier, a key performance parameter, using such an approach. An indirect artificial neural network (ANN) and direct support vector machine (SVM) classification strategy are considered. Simulations show promising results with both methods, with SVMs outperforming ANNs for the more demanding classification scenarios.

Existing studies provide theoretical upper bounds on the size of neural networks that are unrealistic to implement. This work provides a computational study for estimating the size of neural networks using as an estimation parameter the size of available training data. We will also show that the size of a neural network is problem dependent and that one only needs the number of available training data to determine the size of the required network for achieving high classification rate. We use for our experiments a threshold neural network that combines the perceptron algorithm with simulated annealing and we tested our results on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Learning algorithms that use this concept to learn include neural networks (Single Layer Perceptron and Recursive Deterministic Perceptron), and kernel machines (Support Vector Machines). Several algorithms for testing linear separability exist. Some of these methods are computationally intense. Also, several of them will converge if the classes are linearly separable, but will fail to converge otherwise. A fast and efficient test for non linear separability is proposed which can be used to pretest classification data sets for non linear separability thus avoiding expensive computations. This test is based on the convex hull separability method but does not require the computation of the convex hull.

Methods based on hand-coded rule sets are laborous to build and not very reliable. This problem has led to an increasing interest in intrusion detection techniques based upon machine learning or data mining. However, traditional data mining based intrusion detection systems use single classifier in their detection engines. In this paper, we propose a meta learning based method for intrusion detection by MultiBoosting multi classifiers. MultiBoosting can form decision committees by combining AdaBoost with wagging. It is able to harness both AdaBoost's high bias and variance reduction with wagging's superior variance reduction. Experiments results show that MultiBoosting can improve the detection performance of state-of-art machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. Furthermore, we present a Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) based method for reducing network connection features to make MultiBoosting more efficient in real-time network environment, in the meanwhile, keep the detection performance unundermined and in some cases, even further improved.

This technique has become a relevant tool to identify different types of cancer. Several machine learning techniques such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been proposed to this aim. However, common SVM algorithms are based on Euclidean distances which do not reflect accurately the proximities among the sample profiles. The SVM has been extended to work with non-Euclidean dissimilarities. However, no dissimilarity can be considered superior to the others because each one reflects different features of the data. In this paper, we propose to combine several Support Vector Machines that are based on different dissimilarities to improve the performance of classifiers based on a single measure. The experimental results suggest that our method reduces the misclassification errors of classifiers based on a single dissimilarity and a widely used combination strategy such as Bagging.

This paper presents a different, simple approach to the problem of structured pattern recognition, relying on the description of graphs in terms of algebraic binary relations. Maximum-a- posteriori decision rules over relations require the estimation of class-conditional probability density functions (pdf) defined on graphs. A nonparametric technique for the estimation of the pdfs is introduced, on the basis of a factorization of joint probabilities into individual densities that are modeled, in an unsupervised fashion, via Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM training is accomplished applying support vector regression on an unbiased variant of the Parzen Window. The behavior of the estimation algorithm is first demonstrated on a synthetic distribution. Finally, experiments of graph-structured image recognition from the Caltech Benchmark dataset are reported, showing a dramatic improvement over the results (available in the literature) yielded by state-of-the-art connectionist models, for graph processing, namely recursive neural nets and graph neural nets.

Here we present a statistical model that learns a nonlinear representation from the data that reflects abstract, invariant properties of the signal without making requirements about the kind of signal that can be processed. The model has a hierarchy of two layers, with the first layer broadly corresponding to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a second layer to represent higher order structure. We estimate the model using the mathematical framework of Score Matching (SM), a novel method for the estimation of non-normalized statistical models. The model incorporates a squaring nonlinearity, which we propose to be suitable for forming a higher-order code of invariances. Additionally the squaring can be viewed as modelling subspaces to capture residual dependencies, which linear models cannot capture.

Automatic classification of web search results: Product review vs. non-review documents	ASIAN DIGITAL LIBRARIES: LOOKING BACK 10 YEARS AND FORGING NEW FRONTIERS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries	DEC 10-13, 2007	Hanoi, VIETNAM	Minist Sci & Technol Vietnam, IEEE Tech Comm Digital Lib		product review documents; genre classification; snippets; web search results		This study seeks to develop an automatic method to identify product review documents on the Web using the snippets (summary information that includes the URL, title, and summary text) returned by the Web search engine. The aim is to allow the user to extend topical search with genre-based filtering or categorization. Firstly we applied a common machine learning technique, SVM (Support Vector Machine), to investigate which features of the snippets are useful for classification. The best results were obtained using just the title and URL (domain and folder names) of the snippets as phrase terms (n-grams). Then we developed a heuristic approach that utilizes domain knowledge constructed semi-automatically, and found that it performs comparatively well, with only a small drop in accuracy rates. A hybrid approach which combines both the machine learning and heuristic approaches performs slightly better than the machine learning approach alone.

However, social tagging depends on individual knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of tags in describing the resources using support vector machines via classification. We achieved precision and recall at 90.22% and 99.27% respectively, with an average accuracy of 89.84%. Our results show that tags may help users' group resources into broad categories.

The Tactile Graphics Assistant (TGA) and accompanying workflow is described. Components of the TGA that identify text and replace it with Braille use machine learning, computational geometry, and optimization algorithms. We followed through with the ideas in our 2005 paper by creating a more detailed workflow, translating actual images, and analyzing the translation time. Our experience in translating more than 2,300 figures from 4 textbooks demonstrates that figures can be translated in ten minutes or less of human time on average. We describe our experience with training tactile graphics specialists to use the new TGA technology.

The stationary CTI-II uses the time delay and integrate readout mode with a mosaic of CCDs to generate over 100 gigapixels per night which are required to be analyzed within a day of observation. We are attempting to develop robust machine learning techniques that use multiple scientific and engineering data streams to classify objects within an image frame and the image frame itself. We propose the use of Bayesian belief nets as both classifiers and as tools to integrate and explore the data streams. This initial report explores the use of Bayesian networks as source/noise separators.

Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines(SVM) and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task. Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of input feature vectors impacts on the classification speed. The kernel parameters setting for SVM in a training process, impacts on the classification accuracy. Feature selection is another factor that impacts classification accuracy. The objective of this work is to reduce the dimension of feature vectors, optimizing the parameters to improve the SVM classification accuracy and speed. In order to improve classification speed we spent rough sets theory to reduce the feature vector space. We present a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection and parameters optimization to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate our method is more effective than traditional SVM methods and other traditional methods.

Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task. Unfortunately, automatic classifiers often conduct misclassifications. Folksonomy, a new manual classification scheme based on tagging efforts of users with freely chosen keywords can effective resolve this problem. In folksonomy, a user attaches tags to an item for their own classification, and they reflect many one's viewpoints. Since tags are chosen from users' vocabulary and contain many one's viewpoints, classification results are easy to understand for ordinary users. Even though the scalability of folksonomy is much higher than the other manual classification schemes, the method cannot deal with tremendous number of items such as whole weblog articles on the Internet. For the purpose of solving this problem, we propose a new classification method FSVMC (folisonomy and support vector machine classifier). The FSVMC uses support vector machines as a Tag-agent which is a program to determine whether a particular tag should be attached to a weblog page and Folksonomy dedicates to categorize the weblog articles. In addition, we propose a method to create a candidate tag database which is a list of tags that may be attached to weblog pages. Experimental results indicate our method is more flexible and effective than traditional methods.

It then discusses the generalisation of these ideas to self-organising spike-coding networks. A mismatch between the resulting spike-learning algorithm and the known physiological processes of synaptic plasticity is then used as a motivation to introduce the rather obvious idea that neurons are not sending their information to other neurons, but to synapses - more microscopic structures. This prompts a survey of other inter-level communications in the brain and inside cells. It is proposed on the basis of this that information flows all the way up and down the reductionist hierarchy - an idea that transforms many of our ideas about machine learning and neuroscience.

In fact, it is possible to see that generalized maxent problems, often in disguise, do play a significant role in machine learning and statistics. Deviations from the classic form of the problem are typically used to incorporate some form of prior knowledge. Sometimes that knowledge would be difficult or impossible to represent with only linear constraints or an initial guess for the density. To clarify these connections, a good place to start is the classic maxent problem. This can then be generalized until the problem encompasses a large class of problems studied by the machine learning community. Relaxed constraints, generalizations of Shannon-Boltzmann-Gibbs (SBG) entropy and a few tools from convex analysis make the task relatively straightforward. In the examples discussed, the original maxent problem remains embedded as a special case, Providing a trail back to the original maxent problem will highlight the potential for cross-fertilization between the two fields.

Predicting HIV resistance would be much easier if we could directly use the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the targeted protein sequences, but unfortunately we rarely have enough structural information available to train a neural network. Fur-thermore, prediction of the 3D structure of a protein is not straightforward. However, characteristics related to the 3D structure can be used to train a machine learning algorithm as an alternative to take into account the information of the protein folding in the 3D space. Here, starting from this philosophy, we select the amino acid energies as features to predict HIV drug resistance, using a specific topology of a neural network. In this paper, we demonstrate that the amino acid ener-gies are good features to represent the HIV genotype. In addi-tion, it was shown that Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks can be used as an efficient classification method for this prob-lem. The prediction performance that was obtained was greater than or at least comparable to results obtained previously. The accuracies vary between 81.3% and 94.7%.

We compare the DIMLP neural hybrid model to several machine learning algorithms. The clear advantage of this neural hybrid system is its transparency. In fact, the classification strategy of DIMLPs is almost completely encoded into the extracted rules. During cross-validation trials and in the majority of the situations, DIMLPs demonstrated to be at least as accurate as support vector machines, which is one of the most accurate classifiers of the text categorization domain. In the future, in order to further increase DIMLP accuracy, we believe that common sense knowledge could be easily inserted and refined with the use of symbolic rules.

A classical way to deal with unknown values is missing data estimation. Most machine learning techniques work well with missing values, but they do not focus the missing data estimation to solve the classification task. This paper(1) presents effective neural network approaches based on Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for pattern classification with missing inputs. These MTL networks are compared with representative,procedures used for handling incomplete data on two well-known data sets. The experimental results show the superiority of our approaches with respect to alternative techniques.

We employ these findings in a machine-learning metaparameter context, and dynamically couple an adaptive agent's artificial affect to its action-selection mechanism (Boltzmann beta). The agent's performance on two important learning problems is measured. The first consists of learning to cope with two alternating goals. The second consists of learning to prefer a later larger reward (global optimum) for an earlier smaller one (local optimum). Results show that, compared to several control conditions, coupling positive affect to exploitation and negative affect to exploration has several important benefits. In the alternating-goal task, it significantly reduces the agent's goal-switch search peak. The agent finds its new goal faster. In the second task, artificial affect facilitates convergence to a global instead of a local optimum, while permitting to exploit that local optimum. We conclude that affect-controlled action-selection has adaptation benefits.

The state-of-the-art approach is to perform clustering and then compute a functional characterization via enrichments by Gene Ontology terms [1]. To better assist the interpretation of results, it may be Useful to establish connections among different clusters. This machine learning step is sometimes termed cluster meta-analysis, and several approaches have already been proposed; in particular, they usually rely on enrichments based on flat lists of GO terms. However, GO terms are organized in taxonomical graphs, whose structure should be taken into account when performing enrichment studies. To tackle this problem, we propose a kernel approach that can exploit such structured graphical nature. Finally, we compare our approach against a specific flat list method by analyzing the cdc15-subset of the well known Spellman's Yeast Cell Cycle dataset [2].

Previous attempts at gene expression analysis have typically used a linear dimensionality reduction method such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Linear dimensionality reduction methods do not however account for the inherent nonlinearity within the data. The motivation behind this work is to demonstrate that nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are more adept at capturing the nonlinearity within the data compared to linear methods, and hence would result in better classification and potentially aid in the visualization and identification of new data classes. Consequently, in this paper, we empirically compare the performance of 3 commonly used linear versus 3 nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques from the perspective of (a) distinguishing objects belonging to cancer and non-cancer classes and (b) new class discovery in high dimensional gene and protein expression studies for different types of cancer. Quantitative evaluation using a support vector machine and a decision tree classifier revealed statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy by using nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods compared to linear methods.

Naive Bayes assumes positional independence, which makes the computation of the joint probability value easier at the expense of the accuracy or the underlying reality. In addition, the prior probabilities of positive and negative instances are computed from the training instances, which often do not accurately reflect the real prior probabilities. In this paper we address these two issues. We have developed algorithms that automatically perturb the computed prior probabilities and search around the neighborhood to maximize a given objective function. To improve the prediction accuracy we introduce limited dependency on the underlying pattern. We have demonstrated the importance of these extensions by applying them to solve the problem in discriminating a TATA box from putative TATA boxes found in promoter regions of plant genome. The best prediction accuracy of a naive Bayes with 10 fold cross validation was 69% while the second extension gave the prediction accuracy of 79% which is better than the best solution from an artificial neural network prediction.

In this paper, we propose a SVM classifier fusion model using genetic fuzzy system. Genetic algorithms are applied to tune the optimal fuzzy membership functions. The performance of SVM classifiers are evaluated by their AUCs. Our experiments show that AUC-based genetic fuzzy SVM fusion model produces not only better AUC but also better accuracy than individual SVM classifiers.

Predicting the secondary structure of a protein is an important step for determining its tertiary structure and thus its function. This paper explores the protein secondary structure problem using a novel feature selection algorithm combined with a machine learning approach based on random forests. For feature reduction, we propose an algorithm that uses a graph theoretical approach which finds cliques in the non-position specific evolutionary profiles of proteins obtained from BLOSUM62. Then, the features selected by this algorithm are used for condensing the position specific evolutionary information obtained from PSI-BLAST. Our results show that we are able to save significant amount of space and time and still achieve high accuracy results even when the features of the data are 25% reduced.

We treat structure prediction as an optimization problem, using parameterizable cost functions representing biological "pseudoenergies". Machine learning methods are applied to estimate the values of the parameters to correctly predict known protein structures. Results: Focusing on the prediction of alpha helices in proteins, we show that a model with 302 parameters can achieve a Q a value of 77.6% and an SOV a value of 73.4%. Such performance numbers are among the best for techniques that do not rely on external databases (such as multiple sequence alignments). Further, it is easier to extract biological significance from a model with so few parameters. Conclusion: The method presented shows promise for the prediction of protein secondary structure. Biophysically-motivated elementary free-energies can be learned using SVM techniques to construct an energy cost function whose predictive performance rivals state-of-the-art. This method is general and can be extended beyond the all-alpha case described here.

Computational approaches to this problem are important to complement high-throughput technologies and to help biologists in designing new experiments. In this work, we focus on the completion of a biological network from various sources of experimental data. Results: We propose a new machine learning approach for the supervised inference of biological networks, which is based on a kernelization of the output space of regression trees. It inherits several features of tree-based algorithms such as interpretability, robustness to irrelevant variables, and input scalability. We applied this method to the inference of two kinds of networks in the yeast S. cerevisiae: a protein-protein interaction network and an enzyme network. In both cases, we obtained results competitive with existing approaches. We also show that our method provides relevant insights on input data regarding their potential relationship with the existence of interactions. Furthermore, we confirm the biological validity of our predictions in the context of an analysis of gene expression data.

J	Henschel, A; Winter, C; Kim, WK; Schroeder, M				Henschel, Andreas; Winter, Christof; Kim, Wan Kyu; Schroeder, Michael			Using structural motif descriptors for sequence-based binding site prediction	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Automated Function Prediction Meeting	AUG 30-SEP 01, 2006	La Jolla, CA				PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; PHYLOGENETIC PROFILES; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; DATABASE; INTERFACES; FAMILIES; BIOLOGY; ALIGNMENT	Background: Many protein sequences are still poorly annotated. Functional characterization of a protein is often improved by the identification of its interaction partners. Here, we aim to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI) and protein-ligand interactions (PLI) on sequence level using 3D information. To this end, we use machine learning to compile sequential segments that constitute structural features of an interaction site into one profile Hidden Markov Model descriptor. The resulting collection of descriptors can be used to screen sequence databases in order to predict functional sites. Results: We generate descriptors for 740 classified types of protein-protein binding sites and for more than 3,000 protein-ligand binding sites. Cross validation reveals that two thirds of the PPI descriptors are sufficiently conserved and significant enough to be used for binding site recognition. We further validate 230 PPIs that were extracted from the literature, where we additionally identify the interface residues. Finally we test ligand-binding descriptors for the case of ATP. From sequences with Swiss-Prot annotation "ATP-binding", we achieve a recall of 25% with a precision of 89%, whereas Prosite's P-loop motif recognizes an equal amount of hits at the expense of a much higher number of false positives (precision: 57%). Our method yields 771 hits with a precision of 96% that were not previously picked up by any Prosite-pattern. Conclusion: The automatically generated descriptors are a useful complement to known Prosite/InterPro motifs. They serve to predict protein-protein as well as protein-ligand interactions along with their binding site residues for proteins where merely sequence information is available.

J	Landry, M; Winters-Hilt, S				Landry, Matthew; Winters-Hilt, Stephen			Analysis of nanopore detector measurements using Machine-Learning methods, with application to single-molecule kinetic analysis	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Background: A nanopore detector has a nanometer-scale trans-membrane channel across which a potential difference is established, resulting in an ionic current through the channel in the pA-nA range. A distinctive channel current blockade signal is created as individually "captured" DNA molecules interact with the channel and modulate the channel's ionic current. The nanopore detector is sensitive enough that nearly identical DNA molecules can be classified with very high accuracy using machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Results: A non-standard implementation of an HMM, emission inversion, is used for improved classification. Additional features are considered for the feature vector employed by the SVM for classification as well: The addition of a single feature representing spike density is shown to notably improve classification results. Another, much larger, feature set expansion was studied (2500 additional features instead of 1), deriving from including all the HMM's transition probabilities. The expanded features can introduce redundant, noisy information (as well as diagnostic information) into the current feature set, and thus degrade classification performance. A hybrid Adaptive Boosting approach was used for feature selection to alleviate this problem. Conclusion: The methods shown here, for more informed feature extraction, improve both classification and provide biologists and chemists with tools for obtaining a better understanding of the kinetic properties of molecules of interest.

J	Melvin, I; Ie, E; Kuang, R; Weston, J; Stafford, WN; Leslie, C				Melvin, Iain; Ie, Eugene; Kuang, Rui; Weston, Jason; Stafford, William Noble; Leslie, Christina			SVM- Fold: a tool for discriminative multi- class protein fold and superfamily recognition	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Automated Function Prediction Meeting	AUG 30-SEP 01, 2006	La Jolla, CA				CLASSIFICATION; SEQUENCES; DATABASE; KERNELS	Background: Predicting a protein's structural class from its amino acid sequence is a fundamental problem in computational biology. Much recent work has focused on developing new representations for protein sequences, called string kernels, for use with support vector machine ( SVM) classifiers. However, while some of these approaches exhibit state-of-the-art performance at the binary protein classification problem, i.e. discriminating between a particular protein class and all other classes, few of these studies have addressed the real problem of multi-class superfamily or fold recognition. Moreover, there are only limited software tools and systems for SVM-based protein classification available to the bioinformatics community. Results: We present a new multi-class SVM-based protein fold and superfamily recognition system and web server called SVM-Fold, which can be found at http://svm-fold.c2b2.columbia.edu. Our system uses an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art string kernel for sequence profiles, called the profile kernel, where the underlying feature representation is a histogram of inexact matching k-mer frequencies. We also employ a novel machine learning approach to solve the difficult multi-class problem of classifying a sequence of amino acids into one of many known protein structural classes. Binary one-vs-the-rest SVM classifiers that are trained to recognize individual structural classes yield prediction scores that are not comparable, so that standard "one-vs-all" classification fails to perform well. Moreover, SVMs for classes at different levels of the protein structural hierarchy may make useful predictions, but one-vs-all does not try to combine these multiple predictions. To deal with these problems, our method learns relative weights between one-vs-the-rest classifiers and encodes information about the protein structural hierarchy for multi-class prediction. In large-scale benchmark results based on the SCOP database, our code weighting approach significantly improves on the standard one-vs-all method for both the superfamily and fold prediction in the remote homology setting and on the fold recognition problem. Moreover, our code weight learning algorithm strongly outperforms nearest-neighbor methods based on PSI-BLAST in terms of prediction accuracy on every structure classification problem we consider. Conclusion: By combining state-of-the-art SVM kernel methods with a novel multi-class algorithm, the SVM-Fold system delivers efficient and accurate protein fold and superfamily recognition.

In this study, we focus on one specific kind of literature mining task, i.e., detecting definitions of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols in biomedical text. We denote acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols as short forms (SFs) and their corresponding definitions as long forms (LFs). The study was designed to answer the following questions; i) how well a system performs in detecting LFs from novel text, ii) what the coverage is for various terminological knowledge bases in including SFs as synonyms of their LFs, and iii) how to combine results from various SF knowledge bases. Method: We evaluated the following three publicly available detection systems in detecting LFs for SFs: i) a handcrafted pattern/rule based system by Ao and Takagi, ALICE, ii) a machine learning system by Chang et al., and iii) a simple alignment-based program by Schwartz and Hearst. In addition, we investigated the conceptual coverage of two terminological knowledge bases: i) the UMLS (the Unified Medical Language System), and ii) the BioThesaurus (a thesaurus of names for all UniProt protein records). We also implemented a web interface that provides a virtual integration of various SF knowledge bases. Results: We found that detection systems agree with each other on most cases, and the existing terminological knowledge bases have a good coverage of synonymous relationship for frequently defined LFs. The web interface allows people to detect SF definitions from text and to search several SF knowledge bases.

Clustering protein environments for function prediction: finding PROSITE motifs in 3D	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Automated Function Prediction Meeting	AUG 30-SEP 01, 2006	La Jolla, CA				SITES; CLASSIFICATION; RESIDUES; TOOL	Background: Structural genomics initiatives are producing increasing numbers of three-dimensional (3D) structures for which there is little functional information. Structure-based annotation of molecular function is therefore becoming critical. We previously presented FEATURE, a method for describing microenvironments around functional sites in proteins. However, FEATURE uses supervised machine learning and so is limited to building models for sites of known importance and location. We hypothesized that there are a large number of sites in proteins that are associated with function that have not yet been recognized. Toward that end, we have developed a method for clustering protein microenvironments in order to evaluate the potential for discovering novel sites that have not been previously identified. Results: We have prototyped a computational method for rapid clustering of millions of microenvironments in order to discover residues whose surrounding environments are similar and which may therefore share a functional or structural role. We clustered nearly 2,000,000 environments from 9,600 protein chains and defined 4,550 clusters. As a preliminary validation, we asked whether known 3D environments associated with PROSITE motifs were "rediscovered". We found examples of clusters highly enriched for residues that share PROSITE sequence motifs. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that we can cluster protein environments successfully using a simplified representation and K-means clustering algorithm. The rediscovery of known 3D motifs allows us to calibrate the size and intercluster distances that characterize useful clusters. This information will then allow us to find new clusters with similar characteristics that represent novel structural or functional sites.

Traditionally, microtubule behavior is quantified by manually tracking individual microtubules in time-lapse images under various experimental conditions. Manual analysis is laborious, approximate, and often offers limited analytical capability in extracting potentially valuable information from the data. Results: In this work, we present computer vision and machine-learning based methods for extracting novel dynamics information from time-lapse images. Using actual microtubule data, we estimate statistical models of microtubule behavior that are highly effective in identifying common and distinct characteristics of microtubule dynamic behavior. Conclusion: Computational methods provide powerful analytical capabilities in addition to traditional analysis methods for studying microtubule dynamic behavior. Novel capabilities, such as building and querying microtubule image databases, are introduced to quantify and analyze microtubule dynamic behavior.

In the field of data mining, failures are mainly thought to be caused by the limitations inherent in the data itself, which stem from different reasons for creating data files and their various applications. One of the proposed ways of dealing with these kinds of shortcomings is to employ classifier ensembles. Their application involves creating a set of models for the same data file or for different subsets of a specified data file. Although in many cases this approach results in a visible increase of classification accuracy, it considerably complicates, or, in some cases, effectively hinders interpretation of the obtained results. The reasons for this are the methods of defining learning tasks which rely on randomizing. The purpose of this paper is to present an idea for using data contexts to define learning tasks for classifier ensembles. The achieved results are promising.

In this paper, we argue that label ranking is an amenable task from a CBR point of view and, in particular, is more amenable to supporting case-based problem solving than standard classification. Moreover, by developing a case-based approach to label ranking, we will show that, the other way round, concepts and techniques from CBR are also useful for label ranking. In addition to an experimental study in which case-based label ranking is compared to conventional nearest neighbor classification, we present an application in which label ranking is used for node ordering in heuristic search.

The need arises from two important and closely related topics in performance evaluation, namely, workload modeling and performance prediction. Both topics rely heavily on the representative workload data and have their arsenal from statistics and machine learning. Nevertheless, their goals and the nature of research differ considerably. Workload modeling aims at building mathematical models to generate workloads that can be used in simulation-based performance evaluation studies. It should statistically resemble the original real-world data therefore marginal statistics and second-order properties such as autocorrelation and power spectrum are important matching criteria. Performance prediction, on the other hand, intends to provide real-time forecast of important performance metrics (such as application run time and queue wait time) which can support Grid scheduling decisions. From this perspective prediction accuracy as well as performance should be considered to evaluate candidate techniques. My PhD research focuses primarily on these two topics in space-shared, data-intensive Grid environments. Starting from a comprehensive work-load analysis with emphasis oil the correlation structures and the scaling behavior several basic job arrival patterns such as pseudo-periodicity and long range dependence are identified. Models are further proposed to capture these important arrival patterns and a complete workload model including run time is being investigated. The strong autocorrelations present in run time and queue wait time series inspire the research for performance prediction based on learning from historical data. Techniques based on a Instance Based Learning algorithm and several improvements are proposed and empirically evaluated. Research plans are proposed to use the results of work-load modeling and performance prediction in the evaluation of scheduling strategies in data-intensive Grid environments.

The data mining methodology while extracting useful, valid patterns from higher education database environment contribute to proactively ensuring students maximize their academic output. This paper develops a methodology by the derivation of performance prediction indicators to deploying a simple student performance assessment and monitoring system within a teaching and learning environment by mainly focusing on performance monitoring of students' continuous assessment (tests) and examination scores in order to predict their final achievement status upon graduation. Based on various data mining techniques (DMT) and the application of machine learning processes, rules are derived that enable the classification of students in their predicted classes. The deployment of the prototyped solution, integrates measuring, 'recycling' and reporting procedures in the new system to optimize prediction accuracy.			ogor@tciway.tc					ALLENBY GM, 1999, J ECONOMETRICS; Barker Kash, 2004, P 2004 SYST INF ENG, P79; COUNCIL N, 2001, KNOWING WHAT STUDENT; Delavari Naeimeh, 2005, ITHET 6 ANN INT C JU, pF4B; FRAWLEY WJ, 1997, KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, P1; Lakshminarayan K, 1996, P 2 INT C KNOWL DISC, P140; Luan J., 2002, DATA MINING KNOWLEDG; LUAN J, 2001, AIR C LONG BEACH CA, P1; Luau J., 2002, DATA MINING ITS APPL; MICHALSKI RS, 1978, 897 ISG; NOLAN J, 1998, AAAI IAAI P, P1134; RUBENKING N, 2001, PC MAGAZINE     0522; Shavelson R.

The algorithm storage system (ASS) was design to facilitate switching efficiently between different ways of performing a task. It was developed for a 10m long blimp that had 4 operational stages with a different vehicle model for each one; hence the need of an architectural subsystem that could manage the different maneuvers that the blimp had to carry out The system can be easily transferred to any automated vehicle and is an important component in the development of high level artificial intelligence. The paper discusses possible applications such as reinforcement learning, machine learning, multiagent learning and experience gathering.	[Lopera, Luis.

The game records some features during the interaction with players in order to correlate their choices with their gestures, such as mouse tracking, and eye movement etc. Through a 3D interactive video game interface, we are combining an approach using neural networks systems and the Enneagram theory of personality to produce a machine learning engine that is capable of extracting some specific traits of intentionality of the user after one session of playing the game. We conclude by reporting the results of this engine and its internal structure and discuss some theoretical and practical challenges.

Despite the fact that the computer-controlled agents in such games often possess abilities far in advance of the limits imposed on human participants, competent players are capable of easily beating their artificial opponents suggesting that approaches based on the analysis and imitation of human play may produce superior agents, both in terms of performance and believability. The very fact that games provide the ability to quickly and easily generate vast quantities of raw, objective human behavioural data presents many fascinating opportunities to the AI community; opportunities which, with few exceptions, have not yet been suitably explored. Through our work in the field of imitation learning, we therefore investigate how best to utilise the low-level data accrued from recorded game sessions in the creation of intelligent, convincingly human game agents. In previous contributions, we have described models capable of imitating goal-oriented strategic navigation (Gorman & Humphrys 2005) and of reproducing characteristically human movement in first-person shooter games (Gorman, Thurau, Bauckhage & Humphrys 2006a); we have also outlined a comprehensive approach to the evaluation of agent believability (Gorman et al 2006b). Here, we present an approach to the imitation of combat behaviours in such environments. We first describe the extraction and processing of relevant feature vectors from the game session using our custom-built QASE API (Gorman, Fredriksson & Humphrys 2005). We then outline a neural-network based model designed to learn the aiming and context-sensitive weapon handling exhibited by the human players. Finally, we describe an experiment to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach; some observations and future directions for our work close this contribution.

Because testing all possible models is not (and will never be) feasible, we need intelligent tools to combine human expert knowledge, the knowledge extracted by means of computational intelligence and different search strategies to disclose the nature of a problem and provide attractive models. We present some techniques, we have successfully used in our meta-learning approaches, describe the crucial ideas of our general architecture for meta-learning, and show some examples.

What kind of data structures can be learned from data with existing machine learning algorithms? Neurocognitive inspirations show why existing learning systems cannot compete with biological ones. They point the way to more efficient algorithms, generating simplest reliable models of data and capable of object recognition with undetermined number of features. The goal of learning in neural networks and other systems is to transform data into linearly separable data clusters. This is sufficient for relatively simple problems, but makes learning almost impossible if the logic inherent in data is complex. New non-separable targets for learning are introduced to simplify learning and to characterize non-separable problems into classes of growing complexity.

In this study, the SCEM-UA algorithm developed by Vrugt is employed for parameters selection of Support Vector Regression (SVR). The SCEM-UA algorithm, which operates by merging the strengths of the Metropolis algorithm, controlled random search, competitive evolution, and complex shuffling, can avoid the tendency of falling into local minima. The proposed method was tested on a complicated nonlinearly runoff forecasting. The results illustrated that SCEM-UA algorithm can successfully identify the optimal parameters of SVR than grid search method, and can achieve an accurate prediction.

We combine TD (lambda) with Monte Carlo sampling to solve a typical imperfect information game - Junqi. Static linear method and TD (lambda) approach are compared. The static linear evaluation is used with all its parameters unchanged whereas the TD (lambda) approach updates its parameters according to the actual outcomes. It is demonstrated that this algorithm led to a population of intelligent agents successful playing Junqi against human beings with the search depth of 4.

At the first FFT features are extracted from the vibration signal and cutting force in cutting process, then FFT vectors are presorted and coded into code book of integer numbers by SOM, and these code books are introduced to DHMM for machine learning to build up 3-HMMs for different tool wear stage. And then, pattern of HMM is recognised by using maximum probability. Finally the results of tool wear recognition and failure prediction experiments are presented and show that the methodproposed is effective.

This paper presents a comparative study of using supervised probabilistic and predictive machine learning techniques for intrusion detection. Two probabilistic techniques Naive Bayes and Gaussian and two predictive techniques Decision Tree and Random Forests are employed. Different training datasets constructed from the KDD99 dataset are employed for training. The ability of each technique for detecting four attack categories (DoS,Probe,R2L and U2R) have been compared. The statistical results to show the sensitivity of each technique to the population of attacks in a dataset have also been reported. We compare the performance of the techniques and also investigate the robustness of each technique by calculating their standard deviations with respect to the detection rate of each attack category.

Experimental data includes the synthesis results of a multi-level factorial experimental design of the system TEA: SiO(2):Na(2)O:Al(2)O(3):H(2)O. The few parameters of the SVM model were studied and the fitting performance is compared with the ones obtained with other machine learning models such as neural networks and classification trees. SVM models show very good prediction performances and general eralization capacity in zeolite synthesis prediction. They may overcome overfitting problems observed sometimes for neural networks. It is also studied the influence of the type of material descriptors used as model output.

This paper applies the Graph Neural Network for the first time to a given learning task at an international competition on the classification of semi-structured documents. Within this setting, the Graph Neural Network is trained to encode and process a relatively large set of XML formatted documents. It will be shown that the performance using the Graph Neural Network approach significantly outperforms the results submitted by the best competitor.

The consequence of the strict structural document description via XML is that a relatively new task in mining documents based on structural and/or content information has emerged. In this paper we investigate (1) the suitability of new unsupervised machine learning methods for the clustering task of XML documents, and (2) the importance of contextual information for the same task. These tasks are part of an international competition on XML clustering and categorization (INEX 2006). It will be shown that the proposed approaches provide a suitable tool for the clustering of structured data as they yield the best results in the international INEX 2006 competition on clustering of XML data.

We propose a machine learning approach where the mapping between input and target documents is learned from examples. Complex transformations can be learned using only pairs of input and corresponding target documents. From a machine learning point of view, the structure mapping task raises important complexity challenges. Hence we propose an original model which scales well to real world applications. We provide learning and inference procedures with low complexity. The model sequentially builds the target XML document by processing the input document node per node. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model on two structure mapping tasks. Up to our knowledge, there are no other model yet able to solve these tasks.

First we introduce a threshold d of possibility (0:56:51). Then, we formulate new measures for an attribute selection called a gain with possibility, a gain ratio with possibility and a GINI index with possibility. An intuitive idea for the gain and the gain ratio with possibility is that, for a probability p of the class +, the probability 1-p of the class-is replaced with max(d-p,0) and one for the GINI index with possibility that the value lis replaced with d. Under the above new measures, we design a new algorithm to construct decision trees with possibility of which leaf is labeled by either d+ or -. Finally, we construct decision trees separating MRSA data from MSSA data in bacterial culture data by the new algorithm.

However, they were not frequently used mainly due to the poor user interfaceand the lack in learning new knowledge. However, the solutions of these two problems have been introduced since 1990s. For the latter problem, machine learning methods have provided several solutions, and for the former problem, the rapid progress of webtechnologies enables us to implement a good user interface. Furthermore, recent advances in computer resources strengthen these two solutions. In this paper, we focus on the application of knowledge engineering techniques to medical mobile communication network, where the web intelligence technologies are used for an efficient interface of medical expert system. Then, the system was put on the internet to provide an intelligent decision support in tele-medicine and is now being evaluated by region medicalhome doctors. The results show that such an internet-based medical decision support enables home doctors to take a quick action to the applied domain.

While the SOA paradigm provides flexibility and agility to better respond to changing business requirements, the task of assessing the reliability of SOA-based systems is challenging, especially for composite services. However, deriving high confidence reliability estimates for mission-critical systems can require huge costs and time. This paper presents a reliability assessment and prediction model for SOA-based systems. The services are assumed to be realized with reuse and logical composition of components. The model uses AI reasoning techniques on dynamically collected failure data of each service and its components as one of the evidences together with results from random testing. Memory-Based Reasoning technique and Bayesian Belief Networks are used as reasoning tools to guide the prediction analysis. The least tested and "high usage" input subdomains are identified and necessary remedial actions are taken depending on the predicted results from the proposed model. The model is illustrated using a simulated case study based on a real-time dataset from the NASA soft-ware repository.

Developers get benefit from COTS-based development (CBD) environment to select suitable components, adopt and integrate into the system that to achieve better software, more quickly and lower cost. But the current environment didn't support the typical of CBD process in all processes [1]. Some environments are support in some steps or focus on how to develop the components and components interoperability that allow in the same environment. In this paper we propose a new environment tool called "CS-COTS" are consist of (1) Sophisticate machine learning tools for generating rules in selection and integration. (2) Guideline for selecting methods category. (3) Predict a success rate to integrate methods fit into system.

To generalize the history-only prediction to algorithms that include other sources such as page size and priority levels in determining pre-load pages, we present, in this paper, a new prediction scheme that considers not only multiple attributes for page selection, but also the computational complexity side of the algorithm. The idea is an extension to our earlier matrix application in machine learning web cache pre-fetching. We use real world data to test the efficiency of the new algorithm. Results show that system performance measured by hit rate is greatly increased by prediction and prefetching, especially for small size caches. In addition, we introduce a user access model that is based on sequence and group user actions to simulate the request pattern. Data generated from the input model are compared with that from the real world.

Once created the Bayesian network enabled us to do the following: 1) to draw inferences in relation to the environmental impact for points in a grid covering the studied area, for incorporation in a geographical information system and creating an environmental impact map; 2) to better understand the structure of relationships between mining tasks and different environmental variables; and 3) to draw on a knowledge system that is enriched each time new data is added.

In this paper, we show that the problem can be formulated in a general supervised learning context. Emphasis is on two widely used non-parametric techniques known as the Delta test and the Gamma test. Under some regularity assumptions, a novel proof of convergence of the two estimators is formulated and subsequently verified and compared on two meaningful study cases.

Improving the performance of the RBF neural networks trained with imbalanced samples	COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks	JUN 20-22, 2007	San Sebastian, SPAIN				CLASSIFICATION	Recently, the class imbalance problem in neural networks, is receiving growing attention in works of machine learning and data mining. This problem appears when the samples of some classes are much smaller than those in the other classes. The classes with small size can be ignored in the learning process and the convergence of these classes is very slow. This paper studies empirically the class imbalance problem in the context of the RBF neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. We propose to introduce a cost function in the training process to compensate imbalance class and one strategy to reduce the impact of the cost function in the data probability distribution.

However, in real prediction problems this is not usually the case for different reasons. For example, the training set is not usually representative of the whole problem due to sample selection biases during its acquisition. In addition, the measurement biases in training could be different than in test (for example, when the measurement devices are different). Another reason is that in real prediction tasks the statistical structure of the classes is not usually static but evolves in time, and there is usually a time lag between training and test sets. Due to these different problems, the performance of a learning algorithm can severely degrade. Here we present a new learning strategy that constructs a classifier in two steps. First, the labeled examples of the training set are used for constructing a statistical model of the problem. In the second step, the model is improved using the unlabeled patterns of the test set by means of a novel extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm presented here. We show the convergence properties of the algorithm and illustrate its performance with an artificial problem. Finally we demonstrate its strengths in a heart disease diagnosis problem where the training set is taken from a different hospital than the test set.

However, the classical methods are restricted to data embedded in a real vector space and have only limited applicability to noneuclidean data as occurs in, for example, biomedical or symbolic fields. Recently, extensions of unsupervised neural prototype based clustering to dissimilarity data, i.e. data characterized in terms of a dissimilarity matrix only, have been proposed substituting the mean by the so-called generalized median. Thereby, the location of prototypes is chosen within the discrete input space which constitutes a severe limitation in particular for sparse data sets since the prototype flexibility is restricted. Here we present a generalization of median neural gas such that prototypes can be interpreted as mixtures of discrete input locations. We derive a batch optimization scheme based on a corresponding cost function.

Nevertheless,. they are applicable to functional approximation problems and there are however several of them available: SVM for regression, Gaussian Process Regression and Least Squares SVM (LS-SVM) for instance. This paper applies and studies these algorithms to a number of Time Series Prediction problems and compares them with some more conventional techniques.

Machine learning techniques such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) have achieved a high accuracy filtering the spam messages. However, a certain amount of legitimate emails are often classified as spam (false positive errors) although this kind of errors are prohibitively expensive. In this paper we address the problem of reducing particularly the false positive errors in anti-spam email filters based on the SVM. To this aim, an ensemble of SVMs that combines multiple dissimilarities is proposed. The experimental results suggest that the new method outperforms classifiers based solely on a single dissimilarity and a widely used combination strategy such as bagging.

The evidence base can be heterogeneous, involving both qualitative knowledge and measured quantitative data. Machine Learning (ML) methods have also begun to establish themselves as an alternative and promising approach to computer-based data analysis in oncology, as this field moves gradually away from being the preserve of traditional statistical analysis. In this paper, we describe the main areas of cancer research in which ML methods are currently being applied, and briefly discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of their application.

We summarize some studies related to brain tumour research in Europe, based on the metabolic information provided by in vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and transcriptomic profiling observed by DNA microarrays. The first result presents the improvement in brain tumour diagnosis by combining Long TE and Short TE single voxel MR Spectra. Afterwards, a mixture model for binned and truncated data to characterize and classify MRS is reviewed. The classification of Glioblastomas Multiforme and Meningothelial Meningiomas using single-labeling cDNA-based microarrays was studied as proof of principle in the incorporation of genomic information to clinical diagnosis. Finally, we present a Decision Support System for in-vivo classification of brain tumours were the best inferred classifiers are deployed for their clinical use.

The fuzzy lattice reasoning (FLR) classifier for mining environmental data	Computational Intelligence Based on Lattice Theory	STUDIES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA				FRAMEWORK	This chapter introduces a rule-based perspective on the framework of fuzzy lattices, and the Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR) classifier. The notion of fuzzy lattice rules is introduced, and a training algorithm for inducing a fuzzy lattice rule engine from data is specified. The role of positive valuation functions for specifying fuzzy lattices is underlined and non-linear (sigmoid) positive valuation functions are proposed, that is an additional novelty of the chapter. The capacities for learning of the FLR classifier using both linear and sigmoid functions are demonstrated in a real-world application domain, that of air quality assessment. To tackle common problems related to ambient air quality, a machine learning approach is demonstrated in two applications. The first one is for the prediction of the daily vegetation index, using a dataset from Athens, Greece. The second concerns with the estimation of quartely ozone concentration levels, using a dataset from Valencia, Spain.

Many statistical models have been used for evaluating the relevance of explanatory variables. However, the decision to participate in the labor market can also be modeled as a binary classification problem. For this reason, in this paper, we compare four techniques to estimate the Female Labor Force Participation. Two of them, Probit and Logit, are from the statistical area, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hamming Clustering (HC) are from the machine learning paradigm. The comparison, performed using data from the Venezuelan Household Survey for the second semester 1999, shows the advantages and disadvantages of the two methodological paradigms that could provide a basic motivation for combining the best of both approaches.

The approach consists of three steps, namely, partitioning, analysis and prediction. A commonly used k-means clustering algorithm is used to partition stock price time series data. After data partition, linear regression is used to analyse the trend within each cluster. The results of the linear regression are then used for trend prediction for windowed time series data. Using our trend prediction methodology, we propose a trading strategy TTP (Trading based on Trend Prediction). Some results of applying TTP to stock trading are reported. The trading performance is compared with some practical trading strategies and other machine learning methods. Given the volatility nature of stock prices the methodology achieved limited success for a few countries and time periods. Further analysis of the results may lead to further improvement in the methodology. Although the proposed approach is designed for stock trading, it can be applied to the trend analysis of any time series, such as the time series of economic indicators.

Comparison of instance-based techniques for learning to predict changes in stock prices	Computational Intelligence in Economics and Finance, Vol II			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Computer Intelligence in Economics and Finance (CIEF 2005)	JUL 21-26, 2005	Salt Lake City, UT			tactical asset allocation; stock price prediction; instance-based learning; WEKA; financial data mining		This paper is a practical guide to the application of instance-based machine learning techniques to the solution of a financial problem. A broad class of instance-based families is considered for classification using the WEKA software package. The problem selected for analysis is a common one in financial and econometric work: the use of publicly available economic data to forecast future changes in a stock market index. This paper examines various stages in the analysis of this problem including: identification of the problem, considerations in obtaining and preprocessing data, model and parameter selection, and interpretation of results. Finally, the paper offers suggestions of areas of future study for applying instance-based machine learning in the setting of solving financial problems.

One of these is the ambiguity of conjunctions in candidate named entity strings, an all-too-prevalent problem in corporate and legal documents. In this paper, we distinguish four uses of the conjunction in these strings, and explore the use of a supervised machine learning approach to conjunction disambiguation trained on a very limited set of 'name internal' features that avoids the need for expensive lexical or semantic resources. We achieve 84% correctly classified examples using k-fold evaluation on a data set of 600 instances. Further improvements are likely to require the use of wider domain knowledge and name external features.

An entity here is defined as a link of all its mentions in text together with the associated attributes. Entity mentions of different types normally exhibit quite different linguistic patterns. Six separate Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models that incorporate character N-gram and word knowledge features are built to detect the extent and the head of three types of mentions, namely named, nominal and pronominal mentions. For each type of mentions, attributes are identified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers which take mention heads and their context as classification features. Mentions can then be merged into a unified entity representation by examining their attributes and connections in a rule-based coreference resolution process. The system is evaluated on ACE 2005 corpus and achieves competitive results.

S	Wang, XL		Gelbukh, A		Wang, Xinglong			Rule-based protein Term Identification with help from automatic species tagging	Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics	FEB 18-24, 2007	Mexico City, MEXICO	IPN, Nat Language & Text Proc Lab			NAME IDENTIFICATION; GENE	In biomedical articles, terms often refer to different protein entities. For example, an arbitrary occurrence of term p53 might denote thousands of proteins across a number of species. A human annotator is able to resolve this ambiguity relatively easily, by looking at its context and if necessary, by searching an appropriate protein database. However, this phenomenon may cause much trouble to a text mining system, which does not understand human languages and hence can not identify the correct protein that the term refers to. In this paper, we present a Term Identification system which automatically assigns unique identifiers, as found in a protein database, to ambiguous protein mentions in texts. Unlike other solutions described in literature, which only work on gene/protein mentions on a specific model organism, our system is able to tackle protein mentions across many species, by integrating a machine-learning based species tagger. We have compared the performance of our automatic system to that of human annotators, with very promising results.

Over the past decade, we have developed a number of machine learning methods for inducing semantic parsers by training on a corpus of sentences paired with their meaning representations in a specified formal language. We have demonstrated these methods on the automated construction of natural-language interfaces to databases and robot command languages. This paper reviews our prior work on this topic and discusses directions for future research.	Univ Texas, Dept Comp Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA							Aho A.

Among the many research issues, feature selection and classification of proteomic patterns in serum are very typical in the discrimination of cancer patients from normal individuals. In the past several years, many machine learning methods have been proposed with encouraging results. Most of the published works, however, are based on the direct application of original mass spectra, together with dimension reduction methods like PCA or feature selection methods like T-tests. Because only the peaks of MS data correspond to potential biomarkers, it is more important to study classification methods using the detected peaks, particularly from biology point of view. This paper investigates ovarian cancer identification from the detected MS peaks by applying the Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA), which has been shown to be effective for classifying high-dimensional data.

Incremental learning has been successfully applied to many classification problems, where the data is changing and is not all available at once. In this paper there is a comparison between Learn++, which is one of the most recent incremental learning algorithms, and the new proposed method of Incremental Learning Using Genetic Algorithm (ILUGA). Learn++ has shown good incremental learning capabilities on benchmark datasets on which the new ILUGA method has been tested. ILUGA has also shown good incremental learning ability using only a few classifiers and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. The results obtained for ILUGA on the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Wine datasets are good, with an overall accuracy of 93% and 94% respectively showing a 4% improvement over Leam++.MT for the difficult multi-class OCR dataset.			greghul@icon.co.za; t.marwala@ee.wits.ac.za					Burges CJC, 1998, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V2, P121, DOI 10.1023/A:1009715923555; Erdem Z, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3697, P607; Erdem Z, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3541, P246; French RM, 1999, TRENDS COGN SCI, V3, P128, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01294-2; Goldberg DE, 1989, GENETIC ALGORITHMS S; GROSSBERG S, 1988, NEURAL NETWORKS, V1, P17, DOI 10.1016/0893-6080(88)90021-4; Hamker FH, 2001, NEURAL NETWORKS, V14, P551, DOI 10.1016/S0893-6080(01)00018-1; JANTKE K, 1993, AAAI S TRAIN ISS INC, P23; Kittler J, 1998, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V20, P226, DOI 10.1109/34.667881; MOHAMED S, 2006, 17 ANN S PATT REC AS; Muhlbaier M, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3077, P52; NEWMAN CBD, 1998, REPOSITORY MACHINE L; POLIKAR R, 2002, P INT JOINT C NEUR N, V2, P1742; POLIKAR R, 2000, P ICASSP 2000, V6, P3414; Polikar R, 2001, IEEE T SYST MAN CY C, V31, P497, DOI 10.1109/5326.983933; Scholkopf B., 2002, LEARNING KERNELS; THEODORIDIS S, 1999, PETTERN RECOGNITION; Vapnik V.N., 1999, NATURE STAT LEARNING; VILAKAZI B, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V4491, P1241	19	2	2	AMER INST PHYSICS	MELVILLE	2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA	0094-243X	978-0-7354-0466-3	AIP CONF PROC			2007	952						258	267				10	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Physics, Applied	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Physics	BHB65	WOS:000252100400027

SVMs can suffer from slow classification times due to large numbers of support vectors and computationally expensive kernel functions. This paper shows that some SVMs can have support vectors removed to improve classification time, with little to no loss in generalisation accuracy. Greedy and stochastic search methods for finding the support vectors to remove are tested on sets of biological sequence data. This paper shows the results of reducing SVMs trained on sequence data sets, where accuracy was retained after more than half the support vectors were removed.

This chapter focuses on what is required for the learning of complex behaviors. We believe it involves the learning of highly varying functions, in a mathematical sense. We bring forward two types of arguments which convey the message that many currently popular machine learning approaches to learning flexible functions have fundamental limitations that render them inappropriate for learning highly varying functions. The first issue concerns the representation of such functions with what we call shallow model architectures. We discuss limitations of shallow architectures, such as so-called kernel machines, boosting algorithms, and one-hidden-layer artificial neural networks. The second issue is more focused and concerns kernel machines with a local kernel (the type used most often in practice) that act like a collection of template-matching units. We present mathematical results on such computational architectures showing that they have a limitation similar to those already proved for older non-parametric methods, and connected to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Though it has long been believed that efficient learning in deep architectures is difficult, recently proposed computational principles for learning in deep architectures may offer a breakthrough.

Our algorithm, which compares the core attributes of objects and builds decision trees based on those attributes, represents a new type of tree construction. Experiments show that the new algorithm can help to extract more meaningful and accurate rules than other algorithms.

Confidence in its ability to provide adequate authentication is, however, waning. This is largely due to the wrongful use of passwords by many users. In this paper, the design and development of keystroke pressure-based typing biometrics for individual user's verification which based on the analysis of habitual typing of individuals is discussed. The combination of maximum pressure exerted on the keyboard and time latency between keystrokes is used as features to create typing patterns for individual users so as to recognize authentic users and to reject impostors. Support vector machines (SVMs), which is relatively new machine learning, is used as a pattern matching method. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated based upon False Reject Rate (FRR) and False Accept Rate (FAR). A series of experiment shows that the proposed system is effective for biometric-based security system.

In order to cope with these problems, there have been many researches on the defense mechanisms including various DDoS detection mechanisms. SVM is suitable for attack detection since it is a binary classification method. However, it is not appropriate to classify attack categories such as SYN Flooding attack, Smurf attack, UDP Flooding, and so on. Because of this weakness, administrator does not react against the attack timely. To solve this problem, we propose a machine learning model based on Multiple Support Vector Machines (MSVMs), and a new DDoS detection model based on Multiple Support Vector Machines (MSVMs). The proposed model enhanced attack detection accuracy and it classifies attack categories well when the proposed model detects the attacks.

Improving the efficiency and efficacy of the K-means clustering algorithm through a new convergence condition	Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2007, Pt 3, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2007)	AUG 26-29, 2007	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Univ Perugia, Univ Calgary, Optima Numerics, Spark Planner Pte Ltd, Univ Calgary, SPARCS Lab, MASTER-UP				Clustering problems arise in many different applications: machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, data compression, vector quantization, pattern recognition and pattern classification. One of the most popular and widely studied clustering methods is K-means. Several improvements to the standard K-means algorithm have been carried out, most of them related to the initial parameter values. In contrast, this article proposes an improvement using a new convergence condition that consists of stopping the execution when a local optimum is found or no more object exchanges among groups can be performed. For assessing the improvement attained, the modified algorithm (Early Stop K-means) was tested on six databases of the UCI repository, and the results were compared against SPSS, Weka and the standard K-means algorithm. Experimentally Early Stop K-means obtained important reductions in the number of iterations and improvements in the solution quality with respect to the other algorithms.

However to the complex applications, the load peak may make the system suffer extremely high load and the response time may be decreased for this kind of fluctuate. Therefore, to utilize the services effectively especially when the workloads fluctuate frequently, we should make the system react to the load fluctuate gradually and predictably. Many existing load balancing middleware use the dampening technology to make the load to be predicative. However, distributed systems are inherently difficult to manage and the dampening factor cannot be treated as static and fixed. The dampening factor should be adjusted dynamically according to different load fluctuate. So we have proposed a new technique based on machine learning for adaptive and flexible load prediction mechanism based on our load balancing middleware.

This method is used to predict which storm-scale circulations yield tornadoes based on the radar derived Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (MDA) and near-storm environment (NSE) attributes. The main goal of active learning is to choose the instances or data points that are important or have influence to our model to be labeled and included in the training set. We compare this method to passive learning with SVMs where the next instances to be included to the training set are randomly selected. The preliminary results show that active learning can achieve high performance and significantly reduce the size of training set.

In this study, we discuss the applications of the support vector machine with mixture of kernel to design a credit evaluation system, which can discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Differing from the standard SVM, the SVM-MK uses the 1-norm based object function and adopts the convex combinations of single feature basic kernels. Only a linear programming problem needs to be resolved and it greatly reduces the computational costs. More important, it is a transparent model and the optimal feature subset can be obtained automatically. A real life credit dataset from a US commercial bank is used to demonstrate the good performance of the SVM-MK.

In this paper we explore several machine learning techniques for creating models that can be used to impute the missing genotypes using multiple genetic markers. We map the machine learning techniques to different patterns of transmission and, in particular, we contrast the effect of short and long range disequilibrium between markers. The assumption of short range disequilibrium implies that only physically close genetic variants are informative for reconstructing missing genotypes, while this assumption is relaxed in long range disequilibrium and physically distant genetic variants become informative for imputation. We evaluate the accuracy of a flexible feature selection model that fits both patterns of transmission using six real datasets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The results show an increased accuracy compared to standard imputation models. Supplementary material: http://bios.ugr.es/missingGenotypes.

The approach of this system is hybrid, because it uses different classification methods, and also integrated, because it takes into account all kind of data and information contained in e-mails.

The area under the ROC curve offer a measure of the discriminatory power of machine learning algorithms that is independent of class distribution, via its equivalence to Mann-Whitney U-statistics. This measure has recently been extended to cover problems of discriminating three and more classes. In this case, the area under the curve generalizes to the volume under the ROC surface. In this paper, we show how a multi-class classifier can be trained by directly maximizing the volume under the ROC surface. This is accomplished by first approximating the discrete U-statistic that is equivalent to the volume under the surface in a continuous manner, and then maximizing this approximation by gradient ascent.

These robots generally show abilities that include expressive power (face, voice,...), locating, paying attention to and addressing people, etc. Such abilities fall into what is known as social intelligence in humans. The reproduction of social intelligence, as opposed to other types of human abilities, may lead to fragile performance, in the sense of having rather different performances between tested cases and future (untested) cases and situations. This limitation stems from the fact that our social abilities are mainly unconscious to us. This is in contrast with other human abilities that we carry out using conscious effort, and for which we can easily conceive algorithms and representations. The fragile performance mentioned above is nothing but overfitting. Thus, we propose to approach the problem using strategies followed in Machine Learning for avoiding overfitting. Specifically, complexity penalization and incremental design are translated to the broader ambit of robot design and development. The robot CASIMIRO is currently being developed following that approach.

In this paper we propose Eigenmotion-based Contraction Detection (ECD), a novel approach for automatic annotation of intestinal contractions of video capsule endoscopy. Our approach extracts the main motion information of a set of contraction sequences in form of eigenmotions using Principal Component Analysis. Then, it uses a selection of them to represent the high dimension motion data. Finally, this contraction characterization is used to classify the contraction sequences by means of machine learning techniques. The experimental results show that motion information is useful in the contraction detection. Moreover, the proposed automatic method is essential to speed up the costly examination of the video capsule endoscopy.

The proposed technique takes advantage of both data-driven and machine learning approaches. It seeks to utilize the most relevant part of the captured utterances for the synthesis of input phoneme sequences. If highly relevant data are missing or lacking, then it utilizes less relevant (but more abundant) data and relies more heavily on machine learning for the lip-synch generation. This hybrid approach produces results that are more faithful to real data than conventional machine learning approaches, while being better able to handle incompleteness or redundancy in the database than conventional data-driven approaches. Experimental results, obtained by applying the proposed technique to the utterance of various words and phrases, show that (1) the proposed technique generates lip-synchs of different qualities depending on the availability of the data, and (2) the new technique produces more realistic results than conventional machine learning approaches.

The model embodies a simulation of the pigment-water solution and its interaction with the brush and the paper at the level of pigment particles; such a level of detail is needed for achieving highly intricate effects by the artist. The simulation covers pigment diffusion and sorption processes at the paper surface, and aspects of pigment particle deposition on the paper. We follow rules and formulations from quantitative studies of adsorption and diffusion processes in surface chemistry and the textile industry. The result is a pigment model that spans a continuum from the very wet to the very dry brush stroke eftects. We also propose a new pigment mixing method based on machine learning techniques to emulate pigment mixing in real life as well as to support the creation of new artificial pigments. To experiment with the proposed model, we embedded the model in a sophisticated digital brush system. The combined system exhibits interactive speed on a modest PC platform. http://Www.es.hku.hk/similar to songhua/pigment provides supplementary materials for this paper.

J	Liang, HL; Wang, J; Yao, YY				Liang, Hongli; Wang, Jue; Yao, Yiyu			User-oriented feature selection for machine learning	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						user-oriented; feature selection; NP-hard; reduct	ROUGH SETS	The effectiveness of any machine learning algorithm depends, to a large extent, on the selection of a good subset of features or attributes. Most existing methods use the syntactic or statistical information of the data, relying on a heuristic criterion to select features. In this paper, we investigate an alternative less-studied approach called user-oriented feature selection by exploiting the domain-specific semantic information. Given any two features, a user is able to express which one is more important based on the semantic consideration. Such user requirements are formally described by a preference relation on the set of features. Algorithms are proposed to construct a subset of features that is most consistent with the user requirements. Their properties and computational complexity are analysed. User-oriented feature selection offers a new view for machine learning and its potentials need to be further investigated and explored.

We consider the challenging tasks of frame selection for use in mosaicing, and feature selection from Computer Vision, and Machine Learning, respectively, and demonstrate that we can map these problems into the existing graph theory problem of finding the maximum independent set. For frame selection, we represent the temporal and spatial connectivity of the images in a video sequence by a graph, and demonstrate that the optimal subset of images to be used in mosaicing can be determined by finding the maximum independent set of the graph. This process of determining the maximum independent set, not only reduces the overhead of using all the images, which may not be significantly contributing in building the mosaic, but also implicitly solves the "camera loop-back" problem. For feature selection, we conclude that we can apply a similar mapping to the maximum independent set problem to obtain a solution. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of our frame selection method, we build a system for mosaicing, which uses our method of frame selection.

Face detection in gray scale images using locally linear embeddings	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						face detection; locally linear embedding; machine learning; support vector machines; head pose; illumination; facial expression; occlusion; aging	NEURAL-NETWORK	The problem of face detection remains challenging because faces are non-rigid objects that have a high degree of variability with respect to head rotation, illumination, facial expression, occlusion, and aging. This paper employs a novel technique, known as locally linear embedding (LLE), for solving the face detection problem. The LLE method performs dimensionality reduction on data for learning and classification purposes. Proposed by Roweis and Saul, the intent of LLE is to determine a locally linear fit so that each data point can be represented by a linear combination of its closest neighbors. The first objective of this research is to apply the LLE algorithm to 2D facial images to obtain their representation in a sub-space under the specific conditions stated above. The low-dimensional data are then used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to label windows in images as being either face or non-face. Six different databases of cropped facial images, corresponding to variations in head rotation, illumination, facial expression, occlusion and aging, were used to train and test the classifiers. The second objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using the combined efficacy of the six SVM classifiers in a two-stage face detection approach. Experimental results obtained demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method was similar and sometimes better when compared to other face detection methods, thus indicating a viable and accurate technique.

New Feature Selection Methods for Qualification of the Patients for Cardiac Pacemaker Implantation	COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY 2007, VOL 34	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual Conference on Computers in Cardiology	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2007	Durham, NC				MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS SYSTEMS	Implantation of a cardiac pacemaker is a complicated procedure. The success of the procedure depends directly on the proper classification of patients and the choice Of the type of pacing. Machine learning algorithms can support this process. The most important element of these is the feature selection process. In this paper we present the results of our own implementation of feature selection methods, working on the electrocardiological datasets Of 4316 patients with severe heart rhythm disorders and qualified for pacemaker implantation. For the research, we chose the two most promising algorithms (CFS and Chi-square). In all cases it was possible to reduce the initial set of attributes by, 60%. Due to the reduction of the search space the number of generated decision rules was decreased by factor of 6-10. Because of this, practical cardiological validation of rules is easier and faster, more general rules adapt better for recognition of new cases and computational effort is reduced, which was confirmed in clinical practice.

Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of RR intervals and QRS amplitudes of whole record were presented as inputs to train the SVM mode to recognize OSAS+/- subjects. The optimal v trained SVM showed that a SVM using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features correctly recognized 20 out of 20 OSAS+ subjects and 10 out of 10 OSAS- subjects. For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated.	[Khandoker, A.

J	Khorsi, A				Khorsi, Ahmed			Towards hybridization of knowledge representation and machine learning	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						knowledge representation (KR); machine learning (ML); memory modelling		Machine learning and knowledge representation are two fields of artificial intelligence that lead with intelligent reasoning, each one differently. When Knowledge Representation (KR) focuses more on the epistemological face of knowledge to carry out a power-expression model with detriment of the computation efficiency. Machine learning pays more attention to the computation efficiency, often with loss of expressing power. In this paper we show that features of one may overwhelm drawbacks of the other. Taking the uncertainty artefact from machine learning and symbolic representation from KR, we propose in this paper a new memory modelling for knowledge based systems which is at the same time machine-learning structure and a knowledge representation model. In terms of machine learning, our structure allows an unlimited flexibility where no restraining architecture is imposed at the beginning (think about decision trees [18, 6, 5, 2]). Classification can be performed with incomplete vectors where the most likely corresponding class is assigned to the vector with missing attributes. Viewed as a knowledge model, a basic knowledge is easily specified graphically. Inference is defined by rules expressed in the same manner, where the existing sub-instances are used to generate new connections and entities. Inference on existing knowledge is described in two algorithms. Our approach is mainly based on the representation of the context concept. Our model brings together advantages of the symbolic knowledge representation, namely human to computer knowledge coding, and those of machine learning structures, namely ease of efficient coding of inference to perform the so-called intelligent tasks like pattern recognition, prediction and others. Its graphical representation allows visualization of both dynamic and static sides of the model (i.e. inference and knowledge).

Our objective is to propose a tool for detecting and eliminating non relevant variables from the database. The goal, after acquisition by machine learning from a set of data, is to reduce the complexity of storage, thus to decrease the computing time. The objective of this work is to experiment a cellular machine for systems of inference containing rules. Our system relies upon the graphs generated by the SIPINA method. After an introduction aiming at positioning our contribution within the area of machine learning, we briefly present the SIPINA method for automatic retrieval of knowledge starting from data. We then describe our cellular system and the phase of knowledge post-processing, in particular the validation and the use of extracted knowledge. The presentation of our system is mostly done through an example taken from medical diagnosis.

From the rough set theory point of view, in the process of inducing decision trees with evaluations of candidate attributes, some methods based on purity measurements, such as information entropy based methods, emphasize the effect of class distribution. The more unbalanced the class distribution is, the more favorable it is. The rough set based approaches emphasize the effect of certainty. The more certain it is, the better. The criterion for node selection in the new method is based on the measurement of the variable precision explicit regions corresponding to candidate attributes. We compared the presented approach with C4.5 on some data sets from the UCI machine learning repository, which instantiates the feasibility of the proposed method.

Human attitudes are determined in terms of communicative actions of agents; models of machine learning are used when it is rather hard to identify attitudes in a rulebased form directly. We employ scenario knowledge representation and learning techniques in such problems as predicting an outcome of international conflicts, assessment of an attitude of a security clearance candidate, mining emails for suspicious emotional profiles, mining wireless location data for suspicious behavior, and classification of textual customer complaints. A preliminary performance estimate evaluation is conducted in the above domains. Successful use of the proposed methodology in rather distinct domains shows its adequacy for mining human attitude-related data in a wide range of applications.

We present an investigation into how users come to understand an intelligent system as they use it in their daily work. During a six-week field study, we interviewed eight office workers regarding the operation of a system that predicted their managers' interruptibility, comparing their mental models to the actual system model. Our results show that by the end of the study, participants were able to discount some of their initial misconceptions about what information the system used for reasoning about interruptibility. However, the overarching structures of their mental models stayed relatively stable over the course of the study. Lastly, we found that participants were able to give lay descriptions attributing simple machine learning concepts to the system despite their lack of technical knowledge. Our findings suggest an appropriate level of feedback for user interfaces of intelligent systems, provide a baseline level of complexity for user understanding, and highlight the challenges of making users aware of sensed inputs for such systems.

We present Subtle, a toolkit that removes some of the obstacles to developing and deploying applications using sensor-based statistical models of human situations. Subtle provides an appropriate and extensible sensing library, continuous learning of personalized models, fully-automated high-level feature generation, and support for using learned models in deployed applications. By removing obstacles to developing and deploying sensor-based statistical models, Subtle makes it easier to explore the design space surrounding sensor-based statistical models of human situations. Subtle thus helps to move the focus of human-computer interaction research onto applications and datasets, instead of the difficulties of developing and deploying sensor-based statistical models.

One solution to this problem is to design systems that allow remote experts to help multiple people in simultaneously. As a first step towards building such a system, we studied experts' attention and communication as they assisted two novices at the same time in a colocated setting. We compared simultaneous instruction when the novices are being instructed to do the same task or different tasks. Using machine learning, we attempted to identify speech markers of upcoming attention shifts that could serve as input to a remote assistance system.

The algorithm is motivated by the success of the algorithms for probabilistic inference developed in the machine learning community for reasoning in graphical models. The validity or invalidity proof consists of providing an invariant at each program point that can be locally verified. The algorithm works by iteratively randomly selecting a program point and updating the current abstract state representation to make it more locally consistent (with respect to the abstractions at the neighboring points). We show that this simple algorithm has some interesting aspects: (a) It brings together the complementary powers of forward and backward analyses; (b) The algorithm has the ability to recover itself from excessive under-approximation or over-approximation that it may make. (Because the algorithm does not distinguish between the forward and backward information, the information could get both under-approximated and over-approximated at any step.) (c) The randomness in the algorithm ensures that the correct choice of updates is eventually made as there is no single deterministic strategy that would provably work for any interesting class of programs. In our experiments we use this algorithm to produce the proof of correctness of a small (but non-trivial) example. In addition, we empirically illustrate several important properties of the algorithm.

Degradation specific measures perform poorly under "mismatched" conditions. Generic measures, on the other hand, may compromise quality measurement accuracy while gaining robustness to variation in distortion conditions. To improve the accuracy-robustness tradeoff, we employ support-vector degradation classification and machine learning tools to judiciously combine generic and degradation specific measures. To test our algorithm, composite quality metrics are optimized for five different distortion classes. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm achieves improved performance and robustness relative to two benchmark generic quality metrics.

In particular, variational equations based on a generalisation of the representer theorem and an equivalent optimisation problem are presented. This amounts to a generalisation of the ordinary Bayesian maximum a posteriori approach which is nontrivial as infinite-dimensional domains do not admitany probability densities. Instead of the gradient of the density, the logarithmic gradient of the probability distribution is used. Galerkin methods are proposed for the approximate solution of the variational equations. In summary, a framework and some foundations are provided which are required for the application of numerical approximation to an important class of machine learning problems.

Machine learning and data mining give us techniques which can be used to analyze that data and uncover previously unknown rules and associations, hidden knowledge which once acquired - and properly interpreted - can be used in multitude of ways. Even though data mining has mostly been used by the marketing field, lately it is not uncommon to use machine learning techniques in other environments. This paper presents how data mining algorithms and techniques can be used in the academic community to potentially improve some aspects of education quality.

As scheduling problems are NP-complete, no polynomial algorithms exist for evaluating the impact a certain constraint, or relaxing the same constraint, will have on the global problem. We present a general approach where local agents can estimate their problem tightness, or how constrained their local subproblem is. This allows these agents to immediately identify many problems which are not constrained, and will not benefit from sending or receiving further information. Next, agents use traditional machine learning methods based on their specific local problem attributes to attempt to identify which of the constrained problems will most benefit from human attention. We evaluated this approach within a distributed cTAEMS scheduling domain and found this approach was overall quite effective.

Automated ways to overcome conflicts in the behavior of agents can make the execution of interactions more reliable. Such an alignment mechanism will reduce the necessary human intervention. This paper shows how to describe a policy for alignment, which an agent can apply when its behavior is in conflict with other agents. An extension of Petri Nets is used to capture the intended interaction of an agent in a formal way. Furthermore, a mechanism based on machine learning is implemented, to enable an agent to choose an appropriate alignment policy with collected problem information. Human intervention can reinforce certain successful policies in a given context, and can also contribute by adding completely new policies.

So superfluous alerts are generated, and do not have unified format. How to organize and utilize those alerts to enhance network security becomes a hot topic of research. Network-warning system, which can correlate alerts and predict future attacks, appears as one promising solution for the problem. In this paper, an intelligent strong-survivability network-warning model is introduced, which consists of a lot of intelligent agents. And a prototype is implemented based on the model. We propose a self-adaptive data-processing algorithm for classifying and reducing alerts automatically, and design a strong-survivability structure. The intelligence of self-adaptive algorithm depends on machine learning. In the prototype we adopt three methods (C5.0, Neural Net and CART) to construct the self-adaptive algorithm, and choose the best method fitting the algorithm, which is CART. The prototype can not only reduce and classify the original alert data from different network security devices, but also correlate alerts and generate intrusion scenario graphs. The equality of all agents makes the model strong-survivable. Furthermore, the model can predict potential attacks based on scenario graphs and track the attack sources(1).

In bioinformatics, identifying protease cleavage sites in protein sequences can aid drug/inhibitor design. In systems biology, post-translational protein-protein interaction activity is one of the major components for analyzing signaling pathway activities. Determining functional sites using laboratory experiments are normally time consuming and expensive. Computer programs have therefore been widely used for this kind of task. Mining protein sequence data using computer programs covers two major issues: 1) discovering how amino acid specificity affects functional sites and 2) discovering what amino acid specificity is. Both need a proper coding mechanism prior to using a proper machine learning algorithm. The development of the bio-basis function neural network (BBFNN) has made a new way for protein sequence data mining. The bio-basis function used in BBFNN is biologically sound in well coding biological information in protein sequences, i.e. well measuring the similarity between protein sequences. BBFNN has therefore been outperforming conventional neural networks in many subjects of protein sequence data mining from protease cleavage site prediction to disordered protein identification. This review focuses on the variants of BBFNN and their applications in mining protein sequence data.

In this review, we present an overview of basic concepts and methodology in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). An emphasis is put on methods that enable an intuitive interpretation of the results and facilitate gaining an insight into the structure of the problem at hand. We also discuss representative applications of AI methods to docking, screening and QSAR studies. The growing trend to integrate computational and experimental efforts in that regard and some future developments are discussed. In addition, we comment on a broader role of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in biomedical research.

Consistency-based diagnosis is capable of performing automatic fault detection and localization using just correct behaviour models. Nevertheless, it may exhibit low discriminative power among fault candidates. Hence, we combined the consistency based approach with machine learning techniques specially developed for fault identification of dynamic systems. In this work, we apply Stacking to generate time series classifiers from classifiers of its univariate time series components. The Stacking scheme proposed uses K-NN with Dynamic Time Warping as a dissimilarity measure for the level 0 learners, and Naive Bayes at level 1. The method has been tested in a fault identification problem for a laboratory scale continuous process plant.

This work compares Consolidated Tree's Construction (CTC) algorithm with the Combined Multiple Models (CMM) method proposed by Domingos when used to extract explanation of the classification made by bagging. The comparison has been done from two main points of view: accuracy, and quality of the provided explanation. From the experimental results we can conclude that it is recommendable the use of CTC rather than the use of CMM. From the accuracy point of view, the behaviour of CTC is nearer the behaviour of bagging than CMM's one. And, analysing the complexity of the obtained classifiers, we can say that Consolidated Trees (CT trees) will give simpler and, therefore, more comprehensible explanation than CMM classifiers. And besides, looking to the stability of the structure of the built trees, we could say that the explanation given by CT trees is steadier than the one given by CMM classifiers. As a consequence, the user of the classifier will feel more confident using CTC than using CMM.

The aim is to establish an order between the attributes that describe the entries of a learning task according to their utility. In this paper, we propose a method to establish these orders using Preference Learning by means of Support Vector Machines (SVM). We include an exhaustive experimental study that investigates the virtues and limitations of the method and discusses, simultaneously, the design options that we have adopted. The conclusion is that our method is very competitive, specially when it searchs for a ranking limiting the number of combinations of attributes explored; this supports that the method presented here could be successfully used in large data sets.

TBL uses rule templates to identify error-correcting patterns. A critical requirement in TBL is the availability of a problem domain expert to build these rule templates. In this work, we propose an evolutionary approach based on Genetic Algorithms to automatically implement the template selection process. We show some empirical evidence that our approach provides template sets with almost the same quality as human built templates.

MFE2/GA, a GA-based feature construction has been shown to learn more accurately than others when there exist several complex attribute interactions. A new fitness function, based on the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL), is proposed and implemented as part of the MFE3/GA system. Since the individuals of the GA population are collections of new features constructed to change the representation of data, an MDL-based fitness considers not only the part of data left unexplained by the constructed features (errors), but also the complexity of the constructed features as a new representation (theory). An empirical study shows the advantage of the new fitness over other fitness not based on MDL, and both are compared to the performance baselines provided by relevant systems.

Structure based drug design for HIV protease: From molecular modeling to cheminformatics	CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review							FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; FLEXIBLE LIGAND DOCKING; WISWESSER LINE NOTATION; DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FORCE-FIELD; MECHANICS CALCULATIONS; CATALYTIC MECHANISM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; BINDING MODE	Significant progress over the past decade in virtual representations of molecules and their physicochemical properties has produced new drugs from virtual screening of the structures of single protein molecules by conventional modeling methods. The development of clinical antiviral drugs from structural data for HIV protease has been a major success in structure based drug design. Techniques for virtual screening involve the ranking of the affinity of potential ligands for the target site on a protein. Two main alternatives have been developed: modeling of the target protein with a series of related ligand molecules, and docking molecules from a database to the target protein site. The computational speed and prediction accuracy will depend on the representation of the molecular structure and chemistry, the search or simulation algorithm, and the scoring function to rank the ligands. Moreover, the general challenges in modem computational drug design arise from the profusion of data, including whole genomes of DNA, protein structures, chemical libraries, affinity and pharmacological data. Therefore, software tools are being developed to manage and integrate diverse data, and extract and visualize meaningful relationships. Current areas of research include the development of searchable chemical databases, which requires new algorithms to represent molecules and search for structurally or chemically similar molecules, and the incorporation of machine learning techniques for data mining to improve the accuracy of predictions. Examples will be presented for the virtual screening of drugs that target HIV protease.

A few such systems are available for documents written in English. In this paper, we propose a model called LEH_KEY (Learning to Extract Hebrew KEYphrases) that for the first time learns to extract keyphrases for documents written in Hebrew. Firstly, we introduce a relatively high number (15) of baseline extraction methods as opposed to other related systems that use combinations of a low number (two/three) of baseline extraction methods. In contrast, we have investigated various combinations of larger number of baseline methods and various machine learning methods have been tested. The best results have been achieved by a combination of six baseline methods using J48 (an improved variant of C4.5). Our results have been found to be at least of equal quality to those achieved by extraction systems for documents written in English, which are regarded as state-of-the art.

The first version of the brain-gene ontology (BGO) has been completed as a structure and as an initial implementation in the Protege ontology-building environment. The BGO allows users to: navigate through the rich information space of brain functions and brain diseases, brain related genes and their activities in certain parts of the brain and their relation to brain diseases; to run simulations; to download data that can be used in a software machine learning environment such as WEKA and NeuCom to train prediction or classification models; to visualize relationship information; to add some new information as the BGO has an evolving structure. The BGO is designed to facilitate active learning and research in the areas of bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, information engineering, and knowledge management. Different parts of it can be used by different users, from a school level to postgraduate and PhD student level. A further development of the BGO is discussed, where more data and information will be added, that will include both a higher level information on cognitive functions and consciousness, and a lower level quantum information.

J	Borzemski, L; Zatwarnicki, K; Zatwarnicka, A				Borzemski, Leszek; Zatwarnicki, Krzysztof; Zatwarnicka, Anna			Adaptive and intelligent request distribution for content delivery networks	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	KES Conference 2006	OCT 09-11, 2006	Bournemouth, ENGLAND				SYSTEMS	Today's knowledge and content Web-based technologies call for adaptive and intelligent algorithms for accessing the resources, especially to respond to Semantic Web, as well to performance challenges. This work presents the application of two machine learning techniques in an adaptive decision making framework, namely a fuzzy logic and neural networks, to deploy the adaptive and intelligent dispatching algorithm for resource requesting within a geographically distributed fully replicated Web sites. Our approach and algorithm can be used in content distribution and delivery networks where due to content replication each Web server can respond to the client request. Intelligent redirection mechanism redirects the request from the originating site's server to the '' best '' content source to deliver the content in the fastest manner. First, we introduce a broker-based system architecture. Next, we develop a new global adaptive intelligent request distribution algorithm. Our algorithm called GARDiB by a means of the fuzzy-neural techniques redirects each incoming request to local service with the least expected response time, which takes into account, the transfer time of the request and the response, as well as the time elapsed on the local service that responds to the request. Our simulations showed the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive distribution.

Today the two technologies are used mainly separate; even though the knowledge extracted by the two is complementary and significant benefits can be obtained if the technologies were integrated. This problem is especially important for biomedicine where relevant data are often naturally complex having large dimensionality and including heterogeneous features, and where a large body of knowledge is available in the form of ontologies. In this paper we propose one approach for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms by integrating the knowledge provided by ontologies. The basic idea is to redefine the concept of similarity for complex heterogeneous data by incorporating available ontological knowledge, creating a bridge between the two technologies. Potential benefits and difficulties of this integration are discussed, two techniques for empirical evaluation and fine-tuning of feature ontologies are described, and an example from the field of paediatric cardiology is given.

J	Serrurier, M; Dubois, D; Prade, H; Sudkamp, T				Serrurier, Mathieu; Dubois, Didier; Prade, Henri; Sudkamp, Thomas			Learning fuzzy rules with their implication operators	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						inductive logic programming; fuzzy rules; implication operators	ASSOCIATION RULES; APPROXIMATE; SETS	Fuzzy predicates have been incorporated into machine learning and data mining to extend the types of data relationships that can be represented, to facilitate the interpretation of rules in linguistic terms, and to avoid unnatural boundaries in partitioning attribute domains. The confidence of an association is classically measured by the co-occurrence of attributes in tuples in the database. The semantics of fuzzy rules, however, is not co-occurrence but rather graduality or certainty and is determined by the implication operator that defines the rule. In this paper we present a learning algorithm, based on inductive logic programming, that simultaneously learns the semantics and evaluates the validity of fuzzy rules. The learning algorithm selects the implication that maximizes rule confidence while trying to be as informative as possible. The use of inductive logic programming increases the expressive power of fuzzy rules while maintaining their linguistic interpretability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The accuracy of this extended LAD classification is compared on several publicly available benchmark datasets to that of the original LAD classification, and to that of the classifications provided by the most frequently used statistical and data mining methods.

Like Autocorrel I, the new model correlates intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts to automate alert and incidents management, and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. We achieve this correlation by clustering similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only consider a few clusters rather than hundreds or thousands of alerts. The first stage uses an artificial neural network (ANN)-based autoassociator (AA). The AA's objective is to attempt to reproduce each alert at its output. In the process, it uses an error metric, the reconstruction error (RE), between its input and output to cluster similar alerts. In order to improve the accuracy of the system we add another machine-learning stage which takes into account the RE as well as raw attribute information from the input alerts. This stage uses the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm. The performance of this approach is tested with intrusion alerts generated by a Snort IDS on DARPA's 1999 IDS evaluation data as well as incidents.org alerts.

This paper presents a new stochastic nature inspired methodology, which is based on the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), for optimally clustering N objects into K clusters. The proposed algorithm (Hybrid PSO-GRASP) for the solution of the clustering problem is a two phase algorithm which combines a PSO algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP for the solution of the clustering problem. Due to the nature of stochastic and population-based search, the proposed algorithm can overcome the drawbacks of traditional clustering methods. Its performance is compared with other popular stochastic/metaheuristic methods like genetic algorithms and tabu search. Results from the application of the methodology to a survey data base coming from the Paris olive oil market and to data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are presented.

Although feature selection and tuple selection have been studied earlier in various research areas such as machine learning, data mining, and so on, they have rarely been studied together. The contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel distance measure to select the most representative features and tuples. Our experiments are conducted over some microarray gene expression datasets, UCI machine learning and KDD datasets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods quite significantly.

Computing platforms, assets and their agents can and should cooperate via enterprise resource management infrastructure and middleware. Baseline BPM can further be augmented with non-invasive agent-based machine-learning techniques which can, overall, contribute to roll-up views of enterprise performance and will, therefore, be used to further refine the TCPED/TPPU execution strategy. This paper presents an overarching architecture framework which combines these features and operational drivers under a unifying system perspective.

It has been studied extensively in the context of its original use in political elections and social choice-making. It has recently seen use in machine learning and in ranking web searches, but few of its formal properties have been extensively investigated. In this paper, we describe unsupervised, and (barely) supervised learning systems that employ the Borda Count as their underlying bases. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the technique in the context of landmine discrimination.

The dependence on the latter parameters is linear, and can be solved for efficiently using for example the Normalized Surface Magnetic Charge model. The location and orientation, on the other hand, have a nonlinear effect on the measurable scattered field, making their determination much more time-consuming and thus hampering the ability to carry out discrimination in real time. In particular, it is difficult to resolve for depth when one has measurements taken at only one instrument elevation. In view of the difficulties posed by direct inversion, we propose using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to infer the location and orientation of buried UXO. SVMs are a method of supervised machine learning: the user can train a computer program by feeding it features of representative examples, and the machine, in turn, can generalize this information by finding underlying patterns and using them to classify or regress unseen instances. In this work we train an SVM using measured-field information, for both synthetic and experimental data, and evaluate its ability to predict the location of different buried objects to reasonable accuracy. We explore various combinations of input data and learning parameters in search of an optimal predictive configuration.

In the current era of multimodal interaction, each context may require other interaction strategies or system settings to allow the end-users to reach their envisioned goals. For instance, in a meeting room a user may want to use the projection equipment and disable the audio output for a presentation, while audio input and output may be important while in a teleconference. In present computer systems most changes have to be made manually and require explicit interaction with the system. The number of different devices used in such environments makes that this configuration step results in a high cognitive load and causes interrupts of the tasks being executed by the end-user. In this paper we present how proactive user interfaces may predict the next interface changes invoked by context switches or user actions. In particular, we will focus on two machine learning algorithms, decision trees and Markov models, that may support this proactive behaviour for multimodal user interfaces. Based on some simple but relevant scenarios, we compare the outcome of both implementations in order to decide which algorithm is most applicable in this context.

This paper presents a complementary analysis of research and experiments on genre to show that encouraging results can be obtained by using genre structure (form) features. We conducted an experiment to assess the effectiveness of using extensible mark-up language (XML) tag information, and part-of-speech (P-O-S) features, for the classification of genres, testing the hypothesis that if a focus on genre can lead to high precision on normal textual documents, then good results can be achieved using XML tag information in addition to P-O-S information. An experiment was carried out on a subsection of the initiative for the evaluation of XML (INEX) 1. 4 collection. The features were extracted and documents were classified using machine learning algorithms, which yielded encouraging results for logistic regression and neural networks. We propose that utilizing these features and training a classifier may benefit retrieval for most world wide web (WWW) technologies such as XML and extensible hypertext markup language) XHTML.

This approach is related to natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) that were studied extensively from the 1970s to the 1990s. NLIDB systems employed a range of techniques, from simple pattern-matching rules to formal logical calculi such as the lambda calculus, but most were restricted to specific domains. In this paper we describe a machine learning approach to querying tabular data for QA which is not restricted to specific domains. Our approach consists of two steps: for an incoming question, we first use a classifier to identify appropriate tables and columns in a structured database, and then employ a free-text retrieval to look up answers. The system uses part-of-speech tagging, named-entity normalization and a statistical classifier trained on data from the TREC QA task. With the TREC QA data, our system is shown to significantly outperform an existing rule-based table lookup method.

This paper presents a method to simulate continuous gross human body motion with the intention to establish a human motion corpus for learning and recognition. The simulation is achieved by a temporal-spatial-temporal decomposition of human motion into actions, joint actions and actionlets based on the human kinematic model. The actionlet models the primitive moving phase of a joint and represents the muscle movement governed by kinesiological principles. Joint actions and body actions are constructed from actionlets through constrained concatenation and synchronization. Methods for concatenation and synchronization are proposed in this paper. An action corpus with small number of action vocabularies is created to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

The paper explains how the study transforms the SOAR tutorial EATER game's playing rules as a platform to experience that CBR (or AI) agent plays with human player in a shared running-map for finding the CBR agent's best solution as competition with human player and Greedy agent. The advantage of AI project is that the experiment has to adopt human competition experience. There are many uncertain what CBR can achieve, which wait for the individual students to discover. The experiment results are different individually; the educators do not have to worry about the cheating in student assignments. The study found that the fun of interactive computer games would stimulate students' motivation in learning CBR concepts in AI.

Filtering Product Reviews from Web Search Results	DOCENG'07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 ACM SYMPOSIUM ON DOCUMENT ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	7th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering	AUG 28-31, 2007	Winnipeg, CANADA	ACM SIGWEB	Univ Manitoba	Genre Classification; Product Review Documents; Snippets		This study seeks to develop an automatic method to identify product reviews on the Web using the snippets (summary information) returned by search engines. Determining whether a snippet is a review or non-review is a challenging task, since the snippet usually does not contain many useful features for identifying review documents. Firstly we applied a common machine learning technique, SVM (Support Vector Machine), to investigate which features of snippets are useful for the classification. Then we employed a heuristic approach utilizing domain knowledge and found that the heuristic approach performs equally well as the machine learning approach. A hybrid approach which combines the machine learning technique and domain knowledge performs slightly better than the machine learning approach alone.

Naturally each OCR engine has its strengths and weaknesses, and therefore different engines tend to differ in the accuracy on different documents, and in the errors on the same document image. While the idea of using multiple OCR. engines to boost output accuracy is not new, most of the existing systems do not go beyond variations on majority voting. While this approach may work well in many cases, it has limitations, especially when OCR technology used to process a given script has not yet fully matured. Our goal is to develop a system called MEN10E (for "Multi-Evidence Multi-OCR-Engine") that combines, in an optimal or near-optimal way, output streams of one or more OCR engines together with various types of evidence extracted from these streams as well as from original document images, to produce output of higher quality than that of the individual OCR engines, or of majority voting applied to multiple OCR output streams. Furthermore, we aim to improve the accuracy of OCR output on images that might otherwise have low accuracy that significantly impacts downstream processing. The MEMOE system functions as an OCR engine taking document images and some configuration parameters as input and producing a single output text stream. In this paper, we describe the design of the system, various evidence types and how they are incorporated into MEMOE in the form of filters. Results of initial tests that involve two corpora of Arabic documents show that, even in its initial configuration, the system is superior to a voting algorithm and that even more improvement may be achieved by incorporating additional evidence types into the system.

An industrial OCR application combines algorithms studied in detail by different researchers in the area of image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, language analysis, document understanding, data mining, and other, artificial intelligence domains. There is no single perfect algorithm for any of the OCR problems, so modem systems try to adapt themselves to the actual features of the image or document to be recognized. This paper describes the architecture of a modem OCR system with an emphasis on this adaptation process.

Behavior analysis-based learning framework for host level intrusion detection	ECBS 2007: 14th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshops on the Engineering of Computer-Based Systems, Proceedings: RAISING EXPECTATIONS OF COMPUTER-BASES SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	14th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on Engineering of Computer-Based Systems (ECBS 2007)	MAR 26-29, 2007	Tucson, AZ	IEEE Comp Soc, Conf Publ Serv, OECE	Univ Arizona			Machine learning has great utility within the context of network intrusion detection systems. In this paper, a behavior analysis-based learning framework for host level network intrusion detection is proposed, consisting of two parts, anomaly detection and alert verification. The anomaly detection module processes unlabeled data using a clustering algorithm to detect abnormal behaviors. The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms. In this framework, the host behavior is not represented by a single user or program activity; instead, it is represented by a set of factors, called behavior set, so that the host behavior can be described more accurately and completely.

In such cases law enforcement agencies are unable in many cases to single out an attacker from all the users hidden behind the NAT. In this paper we present an innovative approach for clustering the sessions emanating from the NAT in order to identify the attacker. Each cluster should ideally include only the sessions emanating from a specific computer, A system that implements the new approach was developed. It was used to evaluate the new approach performance in a real environment that included 24 computers hidden behind the NAT. The preliminary evaluation results have demonstrated the superiority of the new approach over existing solutions and its ability to assist in locating potential attackers hidden behind a NAT.

Unfortunately, traditional port-based classification and packet payload-based analysis exhibit a number of shortfalls. An alternative is to use Machine Learning (AIL) techniques and identify network applications based on per-flow features. Since a lot of flow features can be used for flow classification and there are many irrelevant and redundant features among them, feature selection plays a vital role in performance optimizing. In this paper, we propose a wrapper-based feature selection method for JP flow classification using modified random-mutation hill-climbing (RMHC) and C4.5 algorithm (MRMHC-C4.5). The experiments show our approach can greatly improve computational performance without negative impact on classification accuracy.

In this study, we have presented an identification system to identify the sex of a person in a Turkish chat medium. Here, the sex identification is taken as a base study in the information raining in chat mediums. This system acquires data from a chat medium, and then automatically detects the chatter's sex from the information exchanged between chatters and compares them with the known identities of the chatters. To do this task, a simple discrimination function is used to determine the sex of the chatters. A semantic analysis method is also proposed to enhance the performance of the system. The system with the semantic analyzer has achieved accuracy over 90% in the sex identification in the real chat medium.

Previous researchers built dictionaries of gene/protein names from online databases and incorporated them into machine learning models as features, but the effects were very limited. This paper gives a quality assessment of four dictionaries derived form online resources, and investigate the impacts of two factors (i.e., dictionary coverage and noisy terms) that may lead to the poor performance of dictionary features. Experiments are performed by comparing performances of the external dictionaries and a dictionary derived from GENETAG corpus, using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with dictionary features. We also make observations of the impacts regarding long names and short names. The results show that low coverage of long names and noises of short names are the main problems of current online resources and a high quality dictionary could substantially improve the accuracy of BioNER.

Although the original proof was non-constructive, efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms have been developed to determine regular partitions for arbitrary graphs. This paper reports a first attempt at applying Szemeredi's result to computer vision and pattern recognition problems. Motivated by a powerful auxiliary result which, given a partitioned graph, allows one to construct a small reduced graph which inherits many properties of the original one, we develop a two-step pairwise clustering strategy in an attempt to reduce computational costs while preserving satisfactory classification accuracy. Specifically, Szemeredi's partitioning process is used as a preclustering step to substantially reduce the size of the input graph in a way which takes advantage of the strong notion of edge-density regularity. Clustering is then performed on the reduced graph using standard algorithms and the solutions obtained are then mapped back into the original graph to create the final groups. Experimental results conducted on standard benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as well as on image segmentation tasks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A challenging task in building agent-based supply network models is to properly specify agent attributes and behaviours. Machine learning techniques, such as Q-learning, can be a useful tool for this purpose. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that has been shown to be an effective adaptation and searching mechanism in distributed settings. In this study, Q-learning is employed by supply network agents to search for 'optimal' values for a parameter in their operating policies simultaneously and independently. Methods are designed to identify the 'optimal' parameter values against which effectiveness of the learning is evaluated. Robustness of the learning's effectiveness is also examined through consideration of different model settings and scenarios. Results show that Q-learning is very effective in finding the 'optimal' parameter values in all model settings and scenarios considered.

Event detection using "variable module graphs" for home care applications	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ALGORITHM	Technology has reached new heights making sound and video capture devices ubiquitous and affordable. We propose a paradigm to exploit this technology for home care applications especially for surveillance and complex event detection. Complex vision tasks such as event detection in a surveillance video can be divided into subtasks such as human detection, tracking, recognition, and trajectory analysis. The video can be thought of as being composed of various features. These features can be roughly arranged in a hierarchy from low-level features to high-level features. Low- level features include edges and blobs, and high-level features include objects and events. Loosely, the low-level feature extraction is based on signal/ image processing techniques, while the high-level feature extraction is based on machine learning techniques. Traditionally, vision systems extract features in a feed- forward manner on the hierarchy, that is, certain modules extract low- level features and other modules make use of these low-level features to extract high-level features. Along with others in the research community, we have worked on this design approach. In this paper, we elaborate on recently introduced V/M graph. We present our work on using this paradigm for developing applications for home care applications. Primary objective is surveillance of location for subject tracking as well as detecting irregular or anomalous behavior. This is done automatically with minimal human involvement, where the system has been trained to raise an alarm when anomalous behavior is detected.

J	West, K; Lamere, P				West, Kris; Lamere, Paul			A model-based approach to constructing music similarity functions	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Several authors have presented systems that estimate the audio similarity of two pieces of music through the calculation of a distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance, between spectral features calculated from the audio, related to the timbre or pitch of the signal. These features can be augmented with other, temporally or rhythmically based features such as zero-crossing rates, beat histograms, or fluctuation patterns to form a more well-rounded music similarity function. It is our contention that perceptual or cultural labels, such as the genre, style, or emotion of the music, are also very important features in the perception of music. These labels help to define complex regions of similarity within the available feature spaces. We demonstrate a machine-learning-based approach to the construction of a similarity metric, which uses this contextual information to project the calculated features into an intermediate space where a music similarity function that incorporates some of the cultural information may be calculated.

Intelligent broadcasting in mobile ad hoc networks: Three classes of adaptive protocols	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; DELIVERY	Because adaptability greatly improves the performance of a broadcast protocol, we identify three ways in which machine learning can be applied to broadcasting in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We chose broadcasting because it functions as a foundation of MANET communication. Unicast, multicast, and geocast protocols utilize broadcasting as a building block, providing important control and route establishment functionality. Therefore, any improvements to the process of broadcasting can be immediately realized by higher-level MANET functionality and applications. While efficient broadcast protocols have been proposed, no single broadcasting protocol works well in all possible MANET conditions. Furthermore, protocols tend to fail catastrophically in severe network environments. Our three classes of adaptive protocols are pure machine learning, intra-protocol learning, and inter-protocol learning. In the pure machine learning approach, we exhibit a new approach to the design of a broadcast protocol: the decision of whether to rebroadcast a packet is cast as a classification problem. Each mobile node (MN) builds a classifier and trains it on data collected from the network environment. Using intra-protocol learning, each MN consults a simple machine model for the optimal value of one of its free parameters. Lastly, in inter-protocol learning, MNs learn to switch between different broadcasting protocols based on network conditions. For each class of learning method, we create a prototypical protocol and examine its performance in simulation. Copyright (c) 2007 Michael D. Colagrosso.

The approach to this problem we consider is Reinforcement Learning (RL). Stationary policies, applied by most RL methods, may be improper in control applications, since for time discretization fine enough they do not exhibit exploration capabilities and define policy gradient estimators of very large variance. As a remedy to those difficulties, we proposed earlier the use of piecewise non-Markov policies. In the experimental study presented here we apply our approach to a 6-degree-of-freedom walking robot and obtain an efficient policy for this object.

These tools are embedded in Learning Management Systems (LMS) and have as goal evaluation of learners. A problem that currently appears is that assessment tools are not always fair or accurate in classifying students according with accumulated knowledge. We propose a software module called Quality Module (QM) that may run along with an assessment tool within an LMS. The QM performs offline analysis and obtains knowledge regarding the classification capability of the assessment tool. The QM also obtains knowledge for course managers regarding the course difficulty such that course materials and quizzes may be altered in order to obtain a more accurate assessment tool and thus better classification among learners.

Machine learning could provide invaluable support for automatically inferring diagnostic rules from descriptions of past cases, making the diagnosis process more objective and reliable. Since the problem involves both test and misclassification costs, we have analyzed ICET, the most prominent approach in the literature for complex cost problems. The hybrid algorithm tries to avoid the pitfalls of traditional greedy induction by performing a heuristic search in the space of possible decision trees through evolutionary mechanisms. Our implementation solves some of the problems of the initial ICET algorithm, proving it to be a viable solution for the problem considered.

It applies machine learning and text mining techniques to identify the most probable answers to factoid and definition questions respectively. Its major quality is that it mainly relies on the use of lexical information and avoids applying any complex language processing resources such as named entity classifiers, parsers and ontologies. Experimental results on the Spanish Question Answering task at CLEF 2006 show that the proposed architecture can be a practical solution for monolingual question answering by reaching a precision as high as 51%.

Here we present an empirical study focusing on various versions of Genetic Programming and other well known Machine Learning techniques to predict Median Oral Lethal Dose (LD50) and Plasma Protein Binding (%PPB) levels. Since these two parameters respectively characterize the harmful effects and the distribution into human body of a drug, their accurate prediction is essential for the selection of effective molecules. The obtained results confirm that Genetic Programming is a promising technique for predicting pharmacokinetics parameters, both from the point of view of the accurateness and of the generalization ability.

In particular, heterogeneous and missing data must be tolerated, the results should be easily interpretable. Moreover, with genetic data, often the combination of two or more attributes leads to non-linear effects not detectable for each attribute on its own. We present a new ML algorithm, HCS, taking inspiration from learning classifier systems, decision trees and statistical hypothesis testing. We show the results of applying this algorithm to a well-known benchmark dataset, and to HNSCC, a dataset studying the connection between smoke and genetic patterns to the development of oral cancer.

We are interested in understanding how cells recognize the proteins that are to be exported and how the necessary information is encoded in the so called "Signal Sequences". In this paper, we address these problems by building a physico-chemical model of signal sequence recognition, using experimental data. This model was built using decision trees. In a first phase the classifier were built from a set of features derived from the current knowledge about signal sequences. It was then expanded by feature generation with genetic algorithms. The resulting predictors are efficient, achieving an accuracy of more than 99% with our wild-type proteins set. Furthermore the generated features can give us a biological insight about the export mechanism. Our tool is freely available through a web interface.

The fact that such co-regulated genes may be differentially regulated suggests that subtle differences in the shared cis-acting regulatory elements are likely significant, however it is unknown which of these features increase or reduce expression of genes. In principle, this expression can be measured by microarray experiments, though they incorporate systematic errors, and moreover produce a limited classification (e.g. up/down regulated genes). In this work, we present an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle the complexities governing gene expression, which considers gene expression data as one feature among many. It analyzes features concurrently, recognizes dynamic relations and generates profiles, which are groups of promoters sharing common features. The method makes use of multiobjective techniques to evaluate the performance of profiles, and has a multimodal approach to produce alternative descriptions of same expression target. We apply this method to probe the regulatory networks governed by the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system in the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our analysis uncovered profiles that were experimentally validated, suggesting correlations between promoter regulatory features and gene expression kinetics measured by green fluorescent protein (GFP) assays.

The lamina structure is considerably deformed after activation of cell death (apoptosis). The spatial organization of the lamina is the initial structural change found after activation of the apoptotic pathway, therefore can be used as a marker to identify cells activated for apoptosis. Here we investigated whether the spatial changes in lamina spatial organization can be recognized by machine learning algorithms to classify normal and apoptotic cells. Classical machine learning algorithms were applied to classification of 3D image sections of nuclear lamina proteins, taken from normal and apoptotic cells. We found that the Evolutionary-optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm succeeded in the classification of normal and apoptotic cells in a highly satisfying result. This is the first time that cells are classified based on lamina spatial organization using the machine learning approach.

J	Im, KH; Park, SC				Im, Kwang Hyuk; Park, Sang Chan			Case-based reasoning and neural network based expert system for personalization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; neural network; case-based reasoning; knowledge base; personalization; cosmetic industry		We suggest a hybrid expert system of case-based reasoning (CBR) and neural network (NN) for symbolic domain. In previous research, we proposed a hybrid system of memory and neural network based learning. In the system, the feature weights are extracted from the trained neural network, and used to improve retrieval accuracy of case-based reasoning. However, this system has worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. When the feature values are symbolic, nearest neighbor methods typically resort to much simpler metrics, such as counting the features that match. A more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required in symbolic domains. We propose feature-weighted CBR with neural network, which uses value difference metric (VDM) as distance function for symbolic features. In our system, the feature weight set calculated from the trained neural network plays the core role in connecting both the learning strategies. Moreover, the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base. To validate our system, illustrative experimental results are presented. We use datasets from the UCI machine learning archive for experiments. Finally, we present an application with a personalized counseling system for cosmetic industry whose questionnaires have symbolic features. Feature-weighted CBR with neural network predicts the five elements, which show customers' character and physical constitution, with relatively high accuracy and expert system for personalization recommends personalized make-up style, color, life style and products.

Yet, the information that resides in customer databases only records transactions at a single company, whereby customer loyalty is generally unavailable. In this study, we enrich the customer database with a prediction of a customer's behavioral loyalty such that it can be deployed for targeted marketing actions without the necessity to measure the loyalty of every single customer. To this end, we compare multiple linear regression with two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (random forests and automatic relevance determination neural networks), and we show that (i) a customer's behavioral loyalty can be predicted to a reasonable degree using the transactional database, (ii) given that overfitting is controlled for by the variable-selection procedure we propose in this study, a multiple linear regression model significantly outperforms the other models, (iii) the proposed variable-selection procedure has a beneficial impact on the reduction of multicollinearity, and (iv) the most important indicator of behavioral loyalty consists of the variety of products previously purchased.

J	Polat, K; Sahan, S; Kodaz, H; Gunes, S				Polat, Kemal; Sahan, Seral; Kodaz, Halife; Guenes, Salih			Breast cancer and liver disorders classification using artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) with performance evaluation by fuzzy resource allocation mechanism	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fuzzy resource allocation; AIRS; Breast Cancer dataset; Liver Disorders dataset; k-Fold cross-validation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CLASSIFIERS; DIAGNOSIS; RULES	Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) classification algorithm, which has an important place among classification algorithms in the field of Artificial Immune Systems, has showed an effective and intriguing performance on the problems it was applied. AIRS was previously applied to some medical classification problems including Breast Cancer, Cleveland Heart Disease, Diabetes and it obtained very satisfactory results. So, AIRS proved to be an efficient artificial intelligence technique in medical field. In this study, the resource allocation mechanism of AIRS was changed with a new one determined by Fuzzy-Logic. This system, named as Fuzzy-AIRS was used as a classifier in the diagnosis of Breast Cancer and Liver Disorders, which are of great importance in medicine. The classifications of Breast Cancer and BUPA Liver Disorders datasets taken from University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository were done using 10-fold cross-validation method. Reached classification accuracies were evaluated by comparing them with reported classifiers in UCI web site in addition to other systems that are applied to the related problems. Also, the obtained classification performances were compared with AIRS with regard to the classification accuracy, number of resources and classification time. Fuzzy-AIRS, which reached to classification accuracy of 98.51% for breast cancer, classified the Liver Disorders dataset with 83.36% accuracy. For both datasets, Fuzzy-AIRS obtained the highest classification accuracy according to the UCI web site. Beside of this success, Fuzzy-AIRS gained an important advantage over the AIRS by means of classification time. In the experiments, it was seen that the classification time in Fuzzy-AIRS was reduced about 70% of AIRS for both datasets. By reducing classification time as well as obtaining high classification accuracies in the applied datasets, Fuzzy-AIRS classifier proved that it could be used as an effective classifier for medical problems.

To enable knowledge sharing and reuse, current middleware make the assumption that a single, universally accepted, ontology exists with which queries and assertions are exchanged. We argue that such an assumption is unrealistic. Rather different communities will speak different 'dialects'; in order to enable cross-community interactions, thus increasing the range of services and information available to users, on-the-fly translations are required. In this paper we introduce MaLM, a middleware for pervasive computing devices that exploits an unsupervised machine learning technique called Self-Organising Map to tackle the problem of ontology heterogeneity. At any given time, the MaLM instance running on a device operates in one of two possible modes: 'training', that is, MaLM is autonomically learning how to group together semantically closed concepts; and 'expert', that is, given in input a query or assertion expressed in a foreign dialect, MaLM identifies the concept, expressed in the device mother-tongue, that most closely represents it.

But its potential self-adaptive learning capability has not been paid enough attention in reservoir operation research. In this paper an operating rule classification system based on LCS, which learns through credit assignment (the bucket brigade algorithm) and rule discovery(the genetic algorithm), is established to extract water-supply reservoir operating rules. The proposed system acquires the online identification rate 95% for training samples and offline rate 85% for testing samples in a case study, and further discussions are made about the impacts on the performances or behaviors of the rule classification system from three aspects of obtained rules, training or testing samples and the comparisons between the rule classification system and the artificial neural network (ANN).

Support vector machines (SVMs), based on statistical learning theory, are gaining applications in the areas of machine learning and pattern recognition because of the high accuracy and good generalization capability. This study briefly introduces the SVM regression algorithms, and presents the SVM model for predicting yarn properties. Model selection which amounts to search in hyper-parameter space is performed for study of suitable parameters with grid research method Experimental results have been compared with those of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The investigation indicates that in the small data sets and real-life production, SVM models are capable of maintaining the stability of predictive accuracy, and more suitable for noisy and dynamic spinning process.

Based on D.Wu's data mining model, the TOPSIS model presented in this paper has improved from two aspects. Firstly, it extents to deal with both crisp and fuzzy data; Secondly, in order to really following automatic machine learning principles to the largest extent, the weights must be immune to the subjective element and the data noise. Here, the weights are obtained from data sets based on support vector regression(SVR), which is a more robust and efficient data regression method than the traditional data regression method. Thus the proposed model can provide additional efficient tool for comparative analysis of data sets. We apply it in supply chain complexity evaluation, and simulation is used to validate the proposed models.

With volumes of data growing increasingly, it's important to design the algorithms which are more efficient. Therefore, a parallel algorithm of PSTCL (Parallel Sub-Top Concept Lattice) is developed in this paper.

This paper presents a one-sided fuzzy support vector machine algorithm based on sphere to improve the classification performance of the minority class. Firstly, the approach obtains the minimal hyper sphere of the majority class; secondly, it uses the center and radius of the hyper sphere to give the fuzzy membership of the majority instances, and thus effectively reduces the influence of majority noises and redundant instances in the classification process. Experiments show that our new approach improves not only the classification performance of the minority class more effectively, but also the classification performance of the whole data set comparing with other methods.

In recent years, ontology-based web documents classification method is introduced to solve the problem of classifier training and not considering semantic relations between words in traditional Machine Learning algorithms. However, previous works on ontology-based web documents classification miss some important tissues of automatic ontology construction and ranking of classified documents. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an ontology-based web documents classification and ranking method Firstly, weighted terms set are extracted from web documents, and ontology is build up by using an effective ontology construction method which clarifies and augments an existent ontology; then similarity score between documents and ontology is computed based on WordNet by using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) method; finally, web documents are assigned to categories according to the similarity score, and a simple ranking method is used to sort the documents in the same categories. The experiment result shows our classification algorithm achieves better precision and recall compare with adaptive KNN method, and is competitive with SVM method, the ranking method also has good performance.

We notice that the vague set theory introduced by Gau and Buehrer has been conceived as a new efficient tool to deal with ambiguous data and it has been applied successfully in different fields. A vague set, as a generalization of the concept of fuzzy set, is a set of decision objects, each of which has a grade of membership whose value is a continuous subinterval of [0, 1]. It is characterized by a truth-membership function and a false- membership function. In this paper, we analyze the similarity measures between vague sets given in literature. The concept of similarity degree is given. Then we revise them and propose a new kind of similarity measures. The new measures are more rational, thus providing a more useful way to measure the degree of similarity between vague sets.

SVM has such advantages as suitableness to high dimensional data, requirement of few samples and robustness to uncertainty, so it can be used to hyperspectral remote sensing image classification effectively. Based on the theory of SVM, a new approach for information classification on hyperspectral sensor has been developed by the experimental case of spatial information classification in central area of Shanghai city with PHI image. The algorithm is synthetically compared with the traditional classification methods. The experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, which results in higher classification accuracy than the traditional methods.

In this paper a finite state machine with evidential reasoning is proposed to control autonomous robots. The Khepera robot is used to demonstrate the control system. The experimental results show that the control system is able to automatically control the robot behaviours via evidential control rules, which can be designed by humans or automatically extracted using machine learning approaches. Therefore, the control system provides an efficient approach to transfer human knowledge to an autonomous robot.

Many deep Web sources are structured by providing structured query interfaces and results. Classifying such structured sources into domains is one of the critical steps toward the integration of heterogeneous Web sources. To date, in terms of the Classification, existing works mainly focus on classifying texts or Web documents, and there is little in the deep Web. In this paper, we present a deep Web model and machine learning based classifying model. The experimental results show that we can achieve a good performance with a small scale training samples for each domain, and as the number of training samples increases, the performance keeps stabilization.

Our multivariate approach covers aspects of software projects such as size, team structure, process orientation, complexity of existing solution, difficulty of problem, coupling aspects, time constrains, and testing data. We investigate the predictability of several severities of defects in software projects. Are defects with high severity difficult to predict? Are prediction models for defects that are discovered by internal staff similar to models for defects reported from the field? We present both an exact numerical prediction of future defect numbers based on regression models as well as a classification of software components as defect-prone based on the C4.5 decision tree. We create models to accurately predict short-term defects in a study of 5 applications composed of more than 8.000 classes and 700.000 lines of code. The model quality is assessed based on. 10-fold cross validation.

Due to the characteristic of the QPSO algorithm, the problems of traditional BPNN can be avoided, such as easily converging to local minimum.

First, item response theory modeling is used to provide continually refined estimates of problem solving ability as students solve a series of simulations. In parallel, students' strategies are modeled by self-organizing artificial neural network analysis, using the actions that students take during problem solving as the classifying inputs. This results in strategy maps detailing the qualitative and quantitative differences among problem solving approaches. Hidden Markov Modeling then develops learning trajectories across sequences of performances and results in stochastic models of problem solving progress across sequential strategic stages in the learning process. Using this layered analytical approach we have found that students quickly adopt preferential problem solving strategies, and continue to use them up to four months later. Furthermore, the approach has shown that students working in groups solve a higher percentage of the problems, stabilize their strategic approaches quicker, and use a more limited repertoire of strategies than do students working alone.

A genetic component determines the brain of the individuals, a machine learner architecture, which is then used to transmit knowledge. The a priori information is kept down to a minimum. All species are initially indistinguishable and agents can only find each other by chance at the beginning. Differentiation occurs as a result of the interactions between the genetic and the knowledge parts. Restricted availability of different symbolic values forces the emergence of more elaborated recognition patterns. The sequences that form as the result Of this Simulation cannot be related to either the genetic or the environmental initial conditions. A Baldwin effect is observed where parts of the machine learning, architecture adapts to accommodate for each species dominant Sequence, which further stabilizes it. Mutually infertile species, limited learning capacities. and a restricted imperfect communication are thus all that is needed for the emergence of stable recognition patterns.

The potential benefits of this procedure are faster and easier learning process as well as the generation of more compact and human-readable classifiers. The dimensionality reduction procedure we propose consists on the reduction of the, 20-letter amino acid (AA) alphabet, which is normally used to specify a protein sequence, into a lower cardinality alphabet. This reduction comes about by a clustering of AA types accordingly to their physical and chemical similarity. Our automated reduction procedure is guided by a fitness function based on the Mutual Information between the AA-based input attributes of the dataset and the protein structure feature that being predicted. To search for the optimal reduction, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA) was used, and afterwards the results of this process were fed into (and validated by) BioHEL, a genetics-based machine learning technique. BioHEL used the reduced alphabet to induce rules for protein structure prediction features. BioHEL results are compared to two standard machine learning systems. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the size of the alphabet used for prediction from twenty to just three letters resulting in more compact, i.e. interpretable, rules. Also, a protein-wise accuracy performance measure suggests that the loss of accuracy acrued by this substantial alphabet reduction is not statistically significant when compared to the full alphabet.

On the other hand. evolutionary computational technique is characterized as a soil computing learning method with its roots in the theory of evolution. During the past decade, SVM has been commonly used as a classifier for various applications. The evolutionary computation has also attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition and has shown significant performance improvement on a variety of applications. However, there has been no comparison of the two methods. In this paper, first we propose an improvement of a coevolutionary Computational classification algorithm, called Improved Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized EM (I-CFS-EM) algorithm. It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds Lip the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase. We also give an intensive analysis of the pros and cons of both approaches.

Incremental Refinement of Solutions for Multiple Objective Optimization Problems	GECCO 2007: GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE, VOL 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 07-11, 2007	London, ENGLAND	ACM		Machine Learning; Multiobjective optimization		MDQL is an algorithm, based on reinforcement learning. for solving multiple objective optimization problems, that has been tested on several applications with promising results [1]. MDQL discretizes the decision variables into a set of states, each associated with actions to move agents to contiguous states. A group of agents explore this state space and are able to find Pareto sets applying a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. The precision of the Pareto solutions depends on the chosen granularity of the states. A finer granularity on the states creates more precise solutions but at the expense of a larger search space, and consequently the need for more computational resources. An important improvement is presented. The new algorithm, called IMDQL. starts with a coarse granularity to find an initial Pareto set. A vicinity for each of the Pareto solutions in refined and a new Pareto set is founded in this refined state space. It is shown that IMDQL not only improves the solutions found by MDQL, but also converges faster and is capable to approximate dynamic Pareto fronts. The main consideration in the application of IMDQL to dynamic environments is that the agents in the algorithm start front the Pareto solutions obtained. Agents start with a deterministic environment constructed with fixed values for the value functions for the first dynamic parameters; when convergence is reached and a Pareto set is obtained, a new cycle is started, changing to the next value for the dynamic parameters. Agents start searching (adapting solutions) from the existing environments which correspond to the Pareto solutions obtained for the previous value for the dynamic parameters. Searching for new solutions, from the last Pareto set, given the new values for the dynamic parameters, significantly reduces the convergence time. IMDQL is tested on a real water distribution network design involving water-reusing treatment; plants and different contaminants concentrations [1]. In this problem, the concentration of contaminants can change over time so the search for optimal solutions becomes a continuous process. It is shown that IMDQL improves on the solutions found by MDQL with fixed concentrations and, that due to its incremental nature, it is able to adequately adjust its Pareto set solutions with dynamic changes in the contaminants concentrations as long as they are within the vicinity of the previous Pareto set. This is, to our knowledge, the first multi-objective optimization algorithm that is able to dynamically adjust the Pareto set with changing conditions and that can adjust the accuracy of its solutions. The solutions were also compared against MDQL that was compared against a reduced gradient method using a weighted combination of the two objective functions [1], see Figures 1 and 2 for comparisons of Pareto fronts obtained with MDQL, x, and IMDQL, square.

We have investigated the circumstances under which this can occur for both the 6-parity boolean learning task and a range of benchmark machine learning problems. We conclude that mutation is an important - and we believe a hitherto unrecognized - factor in preventing population collapse in multiobjective genetic programming; Without mutation we routinely observe population collapse. Front systematic variation of the mutation operator, we conclude that a necessary condition to avoid collapse is that mutation produces on average, an increase in tree sizes (bloating) at each generation which is then counterbalanced by the parsimony pressure applied during selection. Finally, we conclude that the use of a. genotype diversity preserving mechanism is ineffective at preventing population collapse.	[Badran, Khaled M.

In this paper we examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm to pre-process data before it is classified by an external classifier. Genetic Programming is combined with a Genetic Algorithm to construct and select new features from those available in the data, a potentially significant process for data mining since it gives consideration to hidden relationships between features. We then examine techniques to improve the human readability of these new features and extract more information about the domain.

GECCO 2007: GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE, VOL 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 07-11, 2007	London, ENGLAND	ACM		Ensemble Learning; Evolutionary Computation		Evolutionary Learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from which it generally returns (with some notable exceptions) the single best-of-run classifier as final result. In the meanwhile., Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity. is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based Oil the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-EEL) or incrementally along evolution (On-EEL). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-EEL outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.

First, we introduce a visual learning method that uses genetic programming individuals to represent hypotheses. individuals-hypotheses process image representation composed of visual primitives derived from the training images that contain objects to be recognized. The process of recognition is generative, i.e., an individual is supposed to restore the shape of the processed object by drawing its reproduction on a separate canvas. This canonical method is extended with a knowledge reuse mechanism that allows a learner to import genetic material from hypotheses that evolved for the other decision classes (object classes). We compare the performance of the extended approach to the basic method on a real-world tasks of handwritten character recognition, and conclude that knowledge reuse leads to significant convergence speedup and, more importantly, significantly reduces the risk of overfitting.

Learning classifier systems-and genetics-based machine learning in general-can greatly benefit from Such surrogates which may replace the costly matching procedure of a rule against large data sets. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of such surrogate fitness functions when coupled with the probabilistic models evolved by the chi-ary extended compact classifier system (chi eCCS). To achieve such a goal, we show the need that the probabilistic models should be able to represent all the accurate basis functions required for creating an accurate surrogate. we also introduce a procedure to transform populations Of rules based into dependency structure matrices (DSMs) which allows building accurate models of overlapping building blocks-a necessary condition to accurately estimate the fitness of the evolved rules.

A Support Vector machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semidefinite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions: we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages: first, it is no longer necessary to time the SVM parameter which Weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand. Finally, the user can actually see the point where overfitting occurs and can easily select. a solution from the Pareto front best suiting his or her needs.

Facetwise models have been developed to predict the effect of the imbalance ratio-ratio between the number of instances of the majority class and the minority class that are sampled to XCS-on population initialization, and oil the creation and deletion of classifiers of the minority class. While theoretical models show that, ideally, XCS scales linearly with the imbalance ratio, XCS with standard configuration scales exponentially. The causes that are potentially responsible for this deviation from the ideal scalability are also investigated. Specifically, the inheritance procedure of classifiers' parameters, mutation, and subsumption are analyzed, and improvements in XCS's mechanisms are proposed to effectively and efficiently handle imbalanced problems. Once the recommendations are incorporated to XCS, empirical results show that the population size in XCS indeed scales linearly with the imbalance ratio.

This paper uses machine learning to derive an objective in a feature space based on selected examples of previous designs, thus implicitly capturing the features that distinguish that set from others without requiring a predetermined measure of fitness. A genetic algorithm is used to generate new designs, and these arc shown to recognisably display the appropriate features. It is demonstrated that the range of relevant features and optimal solutions is easily varied in proportion to the examples selected to define the objective.

Almost universally the process requires the extraction of tissue (biopsy) and examination of its microstructure by a human. To improve diagnoses based on limited and inconsistent morphologic knowledge, a new approach has recently been proposed that uses molecular spectroscopic imaging to utilize microscopic chemical composition for diagnoses. In contrast to visible, imaging, the approach results in very large data sets as each pixel contains the entire molecular vibrational spectroscopy data front all chemical species. Here, we propose data handling and analysis strategies to allow computer-based diagnosis of human prostate cancer by applying a novel genetics-based machine learning technique (NAX). We apply this technique to demonstrate both fast learning and accurate classification that, additionally, scales well with parallelization. Preliminary results demonstrate that this approach can improve current clinical practice in diagnosing prostate cancer.

These issues were considered by contributions submitted to Group 1 of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW15), which focused on the association of quantitative expression data. These contributions evaluated diverse hypotheses, including those relevant to cancer and obesity research, and used various analytic techniques, many of which were derived from information theory. Several observations from these reports stand out. First, one needs to consider the genetic model of the trait of interest and carefully select which single nucleotide polymorphisms and individuals are included early in the design stage of a study Second, by targeting specific pathways when analyzing genome-wide data, one can generate more interpretable results than agnostic approaches. Finally, for clatasets with small sample sizes but a large number of features like the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 dataset, machine learning approaches may be more practical than traditional parametric approaches.

The focus of this group was to identify candidate genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis or surrogate outcomes. The association methods proposed in this group were diverse, from better known approaches, such as logistic regression for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and haplotype sharing tests to methods less familiar to genetic epidemiologists, such as machine learning and visualization methods. The majority of papers analyzed Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problems 2 (rheumatoid arthritis data) and 3 (simulated data). The highlighted points of this group analyses were: (1) haplotype-based statistics can be more powerful than single SNP analysis for risk-locus localization; (2) considering linkage disequilibrium block structure in haplotype analysis may reduce the likelihood of false-positive results; and (3) visual representation of genetic models for continuous covariates may help identify SNPs associated with the underlying quantitative trait loci.

With that growth, the challenges to understanding the meaning of the underlying information also grow. A currently popular approach to dissecting such information falls under the broad category of data mining. This can apply to any approach that tries to extract relevant information from large amounts of data, but often refers to methods that deal, in a non-linear fashion, with very large numbers of variables that cannot be simultaneously handled by more conventional statistical methods. To explore the usefulness of some of these approaches, 13 groups applied a variety of strategies to the first dataset provided to GAW 15 participants. With the extensive microarray and SNP data provided for 14 CEPH families, these groups explored multistage analyses, machine learning methods, network construction, and other techniques to try to answer questions about gene-gene interaction, functional similarities, co-regulated gene expression and the mapping of gene expression determinants, among others. In general, the methods offered strategies to provide a better understanding of the complex pathways involved in gene expression and function. These are still "works in progress," often exploratory in nature, but they provide insights into ways in which the data might be interpreted. Despite the still preliminary nature of some of these methods and the diversity of the approaches, some common themes emerged. The collection of papers and methods offer a starting point for further exploration of complex interactions in human genetic data now readily available.

Because these tasks become increasingly important, three different data sets were provided for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15, thus allowing examination of various novel and existing data mining methods for both classification and identification of disease susceptibility genes, gene by gene or gene by environment interaction. The approach most often applied in this presentation group was random forests because of its simplicity, elegance, and robustness. It was used for prediction and for screening for interesting SNPs in a first step. The logistic tree with unbiased selection approach appeared to be an interesting alternative to efficiently select interesting SNPs. Machine learning, specifically ensemble methods, might be useful as pre-screening tools for large-scale association studies because they can be less prone to overfitting, can be less computer processor time intensive, can easily include pair-wise and higher-order interactions compared with standard statistical approaches and can also have a high capability for classification. However, improved implementations that are able to deal with hundreds of thousands of SNPs at a time are required.

With an important problem - the recognition of functional target sites for microRNA molecules - as an example, we show how multiple genetic programming classifiers improve accuracy and stability. Moving from single classifiers to bagging and boosting with crossvalidation and parameter optimization requires more computing power. A special-purpose search processor for fitness evaluation renders boosted genetic programming practical for our purposes.

Splice site prediction using stochastic regular grammars	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						splice sites; gene prediction; stochastic grammars; machine learning	PROBABILISTIC-AUTOMATA; GENOMIC DNA; SEQUENCE; MODELS	This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of splice site prediction, by applying stochastic grammar inference. We used four grammar inference algorithms to infer 1465 grammars, and used 10- fold cross- validation to select the best grammar for each algorithm. The corresponding grammars were embedded into a classifier and used to run splice site prediction and compare the results with those of NNSPLICE, the predictor used by the Genie gene finder. We indicate possible paths to improve this performance by using Sakakibara's windowing technique to find probability thresholds that will lower false-positive predictions.	[Kashiwabara, A.

To address that limitation, we introduce Learner of Functional Enrichment (LeFE), a statistical/machine learning algorithm based on Random Forest, and demonstrate it on several diverse datasets: smoker/never smoker, breast cancer classification, and cancer drug sensitivity. We also compare it with previously published algorithms, including Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. LeFE regularly identifies statistically significant functional themes consistent with known biology.

This is accomplished through the use of discriminative machine learning techniques, including a novel training algorithm. We use a two-stage approach, in which a set of binary classifiers designed to recognize coding region boundaries is combined with a global model of gene structure. CONTRAST predicts exact coding region structures for 65% more human genes than the previous state-of-the-art method, misses 46% fewer exons and displays comparable gains in specificity.

In the previous study, we have applied the machine learning system BONSAI to predict patterns based on which positive and negative examples could be classified. Although BONSAI has helped establish 2 interesting rules regarding the requirements for N-myristoylation, the accuracy rates of these rules are not satisfactory. This paper suggests an enhancement of BONSAI by introducing an "insignificant indexing symbol" and demonstrates the efficiency of this enhancement by showing an improvement in the accuracy rates. We further examine the performance of this enhanced BONSAI by comparing the results of classification obtained the proposed method and an existing public method for the same sets of positive and negative examples.

The ability to predict polyadenylation site will allow us to define gene boundaries, predict number of genes present in a particular gene locus and perhaps better understand mRNA metabolism. To this end, we built an arabidopsis polyadenylation prediction model. The prediction model uses a machine learning method which consists of four sequential steps: feature generation, feature selection, feature integration and cascade classifier. We have tested our model on public datasets and achieved more 14 than 97% sensitivity and specificity. We have also directly compared with another arabidopsis prediction model, PASS 1.0, and have achieved better results.

A part of the coastal wetland in the Northern Jiangsu Province was taken as test area. Decision tree classifiers derived using different ways were applied to the classification of coastal wetland and the results were compared by independent sampling points. It was shown that the post-classification improvements by using knowledge rules could achieve higher accuracy than automatic machine learning method. In the post-classification improvements, the selection of feature vectors was crucial to the improvement of accuracy of classification.

In this paper, we propose a market-based resource management approach for cognitive radios using machine learning, consisting of a negotiation phase where nodes are allocated resources in order to meet their requested bit rate, and a learning phase where nodes adjust their pricing of the resources in order to steer the cognitive radio environment towards the greater network good.

Our work explores the possibility of applying marginalized kernels to image processing. In machine learning, performant algorithms have been developed for data organized as real valued arrays; these algorithms are used for various purposes like classification or regression. However, they are inappropriate for direct use on complex data sets. Our work consists of two distinct parts. In the first one we model the images by graphs to be able to represent their structural properties and inherent attributes. In the second one, we use kernel functions to project the graphs in a mathematical space that allows the use of performant classification algorithms. Experiments are performed on medical images acquired with various modalities and concerning different parts of the body.

The method consists in the learning of sets composed of synthetic graph prototypes which are used for a classification step. These learning graphs are generated by simultaneously maximizing the recognition rate while minimizing the confusion rate. Using such an approach the algorithm provides a range of solutions, the couples (confusion, recognition) which suit to the needs of the system. Experiments are performed on real data sets, representing 10 symbols. These tests demonstrate the interest to produce prototypes instead of finding representatives which simply belong to the data set.

Motivations come from machine learning and data mining. For binary strings we develop a linear-time algorithm for any k. Key to efficiency is a special-purpose data structure, called W-tree, which reflects relations between repetition lengths of symbols. Existence of algorithms faster than obvious dynamic programming remains open for non-binary strings. Our problem is also equivalent to finding weighted independent sets of prescribed size in paths. We show that this problem in bounded-degree graphs is FPT.

AL usually means active, self-conscious and independent learning, which is opposite to the type of passive, mechanical or receptive learning. AL has always been a hot issue of machine learning research. In this paper, based on the theory of Dynamic Fuzzy Logic(DFL), autonomic learning model and algorithm are developed, which provide a theoretical basis for the people to solve this type of problem. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of this autonomic learning method.

And the output of partitional clustering is sensitive to the initial parameters. Therefore, it is very important to choose the optimal parameter for a specific clustering algorithm. In the past, parameter selection usually is up to the empirically optimal clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to parameter selection for partitional clustering based on the stability analysis of dynamical system. The main idea is as follows: any clustering algorithm can not always partition a data set into meaningful subsets, therefore the parameters corresponding to the worse clustering result should not be the optimal, especially for those corresponding to the stable worse clustering output. Such framework is called the worse clustering performance analysis. As its application, we not only present how to do parameter selection for several clustering models, but also reveal that the extreme point of its objective function does not guarantee to be the stable fixed point of this clustering algorithm. From a machine learning point of view, such conclusion means that the learning algorithm maybe not reach its original expectation under some circumstance.

Comparison of machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for the prediction of human single nucleotide polymorphisms	GRC: 2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRANULAR COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing	NOV 02-04, 2007	San Jose, CA	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			FACTOR-BINDING SITES; RETRIEVAL	This paper compares machine learning techniques and pattern discovery algorithms for the prediction of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We selected six pattern discovery algorithms (YMF; Projection, Weeder, MotifSampler, AlignACE and ANN-Spec) and two machine learning techniques (Random Forests and K-Nearest Neighbours) and applied them to the DNA sequences flanking noncoding SNPs on human chromosome 21. We compared the pattern similarity amongst the methods and validated the predictions using known SNPs on chromosome 22. Parameterization of both machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms was critical to their performance. Memory usage was broadly constant amongst the pattern discovery algorithms, but the CPU running time varied significantly between deterministic and probabilistic pattern discovery methods, i.e., on average, probabilistic methods run19 times slower than deterministic methods. This is the fist demonstration of SNP prediction, as well as the first comparison of machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms in SNP prediction studies.

Both types of chess game systems are planned searching expert computer systems without machine learning capability. However computer GO game systems are still far behind human GO masters's capability. Therefore a machine learning game theory could be still important research in game theory.

However, most Chinese medical sites do not have wealthy content to satisfy all searchers. In this paper we propose an approach to meta-search Chinese health information on the Internet. Our system queries several general-purpose search engines and merges the returned search results into one ranked list. A major issue of developing a meta-search engine is how to integrate search results of different search engines. We propose a merging strategy that uses five features to estimate the merging score of a result entity. All result entities reported by source search engines are merged into one ranked list according to their merging scores. We intend to generate a high precision ranked list by raising the ranks of the documents that are in the medical domain. We conduct a search task to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experimental results show that our meta-search engine performs better than Google Web search engine. The proposed merging method can provide better search results for health information seekers.

Drowsy driver detection system is one of the potential applications of intelligent vehicle systems. Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make preassumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the Facial Action Coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. In addition, head motion was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes during a driving computer game with 96% accuracy within subjects and above 90% accuracy across subjects. This is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting real drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human behavior during drowsy driving.

In order to achieve the required on-line assessment of those affective states, we propose to extract features from physiological signals from the user (Blood Volume Pulse, Galvanic Skin Response, Skin Temperature and Pupil Diameter), which can be processed by learning pattern recognition systems to classify the user's affective state. An initial implementation of our proposed system was set up to address the detection of "stress" states in a computer user. A computer-based "Paced Stroop Test" was designed to act as a stimulus to elicit emotional stress in the subject. Signal processing techniques were applied to the physiological signals monitored to extract features used by three learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine to classify relaxed vs. stressed states.

The application domain is the psychotherapeutic treatment of anorectic young women. The three techniques are supposed to support the therapists in finding the variables which influence success or failure in therapy. To evaluate the utility of the three techniques we developed on the one hand a report system which helped subjects to formulate and document in a self-directed manner the insights they gained when using the three techniques. On the other hand, focus groups were held with the subjects. The combination of these very different evaluation methods prevents jumping to false conclusions and enables for an comprehensive assessment of the tested techniques. The combined results indicate that the three techniques (EDA, ML, and GRAVI) are complementary and therefore should be used in conjunction.

Different thresholds were used for different categories to optimize results and effectively minimize resources necessary for manual coding of a large number of claims narratives randomly extracted from a large U.S. insurer. The results indicated that utilizing a computer approach with strategic assignment of manual narratives filtered out approximately 15% of the narratives for manual review and resulted in a final accuracy at the two-digit classification level of 81%..

Especially, knowledge of human recognition to free text is very useful, and we can construct a model of writing medical document. Concretely, this knowledge is "Context based Structure (CBS)" based on Diagnostic-Therapeutic cycle. On this time, we analyzed actual medical document (Incident / Accident Report in hospital) using this CBS and we made navigate system that was able to display something HCWs should write about according to judge contents.

We hypothesize that this approach could help task analysts identify activity units performed by the call center agent. The term activity units, in our study, represent the subtasks the agents perform during a remote troubleshooting process. We also investigate whether this tool could help predict the activity units as well. An effort-intensive field-based data collection for the call center's naturalistic decision making's environment was accomplished. A human expert and an additional 18 Purdue students participated in the validation of the assigned subtasks. The machine learning tool's performance was then examined. The preliminary results support our hypotheses that the fuzzy Bayesian based tool is able to learn and predict subtask categories from the agent/customer narrative telephone conversations.

Search engines store the web pages in classified directories and for this process even though some search engines depend on human expertise; most of the search engines use automated methods for classification of web pages. In this paper we use machine-learning techniques for the automated classification of web pages. We consider only URL features for classification as the URL name is unique, meaningful and helps identification of their subject categories most of the times. Experimental results show that machine learning techniques for automated classification of web pages with URL features proves to be the best and more useful method for scorch engines.	[Devi, M.

It is generally believed that boosting-like learning rules are not suited to a strong and stable learner such as LDA. The theory proposed here is composed of a cross-validation mechanism of weakening a strong learner and a subsequent estimation method of appropriate weakness for the classifiers created by the learner. The weakness analysis theory, attempts to boost the strong learner by increasing the diversity between the classifiers created by the learner, at the expense of decreasing their margins, so as to achieve a tradeoff suggested by recent boosting studies for a low generalization error. In addition, a novel distribution accounting for the pair wise class discriminant information is introduced for effective interaction between the booster and the learner. The integration of all these methodologies proposed here leads to a more flexible framework capable of boosting the traditional Face recognizers such as LDA and PCA. Promising experimental results obtained on various difficult face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We believe that this work is especially beneficial in extending the boosting framework to accommodate general (strong/weak) learners.

This paper presents a new classifier fusion system based on the principles of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence combination. The system tackles the advantages of combining different sources of information to attain a high degree of stability across different problem domains. The uncertainty evaluation provided by the Dempster-Shafer theory also contributes to achieving this, stability. System evaluation has confirmed the assumptions related to stability and allows us to formulate a method of establishing the baseline accuracy for any problem domain. Thus, the choice of a specific learning scheme for a certain problem is justified only if it's Performance is better than that of the system proposed here.

Starting from an initial segmentation, hypotheses are generated by perturbing local corfigurations and processed in a high-confidence-first fashion, where the confidence of each hypothesis is produced by a data-driven AdaBoost decision-tree classifier with a set of intuitive features. This framework has successfully applied to grouping text lines and regions in complex freeform digital ink notes from real TabletPC users. It holds great potential in solving many other grouping problems in the ink parsing and document image analysis domains.

The normalization problem is related to the difficulty of training probabilistic models over large spaces while keeping them properly normalized. In recent years, the ML and Natural Language communities have devoted considerable efforts to circumventing this problem by developing "unnormalized" learning models for tasks in which the output is highly structured (e.g. English sentences). This class of models was in fact originally developed during the 90's in the handwriting recognition community, and includes Graph Tran former Networks, Conditional Random Fields, Hidden Markov SVMs, and Maximum Margin Markov Networks. We describe these models within the unifying framework, of "Energy-Based Models" (EBM). The Deep Learning Problem is related to the issue of training all the levels of a recognition system (e.g. segmentation, feature extraction, recognition, etc) in an integrated fashion. We first consider "traditional" methods for deep learning, such as convolutional networks and back-propagation, and show that, although they produce very low error rates for handwriting and object recognition, they require many training samples. We show that using unsupervised learning to initialize the layers of a deep network dramatically reduces the required number of training samples, particularly for such tasks as the recognition of everyday objects at the category level.

Recently, novel approaches, e.g., Minority Detection and One-class clustering, have explored further to identify clusters of atypical objects which strongly contrast from the rest of the data in terms of their distribution or density. This paper analyzes such tasks from an information theoretic perspective. Based on Information Bottleneck formalization, these tasks interpret to increasing the averaged atypicalness of the clusters while reducing the complexity of the clustering. This formalization yields a unifying view of the new approaches as well as the classic outlier detection. We also present a scalable minimization algorithm which exploits the localized form of the cost function over individual clusters. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulated datasets and a text classification benchmark, in comparison with an existing method.

Usually this results far more patterns than a human expert or a machine learning technique could make use of Often different patterns or combinations of patterns cover a similar subset of the examples, thus being redundant and not carrying any new information. To remove the redundant information contained in such pattern sets, we propose a general heuristic approach for selecting a small subset of patterns. We identify several selection techniques for use in this general algorithm and evaluate those on several data sets. The results show that the technique succeeds in severely reducing the number of patterns, while at the same time apparently retaining much of the original information. Additionally the experiments show that reducing the pattern set indeed improves the quality of classification results. Both results show that the approach is very well suited for the goals we aim at.

In this paper, a Pairwise Covariance-preserving Projection Method (PCPM) is proposed for dimension reduction. PCPM maximizes the class discrimination and also preserves approximately the pairwise class covariances. The optimization involved in PCPM can be solved directly by eigenvalues decomposition. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals the relationship between PCPM and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Sliced Average Variance Estimator (SAVE), Heteroscedastic Discriminant Analysis (BDA) and Covariance preserving Projection Method (CPM). PCPM can utilize class mean and class covariance information at the same time. Furthermore, pairwise weight scheme can be incorporated naturally with the pairwise summarization form. The proposed methods are evaluated by both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Several methods based on statistical information have been proposed. However with the linguistic complexity of the texts, semantic-based approaches have been investigated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Kernel for semi-structured biomedical documents. The semantic meanings of words are extracted using the UMLS framework. The kernel, with a SVM classifier, has been applied to a text categorization task on a medical corpus of free text documents. The results have shown that the Semantic Kernel outperforms the Linear Kernel and the Naive Bayes classifier Moreover, this kernel was ranked in the top ten of the best algorithms among 44 classification methods at the 2007 CMC Medical NLP International Challenge.

This learning model is appropriate in many areas, including medical applications. We present new algorithms for choosing which attributes to purchase of which examples in the budgeted learning model based on algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem. All of our approaches outperformed the current state of the art. Furthermore, we present a new means for selecting an example to purchase after the attribute is selected, instead of selecting an example uniformly at random, which is typically done. Our new example selection method improved performance of all the algorithms we tested, both ours and those in the literature.

This approach is driven by linear discrimination based on Nonlinear Rescaling (NR) method and transductive inference. The NR algorithm for linear discrimination (NRLD) computes both the primal and the dual approximation at each step. The dual variables associated with the given labeled data-set provide important information about the objects in the data-set and play the key role in ordering these objects. A confidence score based on a transductive inference procedure using NRLD is used to rank and identify the relevant objects from a pool of unlabeled data. Experimental results on an unbalanced protein data-set for the drug target prioritization and identification problem are used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed identification algorithm.

Although the great success in information retrieval and text categorization, the conventional BOW model ignores the detailed local text information, i.e. the co-occurrence pattern of words at sentence or paragraph level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to represent a document as a set of local tf-idf vectors, or what we called local word bags (LWB). By encapsulating local information distributed around a document into multiple LWBs, we can measure the similarity of two documents via the partial match of their corresponding local bags. To perform the matching efficiently, we introduce the Local Word Bag kernel (LWB kernel), a variant of VG-Pyramid match kernel. The new kernel enables the discriminative machine learning methods like SVM to compute the partial matching between two sets of LWBs in linear time after an one time hierarchical clustering procedure over all local bags at the initialization stage.

We have performed students classification using data representing their activity (D.D Burdescu et. al. Dec. 2006). Generally speaking the correlation between executed actions and traffic is weak because dependencies are too weak or too complex (M. Sydow, 2005). Still, we propose an analysis process specially designed to be used within e-Leaming platforms that predicts Web traffic data using only executed actions. Therefore, students classification using traffic data produces the same results as classification based on performed actions but with great benefits regarding computational time and complexity. We propose an algorithm for comparing two classifications made on students within an e-Leaming platform. This algorithm may be used to validate the correlations between classification procedures that use different features.

Some parametric learning negotiation models have been proposed recently. These models allow a negotiator to learn the opponents' preferences based on previous offer exchanges. Nevertheless, these models make strong assumptions about the particular negotiation mechanism employed by the respective negotiation agent. This paper illustrates the design, development, and evaluation of a non-parametric negotiation knowledge discovery method which is underpinned by the well-known Bayesian learning paradigm. This method can discovery vital information about a negotiator's preferences without making any assumption about the underlying negotiation mechanism employed by the negotiator According to our empirical testing, the proposed negotiation knowledge discovery method can speed up the negotiation process while maintaining the negotiation effectiveness. Our research work opens the door to the development of intelligent negotiation mechanisms to enhance modern e-Marketplaces.

Machine-learning applied to SDS dialogue management strategy design is a growing research area. Training of such strategies can be done using human users or using corpora of human computer dialogue. However, the size of the state space grows exponentially according to the state variables taken into account, making the task of learning dialogue strategies for large-scale SDS very difficult. To address that problem, we propose a divide to conquer approach, assuming that practical dialogue and domain-independent hypothesis are true. In this context, we have considered a clear separation between linguistic dependent and domain dependent knowledge, which allows reducing the complexity of SDS typical components, specially the Dialoguer Manager (DM). Our contribution enables domain portability issues, proposing an adaptive DKM to simplify DM's clarification dialogs. DKM learns, through trial-and-error, from the interaction with DM suggesting a set of best task-device pairs to accomplish a request and watching the user's confirmation. This adaptive DKM has been tested in our domain simulator.

However, the uncertainty of activity execution duration in workflow applications makes it a non-trivial task for schedulers to appropriately organize the ongoing processes. In this paper, we present a K-level prediction approach intended to help workflow schedulers to anticipate activities' time consumption. This approach first defines K levels as a global measure of time. Then, it applies a decision tree learning algorithm to the workflow event log to learn various kinds of activities' execution characteristics. When a new process is initiated, the classifier produced by the decision tree learning technique takes prior activities' execution information as input and suggests a level as the prediction of posterior activity's time consumption. In the experiment on three vehicle manufacturing enterprises, 896 activities were investigated, and we separately achieved and average prediction accuracy of 80.27%, 70.93% and 61.14% with K = 10. We also applied our approach on greater values of K, however the result is less positive. We describe our approach and report on the result of our experiment.

We, instead, try to correctly rank the items according to the users' tastes. First, we define a ranking error function which takes available pairwise preferences between items into account. Then we design an effective algorithm that optimizes this error. Finally we illustrate the proposal on a standard collaborative filtering dataset. We adapted the evaluation protocol proposed by (Marlin, 2004) for rating prediction based systems to our case, where pairwise preferences are predicted instead. The preliminary results are between those of two reference rating prediction based methods. We suggest different directions to further explore our ranking based approach for collaborative filtering.

Further, it is desirable to achieve such a goal automatically without sacrificing the categorization accuracy. Such techniques are known as automatic feature selection methods. Typically this is done in the way that each word is assigned a weight (using a word scoring metric) and the top scoring words are then used to describe a document collection. There are several word scoring metrics which have been employed in literature. In this paper we present a novel feature selection method called the GU metric. The details of comparative evaluation of all the other methods are given. The results show that the GU metric outperforms some of the other well known feature selection methods.

Our goal is to improve the drivers' situation awareness, in which the drivers perceive the environment's events and the projection of their status in a close future. To achieve this goal, we design an educational system for the drivers, which help them to become aware of their driving errors. This educational system aims to identify and correct drivers' drawbacks. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for associating two approaches: a local approach (resulting from cognitive sciences) and a global approach (resulting from machine learning), and we show the key role that context plays in the driving activity.

Shift of search relevance among search engines can easily change a search company's market cap by tens of billions of dollars. With the ever-increasing scale of the Web, machine learning technologies have become important tools to improve search relevance ranking. RankBoost is a promising algorithm in this area, but it is not widely used due to its long training time. To reduce the computation time for RankBoost, we designed a FPGA-based accelerator system. The accelerator, plugged into a commodity PC, increased the training speed on MSN search engine data by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the original software implementation on a server. The proposed accelerator has been successfully used by researchers in the search relevance ranking.

To solve the shortages of the existing fuzzy pattern recognition, this paper puts forward a new method, which is based on extension theory. It firstly takes advantage of the basal concepts, such as matter-element, dependent function in extension theory, to set up an extension-based fuzzy pattern recognition model, and then uses an emulational instance-the voice recognition to testify it. It is proved that this new method can not only conquer the shortages of the existing fuzzy pattern recognition methods, but also have more efficiency and applications.

Various online method are used such as flow injection method (FIR), liquid chromatography (HPLC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), gas chromatography (GC), mass spectrometry (NIS) and others developed techniques. Those instruments are quite expensive to be used by small and cottage industries e.g. "tapai", "tempe", "pekasam" and yoghurt industries. This paper will propose to use simple sensors/probes to gather information using certain variables such as pH value and temperature. From the collected information a pattern or a classification for fermentation bioprocess will be extracted using data mining technologies. The knowledge will be used to monitor fermentation using cheap sensor/probe and also can be used in intelligence system to predict the fermentation process for example fermentation duration and optimal fermentation condition. Data mining is a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning, and database management to extract information from large database systems. Different techniques used in data mining will produce different outcomes based on user specification. The outcomes are classification, association, clustering, prediction, estimation and deviation analysis. With this advantages, suitable data mining techniques will be used in this paper to analyse and classify the fermentation database obtained through the experiments. Certain pattern can be isolated and categorised. A prototype intelligent knowledge based system will then be developed to optimise the fermentation process. The system would be able to facilitate certain components of the fermentation for example estimation of complete fermentation cycle, fermentation status, temperature regulation, etc.	[Fakharudin, Abdul Sahli; Embong, Abdullah; Hamid, Roslina Abdul; Hamza, Mohd Azwan Mohamad; Ajid, Khairul Anwar; Ali, Noorlin Mohd; Satari, Siti Zanariah; Sulaiman, Junaida; Zain, Md] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fak Sistem Komputer & Kejuruteraan Perisian, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia	Fakharudin, AS (reprint author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fak Sistem Komputer & Kejuruteraan Perisian, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia.

Fast and accurate techniques are imperative to achieve on-line transient stability assessment (TSA). This problem has been approached by various machine learning algorithms, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. To counter the shortcoming of common machine learning methods, a novel machine learning technique, i.e. 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), for TSA is presented in this paper. RVM is based on a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very fewer number of so-called relevance vectors. The proposed method is tested on a practical power system, and compared with a state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM) classifier. The classification performance is evaluated using false discriminate rate (FDR). It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier can yield a decision function that Is much sparser than the SVM classifier while providing more higher classification accuracy. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time implementation.

Essentially, an error counting cost function is adopted. Through a linear parametric power series model and a quadratic approximation to the error cost, a deterministic solution is derived. This solution is seen to relate to a class-specific setting of the more generic weighted least-squares. A tuning mechanism is thus incorporated for robust applications. Our empirical evaluations show effectiveness of the classifier.

We show that full derandomization is not suitable in a robust framework, propose partially derandomized samplings, and develop new active learning methods (i) in which expert knowledge is easy to integrate (ii) with a parameter for the exploration/exploitation dilemma (iii) less randomized than the full-random sampling (yet also not deterministic). Experiments are performed in the case of regression for value-function learning on a continuous domain. Our main results are (i) efficient partially derandomized point sets (ii) moderate-derandomization theorems (iii) experimental evidence of the importance of the frontier (iv) a new regression-specific user-friendly sampling tool less-robust than blind samplers but that sometimes works very efficiently in large dimensions.

This new approach is beneficial as it improves the way agents can coordinate with each other to perform the proposed tasks in a real cooperative environment. Introspection aims at including reliable physical knowledge of the controlled systems in the agents' decision-making. To that end, introspection on control-grounded capabilities, inspired by the agent metaphor, are used in the task utility/cost functions. Such control-grounded capabilities guarantee an appropriate agent-oriented representation of the specifications and other relevant details encapsulated in every automatic controller of the controlled systems. In particular, this proposal is demonstrated in the successful performing of tasks by cooperative mobile robots in a simulated robot soccer environment. Experimental results and conclusions are shown, stressing the relevance of this new approach in the sure and trustworthy attainment of allocated tasks for improving multi-agent performance.

The creation of these maps is a non trivial process as the robot has to interpret the findings of its sensors so as to make deductions regarding the state of its environment. Current approaches fall into two broad categories: on-line and offline. An on-line approach is characterised by its ability to construct a map as the robot traverses its operating environment, however this comes at the cost of representational clarity. An offline approach on the other hand requires all sensory data to be gathered before processing begins but is capable of creating more accurate maps. In this paper we present a new means of constructing occupancy grid maps which addresses this problem.	[Collins, Thomas; Collins, J.

Self-reported pain, however, is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or not even possible, as in young children or the severely ill. Behavioral scientists have identified reliable and valid facial indicators of pain. Until now they required manual measurement by highly skilled observers. We developed an approach that automatically recognizes acute pain. Adult patients with rotator cuff injury were video-recorded while a physiotherapist manipulated their affected and unaffected shoulder. Skilled observers rated pain expression front the video on a 5-point Likert-type scale. From these ratings, sequences were categorized as no-pain (rating of 0), pain (rating of 3, 4, or 5). and indeterminate (rating of I or 2). NW explored machine learning approaches for pain-no pain classification. Active Appearance Models (AAM) were used to decouple shape and appearance parameters front the digitized face images. Support vector machines (SVM) were used with several representations front the AAM. Using a leave-one-out procedure, we achieved an equal error rate of 19% (hit rate = 81%) using canonical appearance and shape features. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic pain detection from video.

In this study, 26 participants were videotaped under three experimental conditions: baseline, posed pain, and real pain. In the real pain condition, subjects experienced cold pressor pain by submerging their arm in ice water. Our goal wits to automatically determine which experimental condition wits shown in it 60 second clip from a previously unseen Subject. We chose a machine learning approach, previously used successfully to categorize basic emotional facial expressions in posed datasets as well as to detect individual facial actions of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (Littlewort et al, 2006; Bartlett et al., 2006). For this study, we trained 20 Action Unit (AU) classifiers on over 5000 images selected from a combination of posed and spontaneous facial expressions. The output of the system was a real valued number indicating the distance to the separating hyperplane for each classifier. Applying this system to the pain video data produced a 20 channel output stream, consisting of one real value for each learned AU, for each frame of the video. This data was passed to a second layer of classifiers to predict the difference between baseline and pained faces, and the difference between expressions of real pain and fake pain. Naive human subjects tested on the same videos were at chance for differentiating faked from real pain, obtaining only 52% accuracy. The automated system was successfully able to differentiate faked from real pain. In an analysis of 26 subjects, the system obtained 72% correct for subject independent discrimination of real versus fake pain on a 2-alternative forced choice. Moreover, the most discriminative facial action in the automated system output was AU 4 (brow lower), which was consistent with findings using human expert FACS codes.

Based on an experiment aimed at analyzing human judgment of spatial expressions, we establish a set of criteria that explain human preference for certain interpretations over others. For each of these criteria, we define a metric that combines the semantic and pragmatic contextual information regarding the game as well as the utterance being resolved. Each metric gives rise to a potential field that characterizes the degree of likelihood for carrying out the instruction at a specific hypothesized location. We resort to machine learning techniques to determine it model of spatial relationships from the data collected during the experiment. Sentence interpretation occurs by matching the potential field of each of its possible interpretations to the model at hand.

To realize Such interaction -as semantic interaction-, it is necessary to extract and use the valuable context information needed for understanding interaction from the obtained real-world information. In addition. it is important for the user and the machine to share knowledge and an understanding of a given situation naturally through speech, images, graphics, manipulators, and so on. Submitted papers address these topics from diverse fields, Such as human-robot interaction, machine learning, and game design.

Discover the power of social and hidden curriculum to decision making: Experiments with enron email and movie newsgroups	ICMLA 2007: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2007	Cincinnati, OH	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE				The power of social values that helps to surreptitiously shape or formulate our behavior patterns is not only inevitable, but also influential as the directions of our decision making can never seem to escape the impact of this hidden agent. Therefore, the search of such power agent can be validated through a machine learning approach that enables us to discover the agent dynamics in which drives the evolution of the social groups in a community. By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilistic model for the agent dynamics: the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters. Our approach is to identify, the appropriate parameters in the model. To solve the problem, we develop heuristic expectation-maximization style algorithms for determining the micro-laws of a community based on either observed communication links between actors, or the observed evolution of social groups. We present the learning results from the synthetic data as well as the findings on real communities, e.g., Enron entail and movie newsgroups.

[1] and [2] have developed a Multi-Agent Intelligent Simulator (MAIS) to model the structure of US wholesale market. The methodological practicality was confirmed with a simulation study and a real data set from PJM electricity market. In our proposed artificial wholesale market, the agents are equipped with limited reinforcement learning capabilities. We validate the agent based model with the help of six data sets from the California electricity market. The performance of the AWS is compared with other well-known methods, using a real data set on power trading related to the California electricity (2000-2001).

Tools are needed to provide rapid, onsite predictions of contaminant levels given only approximate measurements in limited locations throughout a building. In principal, such tools could use calculations based on physical process models to provide accurate predictions. In practice, however physical process models are too complex and computationally costly to be used in a real-time scenario. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using machine learning to provide easily computed but approximate models that would be applicable in the field. We develop a machine learning method based on Support Vector Machine regression and classification. We apply our method to problems of estimating contamination levels and contaminant source location.

The robot system has a map-based heuristic maze solving algorithm. The algorithm used for solving the maze is based on map creation and produces a control signal for robot direction. Robot motions were controlled by a fuzzy motion control system running on a chip. The control algorithm can be easily changed with the help of an algorithm via web interface controlled by the control center. The control center program powered by AM TLAB functions and special libraries (image and control) in DELPHI manage all robotic activities. These activities are: command interpreter, image capturing, processing and serving, machine learning techniques, web serving, database management, communication with robot, and compiling microcontroller programs. The results have shown that the proposed designed and implemented system provides amazing new features to the applicants doing their real-time programming exercises on web.

This paper presents the implementation of a platform for language identification in multi-lingual documents on web. The platform consists of five modules to achieve the tasks automatically. Furthermore, artificial neural networks were used for the identification of languages in multi-lingual documents. Results for six languages including Turkish, French, Italian, Danish and Deutsch are present. The major benefit of the approach is that the ANN based language identification system could meet the expectations in real-time language identification accuracy with the help of a developed system. Experiments have shown that system achieves the tasks in high accuracy in discriminating different languages and converting them other languages on web pages.

One of the objectives of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems is to help reduce the number of unexpected failures by continuously monitoring the components of interest and predicting their failures sufficiently in advance to allow for proper planning. In other words, PHM systems may help turn unexpected failures into expected ones. Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of data mining to help build prognostic models for PHM but also has identified the need for new model evaluation methods that take into account the specificities of prognostic applications. This paper investigates this problem. First, it reviews classical and recent methods to evaluate data mining models and it explains their deficiencies with respect to prognostic applications. The paper then proposes a novel approach that overcomes these deficiencies. This approach integrates the various costs and benefits involved in prognostics to quantify the cost saving expected from a given prognostic model. From the end user's perspective, the formula is practical as it is easy to understand and requires realistic inputs. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methods through a real-world case study involving data-mining prognostic models and realistic costs/benefits information. The results show the feasibility of the approach and its applicability to various prognostic applications.

For example, in a binary classification problem it is often the case that examples of one class are abundant, while examples of the other class are in short supply. Examples from one class, typically the positive class, can be limited due to the financial cost or time required to collect these examples. This work presents a comprehensive empirical study of learning when examples from one class are extremely rare, but examples of the other class(es) are plentiful. Specifically, we address the issue of how many examples from the abundant class should be used when training a classifier on data where one class is very rare. Nearly one million classifiers were built and evaluated to generate the results presented in this work. Our results demonstrate that the often used 'even distribution' is not optimal when dealing with such rare events.

An important aspect of this procedure is its ability to utilize negative target information (examples of likely non-targets) as well as positive information. Applications involve situations where clusters of genes are distinguished in experiments with known transcription factors without known binding locations. We apply this to yeast TF data with target identifications from ChIP-chip and other sources, and compare performance with Gibbs sampling methods such as BioProspector. We verify that in yeast this method implies well-defined and cross-validated statistical correlations between TF binding and secondary motifs whose binding properties (either with the primary TF or other possible promoters) are not certain, and discuss some implications of this. SVMotif can be a useful standalone method or a complement to existing techniques, and it will be made publicly available.

Alignment of multiple proteins with an ensemble of hidden markov models	ICMLA 2007: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2007	Cincinnati, OH	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE			SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ALGORITHM; ACCURACY	The alignment of multiple protein sequences is a problem of fundamental importance in bioinformatics. In general, the optimal alignment can be obtained through the optimization of an objective function. However such an optimization task is often computationally intractible, most of the existing alignment tools thus use statistical or machine learning based methods to avoid direct optimizations. In this paper we develop a new method that can progressively construct and update a set of alignments by adding sequences in certain order to each of the existing alignments. In particular each of the existing alignments is modeled with a profile hidden markov model (HMM) and an added sequence is aligned to each of these profile HMMs. The profile HMMs in the set are then updated based on the alignments with leading alignment scores. We performed experiments on BaliBASE benchmarks to compare the performance of this new approach with that of other alignment tools. Our experiments showed that, by introducing an integer parameter that controls the number of profile HMMs in the set, we are able to efficiently explore the alignment space and significantly improve the alignment accuracy on sequences with low similarity.

Providing an input-output mapping, they rely on populations of rules that are modified based on their utility,for the given task at hand through a series of predefined procedures. As such, they have been successfully applied in many different applications; nevertheless, continued research is being performed to improve their performance, to expand their applicability to new problems and to gleam better understanding of their theoretical properties. This paper describes research endeavours to extend conventional learning classifier systems with the concepts of fuzzy logic, so they can better handle problems with real-valued rule representations.

In 1990s, the covering algorithm for forward neural network was put forward, this algorithm is a constructive machine learning method it designs network with sphere neighborhoods built upon sample data. The theoretical analysis indicates that the general ability of this algorithm is in the inverse ratio of the number of covering domains. Some techniques is performed while constructing the sphere neighborhood set to simplify the network, such as changing the sphere neighborhoods center to the barycentre of points covered by a domain, deleting the points covered by a sphere neighborhood In this paper, a new constructive algorithm which combines the covering algorithm and neighborhood search is presented and applied to some databases on the web site of UCI and text categorization, the results show that the algorithm can reduce the number of sphere neighborhoods with higher degree of classifying accuracy.

For this problem, based on the linear semi-supervised support vector machine (S-3 VM) with 1-norm, we propose two new models using all the available data from labeled and unlabeled data and also utilizing as few of the useful features as possible. Furthermore, two proposed learning models for simultaneous feature selection and (SVM)-V-3 classification can be converted to the minimization concave function on the polyhedral set and then solved using successive linear approximation algorithms. Experiments on publicly available datasets prove the effective of our models compared with the linear S-3 VM model for 1-norm.

Two kinds of work are done by us. Firstly, in order to overcome the sparse data problem, which is almost suffered from by all the corpus based supervised learning classifiers, we propose to incorporate the smoothing algorithm into the naive bayes (NB) model.

Multiple species are evolved in parallel; each evolves a particular part of the description of the target concepts. The algorithm allows the number and roles of the species to be adapted; more accurate and general rules are generated The proposed algorithm has been compared to other two popular concept learning algorithms on five benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher performance while still produces a smaller number of rules.

Traditional network planning technology encountered great obstacles in project risk management issues, and often unable to accurately forecast the risk, resulting great loss of costs. To address the cost-time optimization problem considering the risk elements, this paper established a network planning risk element model, which divides risk elements into discrete model and continuous model to be discussed separately. In the discrete model costs and risk element matrix is introduced to get the corresponding programming model; In Continuous model the idea of machine learning model is used to minimum the desired risk. Based on this model, by using genetic algorithm's efficient and rapid global search capability, this paper improves the genetic algorithm developed by Feng and others, increases the risk elements and eventually gets the cost-time curve considering risk elements. This effectively solves the network planning cost optimization problem..

Subsequently a number of feature mining methods have been used to identify the most relevant features and their roles in classifying dialog acts. The selected features are used to learn the underlying models of dialog acts using a number of existing machine learning algorithms from the WEKA toolbox. Empirical analyses using the HCRC Map Task Corpus dialog data was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

We considered pairs of events in a verb-clause construction, where the first event is a verb and the second event is the head of a clausal argument to that verb. We selected all pairs of events in the TimeBank that participated in verb-clause constructions and annotated them with the labels BEFORE, OVERLAP and AFTER. The resulting corpus of 895 event-event temporal relations was then used to train a machine learning model. Using a combination of event-level features like tense and aspect with syntax-level features like the paths through the syntactic tree, we were able to train a support vector machine (SVM) model which could identify new temporal relations with 89.2% accuracy. High accuracy models like these are a first step towards automatic extraction of timeline structures from text.

In part, this has been due to the lack of corpus resources tagged with general anaphoric coreference. The OntoNotes project is creating a large-scale, accurate corpus for general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types. The coreference layer in OntoNotes constitutes one part of a multi-layer, integrated annotation of shallow semantic structure in text. This paper presents an initial model for unrestricted coreference based on this data that uses a machine learning architecture with state-of-the-art features. Significant improvements can be expected from using such cross-layer information for training predictive models. This paper describes the coreference annotation in OntoNotes, presents the baseline model, and provides an analysis of the contribution of this new resource in the context of recent MUC and ACE results.

The natural language processing community has become increasingly interested in detecting, through automatic means, the expression of opinions and measuring the intensity of emotions held by the writer. Despite the depth and abstraction often associated with expressions of sentiment, we apply strictly lexical analysis to the opinions expressed about books and find that machine learning techniques are capable of resolving even fine-grained distinctions between opinions. Using an averaged perceptron classifier trained using a word subsequence kernel, we achieve an accuracy of 89% when distinguishing between 1- and 5-star reviews. Further, this same model yields significant separation when scoring intermediate reviews-making distinctions even human annotators find difficult. We detail the collection of data for supervised training and present the results of our sentiment classifier along with some discussion about why we believe this approach to be effective.

Printed texts in documents need to be converted into digital format and semantic information need to be parsed and managed for effective retrieval. In this work, we attempt to solve the problems faced by current web based archives, where large scale repositories of electronic resources have been built from scanned volumes. Specifically, we focus on the scientific domain and target scanned volumes of scientific publications. Our goal is to automate the semantic processing of scanned volumes, an important and challenging step towards efficient retrieval of content within scanned volumes. We tackle the problem by designing a machine learning-based method to extract multi-level metadata about content of scanned volumes. We combine image and text information within scanned volumes for intelligent parsing. We developed a system and test it with real world data from the Internet Archive, and the experimental evaluation has demonstrated good results.

We introduce LBJ, a new modeling language for specifying exact inference systems of this type, combining ideas from machine learning, optimization, First Order Logic (FOL), and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Expressive constraints are specified declaratively as arbitrary FOL formulas over functions and objects. The language's run-time library translates them to a mathematical programming representation from which an exact solution is computed. In addition, the compiler leverages an existing OOP language: objects and functions are grounded as the OOP objects and methods that encapsulate the user's data.

Now feature selection is facing challenge in high dimension space, such as text categorization in information retrieval. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is an excellent dimensionality reduction method which transforms the original data into low-dimensional feature space. However, it changes the original physical features and makes,features uninterpretable, which motivates us to select but not transform features by LDA idea of preserving structure information of between-class and within-class for text categorization. In the paper; a new approach of feature selection based on Constrained LDA (CLDA) is proposed, which models feature selection as a search problem in subspace and finds optimal solution subject to some restrictions. Further; CLDA optimization problem is transformed into a process of scoring and sorting of features. Experiments on 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 show that CLDA is consistently better than information gain and chit-test with lower computational complexity.

Number of humans that are suffering from this disease is determined by screening the heterozygous population. This article investigates the thalassemia screening problem using the unconstrained functional networks classifier. The learning algorithm for this new scheme is briefly illustrated. The new intelligent system with only sets of second order linearly independent polynomial functions to approximate the neuron functions is tested using thalassemia screening database. The performance of the new approach is compared with the performance of both multilayer perceptron and support vector machines. The results show that this new framework classifier is reliable, flexible, and outperform the most common existing classifiers.	[El-Sebakhy, E. A.; Elshafei, M.

A learning predator has no knowledge about the environmental information. It only knows that it should adapt its actions to other predators' expectations. The learning classifier system is a very interesting tool for the machine learning technique. Indeed, it helps a learning agent to evaluate its actions and to take right actions corresponding to situations in order to have a better cooperation with other agents. The results show how the learning is constructed in such collective task.

First we propose a modification of a multiclass support vector machine, which for binary classification tasks, can always find a convex polytope that includes the points of one class and excludes the others, if possible. Next we present a generalization of this approach for multiclass problems, where a non-convex polytope can be found for each class, so that each polytope contains the points of its corresponding class, and excludes other points. Some promising preliminary results are presented for two dimensional artificial datasets.

The significance of finding the minimum gene subsets is three-fold: 1) It greatly reduces the computational burden and "noise" arising from irrelevant genes. In the examples studied in this paper, finding the minimum gene subsets even allows for extraction of simple diagnostic rules which lead to accurate diagnosis without the need for any classifiers. 2) It simplifies gene expression tests to include only a very small number of genes rather than thousands of genes, which can bring down the cost for cancer testing significantly. 3) It calls for further investigation into the possible biological relationship between these small numbers of genes and cancer development and treatment. Our simple yet very effective method involves two steps. In the first step, we choose some important genes using a feature importance ranking scheme. In the second step, we test the classification capability of all simple combinations of those important genes by using a good classifier. For three "small" and "simple" data sets with two, three, and four cancer (sub)types, our approach obtained very high accuracy with only two or three genes. For a "large" and "complex" data set with 14 cancer types, we divided the whole problem into a group of binary classification problems and applied the 2-step approach to each of these binary classification problems. Through this "divide-and-conquer" approach, we obtained accuracy comparable to previously reported results but with only 28 genes rather than 16,063 genes. In general, our method can significantly reduce the number of genes required for highly reliable diagnosis.

A framework for medical image retrieval using machine learning and statistical similarity matching techniques with relevance feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						classification; clustering; content-based image retrieval (CBIR); relevance feedback (RF); statistical similarity matching; support vector machine (SVM)	COMMUNICATION-SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; CATEGORIZATION; DATABASES; FEATURES	A content-based image retrieval (CBIR) framework for diverse collection of medical images of different imaging modalities, anatomic regions with different orientations and biological systems is proposed. Organization of images in such a database (DB) is well defined with predefined semantic categories; hence, it can be useful for category-specific searching. The proposed framework consists of machine learning methods for image prefiltering, similarity matching using statistical distance measures, and a relevance feedback (RF) scheme. To narrow down the semantic gap and increase the retrieval efficiency, we investigate both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to associate low-level global image features (e.g., color, texture, and edge) in the projected PCA-based eigenspace with their high-level semantic and visual categories. Specially, we explore the use of a probabilistic multiclass support vector machine (SVM) and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering for categorization and prefiltering of images to reduce the search space. A category-specific statistical similarity matching is proposed in a finer level on the prefiltered images. To incorporate a better perception subjectivity, an RF mechanism is also added to update the query parameters dynamically and adjust the proposed matching functions. Experiments are based on a ground-truth DB consisting of 5000 diverse medical images of 20 predefined categories. Analysis of results based on cross-validation (CV) accuracy and precision-recall for image categorization and retrieval is reported.

J	Wu, Q; Bell, DA; Prasad, G; McGinnity, TM				Wu, QingXiang; Bell, David A.; Prasad, Girijesh; McGinnity, Thomas Martin			A distribution-index-based discretizer for decision-making with symbolic AI approaches	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; information theory; decision support	ATTRIBUTES	When symbolic AI approaches are applied to handle continuous valued attributes, there is a requirement to transform the continuous attribute values to symbolic data. In this paper, a novel distribution-index-based discretizer is proposed for such a transformation. Based on definitions of dichotomic entropy and a compound distributional index, a simple criterion is applied to discretize continuous attributes adaptively. The dichotomic entropy indicates the homogeneity degree of the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine the best splitting point. The compound distributional index combines both the homogeneity degrees of attribute value distributions and the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine which interval should be split further; thus, a potentially improved solution of the discretization problem can be found efficiently. Based on multiple reducts in rough set theory, a multiknowledge approach can attain high decision accuracy for information systems with a large number of attributes and missing values. In this paper, our discretizer is combined with the multiknowledge approach to further improve decision accuracy for information systems with continuous attributes. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new discretizer can improve not only the multiknowledge approach, but also the naive Bayes classifier and the C5.0 tree.

J	Yang, Q; Yin, J; Ling, C; Pan, R				Yang, Qiang; Yin, Jie; Ling, Charles; Pan, Rong			Extracting actionable knowledge from decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						phrases decision making; data mining; machine learning		Most data mining algorithms and tools stop at discovered customer models, producing distribution information on customer profiles. Such techniques, when applied to industrial problems such as customer relationship management (CRM), are useful in pointing out customers who are likely attritors and customers who are loyal, but they require human experts to postprocess the discovered knowledge manually. Most of the postprocessing techniques have been limited to producing visualization results and interestingness ranking, but they do not directly suggest actions that would lead to an increase in the objective function such as profit. In this paper, we present novel algorithms that suggest actions to change customers from an undesired status ( such as attritors) to a desired one ( such as loyal) while maximizing an objective function: the expected net profit. These algorithms can discover cost-effective actions to transform customers from undesirable classes to desirable ones. The approach we take integrates data mining and decision making tightly by formulating the decision making problems directly on top of the data mining results in a postprocessing step. To improve the effectiveness of the approach, we also present an ensemble of decision trees which is shown to be more robust when the training data changes. Empirical tests are conducted on both a realistic insurance application domain and UCI benchmark data.

A morphological representation of the anatomy of interest is first obtained using a high-dimensional mass-preserving template warping method, which results in tissue density maps that constitute local tissue volumetric measurements. Regions that display strong correlations between tissue volume and classification (clinical) variables are extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm, taking into account the regional smoothness of the correlation map which is estimated by a cross-validation strategy to achieve robustness to outliers. A volume increment algorithm is then applied to these regions to extract regional volumetric features, from which a feature selection technique using support vector machine (SVM)-based criteria is used to select the most discriminative features, according to their effect on the upper bound of the leave-one-out generalization error. Finally, SVM-based classification is applied using the best set of features, and it is tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The results on MR brain images of healthy controls and schizophrenia patients demonstrate not only high classification accuracy (91.8% for female subjects and 90.8% for male subjects), but also good stability with respect to the number of features selected and the size of SVM kernel used.

Bayesian neural networks for Internet traffic classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet traffic; network operations; neural network applications; pattern recognition; traffic identification		Internet traffic identification is an important tool for network management. It allows operators to better predict future traffic matrices and demands, security personnel to detect anomalous behavior, and researchers to develop more realistic traffic models. We present here a traffic classifier that can achieve a high accuracy across a range of application types without any source or destination host-address or port information. We use supervised machine learning based on a Bayesian trained neural network. Though our technique uses training data with categories derived from packet content, training and testing were done using features derived from packet streams consisting of one or more packet headers. By providing classification without access to the contents of packets, our technique offers wider application than methods that require full packet/payloads for classification. This is a powerful advantage, using samples of classified traffic to permit the categorization of traffic based only upon commonly available information.

J	Pei, Y; Zha, HB				Pei, Yuru; Zha, Hongbin			Transferring of speech movements from video to 3D face space	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						facial animation; speech synchronization; visual speech synthesis; pe rfo rmance-driven animation; machine learning	ANIMATION	We present a novel method for transferring speech animation recorded in low quality videos to high resolution 3D face models. The basic idea is to synthesize the animated faces by an interpolation based on a small set of 3D key face shapes which span a 3D face space. The 3D key shapes are extracted by an unsupervised learning process in 2D video space to form a set of 2D visemes which are then mapped to the 3D face space. The learning process consists of two main phases: 1) Isomap-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction to embed the video speech movements into a low-dimensional manifold and 2) K-means clustering in the low-dimensional space to extract 2D key viseme frames. Our main contribution is that we use the lsomap-based learning method to extract intrinsic geometry of the speech video space and thus to make it possible to define the 3D key viseme shapes. To do so, we need only to capture a limited number of 3D key face models by using a general 3D scanner. Moreover, we also develop a skull movement recovery method based on simple anatomical structures to enhance 3D realism in local mouth movements. Experimental results show that our method can achieve realistic 3D animation effects with a small number of 3D key face models.

The procedure was customized to be used in the southeastern Brazilian coast, since the classification training and test used examples extracted from 402 RADARSAT-1 images acquired in this region. Different sets of spectral, geometric and contextual (meteo-oceanographic and location) features of selected low backscatter patches were evaluated. Machine learning procedures (neural networks, decision trees and support vector machines) were used to induce classifiers to differentiate between seven classes, belonging to two categories. The classification procedure involves two steps: first the features area classified in one of two categories - oil spill or meteo-oceanographic phenomena. In the second step, the identification of tree classes of oil spills and four classes of meteo-oceanographic phenomena is done. The oil spill related classes are associated to operational exploration and production spills, ship releases and others. The meteo-oceanographic phenomena include biogenic oils and/or upwellings, algae blooms, low wind areas and rain cells. The models induced by support vector machines and neural networks achieved good results, allowing the operational implementation of the proposed procedures.

It is a novel method for finding the spectral convexities in a high-dimensional space which addresses several limitations of previous endmember methods. A new approach for estimating the number of endmembers using rate-distortion theory is also presented. It is based upon the observation that the endmembers form a set of basis vectors for the hyperspectral datacube using the linear mixture model. The result is a fully-automatic method for endmember detection. Experimental results using the Cuprite datacube are presented.

Several computer techniques have been developed to aid radiologists to improve their performance in the detection and diagnosis of breast abnormalities. In Point Pattern Analysis, there is a statistic known as Ripley's K function that is frequently applied to Spatial Analysis in Ecology, like mapping specimens of plants. This paper proposes a new way in applying Ripley's K function in order to distinguish Mass and Non-Mass tissues from mammogram images. The features of each image are obtained through the calculate of that function. Then, the samples gotten are classified through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as Mass or Non-Mass tissues. SVM is a machine-learning method, based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which performs well when applied to data outside the training set. Another way of computing Ripley's K function, using concentric rings instead of a circle, is also examined. The best result achieved was 94.25% of accuracy, 94.59% of sensitvity and 94.00% of specificity.

We use the term "spectral signature" for a quantitative plot of optical property variations as a function of wavelengths. We present here intelligent spectral signature bio-imaging methods we developed, including automatic signature selection based on machine learning algorithms and database search-based automatic color allocations, and selected visualization schemes matching these approaches. Using this intelligent spectral signature bio-imaging method, we could discriminate normal and aganglionic colon tissue of the Hirschsprung's disease mouse model with over 95% sensitivity and specificity in various similarity measure methods and various anatomic organs such as parathyroid gland, thyroid gland and pre-tracheal fat in dissected neck of the rat in vivo.

The complex scatter pattern is dependent on particle size, shape, refraction index, density, and morphology. Commercial flow cytometers allow measurement at two nominal angles (2 degrees < theta(1) <= 20 degrees and 70 degrees <= theta(2) <= 110 degrees) Of scattered light intensity from individual microparticles with a speed varying from 10 to 10000 particles per second. The choice of angle is dictated by the fact that scattered light in the small-angle region is primarily influenced by cell size and refractive index, whereas side scatter intensity is related to the granularity of cellular structures. Obviously, these rudimentary measurements cannot be used to separate populations of cells of similar shape, size, or structure. Hence, there have been several attempts in flow cytometry to measure the entire scatter patterns. However, the published concepts required use of unique custom-built flow cytometers and could not be applied to existing instruments. It was also not clear how much information about patterns is really necessary to separate various populations of cells present in a given sample. The presented work demonstrates application of pattern-recognition techniques to classify particles on the basis of their discrete scatter patterns collected at just five different angles, and accompanied by the measurement of axial light loss. Our approach can be used with existing instruments and requires only the addition of a compact custom-built scatter-detector. Our analytical model of scatter of laser beams by individual bacterial cells suspended in a fluid was used to determine the location for scatter sensors. Experimental results were used to train the SVM-based pattern recognition system.

Yet the effect of background knowledge in graph based learning is not systematically explored. This paper describes and demonstrates the first step in this direction and elaborates on how additional relevant background knowledge could be used to improve the predictive performance of a graph learner. A case study in chemoinformatics is undertaken in this regard in which various types of background knowledge are encoded in graphs that are given as input to a graph learner. It is shown that the type of background knowledge encoded indeed has an effect on the predictive performance, and it is concluded that encoding appropriate background knowledge can be more important than the choice of the graph learning algorithm.

These techniques are able to learn the normal and anomalous pattern from training data and generate useful classifiers to detect attacks to computer systems. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) examine all data features to detect intrusion or misused patterns. Some of the features may be redundant or contribute little (if anything) to the detection process. In this paper we use some KDDCUP99 reduced feature sets, obtained from the previous researches, to classify with decision tree technique. We analyze the performance of using this reduced feature sets for network intrusion detection. We use KDDCUP99 data for training and testing of decision tree. Experiments show that the resulted decision trees have better performance compared to the case in which we use all features. This research discusses the accuracy of decision tree for classifying reduced feature sets.

An algorithm for classification in data mining based on classification codes	IMECS 2007: International Multiconference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, Vols I and II	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Multiconference of Engineers and Computer Scientists	MAR 21-23, 2007	Kowloon, PEOPLES R CHINA			data mining; classification; decision tree; algorithm; database		Classification is a key data mining technique whereby database tuples acting as training samples are analyzed in order to produce a model of the given data. A number of classification techniques from the statistics and machine learning have been proposed. A well accepted method of classification is the induction of decision trees. The efficiency of existing decision tree algorithms has been established for small data sets. in decision tree, more number of rules are to be generated to classify the given data, because the algorithm performs the testing on attribute by attribute at level by level which is a time consuming and occupies more memory to store. In rule based classification, all combination of the fields in the table is to be taken to generate more rules for classifying the given data. To overcome these, a new algorithm is proposed which modifies the consideration of the decision tree for classification at the data warehousing level by grouping the samples using classification codes in each branch of the tree. At run time, only the code field and class field are transferred to main memory, which makes the effective usage of main memory, though the database is very large. With this construction, the number of rules to be generated is decreased and the number of tests to be performed also decreased which makes execution fast and increases the throughput. The proposed algorithm proves to be effective and efficient.	CTRI, Rajahmundry 533105, India	Sankar, HR (reprint author), CTRI, Rajahmundry 533105, India.

These nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques are Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The approaches presented in this paper employ psychological tools, computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this paper we concentrate on comparing the performance of these two techniques when combined with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) at the task of classifying facial expressions across the, full expression intensity range from near-neutral to extreme facial expression. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is employed as a means of comprehensively comparing the results of these techniques.

The text classification task is an instance of classification using sparse features residing in a high dimensional feature space. Two standard (of a wide selection of available) algorithms for this task are the naive Bayes classifier and the Rocchio linear classifier. Naive Bayes classifiers are widely applied; the Rocchio algorithm is primarily used in document classification and information retrieval. Both these classifiers are popular because of their simplicity and ease of application, computational speed and reasonable performance. One aspect of the Rocchio approach, inherited from its information retrieval origin, is that it explicitly uses both positive and negative models. Parameters have been introduced which make it adaptive to the particulars of the corpora of interest and thereby improve its performance. The ideas inherent in these classifiers and in second generation wavelets can be recombined into new algorithms for classification.

Such a representation can be constructed by Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF), which is a method for finding parts-based representations of non-negative data. Here, we present a convolutive NMF algorithm that includes a sparseness constraint on the activations and has multiplicative updates. In combination with a spectral magnitude transform of speech, this method extracts speech phones that exhibit sparse activation patterns, which we use in a supervised separation scheme for monophonic mixtures.

The IDS based on the new algorithm can be applied as pure SVM, pure CSOACN or their combination by constructing the detection classifier under three different training modes respectively. The initial experiments indicate that performance of their combination is better than pure SVM in terms of higher average detection rate as well as lower rates of both negative and positive false and is better than pure CSOACN in terms of less training time with comparable detection rate and false alarm rates.

This is inadequate for science, because there is a reality behind appearance, e.g. material objects are built up from atoms. Atoms are just as real as dogs, only harder to observe, and the atomic theory arose long before there was any idea of how big atoms were. This article discusses how atoms were discovered, as an example of discovering the reality behind appearance. We also present an example of the three-dimensional reality behind a two-dimensional appearance, and how that reality is inferred by people and might be inferred by computer programs. Unfortunately, it is necessary to discuss the philosophy of appearance and reality, because the mistaken philosophy of taking the world (or particular phenomena) as a structure of sense data has been harmful in artificial intelligence and machine learning research, just as behaviorism and logical positivism harmed psychology.

Basically, the classification or clustering of a new individual is determined by the distance to one or more prototypes. From a comprehensibility point of view, this is not especially problematic in propositional learning where prototypes can be regarded as a good generalisation (pattern) of a group of elements. However, for scenarios with structured data, this is no longer the case. In recent work, we developed a framework to determine whether a pattern computed by a generalisation operator is consistent w.r.t. a distance. In this way, we can determine which patterns can provide a good representation of a group of individuals belonging to a metric space. In this work, we apply this framework to analyse and define minimal distance-based generalisation operators (mg operators) for first-order data. We show that Plotkin's lgg is a mg operator for atoms under the distance introduced by J. Ramon, M. Bruynooghe and W. Van Laer. We also show that this is not the case for clauses with the distance introduced by J. Ramon and M. Bruynooghe. Consequently, we introduce a new mg operator for clauses, which could be used as a base to adapt existing bottom-up methods in ILP.

Due to the fact that these networks often work in a data centric manner, it is desirable to use machine learning techniques in data aggregation and control. In this paper we give a brief introduction to sensor networks. One of the first attempts to solve the Geolocation problem using Support Vector Regression (SVR) is then discussed. We propose a method to localize a stationary, hostile radar using the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of a characteristic pulse emitted by the radar. Our proposal uses three different Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) flying in a fixed triangular formation. The performance of the proposed SVR method is compared with a variation of the Taylor Series Method (TSM) used for solving the same problem and currently deployed by the DSTO, Australia on the Aerosonde Mark III UAVs. We conclude by proposing the application of the SVR approach to more general localization scenarios in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Traditional shape segmentation methods rely on various assumptions. For instance, the deformable model assumes that edge defines the shape, the Mumford-Shah variational method assumes that the regions inside/outside the (closed) contour are homogenous in intensity; and the active appearance model assumes that shape/appearance variations are linear. In addition, they all need a good initialization. In contrast, SRM poses no such restrictions. It is a two-stage approach that leverages (a) the underlying medical context that defines the anatomic structure and (b) an annotated database that exemplifies the shape and appearance variations of the anatomy. In the first stage, it solves the initialization problem as object detection and derives a regression solution that needs just one scan in principle. In the second stage, it learns a nonlinear regressor that predicts the nonrigid shape from image appearance. We also propose a boosting regression approach that supports real time segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SRM using experiments on segmenting the left ventricle endocardium from an echocardiogram of an apical four chamber view.

Evidence of this can be found in the increasing number of high-quality articles on rough sets and related topics that have been published in a variety of international journals, symposia, workshops, and international conferences in recent years. In addition, many international workshops and conferences have included special sessions on the theory and applications of rough sets in their programs. Rough set theory has led to many interesting applications and extensions. It seems that the rough set approach is fundamentally important in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, especially in research areas such as machine learning, intelligent systems, inductive reasoning, pattern recognition, mereology, knowledge discovery, decision analysis, and expert systems. In the article, we present the basic concepts of rough set theory and point out some rough set-based research directions and applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rubin, SH				Rubin, S. H.			On randomization and discovery	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						brain theory; expert systems; heuristics; KASER; machine learning; randomization	EVOLUTIONARY; SEARCH	In the first part of this paper, traditional computability theory is extended to prove that the attainable density of knowledge is virtually unbounded. That is, the more bits available for storage, the more information that can be stored, where the density of information per bit cannot be bounded above. In the second part, the paper explains how machine intelligence becomes possible as a result of the capability for creating, storing, and retrieving virtually unlimited information/knowledge. It follows from this theory that there is no such thing as a valid non-trivial proof, which in turn implies the need for heuristic search/proof techniques. Two examples are presented to show how heuristics can be developed, which are randomizations of knowledge - establishing the connection with the first part of the paper. Even more intriguing, it is shown that heuristic proof techniques are to formal proof techniques what fuzzy logic is to classical logic. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Each layer of the subsumption architecture is modeled by one different Machine Learning System MLS based on bio-inspired techniques. In this research an evolutionary mechanism supported on Gene Expression Programming to self-configure the behaviour arbitration between layers is suggested. In addition, a co-evolutionary mechanism to evolve behaviours in an independent and parallel fashion is used. The proposed approach was tested in an animat environment using a multi-agent platform and it exhibited several learning capabilities and emergent properties for self-configuring internal agent's architecture.

Nevertheless, the task of selecting its parameters accurately is an optimization problem by itself. Any additional help or hints to adjust the configuration parameters will lead both towards a more efficient PGA application and to a better comprehension on how these parameters affect optimization behavior and performance. This contribution offers an analysis on certain PGA parameters such as migration frequency, topology, connectivity and number of islands. The study has been carried out on an intensive set of experiments that collect PGA performance on several representative problems. The results have been analyzed using machine learning methods to identify behavioral patterns that are labeled as "good" PGA configurations. This study is a first step to generalize relevant patterns from the problems analyzed that identify better configurations in PGAs.	[Muelas, S.; Pena, J.

The proposed feature weighting method named adaptive-3FW. It uses three non-uniform weight levels (zero weight, middle weight and full weight) to weight each feature. The middle weight value is determined using genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed adaptive-3FW overcomes overfitting issues and achieves high recognition performance. Novel GA operators tailored for this formulation are introduced to implement the proposed scheme. Further, a modified k-NN is proposed which uses a class-dependent feature weighting strategy. Whilst the conventional pattern recognition systems use the same set of feature weights for all classes, the proposed algorithm uses different sets of feature weights for different classes. Experiments were performed with the UCI repository for machine learning databases and the unconstrained handwritten numeral database of Concordia University in Canada to show the performance of the proposed method.

Supervised network intrusion detection has been an active and difficult research hotspot in the field of intrusion detection for many years. However, a lot of issues haven't been resolved successfully yet. The most important one is the loss of detection performance attribute to the difficulties in obtaining adequate attack data for the supervised classifiers to model the attack patterns, and the data acquisition task is always time-consuming which greatly relies on the domain experts. In this paper, we propose a novel network intrusion detection method based on TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method is robust and more effective than the state-of-the-art intrusion detection method even provided with "small" dataset for training.

In addition to its utility in validation of applications and network services, it provides a theoretical basis for the design of algorithms for efficient sampling, compression and exfiltration of the sensor readings. Modeling of the environmental processes that gives rise to sensor readings is the core problem in physical sciences. Sensor modeling for wireless sensor networks combine the physics of signal generation and propagation with models of transducer saturation and fault models for hardware. In this paper we introduce a novel modeling technique for constructing probabilistic models for censored sensor readings. The model is an extension of the Gaussian process regression and applies to continuous valued readings subject to censoring. We illustrate the performance of the proposed technique in modeling wireless propagation between nodes of a wireless sensor network. The model can capture the non-isotropic nature of the propagation characteristics and utilizes the information from the packet reception failures. We use measured data set from the Kansei sensor network testbed using 802.15.4 radios.

Sequential nonlinear manifold learning	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						feature representation; autonomous vehicles; machine learning	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION	The computation of compact and meaningful representations of high dimensional sensor data has recently been addressed through the development of Nonlinear Dimensional Reduction (NLDR) algorithms. The numerical implementation of spectral NLDR techniques typically leads to a symmetric eigenvalue problem that is solved by traditional batch eigensolution algorithms. The application of such algorithms in real-time systems necessitates the development of sequential algorithms that perform feature extraction online. This paper presents an efficient online NLDR scheme, Sequential-Isomap, based on incremental singular value decomposition (SVD) and the Isomap method. Example simulations demonstrate the validity and significant potential of this technique in real-time applications such as autonomous systems.

J	Pietraszek, T				Pietraszek, Tadeusz			Classification of intrusion detection alerts using abstaining classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						intrusion detection; false positives; alert classification; abstaining classifiers	MODEL	Intrusion Detection Systems have been observed to trigger an abundance of false positives, that is alerts not reporting security problems. Assuming that in real installations most of the alerts are reviewed by human security analysts in a timely manner, it is possible to use supervised machine learning techniques for automated alert classification to classify alerts into true and false positives. This paper explores the requirements for such an alert classification system and shows that, being a difficult and challenging machine learning problem, it is particularly suited for the application of abstaining classifiers, i.e., classifiers that can refrain from classification in some cases. We show that by applying our method for finding optimal, abstaining classifiers based on the ROC analysis, one can significantly reduce the rates of false positives and the false negatives as well as overall misclassification cost, making this method particularly viable for this application domain. Finally, we validate our method on one real-world proprietary dataset and one synthetic, publicly available dataset.

J	Seewald, AK				Seewald, Alexander K.			An evaluation of Naive Bayes variants in content-based learning for spam filtering	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						empirical study; spam filtering; machine learning; Naive Bayes		We describe an in-depth analysis of spam-filtering performance of a simple Naive Bayes learner and two extended variants. A set of seven mailboxes comprising about 65,000 mails from seven different users, as well as a representative snapshot of 25,000 mails which were received over 18 weeks by a single user, were used for evaluation. Our main motivation was to test whether two extended variants of Naive Bayes learning, SA-Train and CRM114, were superior to simple Naive Bayes learning, represented by SpamBayes. Surprisingly, we found that the performance of these systems was remarkably similar and that the extended systems have significant weaknesses which are not apparent for the simpler Naive Bayes learner. The simpler Naive Bayes learner, SpamBayes, also offers the most stable performance in that it deteriorates least over time. Overall, SpamBayes should be preferred over the more complex variants.

J	Beringer, J; Hullermeier, E				Beringer, Juergen; Huellermeier, Eyke			Efficient instance-based learning on data streams	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data streams; classification; instance-based learning; concept drift	DRIFT	The processing of data streams in general and the mining of such streams in particular have recently attracted considerable attention in various research fields. A key problem in stream mining is to extend existing machine learning and data mining methods so as to meet the increased requirements imposed by the data stream scenario, including the ability to analyze incoming data in an online, incremental manner, to observe tight time and memory constraints, and to appropriately respond to changes of the data characteristics and underlying distributions, amongst others. This paper considers the problem of classification on data streams and develops an instance-based learning algorithm for that purpose. The experimental studies presented in the paper suggest that this algorithm has a number of desirable properties that are not, at least not as a whole, shared by currently existing alternatives. Notably, our method is very flexible and thus able to adapt to an evolving environment quickly, a point of utmost importance in the data stream context.

Two machine learning models, namely, Support vector machines (SVM) and procedural neural networks (PNN) are compared in solving time series and they inspire the creation of SFM. SFM aims to extend the support vectors to spatiotemporal domain, in which each component of vectors is a function with respect to time. In the view of the function, SFM transfers a vector function of time to a static vector. Similar to the SVM training procedure, the corresponding learning algorithm for SFM is presented, which is equivalent to solving a quadratic programming. Moreover, two practical examples are investigated and the experimental results illustrate the feasibility of SFM in modeling time series predictions.

We focus on the problem of learning the overall preference weights of a set of alternatives from the (possibly conflicting) uncertain and imprecise information liven by a group of experts into the form of interval pairwise comparison matrices. Because of the complexity of real world problems, incomplete information or knowledge and different patterns of the experts, interval data provide a flexible framework to account uncertainty and imprecision. In this context, we propose a two-stage method in a distance-based framework, where the impact of the data certainty degree is captured. First, it is obtained the group preference matrix that best reflects imprecise information given by the experts. Then, the crisp preference weights and the associated ranking of the alternatives are derived from the obtained group matrix. The proposed methodology is made operational by using an Interval Goal Programming formulation.

Stop wasting time: On predicting the success or failure of learning for industrial applications	INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2007	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning	DEC 16-19, 2007	Birmingham, ENGLAND				VARIANCE; BIAS	The successful application of machine learning techniques to industrial problems places various demands on the collaborators. The system designers must possess appropriate analytical skills and technical expertise, and the management of the industrial or commercial partner must be sufficiently convinced of the potential benefits that they are prepared to invest in money and equipment. Vitally, the collaboration also requires a significant investment in time from the end-users in order to provide training data from which the system can (hopefully) learn. This poses a problem if the developed Machine Learning system is not sufficiently accurate, as the users and management; may view their input as wasted effort, and lose faith with the process. In this paper we investigate techniques for making early predictions of the error rate achievable after further interactions. In particular we show how decomposing the error in different components can lead to useful predictors of achievable accuracy, but; that this is dependent on the choice of an appropriate sampling methodology.

Positioned nucleosomes are believed to play an important role in transcriptional regulation and for the organization of chromatin in cell nuclei. After completing the genome project of many organisms, sequence mining received considerable and increasing attention. Many works devoted a lot of effort to detect the periodicity in DNA sequences, namely, the DNA segments that wrap the Histone protein. In this paper, we describe and apply a dynamic periodicity detection algorithm to discover periodicity in DNA sequences. Our algorithm is based on suffix tree as the underlying data structure. The proposed approach considers the periodicity of alternative substrings, in addition to considering dynamic window to detect the periodicity of certain instances of substrings. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach by reporting test results on three data sets.

We assumed that such proteins have specific physico-chemical properties that will discriminate them from proteins in other species. In this paper, we examine the validity of this assumption by comparing proteins and their properties from different bacterial species using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We show that by training on selected protein sequence properties, SVMs can successfully discriminate between proteins of different species. This finding takes us a step closer to inferring the functional characteristics of these proteins.

Through a machine learning approach, we are able to discover the agent dynamics that drives the evolution of the social groups in a community. By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing an agent-based hidden Markov model, in which the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters. To solve the problem, we develop a multistage learning process for determining the micro-laws of a community based on observed set of communications between actors without the semantic contents. We present the results of extensive experiments on synthetic data as well as some results on real communities, e.g., Enron email and movie newsgroups.

Using a genetic algorithm for editing k-nearest neighbor classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2007	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning	DEC 16-19, 2007	Birmingham, ENGLAND				DESIGN	The edited k-nearest neighbor consists of the application of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with an edited training set, in order to reduce the classification error rate. This edited training set is a subset of the complete training set in which some of the training patterns are excluded. In recent works, genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to generate edited sets. In this paper we propose three improvements of the edited k-nearest neighbor design using genetic algorithms: the use of a mean square error based objective function, the implementation of a clustered crossover, and a fast smart mutation scheme. Results achieved using the breast cancer database and the diabetes database from the UCI machine learning benchmark repository demonstrate the improvement achieved by the joint use of these three proposals.

Creative learning for intelligent robots	INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND COMPUTER VISION XXV: ALGORITHMS, TECHNIQUES, AND ACTIVE VISION	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXV - Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision	SEP 09-11, 2007	Boston, MA	SPIE		adaptive critic design; dynamic programming; creative learning; Neurocontrol; intelligent robots; artificial intelligence	GUARANTEED TRACKING PERFORMANCE; CONTROLLER; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	This paper describes a methodology for creative learning that applies to man and machines. Creative learning is a general approach used to solve optimal control problems. The creative controller for intelligent machines integrates a dynamic database and a task control center into the adaptive critic learning model. The task control center can function as a command center to decompose tasks into sub-tasks with different dynamic models and criteria functions, while the dynamic database can act as an information system. To illustrate the theory of creative control, several experimental simulations for robot arm manipulators and mobile wheeled vehicles were included. The simulation results showed that the best performance was obtained by using adaptive critic controller among all other controllers. By changing the paths of the robot arm manipulator in the simulation, it was demonstrated that the learning component of the creative controller was adapted to a new set of criteria. The Bearcat Cub robot was another experimental example used for testing the creative control learning. The significance of this research is to generalize the adaptive control theory in a direction toward highest level of human learning - imagination. In doing this it is hoped to better understand the adaptive learning theory and move forward to develop more human-intelligence-like components and capabilities into the intelligent robot. It is also hoped that a greater understanding of machine learning will motivate similar studies to improve human learning.

Typically, search queries are short, reveal very few features per single query and are therefore a weak source for traditional machine learning. In, this paper, we present a method that combines limited manual labeling, computational linguistics and information retrieval to classify a large collection of web search queries. A short set of manually chosen terms that are known a priori to be of interest to a particular class is used to cull a small number of actual queries from a commercial search engine log. These queries are then submitted to a commercial search engine and the returned search results are used to find more class related terms. We examine classification proficiency of the proposed method on a large web search engine query log and show that up to 48% of the unlabeled set could be classified using this method We discuss results of this research and its implications on the advancement of short text classification.

A classifier trained in a specific domain, however could be overfit and so inflexible that it could be used only in that domain. We therefore developed a new corpus about breast cancer and investigated the flexibility of classifier trained on the GENIA [141 corpus or the breast cancer corpus. To avoid overfitting we used the transductive support vector machine (SVM), and we evaluated the effect of transductive learning. We confirmed experimentally that the tranductive SVM prevented overfitting and yielded higher accuracies than the ordinary SVM did.

In this paper, a method is', proposed to identify the P2P traffic based on the machine learning. The novelty of the proposed method is that it utilizes only the size of packets exchanged between IPs within seconds. By investigating the ratio between the upload and download traffic volume of several P2P applications, a characteristic library is constructed. Then the unknown network traffic can be recognized online using this library. The distinguished features of the proposed method lie in that fast computation, high identification accuracy, and resource-saving capability. Finally, experiment results show the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.

Our GBML algorithm is a hybrid version of Michigan and Pittsburgh approaches, which is implemented in the framework of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). Each fuzzy rule is represented by its antecedent fuzzy sets as an integer string of fixed length. Each fuzzy rule-based classifier, which is a set of fuzzy rules, is represented as a concatenated integer string of variable length. Our GBML algorithm simultaneously maximizes the accuracy of rule sets and minimizes their complexity. The accuracy is measured by the number of correctly classified training patterns while the complexity is measured by the number of fuzzy rules and/or the total number of antecedent conditions of fuzzy rules. We examine the in terpretability-accuracy tradeoff for training patterns through computational experiments on some benchmark data sets. A clear tradeoff structure is visualized for each data set. We also examine the interpretabitity-accuracy tradeoff for test patterns. Due to the overfitting to training patterns, a clear tradeoff structure is not always obtained in computational experiments for test patterns. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Practical estimation of Volterra filters of arbitrary degree	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article							FOCK SPACE FRAMEWORK; NON-LINEAR SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; SERIES; NOISE	Generalized Fock spaces (GFS) were proposed some time ago as a general framework for non-linear system identification and signal analysis. Corresponding to a particular class of reproducing kernel Hubert spaces (RKHS) they provide a natural framework for the estimation of continuous- and discrete-time Volterra filters (VF). Whilst both finite and infinite degree VF are treated in a single framework using GFS an open question is the practical estimation of infinite degree VF. In this paper this problem is resolved and it is shown how VF of arbitrary degree (including infinite) can be computed with finite resources. The solutions are global best approximations to the entire VF based on the available data. Use is made of recent advances in the machine learning community, such as the support vector machine, which make extensive use of RKHS ideas. This paper also highlights the importance of this work to the system identification community. A number of particular contributions are made including a derivation of a particular GFS for VF which permits a simply computable reproducing kernel, derivations of the associated mappings between Volterra parameter space and RKHS parameter space which permit the extraction of the Volterra parameters from the RKHS approximation and solve a set of ``free'' parameters, extending the GFS framework to include regularization and a detailed simulation-based comparison of the estimation of VF.

Their accuracy on beta-sheet residue class is considerably lower than for the other two classes. We analysed the relevance of 315 individual input attributes for a predictor with the usual framework of using sequence-profile based data with an input window of fixed size. We propose two alternative knowledge representations with significantly smaller sets of input attributes. We also investigated the possibility of exploiting the prediction of connected pairs of beta-sheet residues and the prediction of residue contact maps for the improvement of accuracy of secondary-structure prediction.

An essential part of this approach is qualitative constraints which were either handcrafted using knowledge from the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model or induced directly from the collected data with a program called QUIN. The induced models were evaluated by a domain expert. We performed a comparison between numerical results of the Q(2) teaming approach and standard machine teaming algorithms. The results suggest that use of qualitative constraints leads to more accurate quantitative predictions.

Optimization of fuzzy partitions for inductive reasoning using genetic algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						electrical engineering; central nervous system; genetic algorithms; fuzzy inductive reasoning; genetic fuzzy systems; machine learning	SYSTEM; NETWORKS; DESIGN	Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR) is a data-driven methodology that uses fuzzy and pattern recognition techniques to infer system models and to predict their future behavior. It is well known that variations on fuzzy partitions have a direct effect on the performance of the fuzzy-rule-based systems. The FIR methodology is not an exception. The performance of the model identification and prediction processes of FIR is highly influenced by the discretization parameters of the system variables, i. e. the number of classes of each variable and the membership functions that define its semantics. In this work, we design two new genetic fuzzy systems (GFSs) that improve this modeling and simulation technique. The main goal of the GFSs is to learn the fuzzification parameters of the FIR methodology.

This characteristic may make machine learning methods that use such kernels suboptimal in cases where the feature vector has an underlying structure. In this paper we will consider one such case, where the features are spatially related. We show a way to modify the objective function of the support vector machine (SVM) optimization problem to account for this structure. The new optimization problem can be implemented as a standard SVM using a particular smoothing kernel. Results arc shown on a speaker verification task using prosodic features that are transformed using a particular implementation of the Fisher score. The proposed method leads to improvements of as much as 15% in equal error rate (EER).

The VariKN toolkit trains language models producing a compact set of high-order n-grams utilizing state-of-art Kneser-Ney smoothing. As an example, this paper shows how to construct a language model for speech recognition in multiple languages utilizing only a minimal amount of linguistic resources. Morfessor and VariKN also have other applications in text understanding, information retrieval and machine translation. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are particularly well suited for the development of systems for less-resourced languages, because they do not depend on manually designed morphological or syntactical analyzers or annotated data.

It extracts predicate-argument structures from text intervals and links them into semantically organized proposition trees. By instantiating trees constructed for topic descriptions in trees representing input sentences or parts thereof, we are able to assess degree of "topicality" for each sentence. The presented strategy was used in the BBN distillation system for the GALE Year I evaluation and achieved outstanding results compared to other systems and human participants.

One of the most critical aspects of such a system is speech recognition errors, since they often take the dialogue thread down a wrong turn that is very confusing to the student and may be irrecoverable. In this paper we report on a machine learning technique to assist the process of selection from a list of N-best candidates based on a high-level description of the semantics of the preceding dialogue. In a user simulation experiment, we show that a significant reduction in sentence error rate can be achieved, from 29.2% to 23.6%. We have not yet verified that our techniques hold for real user data.

We suggest that a simple discourse/sentential distinction is not sufficient for such words and propose two additional classification sub-tasks: identifying (a) whether such words convey acknowledgment or agreement, and (b) whether they cue the beginning or end of a discourse segment. We also study the classification of each individual word into its most common discourse functions. We show that models based on contextual features extracted from the time-aligned transcripts approach the error rate of trained human aligners.

However, the design and optimization of SDS is not only about combining speech and language processing systems such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), parsers, Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis systems. It also requires the development of dialogue strategies taking at least into account the performances of these subsystems (and others), the nature of the task (e.g. form filling, tutoring, robot control, or database search/browsing), and the user's behaviour (e.g. cooperativeness, expertise). Due to the great variability of these factors, reuse of previous hand-crafted designs is also made very difficult. For these reasons, statistical machine learning (ML) methods applied to automatic SDS optimization have been a leading research area for the last few years. In this paper, we provide a short review of the field and of recent advances.

Formal modelling of L1 and L2 perceptual learning: Computational linguistics versus machine learning	INTERSPEECH 2007: 8TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	Interspeech Conference 2007	AUG 27-31, 2007	Antwerp, BELGIUM					In this paper, we evaluate the adequacy of two widely used machine learning algorithms and a computational linguistic proposal to model L2 perceptual development. The three proposals are, in order, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayesian and Stochastic OT and the Gradual Learning Algorithm. We compared the three models' outputs to those of Spanish learners of Dutch who were asked to categorize synthetic stimuli as one of the 12 Dutch vowels. The empirical results of the human learners show that L2 learners differ significantly from native listeners, but also that their perceptual spaces tend to become more native-like with L2 proficiency. The results of the simulations show that all three algorithms are able to model listeners' data to a certain extent but that Stochastic OT and the Gradual Learning Algorithm, i.e. the linguistic model, best reproduces L1 and L2 data.

We propose that identifying the truth or falsity of these CRITICAL SEGMENTS may be important in determining a speaker's veracity over the larger topic of discourse. Further, answers to key questions, which can be identified a priori, may represent emotional and cognitive HOT SPOTS, analogous to those observed by psychologists who study gestural and facial cues to deception. We present results of experiments that use two different definitions of CRITICAL SEGMENTS and employ machine learning techniques that compensate for imbalances in the dataset. Using this approach, we achieve a performance gain of 23.8% relative to chance, in contrast with human performance on a similar task, which averages substantially below chance. We discuss the features used by the models, and consider how these findings can influence future research.

In this paper, we describe a freely available, open-source system, called TurboAnnotate, for bootstrapping linguistic data for machine-learning purposes, or for manually creating gold standards or other annotated lists. A detailed description of the design and functionalities of the tool is given, focusing on how the requirements of end-users are being addressed through it. It is indicated that TurboAnnotate does not only promise to help increase the accuracy of human annotators, but also to save enormously on human effort in terms of time.

To extract and induce rules of association for differentiating between normal and glaucomatous eyes based on the quantitative assessment of summary data reports from the StratusOCT (optical coherence tomography; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) in a Taiwan Chinese population. METHODS. One randomly selected eye of each of the 64 patients with glaucoma and each of the 71 normal subjects was included in the study. Measurements of glaucoma variables (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and optic nerve head analysis results) were obtained with the StratusOCT. A self-organizing map and decision tree were applied to extract features and determine rules of association for glaucoma detection. RESULTS. The average visual field mean deviation was -0.55 +/- 0.57 dB in the normal group and -4.30 +/- 3.32 dB in the glaucoma group. Vertical cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio and inferior quadrant thickness were extracted from the decision tree, and three association rules were determined for glaucoma detection. CONCLUSIONS. The precise rules of association induced by a novel application of the decision tree may enhance glaucoma detection.

In this paper, we propose an integrated Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Machine Learning (ML) approach for question classification in English-Chinese cross-language question answering. To enhance question informer prediction, we use a hybrid method that integrates GA and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to optimize feature subset selection in a CRF-based question informer prediction model. The proposed approach extends cross-language question classification by using the GA-CRF question informer feature with Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of evaluations on the NTCIR-6 CLQA question sets demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in improving the accuracy of question classification in English-Chinese cross-language question answering.

The paper is to model threats to battlefield helicopters, which represents a specific threat pattern and a methodology that compiles the threat into a set of rules using machine learning algorithms. This methodology based upon the inductive threat model can be used to detect real-time threats. We report experimental results that demonstrate the distinctive and predictive patterns of threats in simulated battlefield settings, and show the potential of compilation methods for the successful detection of threat systems.

Although the method, proved by empirical results, can make the datasets much more balanced, the accuracy of the prediction is still not satisfactory. Therefore, a fuzzy-based representation of the software module fault state has been presented instead of the original faulty/non-faulty one. Several experiments were conducted using datasets from NASA Metrics Data Program. The discussion of the results of experiments is provided.

Until now, it has not been possible to determine the best GC algorithm for a particular program without exhaustively profiling that program for all available GC algorithms. This paper presents a new approach. We use machine learning techniques to build a prediction model that, given a single profile run of a previously unseen Java program, can predict a good GC algorithm for that program. We implement this technique in Jikes RVM and test it on several standard benchmark suites. Our technique achieves 5% speedup in overall execution time (averaged across all test programs for all heap sizes) compared with selecting the default GC algorithm in every trial. We present further experiments to show that an oracle predictor could achieve an average 17% speedup on the same experiments. In addition, we provide evidence to suggest that GC behaviour is sometimes independent of program inputs. These observations lead us to propose that intelligent selection of GC algorithms is suitably straightforward, efficient and effective to merit further exploration regarding its potential inclusion in the general Java software deployment process.

Design of an efficient architecture for enhancement of stream video captured in non-uniform lighting conditions	ISSCS 2007: INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNALS, CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems	JUL 12-13, 2007	Iasi, ROMANIA	Fac Elect & Telecommun, IEEE Romania Sect CAS Chapter, Tech Univ Iasi				A novel architecture for informing hue-saturation-value (HSV) domain enhancement of digital color images with non-uniform lighting conditions is proposed in this Paper for video streaming applications. The approach promotes log-domain computation to eliminate all multiplications, divisions and exponentiations utilizing the effective logarithmic estimation modules. An optimized quadrant symmetric architecture is incorporated into the design of homomorphic filter for the enhancement of intensity value. Efficient modules are also presented for conversion between RGB and HSV color spaces. The design is able to bring out details hidden in shadow regions of the image. it is capable of producing 187.86 million outputs per second (MOPs) on Xilinx's Virtex II XUV2000-4ff896 field programmable gate army (FPGA) at a clock frequency of 187.86 MHz. Wean process over 1.79.1 (1024 X 1024) frames per second and consumes approximately 70.7% and 76.8% less hardware resource with 127% and 280% performance boost when compared to the designs with machine learning algorithm [10], and with separated dynamic and contrast enhancements [11], respectively.

The technique is based on principles similar to Tarantula but addresses its main flaw: its difficulty to deal with the presence of multiple faults as it assumes that failing test cases execute the same fault(s). The improvement we present in this paper results from the use of C4.5 decision trees to identify various failure conditions based on information regarding the test cases' inputs and outputs. Failing test cases executing under similar conditions are then assumed to fail due to the same fault(s). Statements are then considered suspicious if they are covered by a large proportion of failing test cases that execute under similar conditions. We report on a case study that demonstrates improvement over the original Tarantula technique in terms of statement ranking. Another contribution of this paper is to show that failure conditions as modeled by a C4.5 decision tree accurate v predict failures and can therefore be used as well to help debugging.

The system under consideration is constantly evolving as several releases a year are shipped to customers. Developers usually have limited resources for their testing and inspections and would like to be able to devote extra resources to faulty system parts. The main research focus of this paper is two-fold: (1) use and compare many data mining and machine learning techniques to build fault-proneness models based mostly, on source code measures and change/fault history data, and (2) demonstrate that the usual classification evaluation criteria based on confusion matrices may not be fully appropriate to compare and evaluate models.

We present experiments on using Wikipedia for computing semantic relatedness and compare it to WordNet on various bench-marking datasets. Existing relatedness measures perform better using Wikipedia than a baseline given by Google counts, and we show that Wikipedia outperforms WordNet on some datasets. We also address the question whether and how Wikipedia can be integrated into NLP applications as a knowledge base. Including Wikipedia improves the performance of a machine learning based coreference resolution system, indicating that it represents a valuable resource for NLP applications.

J	Orasan, C; Evans, R				Orasan, Constantin; Evans, Richard			NP animacy identification for anaphora resolution	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								In anaphora resolution for English, animacy identification can play an integral role in the application of agreement restrictions between pronouns and candidates, and as a result, can improve the accuracy of anaphora resolution systems. In this paper, two methods for animacy identification are proposed and evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic measures. The first method is a rule-based one which uses information about the unique beginners in WordNet to classify NPs on the basis of their animacy. The second method relies on a machine learning algorithm which exploits a WordNet enriched with animacy information for each sense. The effect of word sense disambiguation on the two methods is also assessed. The intrinsic evaluation reveals that the machine learning method reaches human levels of performance. The extrinsic evaluation demonstrates that animacy identification can be beneficial in anaphora resolution, especially in the cases where animate entities are identified with high precision.

J	Bull, L; Adamatzky, A				Bull, Larry; Adamatzky, Andrew			A learning classifier system approach to the identification of cellular automata	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AUTOMATA			English	Article								This paper presents a novel approach to the programming of automata-based simulation and computation using a machine learning technique. The programming of lattice-based automata for real-world applications is cast as a data mining problem. Our approach to achieving this is to use evolutionary computing and reinforcement learning with performance fed back indicating the predictive accuracy of future behaviour of the given system. The purpose of this work is to develop an approach to learning automata rules that can achieve good performance using data from a variety of kinds of complex systems. Results indicate the approach is effective for both nearest neighbour and non-proximal cellular automata.

Classification of highly unbalanced CYP450 data of drugs using cost sensitive machine learning techniques	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEAREST POINT ALGORITHM; CYTOCHROME-P450 2D6; FEATURE-SELECTION; IN-SILICO; MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; PREDICTION; METABOLISM; INHIBITION; MODELS	In this paper, we study the classifications of unbalanced data sets of drugs. As an example we chose a data set of 2D6 inhibitors of cytochrome P450. The human cytochrome P450 2D6 isoform plays a key role in the metabolism of many drugs in the preclinical drug discovery process. We have collected a data set from annotated public data and calculated physicochemical properties with chemoinformatics methods. On top of this data, we have built classifiers based on machine learning methods. Data sets with different class distributions lead to the effect that conventional machine learning methods are biased toward the larger class. To overcome this problem and to obtain sensitive but also accurate classifiers we combine machine learning and feature selection methods with techniques addressing the problem of unbalanced classification, such as oversampling and threshold moving. We have used our own implementation of a support vector machine algorithm as well as the maximum entropy method. Our feature selection is based on the unsupervised McCabe method. The classification results from our test set are compared structurally with compounds from the training set. We show that the applied algorithms enable the effective high throughput in silico classification of potential drug candidates.

We demonstrate, by rigorous multiple comparison statistical tests, that these techniques can provide consistent improvements in predictive performance over single decision trees. However, within these methods, there is no clearly best-performing algorithm. This motivates a more in-depth investigation into the properties of random forests. We identify a set of parameters for the random forest that provide optimal performance across all the studied data sets. Additionally, the tree ensemble structure of the forest may provide an interpretable model, a considerable advantage over SVMs. We test this possibility and compare it with standard decision tree models.

We report a kernel method that allows the processing of molecules represented by binary, integer and real-valued descriptors, and show that it is little different in screening performance from a previously described kernel that had been developed specifically for the analysis of binary fingerprint representations of molecular structure. We then evaluate the performance of an NBC when the training-set contains only a very few active molecules. In such cases, a simpler approach based on group fusion would appear to provide superior screening performance, especially when structurally heterogeneous datasets are to be processed.

J	Oloff, S; Muegge, I				Oloff, Scott; Muegge, Ingo			kScore: a novel machine learning approach that is not dependent on the data structure of the training set	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						virtual screening; applicability domain; predictive modeling; QSAR	QSAR MODELS	Currently machine learning approaches used in Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) model generation impose restrictions and/or make assumptions on how the training set descriptors correlate with a target activity. kScore has been developed as the first machine learning approach that does not require the training data to conform to a defined kernel, accommodates uneven data point distributions in the descriptor space, and optimizes the weight of each dimension in the descriptor space in order to identify the descriptors most relevant to the target property. The ability of kScore to adapt to virtually any correlation makes it essential that generalization terms be included to inhibit overtraining. The Structural Risk Minimization principle and the linear epsilon-insensitive loss terms have been added to the kScore optimization function. The resulting kScore algorithm has proven to be quite universal across several datasets and either produces results similar to or outperforms the most predictive machine learning algorithms tested, such as SVM, kNN, Recursive Partitioning, Neural Networks, Gaussian Process, and the Bayesian Classifier.

J	Peng, FC; Huang, XJ				Peng, Fuchun; Huang, Xiangji			Machine learning for Asian language text classification	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						languages; classification; modelling; China; Japan	CATEGORIZATION	Purpose - The purpose of this research is to compare several machine learning techniques on the task of Asian language text classification, such as Chinese and Japanese where no word boundary information is available in written text. The paper advocates a simple language modeling based approach for this task. Design/methodology/approach - Naive Bayes, maximum entropy model, support vector machines, and language modeling approaches were implemented and were applied to Chinese and Japanese text classification. To investigate the influence of word segmentation, different word segmentation approaches were investigated and applied to Chinese text. A segmentation-based approach was compared with the non-segmentation-based approach. Findings - There were two findings: the experiments show that statistical language modeling can significantly outperform standard techniques, given the same set of features; and it was found that classification with word level features normally yields improved classification performance, but that classification performance is not monotonically related to segmentation accuracy. In particular, classification performance may initially improve with increased segmentation accuracy, but eventually classification performance stops improving, and can in fact even decrease, after a certain level of segmentation accuracy. Practical implications - Apply the findings to real web text classification is ongoing work. Originality/value - The paper is very relevant to Chinese and Japanese information processing, e.g. webpage classification, web search.

J	Bizios, D; Heijl, A; Bengtsson, B				Bizios, Dimitrios; Heijl, Anders; Bengtsson, Boel			Trained artificial neural network for glaucoma diagnosis using visual field data - A comparison with conventional algorithms	JOURNAL OF GLAUCOMA			English	Article						glaucoma diagnostics; perimetry; visual field; artificial neural network	MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; IDENTIFY PATTERNS; EXPERIENCE; STANDARD; DEFECTS; DISC	Purpose: To evaluate and confirm the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) trained to recognize glaucomatons visual field defects, and compare its diagnostic accuracy with that of other algorithms proposed for the detection of visual field loss. Methods: SITA Standard 30-2 visual fields, from 100 glaucoma patients and 116 healthy participants, formed the data set. Our ANN was a previously described fully trained network using scored pattern deviation probability maps as input data. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared to that of the Glaucoma Hemifield Test, the Pattern Standard Deviation index at the P < 5% and < 1%, and also to a technique based on the recognizing clusters of significantly depressed test points. Results: The included tests had early to moderate visual field loss (median MD = -6.16 dB). ANN achieved a sensitivity of 93% at a specificity level of 94% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.984. Glaucoma Hemifield Test attained a sensitivity of 92% at 91% specificity. Pattern Standard Deviation, with a cut off level at P < 5% had a sensitivity of 89% with a specificity of 93 %, whereas at P < 1% the sensitivity and specificity was 72% and 97%, respectively. The cluster algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 82%. Conclusions: The high diagnostic performance of our ANN based on refined input visual field data was confirmed in this independent sample. Its diagnostic accuracy was slightly to considerably better than that of the compared algorithms. The results indicate the large potential for ANN as an important clinical glaucoma diagnostic tool.

The proposed approach combines the philosophy of boosting, putting more effort on difficult instances, with the basis of the random subspace method. Our main contribution is that instead of using a random subspace, we construct a projection taking into account the instances which have posed most difficulties to previous classifiers. In this way, consecutive nonlinear projections are created by a neural network trained using only incorrectly classified instances. The feature subspace induced by the hidden layer of this network is used as the input space to a new classifier. The method is compared with bagging and boosting techniques, showing an improved performance on a large set of 44 problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

J	Yang, W; Rueda, L; Ngom, A				Yang, Wei; Rueda, Luis; Ngom, Alioune			On finding the best parameters of fuzzy k-means for clustering microarray data	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						simulated annealing; clustering; DNA microarray analysis; machine learning	GENE-EXPRESSION; DNA ARRAYS	Clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and fuzzy k-means, have become important tools for gene expression analysis of microarray data. However, the need of prior knowledge of the number of clusters, k, and the fuzziness parameter, b, limits the usage of fuzzy clustering. In this paper, we use simulated annealing (SA) and fuzzy k-means clustering to determine the optimal parameters, namely the number of clusters, k, and the fuzziness parameter, b. To improve SA, two methods, searching with Tabu List and shrinking the scope of randomization, are applied. Our results show that a nearly-optinial pair of k and b (a near optimal value of k) can be obtained without exploring the entire search space.

J	Abraham, A; Jain, R; Thomas, J; Han, SY				Abraham, Ajith; Jain, Ravi; Thomas, Johnson; Han, Sang Yong			D-SCIDS: Distributed soft computing intrusion detection system	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article							AGENTS; ENSEMBLE; DESIGN	An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a program that analyzes what happens or has happened during an execution and tries to find indications that the computer has been misused. A Distributed IDS (DIDS) consists of several IDS over a large network(s), all of which communicate with each other, or with a central server that facilitates advanced network monitoring. In a distributed environment, DIDS are implemented using co-operative intelligent agents distributed across the network(s). This paper evaluates three fuzzy rule-based classifiers to detect intrusions in a network. Results are then compared with other machine learning techniques like decision trees, support vector machines and linear genetic programming. Further, we modeled Distributed Soft Computing-based IDS (D-SCIDS) as a combination of different classifiers to model lightweight and more accurate (heavy weight) IDS. Empirical results clearly show that soft computing approach could play a major role for intrusion detection. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, these studies often incorporate different head injury prognostication models and study populations, thus making direct comparison difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, newer artiricial intelligence tools such as machine learning methods have evolved in the field of data analysis, alongside more traditional methods of analysis. This study targets the development of a set of integrated prognostication model combining different classes of outcome and prognostic factors. Methodologies such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision tree, Bayesian network, and neural network were employed in the study. Several prognostication models were developed using prospectively collected data from 513 severe closed head-injured patients admitted to the Neurocritical Unit at National Neuroscience Institute of Singapore, from April 1999 to February 2003. The correlation between prognostic factors at admission and outcome at 6 months following injury was studied. Overritting error, which may falsely distinguish different outcomes, was compared graphically. Tenfold cross-validation technique, which reduces overfitting error, was used to validate outcome prediction accuracy. The overall prediction accuracy achieved ranged from 49.79% to 81.49%. Consistently high outcome prediction accuracy was seen with logistic regression and decision tree. Combining both logistic regression and decision tree models, a hybrid prediction model was then developed. This hybrid model would more accurately predict the 6-month post-severe head injury outcome using baseline admission parameters.

Bryan			The reusability of induced knowledge for the automatic semantic markup of taxonomic descriptions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TEXT SEGMENTATION	To automatically convert legacy data of taxonomic descriptions into extensible markup language (XML) format, the authors designed a machine-learning-based approach. In this project three corpora of taxonomic descriptions were selected to prove the hypothesis that domain knowledge and conventions automatically induced from some semistructured corpora (i.e., base corpora) are useful to improve the markup performance of other less-structured, quite different corpora (i.e., evaluation corpora). The "structuredness" of the three corpora was carefully measured. Basing on the structuredness measures, two of the corpora were used as the base corpora and one as the evaluation corpus. Three series of experiments were carried out with the MARTT (markuper of taxonomic treatments) system the authors developed to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods of using the n-grarn semantic class association rules, the element relative position probabilities, and a combination of the two types of knowledge mined from the automatically marked-up base corpora. The experimental results showed that the induced knowledge from the base corpora was more reliable than that learned from the training examples alone, and that the n-gram semantic class association rules were effective in improving the markup performance, especially on the elements with sparse training examples. The authors also identify a number of challenges for any automatic markup system using taxonomic descriptions.

Named Entity Extraction (NEE) is a subtask of Information Extraction that involves the identification of groups of words that make up the name of an entity, and the classification of these names into a set of predefined categories. Our approach is corpus-based, we use a re-trainable tagger generator to obtain a named entity extractor from a set of tagged examples. The main contribution of our work is that we obtain the systems needed in a stacking scheme without making use of any additional training material or tagger generators. Instead of it, we have generated the variability needed in stacking by applying corpus transformation to the original training corpus. Once we have several versions of the training corpus we generate several extractors and combine them by means of a machine learning algorithm. Experiments show that the combination of corpus transformation and stacking improve the performance of the tagger generator in this kind of natural language processing applications. The best of our experiments achieves an improvement of more than six percentual points respect to the predefined baseline.

Keywords extraction from documents is a complex task in natural languages processing. Ideally this task concerns sophisticated semantic analysis. However, the complexity of the problem makes current semantic analysis techniques insufficient. Machine learning methods can support the initial phases of keywords extraction and can thus improve the input to further semantic analysis phases. In this paper we propose a machine learning-based keywords extraction for given documents domain, namely scientific literature. More specifically, the least square support vector machine is used as a machine learning method. The proposed method takes the advantages of machine learning techniques and moves the complexity of the task to the process of learning from appropriate samples obtained within a domain. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method is capable to extract keywords from the domain of scientific literature with promising results.

Inducing features from visual noise	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						feature induction; reverse correlation; classification in noise; Gaussian mixture model	REPRESENTATIONS	We present new experimental and mathematical techniques aimed at determining the features used in visual object recognition. We conceive of these features as the parts of an object that are treated as unitary wholes when recognizing or discriminating visual objects. For example, consider a task classifying a visual target presented in pixel noise as a "P" or a "Q". The features may correspond to particular shapes of the target letters. Two such features for "P", for example, might be a vertical line and upper-right-facing curve. The decision may be encoded in terms of particular values of such features, and an appropriate combination of these values may determine how the expression is perceived. We utilize recent advances in statistical machine learning techniques to uncover the features used by human observers.

It often happens that obtaining labeled data in a new domain is expensive and time consuming, while there may be plenty of labeled data from a related but different domain. Traditional machine learning is not able to cope well with learning across different domains. In this paper, we address this problem for a text-mining task, where the labeled data are under one distribution in one domain known as in-domain data, while the unlabeled data are under a related but different domain known as out-of-domain data. Our general goal is to learn from the in-domain and apply the learned knowledge to out-of-domain. We propose a co-clustering based classification (CoCC) algorithm to tackle this problem. Co-clustering is used as a bridge to propagate the class structure and knowledge front the in-domain to the out-of-domain. We present theoretical and empirical analysis to show that our algorithm is able to produce high quality classification results, even when the distributions between the two data are different. The experimental results show that our algorithm greatly improves the classification performance over the traditional learning algorithms.

In most applications, anomalies are defined as data points that are 'abnormal'. Quite often we have access to data which consists mostly of normal records, along with a small percentage of unlabelled anomalous records. We are interested in the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection, where we use the unlabelled data for training, and detect records that do not follow the definition of normality. A standard approach is to create a model of normal data, and compare test records against it. A probabilistic approach builds a likelihood model from the training data. Records are tested for anomalousness based on the complete record likelihood given the probability model. For categorical attributes, bayes nets give a standard representation of the likelihood. While this approach is good at finding outliers in the dataset, it often tends to detect records with attribute values that are rare. Sometimes, just detecting rare values of an attribute is not desired and such outliers are not considered as anomalies in that context. We present an alternative definition of anomalies, and propose an approach of comparing against marginal distributions of attribute subsets. We show that this is a more meaningful way of detecting anomalies, and has a better performance over semi-synthetic as well as real world datasets.

Most previous data mining and machine learning research, however, assumes that a fixed set of training examples is given. In this paper, we propose an online cost-sensitive framework that allows a learner to dynamically acquire examples as it learns, and to decide the ideal number of examples needed to minimize the total cost. We also propose a new strategy for Partial Example Acquisition (PAS), in which the learner can acquire examples with a subset of attribute values to reduce the data acquisition cost. Experiments on UCI datasets show that the new PAS strategy is an effective method in reducing the total cost for data acquisition.

Weighting versus Pruning in Rule Validation for Detecting Network and Host Anomalies	KDD-2007 PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	AUG 12-15, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Machine learning; anomaly detection; rule pruning; rule weighting	ALGORITHMS	For intrusion detection, the LERAD algorithm learns a succinct set of comprehensible rules for detecting anomalies, which could be novel attacks. LERAD validates the learned rules on a separate held-out validation set and removes rules that cause false alarms. However, removing rules with possible high coverage can lead to missed detections. We propose to retain these rules and associate weights to them. We present three weighting schemes and our empirical results indicate that, for LERAD, rule weighting can detect more attacks than pruning with minimal computational overhead.

Examples include linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Lasso amongst others. This paper describes the theory and implementation of a highly scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems. It can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations, allows for data-locality, and can deal with regularizers such as l(1) and l(2) penalties. At present, our solver implements 20 different estimation problems, can be easily extended, scales to millions of observations, and is tip to 10 times faster than specialized solvers for many applications. The open source code is freely available as part of the ELEFANT toolbox.	[Teo, Choon Hui; Le, Quoc; Smola, Alex; Vishwanathan, S. V.

Privacy-Preservation for Gradient Descent Methods	KDD-2007 PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	AUG 12-15, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Privacy Preservation; Gradient Descent Method; Secure Multiparty Computation; Regression		Gradient descent is a widely used paradigm for solving many optimization problems. Stochastic gradient descent performs a series of iterations to minimize a target function in order to reach a local minimum. In machine learning or data mining, this function corresponds to a decision model that is to be discovered. The gradient descent paradigm underlies many commonly used techniques in data mining and machine learning, such as neural networks, Bayesian networks, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work that extends the notion of privacy preservation or secure multiparty computation to gradient-descent-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a preliminary approach to enable privacy preservation in gradient descent methods in general and demonstrate its feasibility in specific gradient descent methods.

Specifically, the localization problem is to determine the location of a client device accurately given the radio signal strength values received at the client device from multiple beacon sensors or access points. Conventional data mining and machine learning methods can be applied to solve this problem. However, all of them require large amounts of labeled training data, which can be quite expensive. In this paper. we propose a probabilistic semi-supervised learning approach to reduce the calibration effort and increase the tracking accuracy. Our method is based on semi-supervised conditional random fields which can enhance the learned model from a small set of training data with abundant unlabeled data effectively. To make our method more efficient, we exploit a Generalized EM algorithm coupled with domain constraints. We validate our method through extensive experiments in a real sensor network using Crossbow MICA2 sensors. The results demonstrate the advantages of methods compared to other state-of-the-art object-tracking algorithms.

We briefly describe some of the machine learning techniques developed to overcome the real world challenges in this medical domain. The most significant hurdle in transitioning from a machine learning research prototype that performs well on an in-house dataset into a clinically deployable system, is the requirement that the CAD system be tested in a clinical trial. We describe the clinical trial in which LungCAD was tested: a large scale multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of CAD in clinical practice for detecting solid pulmonary nodules from CT thorax studies. The clinical trial demonstrates that every radiologist that participated in the trial had a significantly greater accuracy with LungCAD, both for detecting nodules and identifying potentially actionable nodules; this, along with other findings from the trial, has resulted in FDA approval for LungCAD in late 2006.

PR takes into account the huge size of real-world stock data and applies a modified competitive learning technique to predict the ranks of stocks. The primary target of PR is to select the top performing stocks among many ordinary stocks. PR is designed to perform the learning and testing in a noisy stocks sample set where the top performing stocks are usually the minority. The performance of PR is evaluated by a trading simulation of the real stock data. Each week the stocks with the highest predicted ranks are chosen to construct a portfolio. In the period of 1978-2004, PR's portfolio earns a much higher average return as well as a higher risk-adjusted return than Cooper's method, which shows that the PR method leads to a clear profit improvement.

Over the past 30 years, simplistic techniques based on the design of smart feature-extraction algorithms and physiological models have given way to powerful statistical methods based on generative models. Such approaches suffer from three basic problems: discrimination, generalization, and sparsity. In the last decade, the field of machine learning has grown tremendously, generating many promising new approaches to this problem based on principles of discrimination. These techniques, though powerful when given vast amounts of training data, often suffer from poor generalization. In this chapter, we present a unified framework in which both generative and discriminative models are motivated from an information theoretic perspective. We introduce the modern statistical approach to speech recognition and discuss how kernel-based methods are used to model knowledge at each level of the problem. Specific methods discussed include kernel PCA for feature extraction and support vector machines for discriminative modeling. We conclude with some emerging research on the use of kernels in language modeling.

To achieve this goal, the system employs powerful network traffic scanners capable of cleaning traffic from known malicious code. The remaining traffic is monitored and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are invoked in an attempt to pinpoint, unknown malicious code exhibiting suspicious morphological patterns. Decision trees, Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks are used for static code analysis in order to determine whether a suspicious executable file actually inhabits malicious code. These algorithms are being evaluated and preliminary results are encouraging.

The game has a high strategic complexity and the number of possible board positions is larger than in CHESS. There are already some HEX programs of recognizable strength, but which still play on a level below very strong human players. One of their major weaknesses is the time for evaluating a board. In this work we apply machine learning for the computer player to improve his play by generating an fast evaluation function and lookup procedure for pattern endgame databases. The data structures used are neural networks for the evaluation of a position and limited branching trees to determine if a position can be classified as won or lost.

In spite of their sound theoretical properties, RNNs and GNNs suffer some drawbacks that may limit their application. This paper outlines an alternative connectionist framework for learning discriminant functions over structured data. The approach, albeit preliminary, is simple and suitable to maximum-a-posteriori classification of broad families of graphs, and overcomes some limitations of RNNs and GNNs. The idea is to describe a graph as an algebraic relation, i.e. as a subset of the Cartesian product. The class-posterior probabilities given the relation are reduced to products of probabilistic quantities estimated using a multilayer perceptron. Experimental comparisons on tasks that were previously solved via RNNs and GNNs validate the approach.

In Systems Biology the principal problem is modeling complex biological systems and reconstructing interactions between their building blocks. Symbolic machine learning approaches have the power to model structured domains and relations among objects. However biological domains require uncertainty handling due to their hidden complex nature. Statistical machine learning approaches have the potential to model uncertainty in a robust manner. In this paper we apply a hybrid symbolic-statistical framework to modeling metabolic pathways and show through experiments that complex phenomenon such as biochemical reactions in cell's metabolic networks can be modeled and simulated in the proposed framework.

They have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems and particularly to the analysis of gene expression data. However SVM algorithms rely usually on the use of the Euclidean distance that often fails to reflect the object proximities. Several versions of the SVM have been proposed that incorporate non Euclidean dissimilarities. Nevertheless, different dissimilarities reflect complementary features of the data and no one can be considered superior to the others. In this paper, we present an ensemble of SVM classifiers that reduces the misclassification error combining different dissimilarities. The method proposed has been applied to identify cancerous tissues using Microarray gene expression data with remarkable results.
