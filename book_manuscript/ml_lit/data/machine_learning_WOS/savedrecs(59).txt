ONLINE SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION	IEE PROCEEDINGS-CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS; BIOMEDICAL CONTROL; CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION; FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; MACHINE LEARNING		Although fuzzy logic controllers and expert systems have been successfully applied in many complex industrial processes, they experience a deficiency in knowledge acquisition and rely to a great extent on empirical and heuristic knowledge which in many cases cannot be objectively elicited. Among the usual problems to be resolved in fuzzy controller design include the determination of the linguistic state space, definition of the membership functions of each linguistic term and the derivation of the control rules. Some of these problems can be solved by application of machine learning. First, it is desirable to simplify and automate the specification of linguistic rules. Secondly, it is also desirable that modifications of control rules are possible in order to cope with peviously unknown, or changes in process dynamics. Machine learning methods have in recent years emerged from the use of learning algorithms modelled on natural and biological systems. These methods represent a means to abstract the advanced mechanisms of learning exhibited by such systems, which can, consequently, be applied to intelligent control. One of these new algorithms is the genetic algorithm which is modelled on the processes of natural evolution. This paper develops the application of online genetic algorithm techniques for fuzzy adaptive control. It is shown that although GA like other search techniques would not, in general, be suitable for real-time control their application is feasible within the structure of an adaptive fuzzy controller. Genetic algorithms are used to automate the acquisition of control rules and introduce objective criteria in the modification. Simulation show that satisfactory control of a nonlinear process is obtained using only very 'weak' feedback signals.

J	HO, TB				HO, TB			AN APPROACH TO CONCEPT-FORMATION BASED ON FORMAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						MACHINE LEARNING; CONCEPT FORMATION; FORMAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS; CONCEPT LATTICE; CONCEPT HIERARCHY		Computational approaches to concept formation often share a top-down, incremental, hill-climbing classification, and differ from each other in the concept representation and quality criteria. Each of them captures part of the rich variety of conceptual knowledge and many are well suited only when the object-attribute distribution is not sparse. Formal concept analysis is a set-theoretic model that mathematically formulates the human understanding of concepts, and investigates the algebraic structure, Galois lattice, of possible concepts in a given domain. Adopting the idea of representing concepts by mutual closed sets of objects and attributes as well as the Galois lattice structure for concepts from formal concept analysis, we propose an approach to concept formation and develop OSHAM, a method that forms concept hierarchies with high utility score, clear semantics and effective even with sparse object-attribute distributions. In this paper we describe OSHAM, and in an attempt to show its performance we present experimental studies on a number of data sets from the machine learning literature.

Accessing this knowledge base will allow the selection of process parameters for a given machining operation on a specific machine tool based on the desired evaluation criteria, Determining the process parameters in this manner can then replace less accurate methods such as reading process parameters from machining tables. The learning algorithm considered in this study uses an artificial neural-network structure to accomplish the mapping of the process parameters to the evaluation criteria. Learning is achieved by the exposure of the algorithm to training data. Training and testing data were obtained from simulations of an orthogonal cutting operation on a lathe, Neural networks prove to be an excellent tool and very suitable for this application.

These simple inductive learning systems for producing general rules from a collection of examples have a number of advantages over well known induction schemes. The immediate predecessor of RULES-3 had the following features: it could handle large sets of examples without having to break them up into smaller subsets, produced rules containing only relevant conditions, allowed a degree of control over the number of rules extracted, and could be applied to problems involving incomplete examples and objects with numerical attributes. RULES-S has two new features: it generates a compact set of more general rules and provides the user with the option of adjusting the precision of the extracted rules. The paper gives an example to illustrate the operation of the algorithm step by step and presents the results of evaluating it against its predecessor on the IRIS data classification problem.

We describe the process of machine learning in terms of the various events that happen on a given trial, including the crucial association of words with internal representations of their meaning. Of central importance in learning is the generalization from utterances to grammatical forms. Our system derives a comprehension grammar for a superset of a natural language from pairs of verbal stimuli like Go to the screw! and corresponding internal representations of coerced actions. For the derivation of a grammar no knowledge of the language to be learned is assumed but only knowledge of an internal language. We present grammars for English, Chinese, and German generated from a finite sample of about 500 commands that are roughly equivalent across the three languages. All of the three grammars, which are context-free in form, accept an infinite set of commands in the given language.

We have increased breast FNA accuracy by coupling digital image analysis methods with machine learning techniques. Additionally, our mathematical approach captures nuclear features (''grade'') that are prognostically more accurate than are estimates based on tumor size and lymph node status. An interactive computer system evaluates, diagnoses and determines prognosis based on nuclear features derived directly from a digital scan of FNA slides. A consecutive series of 569 patients provided the data for the diagnostic study. A 166-patient subset provided the data for the prognostic study. An additional 75 consecutive, new patients provided samples to test the diagnostic system. The projected prospective accuracy of the diagnostic system was estimated to be 97% by 10-fold cross-validation, and the actual accuracy on 75 new samples runs 100%. The projected prospective accuracy of the prognostic system was estimated to be 86% by leave-one-out testing.

Emergent computation is significantly different from the ''classic'' computational paradigm, where control is top-down and centralized. In emergent systems, overall system dynamics emerge from the local interactions of independent agents. In such systems, overall global control is minimized or eliminated altogether. Applications in ecosystem management include use of ''artificial ecosystems'' as surrogate experimental systems, and genetics-based machine learning systems to evolve management rule-sets for complex domains. Cellular automata, neural networks, genetic algorithms and classifier systems are discussed as examples of the emergent approach. Finally, an in-depth literature review of artificial ecosystems is provided.		OLSON, RL (reprint author), USDA ARS,POB 5367,MISSISSIPPI STATE,MS 39762, USA.

J	CHEN, HC				CHEN, HC			MACHINE LEARNING FOR INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL - NEURAL NETWORKS, SYMBOLIC LEARNING, AND GENETIC ALGORITHMS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Review							DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; EXPERT SYSTEMS; CONNECTIONIST; DESIGN; SEARCH; DATABASES; MODELS	Information retrieval using probabilistic techniques has attracted significant attention on the part of researchers in information and computer science over the past few decades. In the 1980s, knowledge-based techniques also made an impressive contribution to ''intelligent'' information retrieval and indexing. More recently, information science researchers have turned to other newer artificial-intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. These newer techniques, which are grounded on diverse paradigms, have provided great opportunities for researchers to enhance the information processing and retrieval capabilities of current information storage and retrieval systems. In this article, we first provide an overview of these newer techniques and their use in information science research. To familiarize readers with these techniques, we present three popular methods: the connectionist Hopfield network; the symbolic ID3/ID5R; and evolution-based genetic algorithms. We discuss their knowledge representations and algorithms in the context of information retrieval. Sample implementation and testing results from our own research are also provided for each technique. We believe these techniques are promising in their ability to analyze user queries, identify users' information needs, and suggest alternatives for search. With proper user-system interactions, these methods can greatly complement the prevailing full-text, keyword-based, probabilistic, and knowledge-based techniques.

J	BENDAVID, A				BENDAVID, A			MONOTONICITY MAINTENANCE IN INFORMATION-THEORETIC MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						INFORMATION THEORY; MONOTONIC DECISION TREES; CONSISTENCY; ACCURACY; MONOTONIC CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS	KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR	Decision trees that are based on information-theory are useful paradigms for learning from examples. However, in some real-world applications, known information-theoretic methods frequently generate non-monotonic decision trees, in which objects with better attribute values are sometimes classified to lower classes than objects with inferior values. This property is undesirable for problem solving in many application domains, such as credit scoring and insurance premium determination, where monotonicity of subsequent classifications is important. An attribute-selection metric is proposed here that takes both the error as well as monotonicity into account while building decision trees. The metric is empirically shown capable of significantly reducing the degree of non-monotonicity of decision trees without sacrificing their inductive accuracy.

J	LIN, CT				LIN, CT			A NEURAL FUZZY CONTROL-SYSTEM WITH STRUCTURE AND PARAMETER LEARNING	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						NEURAL NETWORKS; CONNECTIONIST; FUZZY CONTROL; FUZZY PREDICTOR; GRADIENT DESCENT; SUPERVISED UNSUPERVISED LEARNING; REINFORCEMENT LEARNING	LOGIC CONTROLLERS	A general connectionist model, called neural fuzzy control network (NFCN), is proposed for the realization of a fuzzy logic control system. The proposed NFCN is a feedforward multilayered network which integrates the basic elements and functions of a traditional fuzzy logic controller into a connectionist structure which has distributed learning abilities. The NFCN can be constructed from supervised training examples by machine learning techniques, and the connectionist structure can be trained to develop fuzzy logic rules and find membership functions. Associated with the NFCN is a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm which utilizes unsupervised learning schemes for structure learning and the backpropagation learning scheme for parameter learning. By combining both unsupervised and supervised learning schemes, the learning speed converges much faster than the original backpropagation algorithm. The two-phase hybrid learning algorithm requires exact supervised training data for learning. In some real-time applications, exact training data may be expensive or even impossible to obtain. To solve this problem, a reinforcement neural fuzzy control network (RNFCN) is further proposed. The RNFCN is constructed by integrating two NFCNs, one functioning as a fuzzy predictor and the other as a fuzzy controller. By combining a proposed on-line supervised structure-parameter learning technique, the temporal difference prediction method, and the stochastic exploratory algorithm, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, which can construct a RNFCN automatically and dynamically through a reward-penalty signal (i.e., ''good' or ''bad'' signal), Two examples are presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed models and learning algorithms.

Knowledge acquisition techniques are used to delineate a problem class hierarchy for complex real-world planning tasks. This hierarchy is stepwise formalized into a KL-ONE-like representation. Explanation-based abstraction is then applied to previously solved cas es, and procedure schemata are constructed for the different problem classes. COEx is a type of apprenticeship learning system where reversed engineering is applied to success cases from the real world. An evaluation of this unification reveals its conceptual soundness and several technical problems.

A QSAR generalizes how the structure (shape) of a compound relates to its biological activity. A comparative study was carried out of six artificial intelligence and traditional algorithms for modeling QSAR's: GOLEM, CART, and M5 from symbolic machine learning; back-propagation from neural networks; and linear regression and nearest-neighbor from traditional statistics. Two test case problems were studied: the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by pyrimidines, and the inhibition of rat/mouse tumor DHFR by triazines. ft was found that there was no significant statistical difference between the methods in terms of their ability to rank unseen compounds by activity. However, symbolic machine learning methods, in particular relational ones, were found to generate rules that provided insight into the stereochemistry of compound receptor interactions.

It also details a way of developing Intelligent systems. These systems are expected to be a new methodology for solving difficult judgments where hardware limits on the power system become more strict for the various constraints. To deal with this circumstance, various technologies called 'intelligent' are researched and applied to the power system area. Rule-based, machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy and genetic algorithms are introduced as major technologies. In the stage of development, it is essential to make clear what is to be solved. Two case studies namely, load forecasting and facility monitoring are introduced as examples of development. The model of cooperation between utility and manufacturer is also explained.

J	Zhang, BT; Muhlenbein, H				Zhang, Byoung-Tak; Muehlenbein, Heinz			Balancing Accuracy and Parsimony in Genetic Programming	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						machine learning; tree induction; genetic programming; minimum description length principle; Bayesian model comparison; evolving neural networks		Genetic programming is distinguished from other evolutionary algorithms in that it uses tree representations of variable size instead of linear strings of fixed length. The flexible representation scheme is very important because it allows the underlying structure of the data to be discovered automatically. One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this article we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks.

SHAPES incorporates new machine-learning algorithms, capable of automatically acquiring heuristic-search guidance, alleviating the need for heuristics to be manually provided to the original scheduling algorithm. Further enhancements have also been introduced in the new system, through the use of best-first search to explore the problem space instead of depth-first search. The paper reports on the development of SHAPES, and application studies which have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of its learning subsystem in improving search efficiency, as well as the performance of the new system in relation to the original scheduling algorithm.

Knowledge level description is a proposal that emphasizes the knowledge content and usage and abstracts away implementation details. Analyzing six different EEL methods at the knowledge level it can be shown what is their shared structure and illuminates their differences in a common framework of description. To describe EEL we use the Components of Expertise (Steels 1991), a knowledge level methodology currently used to describe, analyze, and support the development of expert systems.

J	SRINIVASAN, K; FISHER, D				SRINIVASAN, K; FISHER, D			MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES TO ESTIMATING SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT EFFORT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT; MACHINE LEARNING; DECISION TREES; REGRESSION TREES; AND NEURAL NETWORKS	CLASSIFICATION TREES; COST ESTIMATION; VALIDATION	Accurate estimation of software development effort is critical in software engineering. Underestimates lead to time pressures that may compromise full functional development and thorough testing of software. In contrast, overestimates can result in noncompetitive contract bids and/or over allocation of development resources and personnel. As a result, many models for estimating software development effort have been proposed. This article describes two methods of machine learning, which we use to build estimators of software development effort from historical data. Our experiments indicate that these techniques are competitive with traditional estimators on one dataset, but also illustrate that these methods are sensitive to the data on which they are trained. This cautionary note applies to any model-construction strategy that relies on historical data. All such models for software effort estimation should be evaluated by exploring model sensitivity on a variety of historical data.

J	BOTANA, F; BAHAMONDE, A				BOTANA, F; BAHAMONDE, A			SHAPE - A MACHINE LEARNING-SYSTEM FROM EXAMPLES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article								This paper presents a new machine learning system called SHAPE. The input data are vectors of properties (represented as attribute-value pairs) which are used to describe individual cases, examples or observations in a given world. Each case belongs to exactly one of a set of classes, and the aim is to produce a collection of decision rules concluding the class according to the properties observed. SHAPE follows three steps. First, we build up an acyclic graph capturing dependencies among the properties involved. Since we endow this net with a semantic interpretation, we are allowed to read the net as a first draft of classification rules. Secondly, we will rewrite these rules to compact their syntactic description using automata minimization techniques. Finally, the rules are generalized in order to obtain the definite intensional description of the thus learned concepts. Let us remark that the last two stages could be applied to a set of rules attached to a collection of examples coming from any other learning system. To close the paper, we also present different experiments made with SHAPE to illustrate the performance of the system in a wide range of applications.

In this paper we study the complexity of teaching by considering a variant of the on-line learning model in which a helpful teacher selects the instances. We measure the complexity of teaching a concept from a given concept class by a combinatorial measure we call the teaching dimension, Informally, the teaching dimension of a concept class is the minimum number of instances a teacher must reveal to uniquely identify any target concept chosen from the class.

This process generates spatial representations of afferent (sensory) information which strongly resemble patterns of response properties of neurons commonly called brain maps. For one of the most thoroughly studied phenomena in cortical development, the formation of topographic maps, orientation and ocular dominance columns in macaque striate cortex, the process, for example, generates the observed patterns of receptive field properties including the recently described correlations between orientation preference and ocular dominance. Competitive Hebbian learning has not only proven to be a useful concept in the understanding of development and plasticity in several brain areas, but the underlying principles have have been successfully applied to problems in machine learning [22]. The model's universality, simplicity, predictive power, and usefulness warrants a closer investigation.

J	JAIN, S				JAIN, S			ON A QUESTION ABOUT LEARNING NEARLY MINIMAL PROGRAMS	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						THEORY OF COMPUTATION; MACHINE LEARNING; INDUCTIVE INFERENCE; RECURSION THEORY; MINIMAL PROGRAMS; METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE	INDUCTIVE INFERENCE	Identification by algorithmic devices of programs for computable functions from their graphs is a well studied problem in learning theory. Freivalds and Chen consider identification of ''minimal'' and ''nearly minimal'' programs for functions from their graphs. The present paper solves the following question left open by Chen: Is it the case that for any collection of computable functions, C, such that some machine can finitely learn a nearly minimal (n + 1)-error program for every function in C, there exists another machine that can learn in the limit an n-error program (which need not be nearly minimal) for every function in C? We answer this question negatively.		JAIN, S (reprint author), NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,DEPT INFORMAT SYST & COMP SCI,SINGAPORE 0511,SINGAPORE.

In this same field, the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model presented in this paper proposes an inventive way to explore the space of states that, using the simulated ''incremental'' co-evolution of some organisms, remedies some drawbacks of these previous techniques and even allow this model to outperform them on some difficult problems. This new model has been applied to the sorting network problem, a reference problem that challenged many computer scientists, and an original one-player game named Solitaire. For the first problem, the END model has been able to build from ''scratch'' some sorting networks as good as the best known for the 16-input problem. It even improved by one comparator a 25 years old result for the 18-input problem. For the Solitaire game, END evolved a strategy comparable to a human designed strategy.

The data sets resulting from such studies are often noisy, incomplete, and difficult to envision. We have developed machine learning and visualization software to aid in the analysis, modeling, and understanding of such systems, and have applied it to the analysis of lake and stream field studies and aquatic microcosm toxicological tests. The software is based on nonmetric conceptual clustering, which attempts to group the data into clusters that are strongly associated with several measured parameters. In each case, our tools not only confirmed suspected ecological patterns, but also revealed aspects of the data that were unnoticed by ecologists using conventional statistical techniques. Machine learning tools should, accordingly, become a standard part of the ecologist's armamentarium.

We describe autonomous systems, which observe the outside world and try to generate programs which reproduce the observed data. Methods for generation of new programs are enumeration as well as mutation and combination of old programs. We describe two criteria for judging the quality of a program. We can judge a program to be good if it is short and describes a large body of input data. With this criterion we show that a system can learn to evaluate arithmetic expressions in polish notation. But we can also judge a program to be good if it allows to compress the total length of descriptions of all observations so far. By the latter criterion a system can create tests which can be used e.g. to partition the programs found so far into directories. Keywords: Genetic algorithms, machine learning.

They have the advantage to give an explanation of a diagnosis. But a main problem when dealing with Knowledge-Based Systems is the acquisition of knowledge. Artificial Neural Networks deal with knowledge in a subsymbolic form. Incomplete and imprecise data can be processed by approximating not linear relations in data In a laboratory or medical system the integration of the neural network system into the decision making process may be required. We realised this by building a hybrid system consisting, first, of graphical visualisation methods and second, a machine learning module generating rules out of the neural network. The rules are presented in a form, which can be understood by humans and used in Knowledge-Based Systems.

J	Li, M; Vitanyi, P				Li, M; Vitanyi, P			Computational machine learning in theory and praxis	COMPUTER SCIENCE TODAY	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article							COMPLEXITY	In the last few decades a computational approach to machine learning has emerged based on paradigms from recursion theory and the theory of computation. Such ideas include learning in the limit, learning by enumeration, and probably approximately correct (pac) learning. These models usually are not suitable in practical situations. In contrast, statistics based inference methods have enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Currently, Bayesian reasoning in various forms,minimum message length (MML) and minimum description length (MDL), are widely applied approaches. They are the tools to use with particular machine learning praxis such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, genetic programming, artificial neural networks, and the like. These statistical inference methods select the hypothesis which minimizes the sum of the length of the description of the hypothesis (also called 'model') and the length of the description of the data relative to the hypothesis. It appears to us that the future of computational machine learning will include combinations of the approaches above coupled with guaranties with respect to used time and memory resources. Computational learning theory will move closer to practice and the application of the principles such as MDL require further justification. Here, we survey some of the actors in this dichotomy between theory and praxis, we justify MDL via the Bayesian approach, and give a comparison between pac learning and MDL learning of decision trees.

The learning algorithm addressed the knowledge acquisition problem by developing and maintaining the knowledge base through inductive learning. The performance ofthe learning system is discussed in terms ofthe knowledge extracted from example cases and its classification accuracy on the test cases. Results indicate that the introduced system is a promising alternative to neural networks for fault diagnosis and a complement to expert systems.

This paper gives an efficient method for constructing a Craig interpolant from a refutation proof which involves binary resolution, paramodulation, and factoring. This method can solve the machine learning problem of discovering a first order concept from given examples. It can also be used to find sentences which distinguish pairs of nonisomorphic finite structures.		Huang, GX (reprint author), UNIV HAWAII MANOA,DEPT MATH,HONOLULU,HI 96822, USA.

Auditors, financial analysts, and regulators have shown considerable interest in evaluating and predicting these material errors. This paper describes the development and validation of a prototype expert system, ERRORXPERT, which evaluates material errors and potential fraud. This prototype system is designed to assist auditors at the planning stage in the design of subsequent substantive tests, when material errors and irregularities in the financial statements are probable. A commercial machine learning program was used for rule induction. A set of training examples comprising error and non-error firms was used to generate rules and a separate holdout sample was used to validate the expert system results. The performance of the expert system was also compared to that of a multiple discriminant analysis model using the same data. The results demonstrate that the expert system, ERRORXPERT, outperforms the discriminant model and is a powerful evaluation tool to classify firms into error and non-error categories. The size of the sample used in this study somewhat limits the generalizability of the specific rules.

In this paper we discuss the problem of identifying relevant input parameters from a set of potential input parameters. We show that sensitivity analysis applied to a trained feedforward neural network is an efficient tool for the identification of input parameters that have a significant influence on any one of the possible outcomes. We compare the results of a neural network sensitivity analysis tool with the results obtained from a machine learning algorithm,and discuss the benefits of sensitivity analysis to a neural network rule extraction algorithm.

J	YAKOWITZ, S; MAI, J				YAKOWITZ, S; MAI, J			METHODS AND THEORY FOR OFF-LINE MACHINE LEARNING	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Note							NOISE	Many problems in machine learning can be abstracted to the sequential design task of finding the minimum of an unknown erratic and possibly discontinuous function on the basis of noisy measurements. In the present work, it is presumed that there is no penalty for bad choices during the experimental stage, and at some time, not known to the decision maker, or under his control, the experimentation will be terminated, and the decision maker mill need to specify the point considered best, on the basis of the experimentation. In this note, we seek the best trade-off between i) acquiring new test points, and ii) retesting at points previously selected so as to improve the estimates of relative performance. The algorithm is shown to achieve a performance standard described herein. This decision setting would seem natural for function minimization in a simulation context or for tuning up a production process prior to putting it into service.

These methods are applied to discover meaningful knowledge from large databases, and their usefulness is ensured. However, since there has been no formal approach proposed to treat these methods, efficiency of each method is only compared empirically. In this paper, we introduce matroid theory and rough sets to construct a common framework for empirical machine learning methods which induce the combination of attribute-value pairs from databases. Combination of the concepts of rough sets and matroid theory gives us an excellent framework and enables us to understand the differences and the similarities between these methods clearly. In this paper, we compare three classical methods, AQ, Pawlak's Consistent Rules and ID3. The results show that there exists the differences in algebraic structure between the former two and the latter and that this causes the differences between AQ and ID3.

J	Smith, RE; Dike, BA				Smith, RE; Dike, BA			Learning novel fighter combat maneuver rules via genetic algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article								This paper reports on a project where a genetics-based machine learning system acquired rules for novel fighter combat maneuvers through simulation. In this project, a genetic machine learning system was implemented to generate high angle-of-attack air combat tactics for the NASA X-31 research aircraft. The Genetic Learning System (GLS), based on a learning classifier system approach, employed a digital simulation model of one on one air combat and a Genetic Algorithm to develop effective tactics for the X-31. The resulting maneuvers allowed the X-31 to successfully exploit its post-stall capabilities against a conventional fighter opponent, demonstrating the ability of the GLS to discover novel tactics in a dynamic air combat environment. Moreover, the project demonstrates how genetic machine learning can acquire rules that implement novel approaches to unforeseen problems via experience with simulations.

Recently, digital approach becomes very active. Several fully-digital VLSI chips for on-chip BP learning have been fabricated, and 2.3 GCUPS (Giga Connection Updates per Second) learning speed has been achieved. Radial basis function and Boltzmann machine learning have also been implemented in VLSI chips. Intensive researches on analog and optoelectronic neural networks have been carried out in the world. An analog VLSI neural chip attains 500 GCUPS on-chip learning speed and 20 TCPS (Tera Connections per Second) processing speed with 1 bit digital output. For the optoelectronic approach, although the network size is small, several image processing functions have been implemented in a VSPD array.

Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems.

The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, GI			OPUS: An efficient admissible algorithm for unordered search	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.		Webb, GI (reprint author), DEAKIN UNIV,SCH COMP & MATH,GEELONG,VIC 3217,AUSTRALIA.

J	IdestamAlmquist, P				IdestamAlmquist, P			Generalization of clauses under implication	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.

This paper considers the role of software in system operation, control and automation, and attempts to define intelligence. AI is characterized by its ability to deal with incomplete and imprecise information and to accumulate knowledge. Expert systems, building on standard computing techniques, depend heavily on the domain experts and knowledge engineers that have programmed them to represent the real world. Neural networks are intended to emulate the pattern-recognition and parallel processing capabilities of she human brain and are taught rather than programmed. The future may lie in a combination of the recognition ability of the neural network and the rationalization capability of the expert system. In the second part of the paper, examples are given of applications of AI in stand-alone systems for knowledge engineering and medical diagnosis and in embedded systems for failure detection, image analysis, user interfacing, natural language processing, robotics and machine learning, as related to clinical laboratories. It is concluded that AI constitutes a collective form of intellectual property, and that there is a need for better documentation, evaluation and regulation of the systems already being used in clinical laboratories.

Information retrieval (IR) technologies traditionally avoid all of these issues by defining a document in terms of a statistical profile of its lexical items. The IR community is willing to exploit a superficial type of knowledge found in dictionaries and thesaurae, but anything that requires customization, application-specific engineering, or any amount of manual tinkering is thought to be incompatible with practical cost-effective system designs. In this paper those assumptions are challenged and it is shown how machine learning techniques can operate as an effective method for automated knowledge acquisition when it is applied to a representative training corpus, and leveraged against a few hours of routine work by a domain expert. A fully implemented text classification system operating on a medical testbed is described and experimental results based on that testbed are reported.

The ultimate goal of the research discussed in this paper is to develop a comparehensive monitor and control (M&C) system that can substitute for the expert machinist and perform certain critical in-process tasks to assure quality production. The M&C system must reliably recognize and respond to qualitatively different behaviours of the machine tool, learn new behaviors, respond faster than its human counterpart to quality threatening circumstances, and interface with an existing controller. The research considers a series of face-milling anomalies that were subsequently simulated and used as a first step towards establishing the feasibility of employing machine learning as an integral component of the intelligent controller. We address the question of feasibility in two steps. First, it is important to know if the process models (dull tool, broken tool, etc.) can be learned (model learning). And second, if the models are learned, can an algorithm reliably select an appropriate model (distinguish between dull and broken tools) based on input from the model learner and from the sensors (model selection). The results of the simulation-based tests demonstrate that the milling-process anomalies can be teamed, and the appropriate model can be reliably selected. Such a model can be subsequently utilized to make compensating in-process machine-tool adjustments. In addition, we observed that the learning curve need not approach the 100% level to be functional.

Humans learn the general structure of a domain while solving particular learning problems in it. Another dimension concerns the solver's goals and subgoals. Finding good decompositions is a major AI tactic both for defusing the combinatorial explosion and for ensuring a transparent end-product. In machine learning, pre-occupation with free-standing performance has led to comparative neglect of this resource, illustrated under the following headings. 1. Automatic manufacture of new attributes from primitives (''constructive induction''). 2. Machine learning within goal-subgoal hierarchies (''structured induction''). 3.

Decision tables are one of the simplest hypothesis spaces possible, and usually they are easy to understand. Experimental results show that on artificial and real-world domains containing only discrete features, IDTM, an algorithm inducing decision tables, can sometimes outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as C4.5. Surprisingly, performance is quite good on some datasets with continuous features, indicating that many datasets used in machine learning either do not require these features, or that these features have few values. We also describe an incremental method for performing cross-validation that is applicable to incremental learning algorithms including IDTM. Using incremental cross-validation, it is possible to cross-validate a given dataset and IDTM in time that is linear in the number of instances, the number of features, and the number of label values. The time for incremental cross-validation is independent of the number of folds chosen, hence leave-one-out cross-validation and ten-fold cross-validation take the same time.

J	Reich, Y; Travitzky, N				Reich, Y; Travitzky, N			Machine learning of material behaviour knowledge from empirical data	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						symbolic machine learning; information modelling; modelling material behaviour; corrosion		Symbolic machine learning techniques can extract flexible and comprehensible knowledge from empirical data of material behaviour. The diversity of symbolic machine learning techniques offers potential to match the requirements of many tasks when models of material behaviour need to be created from data. We develop a series of steps for generating material behaviour knowledge from empirical data and exemplify some of them on several small datasets. We discuss some of the issues that govern knowledge extraction and, as a by-product, demonstrate that symbolic learning techniques are functionally superior to sub-symbolic learning for the task of comprehensible knowledge extraction.

Totally computerized patient records are not yet widely used but a large part of essential information is already stored on computer files. These include laboratory test results, diagnoses, codes for operations, codes of histopathological diagnoses and maybe even the patient's medication. Accordingly, these databases include much clinical knowledge that would be useful for clinicians. Laboratories try to support clinicians by producing reference values for laboratory tests. It is, of course, necessary information but, however, it does not give very much information about the weight of evidence that an abnormal laboratory test will give in special clinical settings. We have developed a software package - DiagaiD - in order to build a smart link between patient databases and clinicians. It utilizes neural network-based machine learning techniques and can produce decision support which meets the special needs of clinicians. From example cases it can learn clinically relevant transformations from original numeric values to logical values. By using data transformation together with a single layer perceptron it is possible to build nonlinear models from a set of preclassified example cases. In this paper, we use two small datasets to show how this scheme works in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Results are compared with those obtained using logistic regression or backpropagation neural networks. The performance of our neuro-fuzzy tool seemed to be slightly better in these two materials but the differences did not reach statistical significance.

The algorithm relies on a bottom-up strategy, from particular to general, feature less common that the usual top-down strategy founded in a great number of induction tools. We introduce a method for finding the values of the basic probability assignment according to Theory of Evidence, called probabilistic mass. With this notion, we propose a generalisation of the algorithm capable of handle noisy data.

J	Webb, GI; Kuzmycz, M				Webb, GI; Kuzmycz, M			Feature based modelling: A methodology for producing coherent, consistent, dynamically changing models of agents' competencies	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						student modelling; machine learning; modelling competency	ALGEBRA	Feature Based Modelling uses attribute value machine learning techniques to model an agent's competency. This is achieved by creating a model describing the relationships between the features of the agent's actions and of the contexts in which those actions are performed. This paper describes techniques that have been developed for creating these models and for extracting key information therefrom. An overview is provided of previous studies that have evaluated the application of Feature Based Modelling in a number of educational contexts including piano keyboard playing, the unification of Prolog terms and elementary subtraction. These studies have demonstrated that the approach is applicable to a wide spectrum of domains. Classroom use has demonstrated the low computational overheads of the technique. A new study of the application of the approach to modelling elementary subtraction skills is presented. The approach demonstrates accuracy in excess of 90% when predicting student solutions. It also demonstrates the ability to identify and model student's buggy arithmetic procedures.		Webb, GI (reprint author), DEAKIN UNIV, SCH COMP & MATH, GEELONG, VIC 3217, AUSTRALIA.

J	DAVEY, SM; STOCKWELL, DRB; PETERS, DG				DAVEY, SM; STOCKWELL, DRB; PETERS, DG			MANAGING BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WITH INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	AI APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Management of biological diversity is an integral component of ecologically sustainable development and the international Convention on Biological Diversity. To manage biological diversity, government agencies must be able to locate diverse sources of information quickly and interpret these data intelligently. Advanced information management systems (e.g., machine learning and ''intelligent'' systems) can help governments do this. We developed an information strategy for management of biological diversity, using Australian forest systems as a case study. We used an advanced technology framework (open system architecture) supporting development and upgrading of information management facilities, access to electronic data through computer networks and information management systems, and agreed-upon information standards. Such an information environment must be relatively friendly for end users of the information, such as land-use decision and policy makers and resource managers. Our seven-layered open work-flow model integrates a number of intelligent information systems to help scientists provide timely and comprehensive advice on biological diversity. The model supplies a conceptual basis for the evolution of biology diversity information systems.

This paper considers the role of software in system operation, control and automation and attempts to define intelligence. AI is characterized by its ability to deal with incomplete and imprecise information and to accumulate knowledge. Expert systems, building on standard computing techniques, depend heavily on the domain experts and knowledge engineers that have programmed them to represent the real world. Neural networks are intended to emulate the pattern-recognition and parallel-processing capabilities of the human brain and are taught rather than programmed. The future may lie in a combination of the recognition ability of the neural network and the rationalization capability of the expert system. In the second part of this paper, examples are given of applications of AI in stand-alone systems for knowledge engineering and medical diagnosis and in embedded systems for failure detection, image analysis, user interfacing, natural language processing, robotics and machine learning, as related to clinical laboratories. It is concluded that AI constitutes a collective form of intellectual property and that there is a need for better documentation, evaluation and regulation of the systems already being used widely in clinical laboratories.

J	FAMILI, A				FAMILI, A			USE OF DECISION-TREE INDUCTION FOR PROCESS OPTIMIZATION AND KNOWLEDGE REFINEMENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL-PROCESS	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						DECISION-TREE INDUCTION; PROCESS OPTIMIZATION	SYSTEMS	Development of expert systems involves knowledge acquisition that can be supported by applying machine learning techniques. The basic idea of using decision-tree induction in process optimization and development of the domain model of electrochemical machining (ECM) is presented. How decision-tree induction is used to build and refine the knowledge base of the process is also discussed. The idea of developing an intelligent supervisory system with a learning component [Intelligent MAnufacturing FOreman (IMAFO)] that is already implemented is briefly introduced. The results of applying IMAFO for analyzing data from the ECM process are presented. How the domain model of the process (electrochemical machining) is built from the initial known information, and how the results of decision-tree induction can be used to optimize the model of the process and further refine the knowledge base are shown. Two examples are given to demonstrate how new rules (to be included in the knowledge base of an expert system) are generated from the rules induced by IMAFO. The procedure to refine these types of rules is also explained.

We present a novel technique, Compass, that removes a major obstacle to accurate prediction by automatically selecting conformations and alignments of molecules without the benefit of a characterized active site. The technique combines explicit representation of molecular shape with neural network learning methods to produce highly predictive models, even across chemically distinct classes of molecules. We apply the method to predicting human perception of musk odor and show how the resulting models can provide graphical guidance for chemical modifications.

Some problems and requirements resulting from industrial-caliber tasks are formulated. A step-by-step account of the construction of a knowledge base for such a task demonstrates how the interleaved use of several learning algorithms in concert with an inference engine and a graphical interface can fulfill those requirements. Design, analysis, revision, refinement and extension of a working model are combined in one incremental process. This illustrates the balanced cooperative modelling approach. The case study is taken from the telecommunications domain and more precisely deals with security management in telecommunications networks. MOBAL would be used as part of a security management tool for acquiring, validating and refining a security policy. The modeling approach is compared with other approaches, such as KADS and stand-alone machine learning.

J	TWARDOWSKI, K				TWARDOWSKI, K			AN ASSOCIATIVE ARCHITECTURE FOR GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED MACHINE LEARNING	COMPUTER			English	Article							PROCESSOR; SYSTEMS	In the realm of machine-based learning, system architects seek to design machines with ever-greater levels of human-like autonomy and intelligence. Recent advances in massively parallel computing, coupled with massively parallel artificial intelligence, may one day lead to vast computational resources that will offer new solutions to problems in autonomous agents, database mining, speech processing and translation, adaptive vision systems, visualization systems, and animation. In this article, the author presents his investigation of a Learning Classifier System that he developed, through modeling and simulation, based on hybrid AI algorithms computationally matched to a specialized associative architecture he designed. A key characteristic of Learning Classifier Systems is that they have intense computational requirements, often in the form of highly repetitive yet simple search operations, which is why an associative architecture was selected. The proposed architecture couples a 64-bit content-addressable memory with a very basic 1-bit processing element and includes a reconfigurable bus under the autonomous control of each PE. In the programming model for mapping parallel data onto the architecture, groups of physical PEs are organized as single logical PEs to provide a flexible means of meeting varied memory requirements. A simulator for the associative architecture and LCS algorithms was built with a MasPar MP-1 system that consisted of 8,192 4-bit processors. The LCS implementation was tested on a difficult letter prediction problem that challenged the adaptive abilities of the LCS. The article addresses the successful outcome and evaluates the performance of the algorithm simulations.		TWARDOWSKI, K (reprint author), LORAL FED SYST,1801 STATE RT 17C,OSWEGO,NY 13827, USA.

A novel class of neural networks is proposed to articulate the knowledge it learned from a set of examples. It provides an appealing solution to the problem of knowledge acquisition. After training, the knowledge embedded in the numerical weights of trained neural networks can be easily extracted and represented in the form of production rules, The approach is demonstrated by an example of a hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of diabetes.

J	WOOLERY, LK; GRZYMALABUSSE, J				WOOLERY, LK; GRZYMALABUSSE, J			MACHINE LEARNING FOR AN EXPERT-SYSTEM TO PREDICT PRETERM BIRTH RISK	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Objective: Develop a prototype expert system for preterm birth risk assessment of pregnant women, Normal gestation involves a term of 40 weeks, but because 8-12% of the newborns in the United States are delivered prior to 37 weeks' gestation, problems associated with prematurity continue to plague individuals, families, and the health care system. Design: A knowledge-base development methodology used machine learning, statistical analysis, and validation techniques to analyze three large datasets (18,890 subjects and 214 variables). The dependent (i.e., decision) variable studied was weeks of gestation at delivery, with dichotomous coding of preterm delivery (prior to 37 weeks) and full-term delivery (37+ weeks). Results: Machine learning with a program named Learning from Examples using Rough Sets (LERS) induced 520 usable rules that were entered into a prototype expert system. The prototype expert system was 53-88% accurate in predicting preterm delivery for 9,419 patients. Conclusion: The prototype expert system was more accurate than traditional manual techniques in predicting preterm birth.

It is shown that classes of formulas that are efficiently learnable from only positive examples or only negative examples have certain closure properties. A new substitution technique is used to show that in the distribution-free case learning DNF (disjunctive normal form formulas) is no harder than learning monotone DNF. We prove that monomials cannot be efficiently learned from negative examples alone, even if the negative examples are uniformly distributed. It is also shown that, if the examples are drawn from uniform distributions, then the class of DNF in which each variable occurs at most once is efficiently learnable, while the class of all monotone Boolean functions is efficiently weakly learnable (i.e., individual examples are correctly classified with a probability larger than 1/2 + 1/p, where p is a polynomial in the relevant parameters of the learning problem). We then show an equivalence between the notion of weak learning and the notion of group learning, where a group of examples of polynomial size, either all positive or all negative, must be correctly classified with high probability.

The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables.

Rules (constraints) were determined for four features of beta-sheet packing: (i) whether a beta-strand is at an edge; (ii) whether two consecutive beta-strands pack parallel or anti-parallel; (iii) whether two beta-strands pack adjacently; and (iv) the winding direction of two consecutive beta-strands. Rules were found with high predictive accuracy and coverage. The errors were generally associated with complications in domain folds, especially in one doubly wound domains. Investigation of the rules revealed interesting patterns, some of which were known previously, others that are novel. Novel features include (i) the relationship between pairs of sequential strands is in general one of decreasing size; (ii) more sequential pairs of strands wind in the direction out than in; and (iii) it takes a larger alteration in hydrophobicity to change a strand from winding in the direction out than in. These patterns in the data may be the result of folding pathways in the domains. The rules found are of predictive value and could be used in the combinatorial prediction of protein structure, or as a general test of model structures, e.g. those produced by threading. We conclude that machine learning has a useful role in the analysis of protein structures.

J	GODIN, R; MISSAOUI, R				GODIN, R; MISSAOUI, R			AN INCREMENTAL CONCEPT-FORMATION APPROACH FOR LEARNING FROM DATABASES	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article							LATTICE	This paper describes a concept formation approach to the discovery of new concepts and implication rules from data. This machine learning approach is based on the Galois lattice theory, and starts from a binary relation between a set of objects and a set of properties (descriptors) to build a concept lattice and a set of rules. Each node (concept) of the lattice represents a subset of objects with their common properties. In this paper, some efficient algorithms for generating concepts and rules are presented. The rules are either in conjunctive or disjunctive form. To avoid the repetitive process of constructing the concept lattice and determining the set of implication rules from scratch each time a new object is introduced in the input relation, we propose an algorithm for incrementally updating both the lattice and the set of generated rules. The empirical behavior of the algorithms is also analysed. The implication problem for these rules can be handled based on the well-known theoretical results on functional dependencies in relational databases.

Although very useful, it cannot evolve automatically with advances in technology and expert knowledge. To address this problem, we have designed an inductive learning system (MEA) that uses rules or preclassified examples in order to incrementally build production rules. These rules are of the following form: if description of the fault double right arrow repair and can be used by KEE (knowledge engineering environment), an expert system generator. Both MEA and SERF use a representation based on structured objects. In this paper some aspects of MEA will be described, and the way MEA can extend and/or improve the iterative dichotomizer 3 (ID3) algorithm will be explained. MEA has been tested on a real-life application concerning the repairing of helicopter blades. Results show that it is efficient, simple to use, and helpful to the expert.

J	KJELLIN, H; BOMAN, M				KJELLIN, H; BOMAN, M			FIELDED MACHINE LEARNING-SYSTEM FOR VOCATIONAL COUNSELING	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								A fielded machine learning system for vocational counselling is presented in which learning is based on adjustments of weights on links in a network. The system exemplifies how a specific representation, consisting of weights assigned to associations between keywords, enables the effective use of machine learning algorithms for acquiring and continually refining domain knowledge. The representation is designed for coping with the types of knowledge that can be found in weak theory domains, that is, knowledge too difficult to formalize because it is incomplete or vague. Knowledge acquisition and knowledge refinement processes are automated in order to efficiently decrease the effect of unreliable knowledge caused by unknown or unspecified biases inherent in the knowledge sources. The knowledge acquisition algorithms presented here are capable of coping with incomplete and vaguely defined domain knowledge. The knowledge refinement algorithms are used on-line to enable a continuous refinement of ill-defined domain knowledge.

J	VENTURINI, G				VENTURINI, G			ANALYZING FRENCH JUSTICE WITH A GENETIC-BASED INDUCTIVE ALGORITHM	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								This paper describes a genetic learning system called SIA, which learns rules from a set of pre-classified examples where many attribute values are missing or have ''don't care'' or undefined values. SIA was motivated by a data analysis task in the French justice domain and by the fact that the general machine learning methods used to deal with unknown values are not appropriate for this task. SIA is somewhat similar to the AQ algorithm because it takes an example as a seed and generalizes it (here, using a genetic process) to find a rule maximizing a rule evaluation criterion. Two mechanisms are used to deal efficiently with unknown values: the dropping of the unknown attributes in the seed example and a restricted matching operator that prevents matching with unknown values. SIA is comparable to AQ and other algorithms on two standard learning casks and can help understanding of the French justice domain.

This integration can be supported by a system that can manage linking between rules, representing experts or textbook or theoretical knowledge and facts (or data), representing cases from practice. Conflicts between rules and real-world cases can have diverse causes. Case data can be noisy or inconsistent or both. We use rules to filter cases and confine noise or inconsistency. However, rules can be overly general and can classify more cases than intended. Then machine learning can be used to find additional restrictions for the rules. If, however, no significant similarities can be determined between the misclassified cases, we seek additional expert input to support effective implementation of learning tools. Using a case subset, we capture expert input and formulate a set of ''enriched'' cases. We then use the enriched cases to learn additional rules and to introduce practical features to validate and refine the original rule base. In this paper, we discuss the role of machine learning as a vehicle for supporting rule and data validation. We demonstrate our results by an application of the MOBAL system to a real-world medical domain.

J	NEDELLEC, C; CORREIA, J; FERREIRA, JL; COSTA, E				NEDELLEC, C; CORREIA, J; FERREIRA, JL; COSTA, E			MACHINE LEARNING GOES TO THE BANK	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								This paper describes how the APT system has been applied to loan analysis to generalize and refine the knowledge previously used by an expert system, in order to increase the efficiency and the compactness of the decision rule base. The decision to lend money to industrial companies is a complex and risky activity for financial institutions. They need much expertise to deal with the large amount of information that has to be considered for this process, and the analysis must be carefully done in order to avoid misjudgments that would result in severe losses of unrecoverable credit. An expert system named SPAC had been developed to deal with this task without fulfilling the user's expectations. This paper presents the drawbacks of SPAC's approach and how APT, an integrated machine learning system, has been used to acquire and refine domain knowledge and general decision rules from basic descriptions of cases provided by SPAC. The learning methodology is detailed, and a complete example of a learning session with APT is given. The final results are then compared with those obtained with SPAC.

The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source. By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources. KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques. It maps problem-specific ''domain theories'', represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation. KBANN is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology. Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by KBANN generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.

These large data sets typically describe different states of a system and are difficult to interpret because there is no obvious way of abstracting and presenting data features in a meaningful way for a human observer. Data mining is a term which has recently become popular to describe techniques for the exploration and exploitation of data. In particular, a large part of data mining involves the visualisation of data and subsequent utilisation of machine-learning techniques for classification of data. This paper describes some techniques for data visualisation which enable the user to enhance understanding of the structure and properties of (often multidimensional) data prior to applying machine-learning techniques for further analysis and exploration.

J	DONALD, JH				DONALD, JH			RULE INDUCTION - MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES	COMPUTING & CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								With artifical neural networks (ANN) now approaching the exploitable stage and their use being promoted under the DTI's Neural Computing: Learning Solutions Campaign, it is an appropriate time to consider an alternative set of machine learning techniques in which production rules are generated from sets of data. The techniques used in rule induction offer a powerful alternative approach to ANN but, since both deal in essence with the production of a classifier from a set of example data, it is not surprising that both are being successfully applied to the same types of problems. In turn, the drawbacks of each of the methods are similar although practitioners of each approach will argue that their method has advantages over the other. Much is currently being heard about the benefits of ANN, and this article is intended to redress the balance in a small way by describing rule induction techniques and how they can be applied. Inevitably some advantages over ANN will be identified but it is expected that the ANN community will have adequate answers to any criticism.								Brieman L., 1984, CLASSIFICATION REGRE; Quinlan J.

Heuristically formulated decision algorithms and computer implemented neural networks were compared to determine their accuracy in classification of phenotypic categories. For the databases examined, decision algorithms employing very simple rules were able to properly classify mutants 80-84% of the time, based only on the amino acid sequence of the mutagenized region. Such decision algorithms did not require the formulation of any rules that involved site-to-site interactions, but rather, performed well based on the stringency of specific critical sites in the protein that accept only a restricted set of amino acids. In some cases, neural networks scored almost 10% higher than decision algorithms on the same databases (i.e., 94%). However, the success of the primitive decision algorithms and perceptrons at sorting sequences into categories suggests that linear effects predominate in the classification of a mutant's phenotype. Such methods should be generally applicable to the broad spectrum of databases that are currently being generated in combinatorial chemistry and biology experiments. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Mathematically, the perceptron learning algorithm is an iterative procedure for finding a separating hyperplane for a finite set of linearly separable vectors, or equivalently, for finding a separating hyperplane for a finite set of linearly contained vectors. In this paper, we show that the perception algorithm can be extended to a more general algorithm, called the cone algorithm, for finding a covering cone for a finite set of linearly contained vectors. A proof of the convergence of the cone algorithm is given. The relationship between the cone algorithm and other related algorithms is discussed. The equivalence of the problem of finding a covering cone for a set of linearly contained vectors and the problem of finding a solution cone for a system of homogeneous linear inequalities is established.

J	BLUM, AL				BLUM, AL			SEPARATING DISTRIBUTION-FREE AND MISTAKE-BOUND LEARNING-MODELS OVER THE BOOLEAN DOMAIN	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						MACHINE LEARNING THEORY; LEARNING MODELS; ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS		Two of the most commonly used models in computational learning theory are the distribution-free model in which examples are chosen from a fixed but arbitrary distribution, and the absolute mistake-bound model in which examples are presented in an arbitrary order. Over the Boolean domain {0, 1}(n), it is known that if the learner is allowed unlimited computational resources then any concept class learnable in one model is also learnable in the other. In addition, any polynomial-time learning algorithm for a concept class in the mistake-bound model can be transformed into one that learns the class in the distribution-free model. This paper shows that if one-way functions exist, then the mistake-bound model is strictly harder than the distribution-free model for polynomial-time learning. Specifically, given a one-way function, it is shown how to create a concept class over {0, 1}(n) that is learnable in polynomial time in the distribution-free model, but not in the absolute mistake-bound model. In addition, the concept class remains hard to learn in the mistake-bound model even if the learner is allowed a polynomial number of membership queries. The concepts considered are based upon the Goldreich. Goldwasser. and Micali random function construction [Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Micali, Journal ACM, 33 (1986), pp. 792-807] and involve creating the following new cryptographic object: an exponentially long sequence of strings sigma(1),sigma(2),..., sigma(r), over (0, 1)(n) that is hard to compute in one direction (given sigma(i) one cannot compute sigma(j) for j < i) but is easy to compute and even make random-access jumps in the other direction (given sigma(i) and j > i one can compute sigma(j), even if j is exponentially larger than i). Similar sequences considered previously [Blum, Blum, and Shub, SIAM J. Comput., 15 (1986), pp. 363-383], [Blum and Micali, SIAM J. Comput., 13 (1984), pp. 850-863] did not allow random-access jumps forward without knowledge of a seed allowing one to compute backwards as well.

Knowledge acquisition is the main bottleneck in the knowledge engineer's work. Machine-learning tools have contributed positively to the process of trying to eliminate or open up this bottleneck, but how do we know whether the field is progressing? How can we determine the progress made in any of its branches? How can we be sure of an advance and take advantage of it? This article proposes a benchmark as a classificatory, comparative, and metric criterion for machine-learning tools. The benchmark centers on the knowledge engineering viewpoint, covering some of the characteristics the knowledge engineer wants to find in a machine-learning tool.

The goal of the research is to show that using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, measurements, and some general basic knowledge about the ecosystem suffice to automatically generate better models and in less time than is the case by traditional construction of models. Namely, advanced techniques of AI are able to identify and model a system that we do not understand yet. The methodology of the approach is presented and illustrated by an example of a successfully constructed model in the field of medicine. Subsequently some encouraging results were obtained in the field of ecology and related sciences.

J	KOWALCZYK, A; FERRA, HL				KOWALCZYK, A; FERRA, HL			DEVELOPING HIGHER-ORDER NETWORKS WITH EMPIRICALLY SELECTED UNITS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES	The paper introduces a class of simple polynomial neural network classifiers, called mask perceptrons. A series of algorithms for practical development of such structures is outlined. It relies on ordering of input attributes with respect to their potential usefulness and heuristic driven generation and selection of hidden units (monomial terms) in order to combat the exponential explosion in the number of higher-order monomial terms to choose from. Results of tests for two popular machine learning benchmarking domains (mushroom classification and faulty LED-display), and for two nonstandard domains (spoken digit recognition and article category determination) are given. All results are compared against a number of other classifiers. A procedure for converting a mask perceptron to a classical logic production rule is outlined and shown to produce a number of 100% percent accurate simple rules after training on 6-20% of a database.

The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designed to maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In many applications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises for nonparametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specific cost functions. This correspondence reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithm for inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered to induce decision trees that minimize arbitrary misclassification cost functions (MCF's). Demonstrations of pixel classification in outdoor scenes show how MCF's can optimize the performance of embedded classifiers within the context of larger image understanding systems.

The system incorporates unsupervised and supervised learning via statistical machine learning and rule-based neural networks, respectively. The textured input is represented in the frequency-orientation space via a log-Gabor pyramidal decomposition. In the unsupervised learning stage a statistical clustering scheme is used for the quantization of the feature-vector attributes. A supervised stage follows in which labeling of the textured map is achieved using a rule-based network. Simulation results for the texture classification task are given. An application of the system to real-world problems is demonstrated.

The present work is an attempt to demonstrate their effectiveness to search a global optimal solution to select a decision boundary for a pattern recognition problem using a multilayer perceptron. The proposed method incorporates a new concept of nonlinear selection for creating mating pools and a weighted error as a fitness function. Since there is no need for the backpropagation technique, the algorithm is computationally efficient and avoids all the drawbacks of the backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, it does not depend on the sequence of the training data. The performance of the method along with the convergence has been experimentally demonstrated for both linearly separable and nonseparable pattern classes.

J	DONOHO, SK; WILKINS, DC				DONOHO, SK; WILKINS, DC			USING APPRENTICESHIP TECHNIQUES TO GUIDE CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION	KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION			English	Article								Constructive induction is a means of improving classification accuracy in difficult domains by transforming a difficult domain into a form amenable to standard induction techniques by constructing new features. When performing constructive induction, though, a learning system faces a combinatorial explosion of potential features to construct, but only a small fraction of these will prove to be useful. The challenge lies in identifying enough of these useful constructed features to achieve sufficient accuracy while examining as little as possible of the space of potential constructed features. This paper presents how apprenticeship techniques (Mitchell et al., 1985; Hall, 1988; Wilkins, 1988; Tecuci & Kodratoff, 1990) can be used to guide the feature construction process by focusing attention on weak areas of a learned knowledge base. The method used is to run a splitting algorithm (such as CART, PLS1, or C4.5) to build a knowledge base, employ apprenticeship techniques to detect and localize knowledge base deficiencies, use this information to construct new features, and then repeat the cycle as necessary (i.e. until a desired accuracy is reached). We show how this method improves accuracy on a range of classification problems and discuss why the combination of apprenticeship as a knowledge acquisition method and constructive induction as a machine learning method overcomes key weaknesses of each of these methods used separately.

J	LOPEZSUAREZ, A; KAMEL, M				LOPEZSUAREZ, A; KAMEL, M			DYKOR - A METHOD FOR GENERATING THE CONTENT OF EXPLANATIONS IN KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION; RULE-BASED SYSTEMS; EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING		The paper presents a methodology for improving the organization of knowledge bases and demonstrates its application for generating the content of explanations. The DyKOr (Dynamic Knowledge Organization) method combines information that is usually available through execution traces with existing domain knowledge using techniques from machine learning including knowledge compilation, explanation-based learning, and conceptual clustering. These techniques allow the separation of the knowledge needed to solve a problem from that which is not required, and the identification of information that is related to the problem but is not explicitly stated. Thus, the analysis performed through the methodology can considerably improve the quality and content of explanations. The paper describes the implementation of the methodology and how it can be integrated into typical rule-based expert systems. Illustrations of how the method can be used to produce the content for explanations are presented in the context of typical consultation and problem solving expert systems. A discussion of how the information produced by the method can be used to prepare explanations for users with different levels of expertise is also presented.

J	GEVA, AB; PRATT, H				GEVA, AB; PRATT, H			UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING OF EVOKED-POTENTIALS BY WAVE-FORM	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUZZY CLUSTERING; PATTERN RECOGNITION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS; WAVE-FORMS RECONSTRUCTION	MEMORY	A procedure for clustering evoked potentials (EPs) according to their waveforms is presented. Clustering is performed without a priori selection of basis waveforms, the number of basis waveforms or the number of clusters. The method uses the principal-component-analysis coefficients of EP records as features for unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering (UOFC) of the records. The validity of the procedure is demonstrated in two instances: visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) from humans in a memory-scanning task. In the clustering of VEPs, the procedure differentiates between waveforms judged to be clinically normal and abnormal. In the clustering of ERPs, the procedure correctly differentiates between waveforms evoked by the same stimuli which differ in their context to the performance of a memory-scanning task (memorised items against probes). Within this classification, the procedure detects two subgroups to probe-evoked waveforms, which are not obvious from visual inspection of the waveforms. The advantage of the procedure, which conducts clustering by UOFC, is the adaptive and machine-learning nature of its operation.

In this paper, we present Rulegraphs, a new method that combines the Graph Matching approach with Rule-based approaches from Machine Learning. This new method reduces the cardinality of the (NP-Complete) Graph Matching problem by replacing model part, and their relational, attribute states by rules which depict attribute bounds and evidence for different classes. We show how rulegraphs, when combined with techniques for checking feature label-compatibilities, not only reduce the search space but also improve the uniqueness of the matching process.

Due to the demands of high quality, automated food shape inspection has become an important need for the food industry. Currently, accuracy and speed are two major problems for food shape inspection with computer vision. Therefore, in this study, a fast and accurate computer-vision based feature extraction and classification system was developed. In the feature extraction stage, a statistical model based feature extractor (SMB) and a multi-index active model-based (MAM) feature extractor were developed to improve the accuracy of classifications. In the classification stage, first the back-propagation neural network was applied as a multi-index classifier. Then, to speed up training, some minimum indeterminate zone (MIZ) classifiers were developed. Corn kernels, almonds, and animal-shaped crackers were used to rest the above techniques. The results showed that accuracy and speed were greatly improved when the MAM feature extractor was used in conjunction with the MIZ classifier.

A decision tree which is capable of generating the desired line flows and bus voltages are created using the training patterns which are compiled from the historical operating records of Taiwan power system. The established decision tree contains the knowledge which are essential for line flow and bus voltage prediction. Thus, it can be applied to estimate line flows and bus voltages of a system in an efficient manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ID3 approach is demonstrated by security assessment of Taiwan power system which contains 170 buses and 207 lines.

J	FU, LM				FU, LM			RULE GENERATION FROM NEURAL NETWORKS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						NEURAL NETWORK; KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM; MACHINE LEARNING; RULE-BASED SYSTEM		The neural network approach has proven useful for the development of artificial intelligence systems. However, a disadvantage with this approach is that the knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. In this paper, we show how to interpret neural network knowledge in symbolic form. We lay down required definitions for this treatment, formulate the interpretation algorithm, and formally verify its soundness. The main result is a formalized relationship between a neural network and a rule-based system. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the neural network generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

J	PACHOWICZ, PW				PACHOWICZ, PW			SEMIAUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION OF OBJECT MODELS FOR ADAPTIVE OBJECT RECOGNITION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article							TEXTURE-DISCRIMINATION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; SYSTEMS; FIELDS	The paper presents a semi-autonomous model evolution approach to object recognition under variable perceptual conditions. The approach assumes that (i) the system has to recognize objects on separate images of a sequence, and (ii) the images demonstrate the variability of conditions under which objects are perceived (gradual change in resolution, lighting, positioning). The adaptation of object models is executed due to perceived, over a sequence of images, variabilities of object characteristics. This adaptation involves (i) the application of learned models to the next image, (ii) the monitoring of recognition effectiveness of the models, and (iii) an activation of learning processes if needed (i.e., when the recognition effectiveness of the models decreases). Model adaptation (evolution) integrates recognition processes of computer vision with incremental knowledge acquisition processes of machine learning in a closed loop. The paper presents both an outline of the iterative evolution methodology and the investigation of an incremental model generalization approach on the example of texture recognition problem. Experiments were run in a semi-autonomous mode where a teacher secured soundness behavior of the evolution system. The experiments are compared for the three system configurations: (i) a one-level control structure, (ii) a two-level control structure, and (iii) a two-level control structure with data filtering. The obtained results are evaluated due to system recognition effectiveness, recognition stability, and predictability of evolved models.

The proposed scheduling architecture consists of several decision making agents named ''Intelligent Managers,'' each of which performs certain decision making tasks by using some heuristic rules or by using other agents as internal simulators where knowledge is insufficient. Dynamic Scheduling, i.e., dynamic selection of scheduling rules, is employed to compensate for the drawbacks of decision makings with fixed heuristic rules, and back propagation type Neural Network is employed to obtain the knowledge as to these rule selections. Computer simulations indicate that using this architecture, satisfactory, though suboptimal, schedules can be obtained which well suppress delay from mission due dates and fuel consumption, within a manageable computational time.

The goal of these methods is to discover automatically classification patterns that can be used for general document categorization or personalized filtering of free text. Previous reports indicate that human-engineered rule-based systems, requiring many man-years of developmental efforts, have been successfully built to ''read'' documents and assign topics to them. We show that machine-generated decision rules appear comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation. In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%. In the context of a very high-dimensional feature space, several methodological alternatives are examined, including universal versus local dictionaries, and binary versus frequency-related features.

However, a system optimized for operation with such training signals may perform poorly when trained instead with voiced speech. This performance difference is a consequence of the quasi-periodic nature of voiced speech. In this paper, we explore the effects of quasi-periodic training signals on echo-canceller performance. In particular, we show that unlike filtered white noise, quasiperiodic training signals can actually limit the asymptotic echo-return loss of echo cancellers. In addition, we examine the ability of several existing techniques to improve performance when quasi-periodic signals are used to train echo cancellers.

These techniques, namely, Evidence-Based Networks (EBS-NNets) and Rulegraphs combine techniques from computer vision with those from machine learning and graph matching. The EBS-NNet has the ability to generalize pattern rules from training instances in terms of bounds on both unary (single part) and binary (part relation) numerical features. It also learns the compatibilities between unary and binary feature states in defining different pattern classes. Rulegraphs check this compatibility between unary and binary rules by combining evidence theory with graph theory. The two systems are tested and compared using a number of different pattern and object recognition problems.

These applications are characterized by very high dimensions, with hundreds of features or tens of thousands of cases. The results of several learning techniques are compared, including linear discriminants, nearest-neighbor methods, decision rules, decision trees, and neural nets. Both applications described in this article are good candidates for rule-based solutions because humans currently resolve these problems, and explanations are critical to determining the causes of faults. While several learning techniques achieved competitive results, machine learning with decision rule induction was most effective for these applications. It is demonstrated that decision (production) rule induction is practical in high dimensions, providing strong results and insightful explanations.

The method is shown to be capable of solving a variety of learning problems by mapping the different learning problems into colored digraphs. The generality and scope of this method can be attributed to the expressiveness of the colored digraph representation, which allows a number of different learning problems to be solved by a single algorithm. We demonstrate the application of our method to two seemingly different learning tasks: inductive learning of classification rules, and learning macro rules for speeding up inference. We also show that the uniform treatment of these two learning tasks enables our method to solve complex learning problems such as the construction of hierarchical knowledge bases.

To our knowledge, previously only the growth of the expectation of the number of incorrect choices has been examined. The derivation is founded, in part, on new contributions to the theory of zero crossings for sums of biased independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.

By integrating conceptual clustering and machine learning (especially learning-from-examples) paradigms, the method classifies the data into different clusters, extracts the characteristics of each cluster, and discovers knowledge rules based on the relationships among different clusters. Different kinds of knowledge rules, including hierarchical, equivalence an inheritance rules can be discovered efficiently.

In [74], the unique-attribute representation was introduced to eliminate combinatorics from the match. However, in so doing, unique-attributes engender a sufficiently negative set of trade-offs, so that investigating whether there are alternative representations that yield better trade-offs becomes of critical importance. This article identifies two promising spaces of such alternatives, and explores a number of the alternatives within these spaces. The first space is generated from local syntactic restrictions on working memory. Within this space, unique-attributes is shown to be the best alternative possible. The second space comes from restrictions on the search performed during the match of individual productions (match-search). In particular, this space is derived from the combination of a new, more relaxed, match formulation (instantiationless match) and a set of restrictions derived from the constraint-satisfaction literature. Within this space, new alternatives are found that outperform unique-attributes in some, but not yet all, domains.

J	ABDELAAL, RE; ELHADIDY, MA				ABDELAAL, RE; ELHADIDY, MA			A MACHINE-LEARNING APPROACH TO MODELING AND FORECASTING THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE AT DHAHRAN, SAUDI-ARABIA	ENERGY			English	Article							STATISTICAL-MODEL	We investigate the use of modern machine-learning techniques for weather prediction. The AIM double dagger (Abductory Induction Mechanism) tool for the Macintosh computer has been used for modelling and 3-day forecasting of the minimum temperature in the Dhahran region. Compared to other statistical methods and neural network techniques, this approach has the advantages that model synthesis is much faster and highly automated, requiring little or no user intervention. The resulting models are simpler, requiring data for fewer weather parameters, and prediction and forecasting accuracies are also superior. AIM models were developed using daily data for 18 weather parameters over one year to predict the minimum temperature from other parameters on the same day. Evaluated by using data for another full year, the models give over 99% yield in the +/-3-degrees-C error category compared to approximately 67% for both a statistical model and a model based on back propagation artificial neural networks. AIM forecasting models give a corresponding yield of 93% for the first forecasting day. Model relationships describing the synthesized AIM networks are compared with those derived through a statistical model previously developed for the region. The effect of increasing the model complexity is investigated for both modelling and forecasting.

Although several adaptive control techniques have been introduced, they are not robust enough for many real-world problem domains where the degree of uncertainty is high and therefore classical methods of mathematical modeling and control fail. Computer technology has reached a point where machine intelligence can be incorporated in many of the systems that we use daily. Changes in environments, unmeasurable disturbances, changing reference models and performance criteria and component failures are some of the characteristics which necessitate intelligent control. The developments in the field of artificial intelligence have reached a stage which will help to reduce these control complexities by incorporating intelligence into the control systems. In this paper we explain various artificial intelligence techniques that can be used to control dynamical physical systems.

Our method induces a membership function for a category from positive and negative examples. It can learn ''topological knowledge'' such as typicality of an example. Our method consists of two stages: example space configuration of a coordinate system in the first stage, induction of membership function that induces a membership function based on the distance in the newly configured example space in the second Further, we investigate search strategies suitable for deriving the symbolic expression of a category by geometric analysis of the example space.

J	GAINES, BR				GAINES, BR			CLASS LIBRARY IMPLEMENTATION OF AN OPEN-ARCHITECTURE KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT SYSTEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Review							SEMANTIC NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; ACQUISITION; MAINTENANCE; LOGIC	Object-oriented class libraries offer the potential for individual researchers to manage the large bodies of code generated in the experimental development of complex interative systems. This article analyses the structure of such a class library that supports the rapid prototyping of a wide range of systems including collaborative networking, shared documents, hypermedia, machine learning, knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation, and various combinations of these technologies. The overall systems architecture is presented in terms of a heterogeneous collection of systems providing a wide range of application functionalities. Examples are given of group writing, multimedia and knowledge-based systems which are based on combining these functionalities. The detailed design issues of the knowledge representation server component of the system are analysed in terms of requirements, the current state of the art, and the underlying theoretical principles that lead to an effective object-oriented implementation. It is shown that modeling the server through intensional algebraic semantics leads naturally to an open-architecture class library into which new data types may be pluged as required without change to the basic deductive engine. It is concluded that the development of a principled class library targeted on complex interactive applications does empower the individual researcher in the rapid prototyping of experimental systems. However, it is noted that much of the power of the approach stems from the cumulative evolution of the class library through successive applications, and hence the results may not generalize to team projects where greater rigidity is required in the class library in order to facilitate project management and inter-member coordination.

Design rules are generated by induction from examples of minimum weight designs. This study investigates the applicability of machine learning methods that are capable of constructive induction, that is of automatically searching for and generating problem-relevant attributes beyond those originally provided. The decision rules generated by machine learning programs specify design configurations that are recommended, typical, infeasible, or those that are to be avoided. The learned rules captured some of the essential expert's understanding of the design characteristics involved in selecting wind bracings for tall buildings. These results are promising and demonstrate a potential practical usefulness of the proposed methodology for automated generating of design rules.

Results of testing this method on a selection of data sets show that it has some practical advantages over previously used techniques for tree-pruning. Some of the theoretical implications of the present method are also discussed.

The Shift from SUM to MIN provides an ideal domain for the study of naturally occurring discovery processes in cognitive skill acquisition. The SUM-to-MIN transition poses a number of challenges for machine-learning systems that would model the phenomenon, First, in addition to the SUM and MIN strategies, Siegler and Jenkins (1989) found that children exhibit two transitional strategies, but not a strategy proposed by an earlier model. Second, they found that children do not invent the MIN strategy in response to impasses, or gaps in their knowledge. Rather, MIN develops spontaneously and gradually replaces earlier strategies. Third, intricate structural differences between the SUM and MIN Strategies make it difficult, if not impossible, for standard, symbol-level machine-learning algorithms to model the transition. We present a computer model, called GIPS, that meets these challenges. GIPS combines a relatively simple algorithm for problem solving with a probabilistic learning algorithm that performs symbol-level and knowledge-level learning, both in the presence and absence of impasses. In addition, GIPS makes psychologically plausible demands on local processing and memory. Most importantly, the system successfully models the shift from Sum to MIN, as well as the two transitional strategies found by Siegler and Jenkins.

These problems are: the prediction of protein secondary structure; the identification of rules governing the arrangement of beta-sheets strands in the tertiary folding of proteins; and the modelling of a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) of a series of drugs. For secondary structure prediction and the QSAR, GOLEM yielded predictions comparable with contemporary approaches including neural networks. Rules for beta-strand arrangement are derived and it is planned to contrast their accuracy with those obtained by human inspection. In all three studies GOLEM discovered rules that provided insight into the stereochemistry of the system. We conclude machine leaning used together with human intervention will provide a powerful tool to discover patterns in biological sequences and structures.

J	TERANO, T; MURO, Z				TERANO, T; MURO, Z			ON-THE-FLY KNOWLEDGE-BASED REFINEMENT BY A CLASSIFIER SYSTEM	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								A Classifier System (CS) is a machine learning system composed of a production system, a reinforcement learning mechanism, and a rule generation function by genetic algorithms (GAs). This paper presents a new method for knowledge base refinement by CS technique and describes its application to rule-based simulation for an automated transportation system in a steel manufacturig process. The key idea of the proposed method is that the condition part of a rule should be divided into two parts: indispensable conditions and discriminate conditions. The former are generated by a diagnosing type knowledge-based system. The latter and action parts are generated and refined by genetic algorithms. Using this method, we can easily input initial rule sets, refine the rules without generating unapplicable ones, and reduce the computation time for learning. The method enables us to develop an on-the-fly knowledge refinement mechanism for rule-based simulation systems. Intensive experiments on the transportation system have shown that 1) the generated rules prevent blocking of indispensable events from occurring, and 2) the rules also generate useful sequences of events by means of the minimization of loss time of the shops in the process. The prerequisites of the proposed method are so general that the method can be widely applied to the rule refinement tasks in various kinds of rule-based systems.

The core of the paper concerns a learning program, Candide, which learns to control a process without a priori knowledge about the process, by observing random initial evolutions of the process and acquiring a qualitative model. Monotonous or derivative relationships between inputs and outputs are recognized, and then a rule-based incremental controller is deduced from this model.

J	BECK, HW; ANWAR, T; NAVATHE, SB				BECK, HW; ANWAR, T; NAVATHE, SB			A CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM FOR DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING; SCHEMA EVOLUTION; MACHINE LEARNING; CASE-BASED REASONING; EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING; EXCEPTION HANDLING		Conceptual clustering techniques based on current theories of categorization provide a way to design database schemas that more accurately represent classes. An approach is presented in which classes are treated as complex clusters of concepts rather than as simple predicates. An important service provided by the database is determining whether a particular instance is a member of a class. A conceptual clustering algorithm based on theories of categorization aids in building classes by grouping related instances and developing class descriptions. The resulting database schema addresses a number of properties of categories, including default values and prototypes, analogical reasoning, exception handling, and family resemblance. Class cohesion results from trying to resolve conflicts between building generalized class descriptions and accommodating members of the class that deviate from these descriptions. This is achieved by combining techniques from machine learning, specifically explanation-based learning and case-based reasoning. A subsumption function is used to compare two class descriptions. A realization function is used to determine whether an instance meets an existing class description. A new function, INTERSECT, is introduced to compare the similarity of two instances. INTERSECT is used in defining an exception condition. Exception handling results in schema modification. This approach is applied to the database problems of schema integration, schema generation, query processing, and view creation.

In this article a method is demonstrated for the effective self-evaluation of an expert system for x-ray rocking curve analysis. The method uses a combination of fuzzy logic and machine learning, the latter defined as a self-adaptive system that improves system performance over time. The heuristics of several experts are combined using rules, frames, and connection matrices. Each expert is weighted on the basis of experience and these credibility weights are used to influence the decision processes of the expert system. All weights are evaluated over time and the basis for evaluation is successful or unsuccessful expert system decisions. Individual rules are also evaluated and whenever a rule is shown to be ineffective it is hidden from the reasoning processes of the expert system. When new situations occur that have not been allowed for in the rules of the expert system, then existing rules are fine-tuned and changed to deal with these new facts. New rules are inferred and evaluated in the same way as the heuristics of the human experts. (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	KEARNS, MJ; SCHAPIRE, RE				KEARNS, MJ; SCHAPIRE, RE			EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION-FREE LEARNING OF PROBABILISTIC CONCEPTS	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LEARNABILITY	In this paper we investigate a new formal model of machine learning in which the concept (Boolean function) to be learned may exhibit uncertain or probabilistic behavior-thus, the same input may sometimes be classified as a positive example and sometimes as a negative example. Such probabilistic concepts (or p-concepts) may arise in situations such as weather prediction, where the measured variables and their accuracy are insufficient to determine the outcome with certainty. We adopt from the Valiant model of learning [28] the demands that learning algorithms be efficient and general in the sense that they perform well for a wide class of p-concepts and for any distribution over the domain. In addition to giving many efficient algorithms for learning natural classes of p-concepts, we study and develop in detail an underlying theory of learning p-concepts. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

The process searches for, detects and isolates behaviour patterns inherent in the data. It relates these pattems to production irregularities, suggests connections with specific causes and helps propose possible corrective or preventive actions. The approach is based on a four-phase procedure: (1) the decision-maker focuses on the subject or difficulty at issue, represented by a target concept; (2) the KEDB algorithm, based on a machine learning approach, processes the relevant database and provides knowledge characterizing and classifying the target concept; (3) the output is interpreted in Pareto fashion as a series of possible circumstances explaining the target concept behaviour; and (4) based on these causes, the decision-maker decides on possible corrective actions to improve the situation, or preventive actions to forestall unfavourable conditions. A case study based on an actual quality control database is detailed.

Machine learning of generator programs for computable functions is studied. To motivate these studies partially. it is shown that, in some cases. interesting global properties for computable functions can be proved from suitable generator programs which cannot be proved from any ordinary programs for them. The power (for variants of various learning criteria from the literature) of learning generator programs is compared with the power of learning ordinary programs. The learning power in these cases is also compared to that of learning limiting programs. i.e.. programs allowed finitely many mind changes about their correct outputs.

J	KOZA, JR				KOZA, JR			GENETIC PROGRAMMING AS A MEANS FOR PROGRAMMING COMPUTERS BY NATURAL-SELECTION	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						GENETIC PROGRAMMING; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CROSSOVER; HIERARCHICAL AUTOMATIC FUNCTION DEFINITION; SYMBOLIC REGRESSION; BOOLEAN 11-MULTIPLEXER; ECONOMETRIC EXCHANGE EQUATION; BOOLEAN 11-PARITY		Many seemingly different problems in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and symbolic processing can be viewed as requiring the discovery of a computer program that produces some desired output for particular inputs. When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program. The recently developed genetic programming paradigm described herein provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of different problems from different fields. In genetic programming, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. Genetic programming is illustrated via an example of machine learning of the Boolean 11-multiplexer function and symbolic regression of the econometric exchange equation from noisy empirical data. Hierarchical automatic function definition enables genetic programming to define potentially useful functions automatically and dynamically during a run, much as a human programmer writing a complex computer program creates subroutines (procedures, functions) to perform groups of steps which must be performed with different instantiations of the dummy variables (formal parameters) in more than one place in the main program. Hierarchical automatic function definition is illustrated via the machine learning of the Boolean 11-parity function.

The authors show how to use this procedure to identify relationships between work-in-process data (information obtained during semiconductor fabrication) and potential integrated circuit yield. The relationships, in the form of IF-THEN rules, are extracted from databases of previously fabricated integrated circuits and final yield. It is further shown that these rules, when incorporated into expert systems, can advise the human operator as to which batches of circuits are likely to produce submarginal yield if processed to completion, thereby providing a basis for developing or enhancing a quality control strategy. These rules also identify the parameters and values which have historically provided the highest and lowest final wafer yields. A cost analysis is given to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of this procedure. An introduction to semiconductor manufacturing and a glossary are provided.

The replication strategies include database snapshots, materialized views, and quasi-copies. These strategies are 'static' and do not adapt to the changes in the data usage patterns. Furthermore, they often require expensive update synchronizations to maintain data consistency and do not exploit the knowledge embedded in the query history. This paper describes a machine learning based time invariant fragmentation method (MLTIF) that acquires knowledge about the data usage patterns for each node. Based on this knowledge, MLTIF designs time invariant fragments (TIF) and schedules its allocation and selective update for a specified time period. Simulation is used to compare the effectiveness of the MLTIF approach with that of full replication, materialized views, and non replication strategies. Initial results indicate that for most normal operating conditions, the MLTIF approach can be effective.

From this experiment we find that Humans. Neural Nets, and the Pao-Hu procedure favour a decision tree different from that preferred by the ID3 machine learning algorithm. Implications for the 'strong convergence hypothesis' between neural network and machine learning are discussed, with emphasis here on a 'stronger convergence hypothesis' between neural networks and humans. We further compare the generalization properties of the four approaches, and we introduce a method of 'backprediction' as a measure of the relative quality of generalizations. The relationships of our findings to other recent investigations comparing symbolic and neural learning algorithms are discussed.

This technique, termed Conditional Rule Generation (CRG), was developed to take into account the label-compatibilities which should occur between unary and binary rules in their very generation, a condition which is generally not guaranteed in well-known rule generation and machine learning techniques.

Although this is not a simple task in itself, the difficulties dramatically increase when it is intended to synthesize the inference rules directly from signals obtained from sensors on complex applications. Specific problems concerning knowledge acquisition and representation must be solved. This paper introduces an automatic method to build the knowledge base of a production system from the raw data of a multi-sensor system, using a machine-learning procedure and abstracting the numerical data for symbolic knowledge representation. The method is demonstrated for two applications for monitoring the tool condition in machining processes.

The success in acquiring knowledge automatically by using machine learning techniques has to a certain extent overcome this problem, and hence, has found applications in many fields. Machine-learning techniques have been applied successfully to several real-world problem domains. The application of machine learning techniques to weather forecasting has received only little attention. One reason for this has been the difficulty in obtaining suitable weather forecasting data sets. This paper describes the application of machine-learning techniques on weather data sets to acquire knowledge automatically for the development of an expert system to predict the occurrence and mean depth of rainfall over Melbourne City and its suburbs in Australia during a 24-hour period. The weather data sets were assembled from the archives of the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology.

Alopex is a stochastic parallel process which has been previously applied in the theory of perception. It has also been applied to several nonlinear optimization problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem. It estimates the weight changes by using only a scalar cost function which is measure of global performance. In this paper we describe the use of Alopex algorithm for solving nonlinear learning tasks by multilayer feed-forward networks. Alopex has several advantages such as, ability to escape from local minima, rapid algorithmic computation based on a scalar cost function and synchronous updation of weights. We present the results of computer simulations for several tasks, such as learning of parity, encoder problems and the MONK's problems. The learning performance as well as the generalization capacity of the Alopex algorithm are compared with those of the back-propagation procedure, and it is shown that the Alopex has specific advantages over backpropagation. An important advantage of the Alopex algorithm is its ability to extract information from noisy data. We investigate the efficacy of the algorithm for faster convergence by considering different error functions. We show that an information theoretic error measure shows better convergence characteristics. The algorithm has also been applied to more complex practical problems such as undersea target recognition from sonar returns and adaptive control of dynamical systems and the results are discussed.

They use rules of natural selection to investigate highly complex, multidimensional problems and have been employed successfully in a variety of search, optimization and machine learning applications in science and engineering where other more traditional methods fail. In this study genetic algorithms are presented and discussed within the framework of an adaptive solution methodology for investigating otherwise intractable optimization problems in the thermosciences. The exposition focuses on their application to an electronics cooling problem where it is required to find optimal or nearly optimal arrangements of convectively cooled components placed in-line on the bottom wall of a ventilated two-dimensional channel. The present application is specific only for purposes of illustration. The power of the methodology rests on its generality of application and an indifference to the source of data (experimental, analytical or numerical) used in the optimization process. The study shows that genetic algorithms allow a cost-effective approach for investigating highly complex numerical and or experimental thermosciences problems where it is desirable to obtain a family of acceptable problem solutions, as opposed to a single optimum solution.

J	LAIRD, P; SAUL, R				LAIRD, P; SAUL, R			DISCRETE SEQUENCE PREDICTION AND ITS APPLICATIONS	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						SEQUENCE EXTRAPOLATION; STATISTICAL LEARNING; TEXT COMPRESSION; SPEEDUP LEARNING; MEMORY MANAGEMENT		Learning from experience to predict sequences of discrete symbols is a fundamental problem in machine learning with many applications. We present a simple and practical algorithm (TDAG) for discrete sequence prediction. Based on a text-compression method, the TDAG algorithm limits the growth of storage by retaining the most likely prediction contexts and discarding (forgetting) less likely ones. The storage/speed tradeoffs are parameterized so that the algorithm can be used in a variety of applications. Our experiments verify its performance on data compression tasks and show how it applies to two problems: dynamically optimizing Prolog programs for good average-case behavior and maintaining a cache for a database on mass storage.

A consecutive series of 569 patients provided the data to develop the system and an additional 54 consecutive, new patients provided samples to test the system. The projected prospective accuracy of the system estimated by tenfold cross validation was 97%. The actual accuracy on 54 new samples (36 benign, 1 atypia, and 17 malignant) was 100%. Digital image analysis coupled with machine learning techniques will improve diagnostic accuracy of breast fine needle aspirates.

The application of machine learning techniques in design domain requires the consideration of the representation of the learned design knowledge, that is, a target representation, as well as the content and form of the training data, or design examples. This paper examines the use of a target representation of design concepts and the application, adaptation, or generation of machine learning techniques to generate design concepts from design examples. The examples are taken from the domain of bridge design. The primary machine learning paradigm considered is concept formation.

The proposed approach to synthesis knowledge acquisition and use (SKAU) described in this paper, called NETSYN, creates a function to estimate the probability of each possible value of each design property being used in a given design context. NETSYN uses a connectionist learning approach to acquire and represent this probability estimation function and exhibits good performance when tested on an artificial design problem. This paper presents the NETSYN approach for SKAU, a preliminary test of its capability, and a discussion of issues that need to be addressed in future work.

We begin by discussing the characteristics of software engineering that establish dynamic reorganization as a requirement for a repository of software artifacts. We then present an experimental system that uses incremental concept formation as the basis for dynamic reorganization, and the conceptual hierarchy that was generated by the system for a set of 67 artifacts. The hierarchy is compared to a hierarchy produced manually by independent investigators, and the automatic hierarchy is evaluated in terms of retrieval efficiency and retrieval reliability. The paper ends with a discussion of three projects that share similar objectives with our work.

A predictive agent is defined as a system that is able to predict the expected effectiveness of various composable products from current product attributes. The described research addresses the questions of how to acquire the necessary knowledge for a predictive agent, how to organize this knowledge, and how to link it with methods and tools for courseware authoring and adaptation. We propose to use a methodology, derived from the field of machine learning, and present a framework for applying inductive knowledge acquisition based upon the empirical evaluation of adaptable courseware products.

J	BOTICARIO, JG; MIRA, J				BOTICARIO, JG; MIRA, J			SOME METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF MACHINE LEARNING	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								There is a lack of theory and methodology for the development and proper evaluation of the machine learning (ML) applications built so far. This paper presents some methodological considerations concerning a particular ML perspective expressed in a methodological model called 2D-LIM, a multilevel paradigm-independent methodology that is intended to help during the continuous specification mechanism implicitly present on developing learning programs. Taking into account the striking differences between the knowledge level description of these systems and the symbolic ones, we have identified new layers for their characterization, from the observer point of view and from a pure computational perspective. Our proposal is supported with symbolic structures and arguments from distinguished machine learning strategies and applications (Winston et al., 1983; Mitchell et al., 1983, 1986; Dejong and Mooney, 1986; Carbonell, 1986; 1986; Hammond, 1986; Minton, 1990, Bergadano and Giordana, 1988; Hirsh 1990) and from our own experience in the field (Boticario, 1988; Dent et al., 1992).

In this paper the performance of this method is evaluated on three groups of compounds. The molecular structure was encoded as sequences of well-known structural (topological) indices. Euclidean distance has been used for determining the similarities between compounds. Property prediction results of the new method are compared with the results of the neighborhood based approximation (clustering) method and with the results obtained by an artificial intelligence program using machine learning tools.

Conventional control of large refrigerated stores can be improved dramatically by the use of artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly expert systems. One of the requirements of the system developed is for a simulation of the heat and mass transfer of the store, and this has a high processing time overhead. This paper defines the real-time control problems of the situation, both synchronous and asynchronous, and gives a general overview of methods adopted for dealing with them. The separation of the knowledge bases within the whole system has been used to facilitate the assessment of particular real-time bottlenecks, and the improvement in performance within these areas by intelligent parameter passing. Discussion is confined to the two main knowledge base components where this application is critical, the simulation model and the intelligent data-archiving system. Such an approach promotes the machine-learning capabilities of the application in both areas.		MARCHANT, AN (reprint author), UNIV EXETER,SCH ENGN,EXETER EX4 4QF,ENGLAND.

J	WROBEL, S				WROBEL, S			CONCEPT-FORMATION DURING INTERACTIVE THEORY REVISION	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						CONCEPT FORMATION; THEORY REVISION; REPRESENTATION CHANGE; NEW-TERM PROBLEM; MOBAL; KRT; CLT	CATEGORIES; OBJECTS	This article examines the problem of concept formation in machine learning, and focuses in particular on the problem of aggregation, i e., the decision of which objects are to be grouped together into a new concept. While existing concept formation approaches have mainly concentrated on aggregation constraints that rely on structural or correlational properties of the concepts themselves, we argue that in an integrated learning system, other learning activities can provide an additional context that focuses concept formation before structural criteria are applied. In particular, we present the concept formation method realized by the KRT and CLT components of the integrated learning system MOBAL. In MOBAL, a concept formation attempt is triggered whenever no existing concept can adequately capture the rule instance and exception sets as they arise from the theory revision activities of the system. We describe how the so-proposed aggregate is characterized by a set of (function-free) first-order Horn clauses and how these are evaluated according to structural criteria to decide about the introduction of the concept into the representation. We show how a structural criterion can be used to ensure that any new concept improves the structure of the knowledge base, and we empirically evaluate how the introduction of new concepts according to different criteria affects the classification accuracy of learned rules.

J	KIETZ, JU; MORIK, K				KIETZ, JU; MORIK, K			A POLYNOMIAL APPROACH TO THE CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION OF STRUCTURAL KNOWLEDGE	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION; RESTRICTIONS OF 1ST-ORDER LOGIC FOR LEARNING; LEARNING MOST SPECIFIC GENERALIZATIONS		The representation formalism as well as the representation language is of great importance for the success of machine learning. The representation formalism should be expressive, efficient, useful, and applicable. First-order logic needs to be restricted in order to be efficient for inductive and deductive reasoning. In the field of knowledge representation, term subsumption formalisms have been developed which are efficient and expressive. In this article, a learning algorithm, KLUSTER, is described that represents concept definitions in this formalism. KLUSTER enhances the representation language if this is necessary for the discrimination of concepts. Hence, KLUSTER is a constructive induction program. KLUSTER builds the most specific generalization and a most general discrimination in polynomial time. It embeds these concept learning problems into the overall task of learning a hierarchy of concepts.

Neural network analysis provides a non-algorithmic approach to information processing, which results in the ability of the computer to form associations and to recognize patterns or classes among data. It belongs to die machine learning techniques which also include probabilistic techniques such as discriminant function analysis and logistic regression and information theoretical techniques. These techniques may be used to extract knowledge from example patients to optimize decision limits and identify clinically important laboratory quantities. An expert system may be defined as a computer program that can give advice in a well-defined area of expertise and is able to explain its reasoning. Declarative knowledge consists of statements about logical or empirical relationships between things. Expert systems typically separate declarative knowledge residing in a knowledge base from the inference engine: an algorithm that dynamically directs and controls the system when it searches its knowledge base. A tool is an expert system without a knowledge base. The developer of an expert system uses a tool by entering knowledge into the system. Many, if not the majority of problems encountered at the laboratory level are procedural. A problem is procedural if it is possible to write up a step-by-step description of the expert's work or if it can be represented by a decision tree. To solve problems of this type only small expert system tools and/or conventional programming are required. Expert systems should probably be combined with methods such as machine learning methods, time series analysis, and mathematical models of biochemical systems which may be used to extract knowledge at a high level of abstraction.

Building on our experience with the Machine Learning Toolbox, we propose a set of taxonomies that allow a domain expert, with little or no knowledge of machine learning, to choose a suitable tool for his particular application. Unlike previous classifications of learning systems, which were based on technical characteristics of these systems, ours relies on features of the applications that can be solved, such as the user's goal, available data and background knowledge, and interaction between the system and its user.

An eight-stage knowledge acquisition process is proposed and its individual stages justified and described. Machine learning is used to learn about urban rail control. The development of the representation space for this problem is discussed, including the analysis of motion and stopping regime for a train, and of both decision and performance attributes. Travel time, energy consumption, and passenger comfort are used as performance attributes. Six automated knowledge acquisition processes were conducted for various performance (dependent) attributes, taking into consideration two different clusterings of performance attribute values into three and seven subranges. All the examples used for learning were computer generated, using REGIME, which separately produces estimations of individual performance attributes for a given train-driving scenario and an assumed rail corridor. The decision rules produced are discussed, and their verification, based on the overall empirical error rate, is reported. This paper also contains conclusions and suggestions regarding future research on applications of machine learning to knowledge acquisition in transportation engineering.

A steady improvement in recognition performance is demonstrated. It is achieved by learning individual faces in terms of the local shapes of image boundaries. High-level facial features, such as nose, are not explicitly used in this scheme. Several machine learning methods are tested and compared. The overall objectives are formulated as follows: Classify the different tasks of ''face recognition'' and suggest an orderly terminology to distinguish between them. Design a set of easily and reliably obtainable descriptors and their automatic extraction from the images. Compare plausible machine learning methods; tailor them to this domain. Design experiments that would best reflect the needs of real world applications, and suggest a general methodology for further research. Perform the experiments and compare the performance.

These structures should be represented as a finite element mesh. Defining an appropriate geometric mesh model that ensures low approximation errors and avoids unnecessary computational overheads is a very difficult and time consuming task. It is the major bottleneck in the FEM analysis process. The inductive logic programming system GOLEM has been employed to construct the rules for deciding about the appropriate mesh resolution. Five cylindrical mesh models have been used as a source of training examples. The evaluation of the resulting knowledge base shows that conditions in the domain are well represented by the rules, which specify the required number of the finite elements on the edges of the structures to be analysed using FEM. A comparison between the results obtained by this knowledge base and conventional mesh generation techniques confirms that the application of inductive logic programming is an effective approach to solving the problem of mesh design.

Manual acquisition of this knowledge is tedious and error prone. Development of an automated acquisition process would prove invaluable. This paper references and overviews a range of the systems that have been developed in the domain of machine learning and natural language processing. Each system is categorised into either a symbolic or connectionist paradigm, and has its own characteristics and limitations described.

The system classifies and matches catalogs from multiple, overlapping plate scans as well as CCD calibration sequences; and it can be used for the scientific analysis of the resulting catalogs. It incorporates a number of novel machine-learning and AI tools, including the star/galaxy classification using decision tree algorithms. This results: in star/galaxy separation accurate to 90% or better down to B-J similar to 21(m), i.e. similar to 1(m) above the plate limit. The final catalog is expected to contain at least 5 x 10(7) galaxies and > 2 x 10(9) stars. We present preliminary results on galaxy counts from a test region near the NGP. We find a mild excess over the no-evolution models, smaller than previously found by the APM group. A search for z > 4 quasars and the two-point correlation analysis of this data set are in progress.

J	ATMAR, W				ATMAR, W			NOTES ON THE SIMULATION OF EVOLUTION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; OPTIMIZATION	The simulation of evolution for the purposes of paramenter optimization has generally demonstrated itself to be a robust and rapid optimization technique. But there may exist more value in simulating evolution than simple parameter optimization. The optimizations of system behavior obtained through simulated evolution represent a potentially powerful autopoetic pathway to machine learning and self-organization. Indeed, the simulation of evolution may eventually prove to be the only practical path to the development of ontogenetic machine intelligence. As the complexity of the systems being evolved increases, the development of a proper philosophy of analysis and design becomes imperative. The designer of evolutionary algorithms must keep clearly in mind what is being evolved and what evolves only by consequence. Notes on the simulation of evolution are offered in four sections: 1) the basic nature of evolution, 2) the practical simulation of evolution, 3) common philosophical errors, and 4) that which remains to be accomplished. Simulated evolutionary optimization, as a machine intelligence technique, is still in its infancy, yet it is nonetheless a mechanism of machine learning that can reasonably be expected to continue to grow in importance and practical benefit. As the availability of massively parallel processors becomes increasingly common, the value of simulated evolutionary techniques will become increasingly apparent, if for no other reason than the natural match between the technique and the emerging technology. The power of simulated evolutionary techniques cannot be easily exaggerated. The method has been repeatedly demonstrated to successfully find points of global optimality when other methods fail, often astonishingly quickly. While the process of simulating evolution is still very young, specific rules have become apparent and are easily stated.

Representing a context by a pair (E, P) of examples and properties involved, we build the least lattice containing the ordering given by the dependencies of the properties. That is, we say that a property p is less or equal a property q whenever all occurrences of p are q instances. In this framework we can obtain inductive rules suggested by the examples. The rules are described in terms of lattices operations, and we develop an algorithm to compute the most convenient denotation of rules according to an economical optimization principle.

J	MUGGLETON, S				MUGGLETON, S			PREDICATE INVENTION AND UTILIZATION	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						LOGIC PROGRAMMING; MACHINE LEARNING; PREDICATE INVENTION; INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING		Inductive logic programming (ILP) involves the synthesis of logic programs from examples. In terms of scientific theory formation ILP systems define observational predicates in terms of a set of theoretical predicates. However, certain basic theorems indicate that with an inadequate theoretical vocabulary this is not always possible. Predicate invention is the augmentation of a given theoretical vocabulary to allow finite axiomatization of the observational predicates. New theoretical predicates need to be chosen from a well-defined universe of such predicates. In this paper a partial order of utilization is described over such a universe. This ordering is a special case of a logical translation. The notion of utilization allows the definition of an equivalence relationship over new predicates. In a manner analogous to Plotkin, clause refinement is defined relative to given background knowledge and a universe of new predicates. It is shown that relative least clause refinement is defined and unique whenever there exists a relative least general generalization of a set of clauses. Results of a preliminary implementation of this approach are given.

The existing manual methods of assessment of preterm birth are 17% - 38% accurate. The machine learning system LERS was used for three different datasets about pregnant women. Rules induced by LERS were used in conjunction with a classification scheme of LERS, based on ''bucket brigade algorithm'' of genetic algorithms and enhanced by partial matching. The resulting prediction of preterm birth in new, unseen cases is much more accurate (68%-90%).

Rules for medical expert systems consists of two parts: one is a proposition part, which represent a if-then rule, and the other is probabilistic measures, which represents reliability of that rule. Therefore, acquisition of both knowledge is very important for application of machine learning methods to medical domains. Extending concepts of rough set theory to probabilistic domain, we introduce a new approach to knowledge acquisition, which induces probabilistic rules based on rough set theory (PRIMEROSE) and develop a program that extracts rules for an expert system from clinical database, using this method. The results show that the derived rules almost correspond to those of medical experts.

A general framework for classification is set up within which methods from statistics, neural networks, pattern recognition and machine learning can be compared. Neural networks emerge as one of a class of flexible non-linear regression methods which can be used to classify via regression. Many interesting issues remain, including parameter estimation, the assessment of the classifiers and in algorithm development.

Recently, it has been shown that these phenomena also hold in the world of polynomial-time algorithmic learning. Thus inductive inference can be understood and used as a source of potent ideas guiding both research and applications in algorithmic learning theory.

DOPPELGANGER'S learning is called heterogeneous for two reasons: first, multiple learning techniques are used to interpret the data, and second, the learning techniques must often grapple with disparate data types. These computations take place at geographically distributed sites, and make use of portable user models carried by individuals. This paper concentrates on DOPPELGANGER's learning techniques and their implementation in an application-independent, sensor-independent environment.

With this in view, the main objective of this paper is to present and discuss the student modelling approach we have adopted to implement Pitagora 2.0, an ITS based on a co-operative learning model, and designed to support teaching-learning activities in a Euclidean Geometry context. In particular, this approach has led us to develop two distinct modules that cooperate to implement the SM of Pitagora 2.0. The first module resembles a ''classical'' student model, in the sense that it maintains a representation of the current student knowledge level, which can be used by the teacher in order to tune its teaching strategies to the specific student needs. In addition, our system contains a second module that implements a virtual partner, called companion, This module consists of a computational model of an ''average student'' which cooperates with the student during the learning process. The above mentioned module calls for the use of machine learning algorithms that allow the companion to improve in parallel with the real student. Computational results obtained when testing this module in simulation experiments are also presented.

Psychological experiments show that people with varying goals process information differently, studies in education show that goals have a strong effect on what students learn, and functional arguments in machine learning support the necessity of goal-based focusing of learner effort. At the Fourteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, a symposium brought together researchers in AI, psychology, and education to discuss goal-driven learning. This article presents the fundamental points illuminated at the symposium, placing them in the context of open questions and current research directions in goal-driven learning.

This paper addresses these problems and describes some techniques for handling them. A model of an idealized knowledge-discovery system is presented as a reference for studying and designing new systems. This model is used in the comparison of three systems: CoverStory, EXPLORA, and the Knowledge Discovery Workbench. The deficiencies of existing systems relative to the model reveal several open problems for future research.

We describe three classes of database mining problems involving classification, associations, and sequences, and argue that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive data. We describe a model and some basic operations for the process of rule discovery. We show how the database mining problems we consider map to this model and how they can be solved by using the basic operations we propose. We give an example of an algorithm for classification obtained by combining the basic rule discovery operations. This algorithm not only is efficient in discovering classification rules but also has accuracy comparable to ID3, one of the current best classifiers.

This paper puts inductive learning in the context of a set of relations defined either extensionally or intentionally in the framework of deductive databases. It presents LINUS, an inductive logic programming system that induces virtual relations from example positive and negative tuples and already defined relations in a deductive database. Based on the idea of transforming the problem of learning relations to attribute-value form, it incorporates several attribute-value learning systems. As the latter handle noisy data successfully, LINUS is able to learn relations from real life noisy databases. The paper illustrates the use of LINUS for learning virtual relations and then presents a study of its performance on noisy data.

Tree induction algorithms of two types, total branching and subset elimination, used in the generation of rules, are reviewed,vith respect to their treatment of the issue of quality. Based upon this assessment, a hybrid approach, Probabilistic Inductive Learning (PrIL), is presented that provides a probabilistic measure of goodness for an individual rule, enabling the user to set maximum misclassification levels, or minimum reliability levels, with predetermined confidence that each and every rule will satisfy this criterion. The user is able to quantify the reliability of the decision process, i.e., the invoking of the rules, which is of crucial importance in automated decision processes. PrIL is described with its associated algorithm. An illustrative example based upon the claims process at a workers' compensation board is also presented.

The machine learning paradigm used is structured concept formation, in which objects described in terms of components and their interrelationships are clustered and organized in a knowledge base. Symbolic images are used to represent classes of structured objects. A discovered molecular knowledge base is successfully used in the interpretation of a high resolution electron density map.

However, one of the bottlenecks in building intelligent systems is the difficulty of acquisition, testing and refinement of domain specialists' knowledge. Learning capability offers a way through this bottleneck. In this paper, we describe a general-purpose learning model for use in an unstructured environment. The proposed model exploits different learning techniques to improve the coordination, to increase task and resource allocation efficiency and to refine problem-solving skills of system elements. The utility of such system is most evident in complex domains such as 'grasping unknown objects by a dextrous hand'. An example of the proposed model is illustrated by an intelligent dextrous hand which learns to grasp unknown objects. Moreover, an expert system for grasp mode selection was implemented in a software package and an example of grasp mode generation is demonstrated.

High-performance shape discrimination operators, defined as variable structuring elements and sequenced as program forms, are derived using GAs. The population of operators, iteratively evaluated according to an performance index corresponding to shape discrimination ability, evolves into an optimal set of operators using the evolutionary principles of genetic search. Experimental results are included to illustrate the feasibility of our novel methodology for developing robust shape analysis methods.

(This algorithm uses membership queries.) The decision tree model that is considered is an extension of the traditional boolean decision tree model that allows linear operations in each node (i.e., summation of a subset of the input variables over GF(2)). This paper shows how to learn in polynomial time any function that can be approximated (in norm L(2)) by a polynomially sparse function (i.e., a function with only polynomially many nonzero Fourier coefficients). The authors demonstrate that any function f whose L(1)-norm (i.e., the sum of absolute value of the Fourier coefficients) is polynomial can be approximated by a polynomially sparse function, and prove that boolean decision trees with linear operations are a subset of this class of functions. Moreover, it is shown that the functions with polynomial L(1)-norm can be learned deterministically. The algorithm can also exactly identify a decision tree of depth d in time polynomial in 2(d) and n. This result implies that trees of logarithmic depth can be identified in polynomial time.

J	HEATH, D; KASIF, S				HEATH, D; KASIF, S			THE COMPLEXITY OF FINDING MINIMAL VORONOI COVERS WITH APPLICATIONS TO MACHINE LEARNING	COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Our goal in this paper is to examine the application of Voronoi diagrams, a fundamental concept of computational geometry, to the nearest neighbor algorithm used in machine learning. We consider the question ''Given a planar polygonal tessellation T and an integer k, is there a set of k points whose Voronoi diagram contains every edge in T?'' We show that this question is NP-hard. We encountered this problem while studying a learning model in which we seek the minimum sized set of training examples needed to teach a given geometric concept to a nearest neighbor learning program. That is, given a concept which can be described by a planar tessellation, we are seeking to construct the smallest set of points whose Voronoi diagram is consistent with the given tessellation. In a sense, this question captures the difficulty of teaching the nearest neighbor algorithm a simple structure, using a minimal number of examples. In addition, we consider the natural inverse to the problem of computing Voronoi diagrams. Given a planar polygonal tessellation T, we describe an algorithm to find a set of points whose Voronoi diagram is T, if such a set exists.

Therefore, one needs to be able to differentiate low/high fault frequency components so that testing/verification effort can be concentrated where needed. Such a strategy is expected to detect more faults and thus improve the resulting reliability of the overall system. This paper presents the Optimized Set Reduction approach for constructing such models, intended to fulfill specific software-engineering needs. Our approach to classification is to measure the software system and build multivariate stochastic models for predicting high-risk system components. We present experimental results obtained by classifying Ada components into two classes: is or is not likely to generate faults during system and acceptance test.

There are currently two major approaches to process planning: the ''variant'' and the ''generative'' approaches. Each has advantages and deficiencies. Our hypothesis was that EBL could successfully unite these apparently disparate approaches. Weak method AI planning can be viewed as subscribing to the generative notion of process planning. Skeletal planning, on the other hand, has much in common with the variant approach. EBL can be employed to transition a traditional weak method planner into a strong method skeletal planner by acquiring strong method concepts which are generalized weak-method explanations of observed episodes. Thus, it would seem to be a natural vehicle to unite variant and generative process planning. We implemented a learning process planner, called EXBLIPP, to test our hypothesis. We found that the system possesses many of the intended advantages. In particular, we demonstrate that the EBL capability enables the process planning system to learn new schemata which yield many of the advantages of variant process planning. Unfortunately, the acquired concepts also manifest an inability to respond to unpredictable features of the environment. Such attributes are unavoidable in process planning applications which require nontrivial scheduling decisions. The root of the problem can be traced to the fact that standard EBL forces all nonoperational decisions to be made a priori, thus leading to a brittleness that greatly limits the benefits of the acquired concepts. We were able to overcome this deficiency through the use of a technique called contingent explanation-based learning. This was implemented as an extension to EXBLIPP. By deferring certain planning decisions until execution time, the extended EXBLIPP is able to adapt to the dynamic environment of a manufacturing system. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach in the context of integrated planning and scheduling. We speculate on how the techniques might be pushed to integrate control decision as well.

J	GREENWOOD, AG; REES, LP; CROUCH, IWM				GREENWOOD, AG; REES, LP; CROUCH, IWM			SEPARATING THE ART AND SCIENCE OF SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION - A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ARCHITECTURE PROVIDING FOR MACHINE LEARNING	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; OPTIMUM-SEEKING	The purpose of this paper is to develop an architecture for simulation optimization, building on the work we published in this journal in 1985. The need for a dramatically updated architecture is established by examining the simulation optimization process, traditional approaches to die problem, and difficulties inherent with these methodologies. Our framework directly addresses these problems by exploiting concepts and technologies introduced that have become popular in the last ten years, such as expert systems, to capture heuristic opinions and experience, and neural networks, to introduce machine learning. Three main contributions result from this research. First, the simulation optimization process is examined from a completely new perspective-a strategic overview of the process leads to an unbundling of the ''art'' and ''science'' elements that are co-mingled in current practice, thereby promoting modularity and making the other two contributions possible. Second, the newly unbundled process is translated to a knowledge-based context facilitating the direct inclusion of human expertise. The third contribution of this paper is the incorporation of machine learning into the framework thus permitting the optimizer to teach itself from its experiences.

J	JANIKOW, CZ				JANIKOW, CZ			A KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR SUPERVISED LEARNING	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						GENETIC ALGORITHMS; MACHINE LEARNING; SYMBOLIC LEARNING; SUPERVISED LEARNING		Supervised learning in attribute-based spaces is one of the most popular machine learning problems studied and, consequently, has attracted considerable attention of the genetic algorithm community. The full-memory approach developed here uses the same high-level descriptive language that is used in rule-based systems. This allows for an easy utilization of inference rules of the well-known inductive learning methodology, which replace the traditional domain-independent operators and make the search task-specific. Moreover, a closer relationship between the underlying task and the processing mechanisms provides a setting for an application of more powerful task-specific heuristics. Initial results obtained with a prototype implementation for the simplest case of single concepts indicate that genetic algorithms can be effectively used to process high-level concepts and incorporate task-specific knowledge. The method of abstracting the genetic algorithm to the problem level, described here for the supervised inductive learning, can be also extended to other domains and tasks, since it provides a framework for combining recently popular genetic algorithm methods with traditional problem-solving methodologies. Moreover, in this particular case, it provides a very powerful tool enabling study of the widely accepted but not so well understood inductive learning methodology.

This question has become increasingly important as people have tried to apply the GA to ever more diverse types of problems. Much previous work on this question has studied the relationship between GA performance and the structure of a given fitness function when it is expressed as a Walsh polynomial. The work of Bethke, Goldberg, and others has produced certain theoretical results about this relationship. In this article we review these theoretical results, and then discuss a number of seemingly anomalous experimental results reported by Tanese concerning the performance of the GA on a subclass of Walsh polynomials, some members of which were expected to be easy for the GA to optimize. Tanese found that the GA was poor at optimizing all functions in this subclass, that a partitioning of a single large population into a number of smaller independent populations seemed to improve performance, and that hillclimbing outperformed both the original and partitioned forms of the GA on these functions. These results seemed to contradict several commonly held expectations about GAs. We begin by reviewing schema processing in GAs. We then give an informal description of how Walsh analysis and Bethke's Walsh-schema transform relate to GA performance, and we discuss the relevance of this analysis for GA applications in optimization and machine learning. We then describe Tanese's surprising results, examine them experimentally and theoretically, and propose and evaluate some explanations. These explanations lead to a more fundamental question about GAs: what are the features of problems that determine the likelihood of successful GA performance?

The profile of a corn kernel was sampled into a sequence of one-dimensional digital signals based on its binary image. Shape parameters were selected by analyzing the kernel profile and were sent into a machine learning algorithm to train for a shape membership function of broken versus whole kernel. This system provided successful classifications of 99% for 720 whole kernels and 96% for 720 broken flat kernels, and of 91% for 720 whole kernels and 95% for 720 broken round kernels, respectively.

The average prediction profile showed flat plateaux separated by minima that appeared about every 40 residues and could result from the duplication of an ancestral gene coding for an alpha-helix. Analysis of staggered and unstaggered tropomyosin models through empirical scoring methods led to results similar to previous results from molecular dynamics calculations. This demonstrates the ability of empirical scoring methods to correctly evaluate protein models. Using both energy calculations and empirical scores, the unstaggered molecular dynamics model was slightly favored over the 14 residues staggered model.

J	KONONENKO, I				KONONENKO, I			INDUCTIVE AND BAYESIAN LEARNING IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Although successful in medical diagnostic problems, inductive learning systems were not widely accepted in medical practice. In this paper two different approaches to machine learning in medical applications are compared: the system for inductive learning of decision trees Assistant, and the naive Bayesian classifier. Both methodologies were tested in four medical diagnostic problems: localization of primary tumor, prognostics of recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosis of thyroid diseases, and rheumatology. The accuracy of automatically acquired diagnostic knowledge from stored data records is compared, and the interpretation of the knowledge and the explanation ability of the classification process of each system is discussed. Surprisingly, the naive Bayesian classifier is superior to Assistant in classification accuracy and explanation ability, while the interpretation of the acquired knowledge seems to be equally valuable. In addition, two extensions to naive Bayesian classifier are briefly described: dealing with continuous attributes, and discovering the dependencies among attributes.

J	SHARKEY, NE; SHARKEY, AJC				SHARKEY, NE; SHARKEY, AJC			ADAPTIVE GENERALIZATION	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETS; TRANSFER OF TRAINING; HYPERPLANE METHOD; MACHINE LEARNING		Adaptive generalisation is the ability to use prior knowledge in the performance of novel tasks. Thus, if we are to model intelligent behaviour with neural nets, they must be able to generalise across task domains. Our objective is to elucidate the aetiology of transfer of information between connectionist nets. First, a method is described that provides a standardised score for the quantification of how much task structure a net has extracted, and to what degree knowledge has been transferred between tasks. This method is then applied in three simulation studies to examine Input-to-Hidden (IH) and Hidden-to-Output (HO) decision hyperplanes as determinants of transfer effects. In the first study, positive transfer is demonstrated between functions that require the vertices of their spaces to be divided similarly, and negative transfer between functions that require decision regions of different shapes. In the other two studies, input and output similarity are varied independently in a series of paired associate learning tasks. Further explanation of transfer effects is provided through the use of a new technique that permits better visualisation of the entire computational space by showing both the relative position of inputs in Hidden Unit space, and the HO decision regions implemented by the set of weights.

The data is output from automatic test equipment which is used to test every board subsequent to manufacture. The use of a conventional machine-learning technique produced only limited success due to the very large search space of failure reports. This also ruled out the use of a conventional knowledge-based approach. In addition, there was a requirement to track changes in printed circuit board design and manufacture which also ruled out a conventional knowledge-based approach. The investigations led to the development of a system which tracks changes by learning in a more restricted search space derived from the original space of reports. The system performs a diagnosis by matching a failure report with information about previously seen reports. The matching rules used are heuristic. The system uses basic circuit connectivity information in conjunction with the matching procedure to improve diagnostic performance, especially in cases where matching fails to identify a unique component.

In the particular case that we outline, P is the set of protein sequences in a protein sequence database matching a given protein sequence pattern, whereas phi is a query in the annotation of the database. Ideally, phi is the description of a biological function. If the extension of phi is very similar to P, we may infer association between the pattern and the biological function described by the query. We have developed an algorithm that efficiently searches the query space when negation is not considered. Since the query language is a first-order language, the query space may be mapped into a set algebra in which a measure of stochastic dependence-an assymptotic approximation of the correlation coefficient-is used as a measure of set similarity. The algorithm uses the algebraic properties of such a measure to reduce the time required to search the query space. A prototype implementation of the algorithm has been tested in different collections of protein sequence patterns. Results obtained show that appropriate descriptions for known biologically meaningful protein sequence patterns are found efficiently. We finally describe an application of the algorithm in which the database is automatically and exhaustively searched for potentially relevant protein sequence patterns, and we report a few interesting discoveries obtained in a test case.

This paper represents a binary relation between a set of size n and a set of size m as an n x m matrix of bits whose (i, j) entry is 1 if and only if the relation holds between the corresponding elements of the two sets. Polynomial prediction algorithms are presented for learning binary relations in an extended on-line learning model, where the examples are drawn by the learner, by a helpful teacher, by an adversary, or according to a uniform probability distribution on the instance space, The first part of this paper presents results for the case in which the matrix of the relation has at most k row types. It presents upper and lower bounds on the number of prediction mistakes any prediction algorithm makes when learning such a matrix under the extended on-line learning model. Furthermore, it describes a technique that simplifies the proof of expected mistake bounds against a randomly chosen query sequence. In the second part of this paper the problem of learning a binary relation that is a total order on a set is considered. A general technique using a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (fpras) to implement a randomized version of the halving algorithm is described.

To stimulate the discussion, the participation was limited to 40 researchers who are involved in fundamental research in rough set theory and its extensions, logic for approximate reasoning, machine learning, knowledge representation and transfer, and applications of rough set methodology. The workshop focused primarily on applications of the basic idea of the approximate definition of a set and its consequences in other areas of science and engineering. Applications discussed at the workshop included machine learning, medical diagnosis, fault detection, medical image processing, neural net training, database organization, drug research, and digital circuit design.

J	QUARTZ, SR				QUARTZ, SR			NEURAL NETWORKS, NATIVISM, AND THE PLAUSIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTION	COGNITION			English	Article							MULTILAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; LANGUAGE	Recent interest in PDP (parallel distributed processing) models is due in part to the widely held belief that they challenge many of the assumptions of classical cognitive science. In the domain of language acquisition, for example, there has been much interest in the claim that PDP models might undermine nativism. Related arguments based on PDP learning have also been given against Fodor's anti-constructivist position - a position that has contributed to the widespread dismissal of constructivism. A limitation of many of the claims regarding PDP learning, however, is that the principles underlying this learning have not been rigorously characterized. In this paper, I examine PDP models from within the framework of Valiant's PAC (probably approximately correct) model of learning, now the dominant model in machine learning, and which applies naturally to neural network learning. From this perspective, I evaluate the implications of PDP models for nativism and Fodor's influential anti-constructivist position. In particular, I demonstrate that, contrary to a number of claims, PDP models are nativist in a robust sense. I also demonstrate that PDP models actually serve as a good illustration of Fodor's anti-constructivist position. While these results may at first suggest that neural network models in general are incapable of the sort of concept acquisition that is required to refute Fodor's anti-constructivist position, I suggest that there is an alternative form of neural network learning that demonstrates the plausibility of constructivism. This alternative form of learning is a natural interpretation of the constructivist position in terms of neural network learning, as it employs learning algorithms that incorporate the addition of structure in addition to weight modification schemes. By demonstrating that there is a natural and plausible interpretation of constructivism in terms of neural network learning, the position that nativism is the only plausible model of acquisition can no longer be defended. Indeed, I briefly discuss a number of learning-theoretic reasons indicating that constructivist models so characterized uniquely possess a number of important learning characteristics.

J	GUPAL, AM; PONOMAREV, AA; TSVETKOV, AM				GUPAL, AM; PONOMAREV, AA; TSVETKOV, AM			ON A METHOD OF INDUCTIVE INFERENCE WITH DECISIONTREE PRUNING	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS ANALYSIS			English	Note								Recent years have been characterized by attempts to introduce expert systems designed for the solution of poorly formulated problems into such areas as chemistry, biology, medicine, economics, and sociology [1]. Poorly formulated problems are those that cannot be solved by means of conventional computer models that can be described by linear, nonlinear, differential, partial differential, or other equations. The heart of an expert system is knowledge of a subject area that has been accumulated in the process of its construction. The formation of a knowledge base is a most complicated, prolonged, and time-consuming process, same many qualified experts in a given subject area must be called upon. The construction phase of first-generation expert systems has been completed. The expert systems of the second and subsequent generations must contain automatic procedures for the generation of hypotheses (knowledge) from data that will increase the intellectual power of the expert. When it is difficult or impossible to obtain knowledge from an expert, the hypothesis generator becomes the only means of knowledge-base formation. For this reason, the interest in methods of inductive inference from data (machine learning) has increased considerably in recent years. Several productive trends in the development of inductive-inference methods have been developed [2-4]. An approach of great promise involves the construction of decision trees.

The problem processing components of DSSs that subscribe to existing DSS paradigms typically utilize supervised learning strategies to acquire problem processing knowledge (PPK). On the other hand, the problem processor of an Adaptive DSS utilizes unsupervised inductive learning, perhaps in addition to other forms of learning, to acquire some of the necessary PPK Thus, Adaptive DSSs are, to some extent, self-teaching systems with comparatively less reliance on external agents for PPK acquisition. To illustrate these notions, we examine an application in the domain concerned with the scheduling of jobs in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). We provide an architectural description for an Adaptive DSS for supporting static scheduling decisions in FMSs. We illustrate key problem processing features of the system using an example. A prototype system, based on this architecture, is currently under implementation.

This paper discusses organizational learning in the extended enterprise: consisting of the turbulent competitive/political environment of threats and opportunities, and the organization's internal environment - traditionally consisting of people and their institutions - extended to include the information technology platform. Here, internal and external policies need to be modeled for an effective adaptation of the enterprise. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods are applied to organizational design in monitoring and analyzing decisions based on the impact and structure of the organization - monitoring changes as part of the learning and adaptation cycle.

One of the crucial characteristics of such support is systems that are capable of improving their performance, both in terms of efficiency and solution quality, by employing machine learning techniques. A framework for intelligent computer-supported conflict resolution through negotiation/mediation is presented. The model integrates Artificial Intelligence methods (case-based reasoning) and decision theoretic techniques (multi-attribute utilities) to provide enhanced conflict resolution and negotiation support in group problem solving. This model has been implemented in the PER-SUADER, a computer program which operates in the domain of resolution of labor management disputes. The PER-SUADER uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to learn from its experience. In contrast to quantitative models or expert systems that solve each problem from scratch and discard the solution at the end of problem solving, CBR retains the process and results of its computational decisions so that they can be re-used to solve future related problems. CBR is a powerful learning method since it enables a system not only to exploit previous successful decisions, thus short-cutting possibly long reasoning chains, but also to profit from previous failures by using them to recognize similar failures in advance so they can be avoided in the future. As the state of the art in DSS development advances and as DSSs support increasingly more complicated tasks, such machine learning techniques will become an indispensable part of decision support systems.

J	LIANG, TP				LIANG, TP			ANALOGICAL REASONING AND CASE-BASED LEARNING IN MODEL MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						ANALOGICAL REASONING; MACHINE LEARNING; MODEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; CASE-BASED REASONING		Developing computer-based model management systems has been a focus of recent research in decision support. In this paper, we explore the use of analogical reasoning and case-based learning in model management. Analogical reasoning and case-based learning are techniques found useful in human problem solving. They can help model builders apply their modeling experience to construct new models and improve their modeling knowledge through learning. This paper presents a feasible approach to incorporate case-based analogical reasoning in model management systems. First, the role of analogical reasoning and case-based learning in model management is described. A scheme for representing case features is presented. Then, problem and model similarities are discussed at conceptual, structural, and functional levels. This is followed by a description of the process for analogical model formulation, which includes feature mapping, transformation, and evaluation. Finally, examples are illustrated and case-based learning is discussed.

J	TAM, KY				TAM, KY			APPLYING CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING TO KNOWLEDGE-BASED CONSTRUCTION	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING; MACHINE LEARNING; EXPERT SYSTEMS; CATEGORY UTILITY		Concept hierarchy is a common approach to organizing structural knowledge in expert systems because of its efficient mechanism to store and generalize a large body of interrelated concepts. Construction of a concept hierarchy, however, is still an unstructured manual process. This laborious process, which is usually conducted by interviewing with human experts, is generally regarded as the bottleneck in developing an expert system. In this paper, a conceptual clustering approach to automatically generating a concept hierarchy is presented. Details of the automated Process are illustrated with an experimental system. Initial findings obtained from this study indicate that: (1) construction of concept hierarchy can be automated; (2) inference making can be accomplished by partial matching; (3) conceptual clustering can be used as a general modeling tool in other management disciplines.

J	LEWIS, M				LEWIS, M			ASSESSING DECISION HEURISTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						EMPIRICAL LEARNING; COGNITIVE MODELING; SKILLED DECISIONS	MANEUVERS; KNOWLEDGE	In decision making, automatization associated with 'skill' contributes to the discrepancies often found between actual and reported use of information. Designing decision support systems (DSS) to assist skilled decision making is complicated by this lack of accessible models. This paper proposes a model of skilled decision making in which tacit heuristics define simplified situations within which skilled decisions are made. Heuristics employed in decision making are identified from qualitative representations of past decisions using machine learning. These heuristics can then be matched with performance criteria to identify conditions under which the user may need supplemental aiding. This use of machine learning to identify 'buggy' models of human performance has proved very difficult even for simple tasks such as subtraction. We argue that skilled interaction with real-time systems provides a special case in which the learning problem can he simplified sufficiently to allow user modelling of adequate quality for decision support. Our approach is illustrated in assessments of decision heuristics used by pilots in avoiding intruding aircraft and for operators of a simulated process plant. The ability to adapt decision support functions to complement the decision making processes of skilled users is argued to he essential to providing them effective support Attribute-based machine learning methods are proposed as a feasible mechanism for achieving this goal.

FMS-DSS differs from traditional DSSs in that it can acquire scheduling and control knowledge from historical data comprising prior decisions. This knowledge is applied to support subsequent decision making. It manages complexity through hierarchically structuring the user's objectives, and can deal with noise in the form of missing, inaccurate, or erroneous data. Results indicate that a machine learning based approach can provide effective support for repetitive real-time decision making and outperform static scheduling rules.

Organizations commonly rely on human expertise to solve such problems. Human expertise is presumed to utilize specialized knowledge structures, and recent research in artificial intelligence has sought to devise machine-learning procedures that can derive knowledge structures from sets of data that represent problem-domain exemplars. Concurrently, research in statistical methods has resulted in the development of qualitative-response models that can be applied to some of the same kinds of problems addressed by machine-learning models-especially those that involve a classification decision. Using a difficult audit decision problem requiring expertise, this paper reports on a study comparing performance of two machine-learning algorithms and logistic regression, a widely-used qualitative-response method for classification analysis. A recently-developed machine-learning algorithm, NEWQ, is found to yield the best performance characteristics.

J	SZCZERBICKI, E				SZCZERBICKI, E			ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE FOR AUTONOMOUS COOPERATING AGENTS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article							DECISION SUPPORT; EXPERT-SYSTEMS; INTELLIGENCE; DESIGN	In an organizational context autonomous agents consist of groups of people, machines, robots, and/or guided vehicles tied hy the flow of information between an agent and its external environment as well as within an agent. Mathematical modeling is used to evaluate such an information flow. The evaluation of an information flow is performed for different types of external and internal environments. Two major cases are taken into account, i.e., static and dynamic processes describing the external environment. Such issues as the role of correlation as well as interaction and the losses caused by incomplete and delayed information are addressed. Only actions that are described by real numbers and utility functions that are twice differentiable are considered. The results of the model-based evaluation of an information flow in different decision situations are formulated as IF ... AND ... THEN rules that provide some useful knowledge about autonomous agents functioning. Generation of such knowledge is an important factor in successful implementation of ideas related to atomized organizations and provides a bridge into the distributed systems and artificial intelligence (AI) communities. To support the development of such a bridge, an approach is suggested that combines knowledge expressed by traditional IF ... THEN rules with machine learning technique based on the training of a neural network. A three-layer neural configuration is used. It is demonstrated that the use of networks shows promise as a tool for the development of information structure for autonomous agents. The concepts included in the paper are illustrated with examples providing interpretation and relation to real situations.

A genetic algorithm is employed to derive control rules encoded as decision tables. Next, the rules are automatically transformed into comprehensible form by means of inductive machine learning. Finally, a genetic algorithm is applied again to optimize the numerical parameters of the induced rules. The approach is experimentally verified on a benchmark problem of inverted pendulum control, with special emphasis on robustness and reliability. It is also shown that the proposed framework enables exploiting available domain knowledge. In this case, genetic algorithm makes qualitative control rules operational by providing interpretation of symbols in terms of numerical values.

The present paper considers identification of r.e. languages by machines that have access to membership oracles for noncomputable sets. It is shown that for any set A there exists another set B such that the collections of re. languages that can be identified by machines with access to a membership oracle for B is strictly larger than the collections of r.e. languages that can be identified by machines with access to a membership oracle for A. In other words, there is no maximal inference degree for language identification.

Passive techniques observe users whereas active techniques query users. User-initiated techniques require that users volunteer information; automatic techniques do not. The logical/plausible dimension measures the accuracy of derived user model data. Indirect techniques build upon data gathered by more direct methods. On-line techniques acquire user models in real-time during user interaction, while off-line techniques work after the user interaction is finished. Commonalities and differences in capabilities and features of different user model acquisition techniques are analyzed along the above dimensions, and the relationship of these techniques to similar techniques in other areas of artificial intelligence are discussed.

The activation patterns (or . desired outputs) consisted of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals from the semitendinosus and vastus medialis muscles. The inputs consisted of flexion and extension angles measured at the hip and knee of the ipsilateral leg, their first and second derivatives, and bilateral foot contact information. The training set consisted of data from six trials, at two different speeds. The testing set consisted of data from two additional trials (one at each speed), which were not in the training set. It was possible to reconstruct the muscular activation at both speeds using both techniques. Timing of the reconstructed signals was accurate. The integrated value of the activation bursts was less accurate. The neural network gave a continuous output, whereas the rule-based inductive learning rule tree gave a quantised activation level. The advantage of rule-based inductive learning was that the rules used were both explicit and comprehensible, whilst the rules used by the neural network were implicit within its structure and not easily comprehended. The neural network was able to reconstruct the activation patterns of both muscles from one network, whereas two separate rule sets were needed for the rule-based technique. It is concluded that machine learning techniques, in comparison to explicit inverse muscular skeletal models, show good promise in modelling nearly cyclic movements such as locomotion at varying walking speeds. However, they do not provide insight into the biomechanics of the system, because they are not based, on the biomechanical structure of the system.

Machine learning is an area concerned with the automation of this process of knowledge acquisition. Neural networks generally represent their knowledge at the lower level, while knowledge-based systems use higher-level knowledge representations. The method we propose here provides a technique that automatically allows us to extract conjunctive rules from the lower-level representation used by neural networks. The strength of neural networks in dealing with noise has enabled us to produce correct rules in a noisy domain. Thus we propose a method that uses neural networks as the basis for the automation of knowledge acquisition and can be applied to noisy, real-world domains. (C) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Previous work in adapting caches for theorem proving relies on the use of unlimited-size caches. We show how unlimited-size caches are unsuitable in application contexts where resource-limited theorem provers are used to solve multiple problems from a single problem distribution. We introduce bounded-overhead caches, that is, those caches that contain at most a fixed number of entries and entail a fixed amount of overhead per lookup, and we examine cache design issues for bounded-overhead caches. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of bounded-overhead cache performance, relying on a specially designed experimental methodology that separates hardware-dependent, implementation-dependent, and domain-dependent effects.

J	GALLAND, CC				GALLAND, CC			THE LIMITATIONS OF DETERMINISTIC BOLTZMANN MACHINE LEARNING	NETWORK-COMPUTATION IN NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article							SOLVABLE MODEL; SPIN GLASS	The stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM) learning procedure allows a system of stochastic binary units at thermal equilibrium to model arbitrary probabilistic distributions of binary vectors, but the inefficiency inherent in stochastic simulations limits its usefulness. By employing mean field theory, the stochastic settling to thermal equilibrium can be replaced by efficient deterministic settling to a steady state. The analogous deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learning rule performs steepest descent in an appropriately defined error measure under certain circumstances and has been empirically shown to solve a variety of non-trivial supervised, input-output problems. However, by applying 'naive' mean field theory to a finite system with non-random interactions, the true stochastic system is not well described, and representational problems result that significantly limit the situations in which the DBM procedure can be successfully applied. It is shown that the independence assumption is unacceptably inaccurate in multiple hidden layer configurations, thus accounting for the empirically observed failure of DBM learning in such networks. Further restrictions in network architecture are suggested that maximize the utility of the supervised DBM procedure, but its inherent limitations are shown to be quite severe. An analogous system based on the TAP equations is also discussed.		GALLAND, CC (reprint author), UNIV TORONTO,DEPT PHYS,60 ST GEORGE ST,TORONTO M5S 1A7,ONTARIO,CANADA.

The method is based on sampling the input-output behavior of the target formula on a probability distribution that is determined by the fixed point of the formula's amplification function (defined as the probability that a one is output by the formula when each input bit is one independently with probability p). By performing various statistical tests on easily sampled variants of the fixed-point distribution, it is possible to efficiently infer all structural information about any logarithmic-depth formula (with high probability). Results are applied to prove the existence of short universal identification sequences for large classes of formulas.

J	DIVER, DA				DIVER, DA			APPLICATIONS OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS TO THE SOLUTION OF ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION	A novel genetic algorithm has been developed and applied to the solution of ordinary differential equations. The algorithm solves the equations by a process of breeding better candidate solutions from a family of estimates, and learns to retain the best features as it progresses. This self-learning system is intrinsically parallel, and capable of handling linear and nonlinear equations, both stiff and non-stiff. Genetic algorithms are a key element in artificial intelligence and machine learning, playing a significant role in optimization and robotics. In this document, the application of genetic algorithms to the solution of ordinary differential equations is presented as a radically different way of approaching numerical simulations, and is of importance to many disciplines.

The design involves a unique combination of statistical and artificial intelligence techniques. First, a statistical preprocessing module identifies the content-bearing words. An expert system called the Topic Expert determines the subject areas of the document from these words by matching them to vocabularies characteristic of given subject areas. Another expert system, the Subject Specialist, using an enriched thesaurus, assigns final index terms according to the subject areas and the content-bearing words. Justification for the design is given and its advantages outlined. Topics such as choice of content indicators, the effect of stemming, and the identification of characteristic vocabularies for given subject areas are discussed, and some experimental results presented. The application of machine learning algorithms to the identification of vocabularies is also examined.

J	CHATURVEDI, AR				CHATURVEDI, AR			FMS SCHEDULING AND CONTROL - LEARNING TO ACHIEVE MULTIPLE GOALS	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article							FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; SHOP	This paper describes FMS-GDCA, a loosely coupled system using a machine learning paradigm known as goal-directed conceptual aggregation (GDCA) and simulation to address the problem of Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) scheduling for a given configuration and management goals. The main advantage of FMS-GDCA is that it provides a manufacturing manager with an extremely flexible and goal-seeking control mechanism that allows for a continuous improvement in decision outcomes. The manager can choose a goal or a combination of goals or can prioritize the partial goals by assigning weights. Given the goals, FMS-GDCA attempts to achieve them to the best of its ability. If it cannot meet the goals due to its lack of knowledge, it will acquire the relevant knowledge from data and solve the problem. The results indicate that FMS-GDCA can consistently produce improved overall performance over the traditional scheduling techniques.

(i) A new learning procedure suitable for LSI implementation is proposed. This is fully-on-line learning in which different sample patterns are presented in consecutive clamped and free phases and the weights are modified in each phase. This procedure is implemented without extra memories for learning operation, and reduces the chip area and power consumption for learning by 50 percent. (ii) Learning in a layer-type DBM with one output unit has characteristic local minima which reduce the effective number of available hidden units. Effective methods to avoid reaching these local minima are proposed. (iii) Although DBM learning is not suitable for mapping problems with analog target values, it is useful for analog data discrimination problems.

J	HEISE, R				HEISE, R			PROGRAMMING ROBOTS BY EXAMPLE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								This article presents a prototypical machine learning system (ETAR) that acquires programs for robot tasks. The long-term goal of this project is to discover how to make computer technology, in particular robots, more useful to (and controllable by) people in general. Rather than require programming expertise, the idea is to build a system that learns robot programs from users' examples. Thus the ETAR learning algorithm begins by sampling the robot path while a user physically leads it through the task. A general procedure, possibly containing loops, branches, and variables, is induced from these examples. The ETAR algorithm is novel because an implicit focus mechanism is used to control the entire generalization process. The focus forces ETAR to concentrate on the important domain objects, thus eliminating useless steps and translating the sampled sequence into a series of robot primitive motions. Loops and branches are introduced as the focus objects repeat or differ. Finally, robot positional variables are introduced as functions of the common characteristics of the objects in the focus. The programs that ETAR generates for three tasks-block stacking, obtaining an object with a certain characteristic, and sorting-are shown to provide an intuitive feel for the types of tasks that ETAR can learn. The article concludes with a general discussion of the current issues in programming by example and describes how this new learner is related to previous systems in this area. ETAR has been implemented on an Excalibur robot.		HEISE, R (reprint author), UNIV CALGARY,DEPT COMP SCI,CALGARY T2N 1N4,ALBERTA,CANADA.

It involves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns in engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the development of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with interpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for employing machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to contextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by normalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was developed and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine in a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers, gathered over a 12-second interval. There were eight classes of observations: seven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared two approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and instance-based learning. We have three main results.

Searching for Diverse, Cooperative Populations with Genetic Algorithms	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						genetic algorithms; classifier systems; fitness sharing; computational immunology; multimodal search		In typical applications, genetic algorithms (GAS) process populations of potential problem solutions to evolve a single population member that specifies an "optimized" solution. The majority of GA analysis has focused on these optimization applications. In other applications (notably learning classifier systems and certain connectionist learning systems), a GA searches for a population of cooperative structures that jointly perform a computational task. This paper presents an analysis of this type of GA problem. The analysis considers a simplified genetics-based machine learning system: a model of an immune system. In this model, a GA must discover a set of pattern-matching antibodies that effectively match a set of antigen patterns. Analysis shows how a GA can automatically evolve and sustain a diverse, cooperative population. The cooperation emerges as a natural part of the antigen-antibody matching procedure. This emergent effect is shown to be similar to fitness sharing, an explicit technique for multimodal GA optimization. Further analysis shows how the GA population can adapt to express various degrees of generalization. The results show how GAS can automatically and simultaneously discover effective groups of cooperative computational structures.

Fuzzy sets provide an interesting and powerful scheme of knowledge representation with its clear-cut logical properties. Neural networks with their superb learning capabilities play a primordial role in numerical processing. The synergy between these two paradigms will be studied. Two new classes of basic logic-oriented processing units (fuzzy neurons) will be introduced. The first one embraces aggregative neurons realizing OR, AND and mixed OR/AND operations. The neurons of the reference character constituting the second category of the processing units pertain to a referential character of processing that includes manipulation on binary relations of matching, difference, inclusion and dominance. The proposed architecture of logic processors implements the paradigm of distributed processing with the aid of logic-driven neurons. Various application domains (fuzzy controllers, machine learning, decision-making and distributed modelling) will be studied.

Our learning problem is that of finding p in p --> q with a given data sequence of q, written as {q(i), i = 1, 2,..., N}. Based on the concept of Zadeh's 'relative sigma-count', we formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization with 'sufficiency' and 'necessity' criteria. We give explicit formulae of the ideal evidence sequence {p(i)} and we analyze how the ideal sequence depends on different T-norm operations and the parameters specified in the criteria using Schweizer and Sklar's one parameter family of T-norms.

J	MICHALSKI, RS				MICHALSKI, RS			INFERENTIAL THEORY OF LEARNING AS A CONCEPTUAL BASIS FOR MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						LEARNING THEORY; MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING; INFERENCE; CLASSIFICATION OF INFERENCE; DEDUCTION; INDUCTION; ABDUCTION; GENERALIZATION; ABSTRACTION; ANALOGY; TRANSMUTATION		In view of a great proliferation of machine learning methods and paradigms, there is a need for a general conceptual framework that would explain their interrelationships and provide a basis for their integration into multistrategy learning systems. This article presents initial results on the Inferential Theory of Learning that aims at developing such a framework, with the primary emphasis on explaining logical capabilities of learning systems, i.e., their competence. The theory views learning as a goal-oriented process of modifying the learner's knowledge by exploring the learner's experience. Such a process is described as a search through a knowledge space, conducted by applying knowledge transformation operators, called knowledge transmutations. Transmutations can be performed using any type of inference-deduction, induction, or analogy. Several fundamental pairs of transmutations are presented in a novel and very general way. These include generalization and specialization, explanation and prediction, abstraction and concretion, and similization and dissimilization. Generalization and specialization transmutations change the reference set of a description (the set of entities being described). Explanations and predictions derive additional knowledge about the reference set (explanatory or predictive). Abstractions and concretions change the level of detail in describing a reference set. Similizations and dissimilizations hypothesize knowledge about a reference set based on its similarity or dissimilarity with another reference set. The theory provides a basis for multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL), which is outlined and illustrated by an example. MTL dynamically adapts strategies to the learning task, defined by the input information, the learner's background knowledge, and the learning goal. It aims at synergistically integrating a wide range of inferential learning strategies, such as empirical and constructive inductive generalization, deductive generalization, abductive derivation, abstraction, similization, and others.

J	MORIK, K				MORIK, K			BALANCED COOPERATIVE MODELING	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING; BALANCED COOPERATIVE MODELING; MOBAL		Machine learning techniques are often used for supporting a knowledge engineer in constructing a model of part of the world. Different learning algorithms contribute to different tasks within the modeling process. Integrating several learning algorithms into one system allows it to support several modeling tasks within the same framework. In this article, we focus on the distribution of work between several learning algorithms on the one hand and the user on the other hand. The approach followed by the MOBAL system is that of balanced cooperation, i.e., each modeling task can be done by the user or by a learning tool of the system. The MOBAL system is described in detail. We discuss the principle of multi-functionality of one representation for the balanced use by learning algorithms and users.

It has been seen as a feasible way of avoiding the knowledge bottleneck problem in knowledge-based systems development. Research on machine learning has concentrated in the main on inductive learning. This paper surveys the current inductive learning research. The three typical inductive algorithms, AQ11, ID3 and HCV, are summarized with their main features being analyzed and three research frontiers, i.e., constructive learning, incremental learning and learning from data bases, in inductive learning are introduced.

J	ALNAHI, H; ALSHAWI, S				ALNAHI, H; ALSHAWI, S			KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN BIOMEDICAL DATABASES - A MACHINE INDUCTION APPROACH	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						MACHINE LEARNING; INDUCTION; DATABASES; KNOWLEDGE; RULES; PROTEIN PRIMARY SECONDARY STRUCTURES; AMINO ACID RESIDUES	SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE	The increase in the number and size of available databases by far exceeds the growth of the corresponding knowledge. Furthermore, many databases contain information which is not possessed by an existing human expert. This creates both a need and an opportunity for extracting knowledge from databases. An unsolved problem in molecular biology is the problem of predicting a protein's secondary structure from its primary structure. Inductive machine learning is a search for a plausible general description which can explain the given input data, and is useful for predicting new data. In this paper we present a statistical inductive algorithm which can be used to produce new rules for predicting multiple protein secondary structures from protein primary structure databases.

The methodology suggests to use a manual interview technique first and, then, to apply a machine learning program to structure the elicited information. In this way the experts are free of expressing their knowledge in a familiar format; on the other hand, the automated processing helps the knowledge engineer formalize knowledge. This interaction between manual and automatic techniques is particularly useful when the expert meets with difficulties in formulating general rules and prefers, instead, to reason by cases. The application of the methodology to an image interpretation task, namely speech spectrogram reading, is described as a test case.

The system, ENIGMA, used in the experimentation, is an incremental version of the ML-SMART system, which acquires a network of first-order logic rules, starting from a set of classified examples and a domain theory. The application described in this paper has been selected, among several others, for its particular significance, both in terms of complexity of the solved problem and in terms of the obtained industrial benefits. The problem has been supplied by the ENICHEM Company and consists in discovering malfunctions in electromechanical apparata. ENIGMA's efficacy in acquiring sophisticated knowledge and handling complex structured examples is largely due to its underlying database management system, which supports the learning operators, defined at the abstract level, with a set of primitives, taken from the field of deductive databases. This database layer serves the additional goal of easing the interaction between the learning module and an information system, currently used at ENICHEM to directly store the data measured in field. An expert system, MEPS, devoted to the same task, has also been manually developed. Then, a number of comparisons along different dimensions of the manual and automatic development process have been possible, allowing some practical indications to be suggested.

In this paper, an efficient induction method is developed for learning quantitative rules in relational databases. With the assistance of knowledge about concept hierarchies, data relevance, and expected rule forms, attribute-oriented induction can be performed on the database, which integrates database operations with the learning process and provides a simple, efficient way of learning quantitative rules from large databases. Our method learns both characteristic rules and classification rules. Quantitative information facilitates quantitative reasoning, incremental learning, and learning in the presence of noise. Moreover, learning qualitative rules can be treated as a special case of learning quantitative rules. Our paper shows that attribute-oriented induction provides an efficient and effective mechanism for learning various kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases.

The goals of the workshop are to identify applications, research problems, and designs of HPCC systems for supporting applications in these areas. In computer vision, we have identified the main scientific issues as machine learning, surface reconstruction, inverse optics and integration, model acquisition, and perception and action. Since vision algorithms operate in different levels of granularity, computers for supporting these algorithms need to be heterogeneous and modular. Advances in technology, new architectural concepts, and software design methods are essential for this area. In SNLP, we have identified issues in statistical analysis in corpus-based speech and language understanding, search strategies for language analysis, auditory and vocal-tract modeling, integration of multiple levels of speech and language analyses, and connectionist systems. Similar to algorithms in computer vision, algorithms in SNLP require high computational power, ranging from general purpose supercomputing to special purpose VLSI systems. As processing has various requirements, a hybrid heterogeneous computer system is the most desirable. In AI, important issues that need immediate attention include the development of efficient machine learning and heuristic search methods that can adapt to different architectural configurations, and the design and construction of scalable and verifiable knowledge bases, active memories, and artificial neural networks. A computer system for supporting AI applications is heterogeneous, requiring research in high-speed computer networks, mass storage and efficient retrieval methods, computer languages, and hardware and software design tools. Research in these areas is inherently multidisciplinary and will require active participation of researchers in device and networking technologies, signal processing, computer architecture, software engineering, and knowledge engineering. Besides extending current frontiers in research, an important aspect to be emphasized is the integration of existing components and results into working systems.

The approach integrates direct-methods and artificial-intelligence strategies to rephrase the structure determination process as an exercise in scene analysis. A general joint probability distribution framework, which allows the incorporation of isomorphous replacement, anomalous scattering and a priori structural information, forms the basis of the direct-methods strategies. The accumulated knowledge, on crystal and molecular structures is exploited through the use of artificial-intelligence strategies, which include techniques of knowledge representation, search and machine learning.

J	REICH, Y				REICH, Y			A MODEL OF AESTHETIC JUDGMENT IN DESIGN	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						AESTHETIC JUDGMENT; RATIONALISM; ROMANTICISM; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; DESIGN ADAPTATION; MACHINE LEARNING; BRIDGE DESIGN		Aesthetics plays a major role in real design. To date, aesthetics is mostly ignored in studies dealing with computational design support systems. Probably the main reason for this omission is that aesthetics is tightly associated with art, which is perceived to be beyond the capabilities, of computational techniques. The paper outlines a model for the incorporation of aesthetic judgment in design. It shows how important aesthetic criteria that follow the rationalistic and the romanticist movements of aesthetics, can be represented, refined, and used in design. BRIDGER, a system that assists in the preliminary design of cable-stayed bridges, implements a preliminary version of this model. Several examples of designs generated by BRIDGER are discussed for demonstrating the scope and potential of the model. The most significant investigations in bridge aesthetics deal primarily with fundamental philosophical and psychological problems or direct aesthetic analysis of existing bridges, providing relatively few basic concepts for use in design (see Ref).

J	BRATKO, I				BRATKO, I			MACHINE LEARNING IN ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Among several forms of learning, learning concepts from examples is the most common and best understood. In this paper some approaches to learning concepts from examples are reviewed. In particular those approaches that are currently most important with respect to practical applications (learning decision trees and if-then rules), or likely to become very important in the near future (Inductive Logic Programming as a form of relational learning) are discussed.

Invariably, this effort, while important at the early stages of the development of the field, cannot scale up to address real design problems since all existing techniques are based on simplifying assumptions that do not hold for real design. In particular, they do not address the dependence on context and multiple, often conflicting, interests that are constitutive of design. This paper analyzes the present situation and criticises a number of prevailing views. Subsequently, the paper offers an alternative approach whose goal is to advance the use of machine learning in design practice. The approach is partially integrated info a modeling system called n-dim. The use of machine learning in n-dim is presented and open research issues are outlined.

J	DUFFY, AHB; KERR, SM				DUFFY, AHB; KERR, SM			CUSTOMIZED PERSPECTIVES OF PAST DESIGNS FROM AUTOMATED GROUP RATIONALIZATIONS	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						PAST DESIGN UTILIZATION; CUSTOMIZED PERSPECTIVES; GROUP RATIONALIZATION; MACHINE LEARNING; DYNAMIC DESIGN TOOL		In this paper the case is presented that designers require different viewpoints from past designs and abstractions in order to facilitate the effective utilisation of past design knowledge. It highlights the need for a dynamic design tool capable of automating the rationalisation of past designs to suit a designer's particular needs. The rationalisation of past designs is motivated by the belief that, within the abundant explicit information of individual past designs, there exists a wealth of implicit knowledge which should be made explicitly available to the designer. Current approaches to utilising past design knowledge do not support the automatic generation of customised design perspectives. This is partly realised in this paper by the application of a clustering approach to rationalise past design examples into abstract groups. The results of this approach are compared with that of a case study and the paper concludes with a discussion on the utilisation of rationalisation in design.

J	REICH, Y				REICH, Y			THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRIDGER - A METHODOLOGICAL STUDY OF RESEARCH ON THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN DESIGN	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						RESEARCH METHODOLOGY; GENERIC LEARNING TASKS; MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING; CONCEPT FORMATION; BRIDGE DESIGN; SCIENTIFIC METHOD; DESIGN KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; DESIGN RATIONALE	PROGRAMS	Research is a design activity whose decisions involve the ways in which research is carried out and its results interpreted. These activities comprise what is referred to as research methodology. This paper brings the concepts of capturing design rationale and machine learning to bear on the design of research itself. Therefore, design decisions concerning research must be recorded to allow for understanding feedback and updating of research strategies. In addition, successes as well as failures of research decisions must be reported to facilitate learning about research. This requires a shift in the way research is carried out and reported. This paper illustrates this shift in the context of a specific project on machine learning in design.

Compared to RULES, the new algorithm generally is faster as it requires fewer rule searching operations in its induction process. Furthermore, it allows the user to specify the number of rules to be extracted, is able to deal with incomplete examples and can handle attributes with numerical as well as nominal values. The algorithm has been tested on several applications. Two of these applications, including the identification of a dynamic system, are described in the paper. The results obtained have demonstrated the strong performance of the algorithm.

We describe two algorithms that optimize scores expressing the propensity of a polypeptide sequence to adopt a local fold. The first algorithm generates secondary structure prediction rules based on a dictionary of geometrical patterns frequently found in the learning database. The second algorithm leads to scores that indicate the fit between an amino acid and a given local structural environment. Dynamic programming is then used to align structural information profiles by modifying the local mutation cost with the above learned functions. The main features of the system are exemplified on the structural prediction of the N-terminal domain of the CD4 antigen. Then the usefulness of additional 3-D information in the alignment is benchmarked on eight pairs of weakly homologous proteins.

J	LERMAN, IC				LERMAN, IC			LIKELIHOOD LINKAGE ANALYSIS (LLA) CLASSIFICATION METHOD - AN EXAMPLE TREATED BY HAND	BIOCHIMIE			English	Article						HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION; RELATIONAL ATTRIBUTES; PROBABILISTIC ASSOCIATION COEFFICIENTS; APPLICATION TO GENETIC SEQUENCES		This paper describes a very general method of data analysis using a hierarchical classification. The data can be provided by observation, experiment or knowledge; their nature can be numerical, qualitative or logical. First, the classical view of the context of data representation, in which the algorithm of hierarchical ascendant construction of the classification tree is set, is treated in a synthetic manner. The main notion in our method is one of 'similarity'. This must be elaborated in the best way, taking into account the mathematical nature of the objects to be compared. Here we adopt a set of theoretical and combinatorial representation of the descriptive attributes, which are interpreted in terms of relations. Then we introduce a probability scale for similarity measurement by using a likelihood concept. The largest part of the paper concerns an illustrating example, moderately sized, detailing very minutely the different steps and the different calculations assumed by the method. The data structure handled with this example is the simplest possible. Then, general aspects and methodological extensions are evoked. We end by indicating the interest of the described approach in future works, in which we are involved, concerning typological organization of genetic sequences. We emphasize the 'explanation' aspect of the obtained results, with respect to a given description. For this purpose, classifications (on the object set and on the attribute set) on the one hand and machine learning techniques on the other, intervene efficiently.

Various forms of simulated evolution, such as genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming techniques, have been used to generate machine learning through automated discovery. These methods have been applied to complex combinatorial optimization problems with varied degrees of success. The present paper relates the use of evolutionary programming on selected traveling salesman problems. In three test cases, solutions that are equal to or better than previously known best routings were discovered. In a 1000-city problem, the best evolved routing is about 5% longer than the expected optimum.

Simulation is used as the primary environment for modeling manufacturing systems and their processes. We propose an adaptive DSS framework for incorporating machine learning into the real time scheduling of a flexible manufacturing system and flexible flow system. The resulting DSS, referred to as pattern directed scheduling (PDS) system, has the unique characteristic of being an adaptive scheduler. While the bulk of previous research on dynamic machine scheduling deals with the relative effectiveness of a single scheduling rule, the approach presented in this study provides a mechanism for the state-dependent selection of one from among several rules. We address the PDS approach in the context of a model management system (MMS), with built-in simulation and inductive learning modules for heuristic acquisition and refinement. These modules complement each other in performing the decision support functions. Computational results show that such a pattern directed scheduling approach leads to superior system performance. It also provides a new frame-work for developing adaptive DSS.

GDCA-II employs an integrated strategy involving conceptual clustering and case-based learning to acquire knowledge relevant for solving domain problems. Threshold values and bottleneck resource examples are used to demonstrate the necessity of acquiring implicit knowledge for improved decision making.

J	DORIGO, M; SCHNEPF, U				DORIGO, M; SCHNEPF, U			GENETICS-BASED MACHINE LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR-BASED ROBOTICS - A NEW SYNTHESIS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article								Intelligent robots should be able to use sensor information to learn how to behave in a changing environment. As environmental complexity grows, the learning task becomes more and more difficult. This problem is faced using an architecture based on learning classifier systems and on the structural properties of animal behavioral organization, as proposed by ethologists. After a description of the learning technique used and of the organizational structure proposed, experiments that show how behavior acquisition can be achieved were presented. The simulated robot learns to follow a light and to avoid hot dangerous objects. While these two simple behavioral patterns are independently learned, coordination is attained by means of a learning coordination mechanism. Again this capacity is demonstrated by performing a number of experiments.

J	FU, LM				FU, LM			KNOWLEDGE-BASED CONNECTIONISM FOR REVISING DOMAIN THEORIES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article								Integration of domain theory into empirical learning is important in building a useful learning system in practical domains since the theory is not always perfect and the data is not always adequate. A novel knowledge-based connectionist model referred to as KBCNN for machine learning is presented. In the KBCNN learning model, useful domain attributes and concepts are first identified and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge, and then the links are weighted properly so as to maintain the semantics. Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form. The domain of molecular genetics has been used to demonstrate the validity of the KBCNN learning model and its superiority over related learning methods.

Intelligent sensory decision-making for error identification in autonomous robotic systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						autonomous robotic systems; automatic error recovery; automatic assembly process; error identification tree		Successful automatic assembly of complex artefacts requires the robotic system to have the capability of detecting, identifying and recovering from various errors. Efficient error identification process is essential to ensure fast recovery and minimum loss of production time. It is not cost-effective to interrogate every sensor for every pass through the assembly process. This paper presents a machine-learning approach to identify error. The basic idea is to construct a decision tree based on some sensor and error attributes in the knowledge base.

The algorithm partitions a data set into subsets using features which best describe and distinguish a Particular subset from all other subsets. These features are used to form the rules which can be used as the knowledge base of a diagnostic expert system. Results from the application of the algorithm to coronary artery stenosis data are compared with the results obtained from the existing expert system.

In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances. and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity. We conclude that experimental evidence favors the use and continued development of nearest neighbor algorithms for domains such as the ones studied here.

J	ABE, N				ABE, N			RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROBABILISTIC PAC LEARNING-MODELS	NEC RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						MACHINE LEARNING; COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY; PAC LEARNING MODEL		Computational learning theory is an attempt to formally characterize which classes of languages, concepts or patterns are learnable by a computing agent that has access to limited amounts of data and limited computational resources. Most models in computational learning theory deal with the problem of learning languages or concepts, formulated mathematically as 0,1-valued functions. This line of research has been criticized to be relatively naive with respect to the handling of noise in the data, and a number of models have been proposed that deal with this issue. One natural approach to this problem is to consider the target object being learned to be a probabilistic information source (a conditional or non-conditional probability distribution). In particular, a number of authors have proposed probabilistic extensions to Valiant's PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning model, the most commonly used model for learning (0,1-valued functions. This paper will review these models, collectively termed here as the ''probabilistic PAC learning model,'' and survey some of the recent results regarding these models, mainly those obtained by researchers at the C&C Information Technology Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation, and their colleagues at other institutions.

Analysis in domains of practical interest indicates that the performance accuracy of knowledge induced through learning from examples compares very favourably with the accuracy of best human experts. Also, in addition to accuracy, there are encouraging examples regarding the clarity and meaningfulness of induced knowledge. This points towards automated knowledge synthesis, although much further research is needed in this direction. The state of the art of some approaches to Machine Learning is assessed relative to their practical applicability and the characteristics of a problem domain.

We introduce a decision tree whose nodes are labeled with regular patterns. As a hypothesis, the system produces such a decision tree for a small number of randomly chosen positive and negative examples from PIR. Experiments show that our system finds reasonable hypotheses very successfully. As a theoretical foundation, we show that the class of languages defined by decesion trees of depth at most d over k-variable regular patterns is polynomial-time learnable in the sense of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for any fixed d, k greater-than-or-equal-to 0.

J	YAKOWITZ, S				YAKOWITZ, S			A GLOBALLY CONVERGENT STOCHASTIC-APPROXIMATION	SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						STOCHASTIC APPROXIMATION; RANDOM SEARCH; AUTOMATIC LEARNING	RANDOM SEARCH; MACHINE	By combining a constrained Kiefer-Wolfowitz search with an automatic learning algorithm, it is shown that asymptotically normal convergence of an estimator to a global optimum under reasonably lenient assumptions can be attained. It is enough that the objective function be smooth and locally strictly convex at its minima. The central conclusion is that if theta(n) is the estimate produced by the method shown at the nth decision epoch, then for some global minimizer theta*, n1/3(theta(n)-theta*) is asymptotically normally distributed. This coincides with the conventional Kiefer-Wolfowitz convergence rate to a local optimum. Whereas this study was motivated by needs of machine learning, the basic plan would seem applicable to root-finding tasks, and to other types of stochastic approximation algorithms.

These control systems possessed the ability to adaptively construct their own sensors, thereby choosing the relationship between their internal states and the world at large. Devices were built that evolved de novo sensitivity to sound or magnetic fields. Pask's devices have far-reaching implications for artificial intelligence, self-constructing devices, theories of observers and epistemically-autonomous agents, theories of functional emergence, machine creativity, and the limits of contemporary machine learning paradigms.

The method of classification with LVQ is described in detail along with first results on a subject who participated in four on-line cursor control sessions. Using this data, extensive off-line experiments were performed to show the influence of the various parameters of the classifier and the extracted features of the EEG on the classification results.

Herein we relate an algorithm for such 'stochastic minimization' problems, and derive some general properties. The general framework is extended to be applicable to finding the 'ten-count' standing-number strategy for blackjack. Computational experiments explore this learning application. The feature here, as opposed to blackjack analyses by Thorp, Braum, and others, who rely on combinatorics in their constructions, is that our methodology requires minimal modelling or understanding of the problem structure. This is the first reasonably detailed account of a procedure for finding ten-count standing numbers. But it is general enough to be applicable to other blackjack problems and, in fact, to a wide variety of sequential decision tasks.

The training data for the program were 44 trimethoprim analogues and their observed inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. A further 11 compounds were used as unseen test data. GOLEM obtained rules that were statistically more accurate on the training data and also better on the test data than a Hansch linear regression model. Importantly machine learning yields understandable rules that characterized the chemistry of favored inhibitors in terms of polarity, flexibility, and hydrogen-bonding character. These rules agree with the stereochemistry of the interaction observed crystallographically.

Classical techniques for such analysis are not always well suited to software engineering data. In this paper we describe a pattern recognition approach for analyzing software engineering data, called optimized set reduction (OSR), that addresses many of the problems associated with the usual approaches. Methods are discussed for using the technique for prediction, risk management, and quality evaluation. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for the particular application of software cost estimation.

We focus on improving performance related heuristic methods (HM's) in knowledge lean application domains. We assume that learning is episodic, that the performance measures of an episode are dependent only on the final state reached in evaluating the corresponding test case and are independent of the intermediate decisions and internal states, and that the aggregate performance measures of the HM's involved are independent of the order of evaluation of test cases. The learning model is based on testing a population of competing HM's for an application problem, and switches from one to another dynamically, depending on the outcome of previous tests. Its goal is to find a good HM within the resource constraints, with proper trade-off between cost and quality. It complements existing point-based machine learning models that maintain only one incumbent HM, and that test the HM extensively before switching to alternative ones. It extends existing work on classifier systems by addressing issues related to delays in feedback, scheduling of tests of HM's under limited resources, anomalies in performance evaluation, and scalability of HM's. Finally, we describe our experience in applying the learning method on five application problems.

This type of learning is characterized as partially supervised learning. This paper suggests a learning algorithm of this type for linearly separable systems. The proposed algorithm selects a subset S from a finite set X of linearly separable vectors to construct a linear classifier that can correctly classify all the vectors in X. The sample set S is chosen without any prior knowledge of how the vectors in X - S are classified. The computational complexity of the algorithm is analyzed, and the lower bound on the size of the sample set is established.

Probabilities are estimated by a Bayesian inference scheme which assumes that instances are partitioned into categories and that within categories features are displayed independently and probabilistically. This algorithm can be shown to be an optimization of an ideal Bayesian algorithm in which predictive accuracy is traded for computational efficiency. The algorithm can deliver predictions about any dimension of a category and does not treat specially the prediction of category labels. The algorithm has successfully modeled much of the empirical literature on human categorization. This paper describes its application to a number of data sets from the machine learning literature. The algorithm performs reasonably well, having its only serious difficulty because the assumption of independent features is not always satisfied. Bayesian extensions to deal with nonindependent features are described and evaluated.		ANDERSON, JR (reprint author), CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213, USA.

In particular, we focus on constructing Bayesian belief networks. Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.

In this paper, the use of a machine learning algorithm which allows relational descriptions is shown to lead to improved performance. The Inductive Logic Programming computer program, Golem, was applied to learning secondary structure prediction rules for alpha/alpha domain type proteins. The input to the program consisted of 12 non-homologous proteins (1612 residues) of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the residues. Golem learned a small set of rules that predict which residues are part of the alpha-helices-based on their positional relationships and chemical and physical properties. The rules were tested on four independent non-homologous proteins (416 residues) giving an accuracy of 81% (+/- 2%). This is an improvement, on identical data, over the previously reported result of 73% by King and Sternberg (1990, J. Mol. Biol., 216, 441-457) using the machine learning program PROMIS, and of 72% using the standard Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method. The best previously reported result in the literature for the alpha/alpha domain type is 76%, achieved using a neural net approach. Machine learning also has the advantage over neural network and statistical methods in producing more understandable results.

J	FREEMAN, DT				FREEMAN, DT			COMPUTER RECOGNITION OF BRAIN-STEM AUDITORY EVOKED-POTENTIAL WAVE-V BY A NEURAL NETWORK	ANNALS OF OTOLOGY RHINOLOGY AND LARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						COMPUTER-ASSISTED DIAGNOSIS; COMPUTER-ASSISTED IMAGE PROCESSING; EXEMPLAR-BASED MACHINE LEARNING		A neural network simulator was used for the recognition of the presence and location of the peak of wave V of the brain stem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) test. Waveforms selected from BAEPs performed in the last 4 years at the University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian University Hospital were digitized and sampled, and the resulting amplitudes were normalized. A training set was composed of the waveforms resulting from the stimulation of 50 ears. The normalized amplitudes were used as the initial activation values for the networks. The desired outputs (the target locations for wave V) were represented in the output layer by setting the output element, which corresponded to the target location and its immediate neighbors, to high activation levels, and all the remaining output units to zero activity. Two network architectures, differing only in the hidden unit layer, with 40 and 16 hidden units, respectively, were trained by using standard back-propagation. Several trials from different starting points were performed for each architecture. The best network, found after 60 epochs (3,000 presentations), was able to correctly identify 17 of 20 cases (85%) from a set of test cases that were independent from the training set.

In the paper, the problem is related to a broader class of issues, and the conclusion is drawn that no individual method can be regarded as a unique and comprehensive paradigm for Computer Vision. A possible solution to this problem might lie in combining different methodologies to enhance mutual advantages and to balance individual shortcomings; K-B vision approaches are reviewed here from this integration-oriented perspective. Higher-level integration should aim at improving 'intelligent' activities of K-B systems; Machine Learning approaches to Vision are discussed from this point of view. Lower-level integration should provide K-B systems with the fast number-crunching capability and robustness required; the use of neural networks and of associative memories is evaluated for this purpose. All such methodologies are reviewed, taking into account both their intrinsic peculiarities and the specific problems that may arise from coupling them with K-B vision systems. The paper aims at providing an updated and critical picture of some lines of research that are currently being pursued to achieve an efficient integration of K-B techniques into complex vision systems.

This technique is used in a database design tool that uses example databases to give feedback to the designer. If the examples show deficiencies in the design, the designer can directly modify the examples. The tool then infers new dependencies and the database schema can be modified, if necessary. The discovery of the functional and inclusion dependencies can also be used in analyzing an existing database. The problem of inferring functional dependencies has several connections to other topics in knowledge discovery and machine learning. In this article we discuss the use of examples in the design of databases, and give an overview of the complexity results and algorithms that have been developed for this problem.

J	MAJOR, JA; RIEDINGER, DR				MAJOR, JA; RIEDINGER, DR			EFD - A HYBRID KNOWLEDGE STATISTICAL-BASED SYSTEM FOR THE DETECTION OF FRAUD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								EFD (Electronic Fraud Detection) assists Investigative Consultants in the Managed Care & Employee Benefits Security Unit of The Travelers Insurance Companies in the detection and preinvestigative analysis of healthcare provider fraud. The task EFD performs, scanning a large population of health insurance claims in search of likely fraud, has never been done manually. Furthermore, the available database has few positive examples. Thus, neither existing knowledge engineering techniques nor statistical methods are sufficient for designing the identification process. To overcome these problems, EFD uses knowledge discovery techniques on two levels. First, EFD integrates expert knowledge with statistical information assessment to identify cases of unusual provider behavior. The heart of EFD is 27 behavioral heuristics, knowledge-based ways of viewing and measuring provider behavior. Rules operate on them to identify providers whose behavior merits a closer look by the Investigative Consultants. Second, machine learning is used to develop new rules and improve the identification process. Pilot operations involved analysis of nearly 22 000 providers in six metropolitan areas. The pilot is implemented in SAS Institute's SAS(R) System, AICorp's Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS(R)), and Borland International's Turbo Prolog(R).

J	BERGCROSS, G				BERGCROSS, G			CAN A LARGE KNOWLEDGE BASE BE BUILT BY IMPORTING AND UNIFYING DIVERSE KNOWLEDGE - LESSONS FROM SCRUFFY WORK	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS; CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; NEAT AND SCRUFFY PHILOSOPHIES		Two different roads to the modelling of intelligence and the building of intelligence systems have been proposed. These are the 'neat' (logical) versus scruffy (ad hoc) philosophies applied to the building of AI systems. The paper revisits this issue, and characterizes the nature of recent relevant work, with particular emphasis on the Cyc project. A constructionist perspective that is akin to Piagetian work and Sowa's crystallizing of theory is espoused. This perspective notes that scruffy, bottom-up methods provide a developmental basis for more formal theories which, in turn, provide a further bootstrapping of subsequent scruffy development of important formal elements, such as conceptual catalogues. Particular emphasis is placed on conceptual analysis results that are available from the Cyc project, which is attempting to achieve robust intelligence using vast pools of handcrafted knowledge. This effort, like a good conceptual catalogue, is an attempt to provide an empirical basis for knowledge acquisition via automated understanding of documentation and machine learning.

The learning tool LEFT provides an environment for the creation of floorplan topologies. LEFT's input is a list of blocks to be placed on a two-dimensional area and a specification of their connections. The designer uses LEFT as an extended, graphical design editor and selects operators that perform single floorplanning steps. In this way a floorplan is created interactively. LEFT's learning component creates from observed design steps specific production rules and generalizes them by means of a new and optimized inductive machine learning mechanism. Each time a rule matches on the current state of the design process LEFT proposes the execution of the corresponding operator in the right-hand rule side of the rule. In this way LEFT works as an apprentice system that supports the creation of early floorplans, adapts to the design style of the user and increases its knowledge during the use of the system.

J	SHEN, WM				SHEN, WM			DISCOVERING REGULARITIES FROM KNOWLEDGE BASES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Knowledge bases open new horizons for machine learning research. One challenge is to design learning programs to expand the knowledge base using the knowledge that is currently available. This article addresses the problem of discovering regularities in large knowledge bases that contain many assertions in different domains. The article begins with a definition of regularities and gives the motivation for such a definition. It then outlines a framework that attempts to integrate induction with knowledge. Although the implementation of the framework currently uses only a statistical method for confirming hypotheses, its application to a real knowledge base has shown some encouraging and interesting results.

Hence, the problem of automated rule acquisition from data is a well-motivated one, particularly for domains where a database of sample data exists. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for the induction of rules from examples. The algorithm is novel in the sense that it not only learns rules for a given concept (classification), but it simultaneously learns rules relating multiple concepts. This type of learning, known as generalized rule induction is considerably more general than existing algorithms which tend to be classification oriented. Initially we focus on the problem of determining a quantitative, well-defined rule preference measure. In particular, we propose a quantity called the J-measure as an information theoretic alternative to existing approaches. The J-measure quantifies the information content of a rule or a hypothesis. We will outline the information theoretic origins of this measure and examine its plausibility as a hypothesis preference measure. We then define the ITRULE algorithm which uses the newly proposed measure to learn a set of optimal rules from a set of data samples, and we conclude the paper with an analysis of experimental results on real-world data.

Usually this is achieved through a detailed analysis of the process variables and their interrelationships. This step is very time consuming because large volumes of data are generated during the operation of a process. In this article we present a method for exploratory data analysis that can be used to scan the process data to suggest relationship among variables. The method is based upon a combination of inductive techniques (developed by computer scientists for machine learning) and classical regression methods. The method is illustrated using two example problems. The results show the power and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The method should prove useful to engineers and scientists who are interested in analyzing past operational history of a process to understand causes of quality deviation.

The goal is for these hierarchies to provide valuable input to the database administrator for dynamically modifying the physical and external schemas of a database for improved system performance and user productivity. The criteria for choosing the appropriate learning algorithms are analyzed, and based on them, two such algorithms, UNIMEM and COBWEB, are selected as the most suitable ones for the task. Standard UNIMEM and COBWEB implementations have been modified to support queries as input. Based on the results of experiments with these modified implementations, the whole approach appears to be quite promising, especially if the concept hierarchy from which the learning algorithms start their processing is initialized with some of the most obvious concepts captured in the database.

J	NEAL, RM				NEAL, RM			CONNECTIONIST LEARNING OF BELIEF NETWORKS	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							GRAPHICAL STRUCTURES; PROBABILITIES; ALGORITHM	Connectionist learning procedures are presented for "sigmoid" and "noisy-OR" varieties of probabilistic belief networks. These networks have previously been seen primarily as a means of representing knowledge derived from experts. Here it is shown that the "Gibbs sampling" simulation procedure for such networks can support maximum-likelihood learning from empirical data through local gradient ascent. This learning procedure resembles that used for "Boltzmann machines", and like it, allows the use of "hidden" variables to model correlations between visible variables. Due to the directed nature of the connections in a belief network, however, the "negative phase" of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid belief network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, are naturally applicable to unsupervised learning problems, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge.

Nevertheless, they are less popular than text editors. One of the reason is that they force a priori specified editing structures on the user and do not allow him to use his own structure. ACE (Algorithmically Customizable syntax-directed Editor) provides a solution for this problem by using a technique of machine learning; ACE has a special function of customizing the grammar algorithmically and interactively based on the learning method for grammars from examples and queries. The grammar used in the editor is customized through interaction with the user so that the user can edit his program in a more familiar structure. The customizing function has been implemented based on the methods for learning of context-free grammars from structural examples, for which the correctness and the efficiency are proved formally. This guarantees the soundness and the efficiency of customization. Furthermore, ACE can be used as an algorithmic and interactive tool to design grammars, which is required for several purposes such as compiler design and pretty-printer design.

We mainly address the impact of noise on the resulting classification tree and on the classification results obtained with the derived tree. We use the domain of the biochemical assessment of thyroid diseases as an example. Some suggestions for quality assessment are outlined that should be available in tools that assist users in deriving classification trees in noisy domains.

The data is usually just the values f(0), f(1), . . . . The scenario is modeled so that the learner is also allowed to ask questions about the data (e.g., (for-all x) [x > 17 double-line arrow pointing right f(x) = 0]?). An important parameter is the language that the learner may use to formulate queries. We show that for most languages a learner can learn more by asking questions than by passively receiving data. Mathematical tools used include the solution to Hilbert's tenth problem, the decidability of Presuburger arithmetic, and omega-automata.

This demand has been driven by the increasing needs for information sharing and office automation, and by the increasing accessibility to large-scale, fast, and powerful computer resources. A problem of current OCR technology is that texts produced by the state-of-the-art OCR software contain an unacceptable frequency of errors. This prevents the OCR technology from being efficiently used for vast-volume information transfer or daily office operation applications. To correct these errors in a conventional way requires a significant amount of costly human-machine interaction. In this article, we identify and classify the types and distributions of optical recognition errors. We propose a novel postprocessing strategy, based on machine learning techniques, to correct errors resulted from unrecognized or misrecognized characters during the recognition process. By applying this strategy, the accuracy of recognition can be significantly improved, and the human interaction required can be dramatically reduced. Experimental results indicate that, in a typical environment, about 46% of total errors can be corrected automatically (i.e., without human interference), with an accuracy of 91%.

Among others, we consider the model for learning with equivalence and membership queries. For this model we give lower bounds on the number of queries that are needed to learn a concept class C in terms of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of C, and in terms of the complexity of learning C with arbitrary equivalence queries. Furthermore, we survey other known lower bound methods and we exhibit all known relationships between learning complexities in the models considered and some relevant combinatorial parameters. As it turns out, the picture is almost complete. This paper has been written so that it can be read without previous Knowledge of Computational Learning Theory.

IPSA includes the creation of a new database which was designed specifically for the analysis of protein structure by statistics and machine learning. The Protein Representation Language (PRL) database includes explicit and symbolic representations of geometrical, topological and chemo-physical information about secondary structures and the relationships between secondary structures. The IPSA methodology consists of: the use of PRL information to produce a new database of examples of secondary structures which associate together (examples of possible super-secondary structures); then the use of a variety of clustering techniques to produce a consensus clustering of these examples (super-secondary structures); these super-secondary structures are finally examined to uncover any biological features of significance. We have applied this method to find simple super-secondary structures consisting of pairs of alpha-helices. We found four well-defined super-secondary structures, one formed exclusively by long range interactions, and another in association with an additional element of secondary structure (alpha-t-alpha-motif). Examinations were carried out using homologous pairs and conformational fits which confirm our clustering.

J	CHI, RTH				CHI, RTH			USING AN INTEGRATED MODEL LEARNING-SYSTEM TO CONSTRUCT THE MODEL BASE OF A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								The Model Base Management System (MBMS) in a Decision Support System (DSS) has become increasingly important in handling complicated decision problems. Traditionally, models are retrieved from the human experts. This approach has the disadvantages of low productivity and being subjective by different individuals. Although recent research projects include how to apply Artificial Intelligence approaches to automatic model retrieval, none of them provides an efficient and effective way to produce large-scale complicated models. In this article, an Integrated Model Learning System is introduced to learn new models from model instances. This system basically uses the Multiple Instance Explanation Based Generalization (miEBG) approach which is a modification of the Multiple Explanation Based Generalization (mEBG) approach to explain and generalize model instances by the Domain Theory. Different from other machine learning approaches, this approach takes advantages of using the Domain Theory to learn multiple explanation trees from instances, and then combines all trees to form a complete explanation tree which will be generalized into a useful model. In general, this approach provides the Model Base Management System an automatic way to retrieve new and more complete models from related instances in a self-learning fashion.

J	DIETZEN, S; PFENNING, F				DIETZEN, S; PFENNING, F			HIGHER-ORDER AND MODAL LOGIC AS A FRAMEWORK FOR EXPLANATION-BASED GENERALIZATION	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						EXPLANATION-BASED GENERALIZATION (EBG); HIGHER-ORDER LOGIC; MODAL LOGIC; LOGIC PROGRAMMING; METAL-LEVEL REASONING; PROLOG; THEOREM PROVING; PROGRAM TRANSFORMATION	SYSTEM	Certain tasks, such as formal program development and theorem proving, fundamentally rely upon the manipulation of higher-order objects such as functions and predicates. Computing tools intended to assist in performing these tasks are at present inadequate in both the amount of 'knowledge' they contain (i.e., the level of support they provide) and in their ability to 'learn' (i.e., their capacity to enhance that support over time). The application of a relevant machine learning technique-explanation-based generalization (EBG)-has thus far been limited to first-order problem representations. We extend EBG to generalize higher-order values, thereby enabling its application to higher-order problem encodings. Logic programming provides a uniform framework in which all aspects of explanation-based generalization and learning may be defined and carried out. First-order Horn logics (e.g., Prolog) are not, however, well suited to higher-order applications. Instead, we employ lambda-Prolog, a higher-order logic programming language, as our basic framework for realizing higher-order EBG. In order to capture the distinction between domain theory and training instance upon which EBG relies, we extend lambda-Prolog with the necessity operator square of modal logic. We develop a meta-interpreter realizing EBG for the extended langauge, lambda(square)Prolog, and provide examples of higher-order EBG.

J	HUNTER, L				HUNTER, L			KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION PLANNING - USING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN BIOMEDICINE	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article								By combining techniques from machine learning and robot planning, knowledge acquisition planning provides a framework for automatically deploying diverse and complex analytical tools to extremely large collections of data. KA planning is the process of automatically combining inferential tools such as induction, search, database lookup and statistical analysis into methods for addressing complex query statements. This process depends both on having a domain model that supports subgoal decomposition and a library of KA actions annotated with the type and form of required input data, expected outcomes of the action, estimates of computational resources needed, and so on. By annotating analytical tools in this way, it is possible to automatically select and deploy them and combine their results, even if they run on incompatible platforms. Knowledge acquisition planning was first implemented in a program that learned about diagnosing lung tumors. A larger project is currently underway in the domain of molecular biology.

The method is based on a weight-learning algorithm for finding the right weighting coefficients of fuzzy rules with respect to some goal premise-conclusion pair of fuzzy sets. A necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of the weight-learning algorithm is proved. A program implementation of the weight-learning algorithm in GOLDEN COMMON LISP programming language for an IBM PC AT microcomputer and compatible ones is presented. The results of computer experiments are reported and analysed.		STOEVA, SP (reprint author), INST INFORMAT & COMPLEX AUTOMAT,BU-1574 SOFIA,BULGARIA.

Our experiments have shown that changes in the workload structure impose the necessity of automated modifications of the rules in the knowledge base. These modifications are made by means of a machine learning subsystem that is incremental and capable of forgetting pieces of knowledge that have become obsolete.

At the same time, research in statistics and econometrics has resulted in the development of qualitative-response models that can be applied to the same kind of problems addressed by machine-learning models-particularly those that involve a classification decision. This paper presents the theoretical structure of a generalized qualitative-response model and compares its performance to two seminal machine-learning models in two problem domains associated with audit decision making. The results suggest that the generalized qualitative-response model may be a useful alternative for certain problem domains.

In this connection, the critical clearing time(CCT) is an attribute which provides significant information about the quality of the post-fault system behavior. It may be regarded to be a complex mapping of the prefault, fault-on, and post-fault system conditions into the time domain. In previous work, we have shown that a feedforward neural-network can be used to learn this mapping and successfully perform under variable system operating conditions and topologies. In that work we described the system in terms of some conventionally used parameters. In contrast to using those pragmatic features selected on the basis of the engineering understanding of the problem, we consider in this paper the possibility of using unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms to discover what combination of "raw" measurements are significant in determining CCT. Correlation analysis and Euclidian metric are used to specify inter-feature dependencies. An example of 4-machine power system is used to illustrate the suggested approach.

In the context of conventional job shops, the relative performance of these rules has been found to depend upon the system attributes, and no single rule is dominant across all possible scenarios. This indicates the need for developing a scheduling approach which adopts a state-dependent dispatching rule selection policy. The importance of adapting the dispatching rule employed to the current state of the system is even more critical in a flexible manufacturing system because of alternative machine routing possibilities and the need for increased coordination among various machines. This study develops a framework for incorporating machine learning capabilities in intelligent scheduling. A pattern-directed method, with a built-in inductive learning module, is developed for heuristic acquisition and refinement. This method enables the scheduler to classify distinct manufacturing patterns and to generate a decision tree consisting of heuristic policies for dynamically selecting the dispatching rule appropriate for a given set of system attributes. Computational experience indicates that the learning-augmented approach leads to improved system performance. In addition, the process of generating the decision tree shows the efficacy of inductive learning in extracting and ranking the various system attributes relevant for deciding upon the appropriate dispatching rule to employ.

We report on the program FAVORIT, which achieves a performance improvement over its predecessors (such as UNIMEM) by means of a simple mechanism mimicking the shortcomings of human learning: aging of knowledge and forgetting. When applied to large and noisy data sets, these characteristics enable efficient restructuring and pruning of the internal knowledge structures. The paper contains a brief description of the program, together with the rationale behind its philosophy, as well as a simple case study.

This problem is more severe in knowledge-based control systems because the knowledge is often difficult to extract and needs to be constantly updated to reflect changing processing conditions. This article considers the problem of extracting processing knowledge directly from historical plant operational data. First we consider the features of the problem. The applicability of machine learning algorithms is considered. Quadratic regression, induction and artificial neural network modeling are applied to a process selected from composite manufacturing. The results show that, while neural networks are a promising new approach, there is a need to focus attention on the preprocessing of data to cope with data reduction and process nonlinearity. Methods based on statistical analysis will play an important role in this preprocessing.		JOSEPH, B (reprint author), WASHINGTON UNIV,DEPT CHEM ENGN,ST LOUIS,MO 63130, USA.

To accomplish this, ALIAS requires only one pass through a training set, which typically consists of less than 100 samples. The original version of ALIAS (1.0) was completed in Apr. 1990 at the Research Institute for Applied Knowledge Processing (FAW) in Ulm, Germany. This engine was limited to an input domain of binary images. Although there are many applications that involve binary images, it was clear that ALIAS could be greatly enhanced by extending its input domain to include gray-scale (or color) images. For this reason, Robert Bosch GmbH funded Project ALANN to develop a new gray-scale version of ALIAS (2.3), which was completed in Apr. 1991. Robert Bosch has applied for a patent on the computational methods and system architecture of the current ALIAS engine. This paper presents the theoretical background and technical design of ALIAS, and describes two experiments with the new gray-scale capability.

J	HELMBOLD, D; SLOAN, R; WARMUTH, MK				HELMBOLD, D; SLOAN, R; WARMUTH, MK			LEARNING INTEGER LATTICES	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						LATTICES; CONCEPT LEARNING; MISTAKE BOUNDS		The problem of learning an integer lattice of Z(k) in an on-line fashion is considered. That is, the learning algorithm is given a sequence of k-tuples of integers and predicts for each tuple in the sequence whether it lies in a hidden target lattice of Z(k). The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the number of prediction mistakes. An efficient learning algorithm with an absolute mistake bound of k + right perpendicular k log(n square-root k) left perpendicular is given, where n is the maximum component of any tuple seen. It is shown that this bound is approximately a log log n factor larger than the lower bound on the worst case number of mistakes given by the VC dimension of lattices that are restricted to {-n, ...,0,...,n}k. This algorithm is used to learn rational lattices, cosets of lattices, an on-line word problem for abelian groups, and a subclass of the commutative regular languages. Furthermore, by adapting the results of [D. Helmbold, R. Sloan, and M. K. Warmuth, Machine Learning, 5(1990), pp. 165 196], one can efficiently learn nested differences of each of the above classes (e.g., concepts of the form c1 - (c2 - (c3 - (c4 - c5))), where each c(i) is the coset of a lattice).

The set of all the Boltzmann machines with a fixed topology forms a geometrical manifold of high dimension, where modifiable synaptic weights of connections play the role of a coordinate system to specify networks. A learning trajectory, for example, is a curve in this manifold. It is important to study the geometry of the neural manifold, rather than the behavior of a single network, in order to know the capabilities and limitations of neural networks of a fixed topology. Using the new theory of information geometry, the present paper establishes a natural invariant Riemannian metric and a dual pair of affine connections on the Boltzmann neural network manifold. The meaning of geometrical structures is elucidated from the stochastic and the statistical point of view. This leads to a natural modification of the Boltzmann machine learning rule.

A continuous ID3 algorithm is proposed that converts decision trees into hidden layers. The algorithm allows self-generation of a feedforward neural network architecture. In addition, it allows interpretation of the knowledge embedded in the generated connections and weights. A fast simulated annealing strategy, known as Cauchy training, is incorporated into the algorithm to escape from local minima. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed on spiral data.

Sequence patterns consist of a number of consecutive positions along the polypeptide chain from which a certain quantity is specified. One of the important factors in deriving sequence patterns in terms of amino acid properties is how to find the most characteristic properties to specify a certain position and thus to avoid redundant physical information. We have applied machine learning methods to select the most significant amino acid properties describing a structurally determined sequence position. Results are given for the beginning of alpha-helices. These methods may link the gap between amino acid patterns and property patterns and thus are valuable to improve protein structure prediction.

This insight allows interesting cross-fertilization between both areas. To support this claim, we sketch a simple extension of Shapiro's Model Inference System that solves the belief updating problem within a restricted subset of first order logic. This extension uses integrity constraints and allows for the assertion of non-unit clauses. The former generalizes the use of examples in concept-learning whereas the latter generalizes the set of revisions considered in knowledge base updating.

Extensive studies have been performed on the effect of various factors such as learning rate, momentum, the number of presentations in an iteration, etc. on the efficiency and accuracy of the backpropagation-momentum learning method which is employed in the training of artificial neural networks. To speed up the training process, a new learning algorithm for the adaptive training of neural networks is presented. The effectiveness of the neural network with the proposed adaptive learning algorithm is demonstrated by short term load forecasting of Taiwan power system. It is found that, once trained by the proposed learning algorithm, the neural network can yield the desired hourly load forecast very efficiently and accurately. Moreover, the proposed adaptive learning algorithm converges much faster than the conventional backpropagation-momentum learning method.

For this strategy to work effectively, sufficient knowledge is required to enable prediction of which rule is the best to use under the current line status. In this paper, a new learning algorithm for acquiring such knowledge is proposed. In this algorithm, a binary decision tree is automatically generated using empirical data obtained by iterative production line simulations, and it decides in real time which rule to be used at decision points during the actual production operations. The configuration of the developed dynamic scheduling system and the learning algorithm are described in detail. Simulation results on its application to the dispatching problem are discussed with regard to its scheduling performance and learning capability.

The approach utilizes a machine learning technique, goal-directed conceptual aggregation (GDCA), to facilitate dynamic decision-making. The application domain employed is Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) scheduling and control. Simulation is used for the dual purpose of providing a realistic depiction of FMSs, and serves as an engine for demonstrating the viability of a synergistic system involving incremental learning, The paper briefly describes prior approaches to FMS scheduling and control, and machine learning. It outlines the GDCA approach, provides a generalized architecture for dynamic control problems, and describes the implementation of the system as applied to FMS scheduling and control. The paper concludes with a discussion of the general applicability of this approach.

The system can be used by a researcher to build modular and efficient learning systems. The algorithms composing the basic structure of the implementation are the genetic algorithm, the bucket brigade algorithm and the inferential engine. We present a parallel version of these algorithms and call it low-level parallelism. Compared to the standard sequential version of the same algorithms, low-level parallelism gives us an increase in performance. To provide the learning system designer with a higher level of flexibility than currently available with standard systems, we also implemented high-level parallelism: subsets of the transputer network can be allocated to different learning systems. In this way a complex learning problem can be decomposed in many simpler problems, each one mapped on a single (possibly low-level parallel) learning system.

J	MCKENZIE, D; LOW, LH				MCKENZIE, D; LOW, LH			THE CONSTRUCTION OF COMPUTERIZED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS - AN OVERVIEW	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article							BOOTSTRAP; RULES	Although there are several microcomputer programs that are concerned with the automatic induction or machine learning of classification rules, the techniques seem to have been largely ignored in favor of conventional parametric procedures. Various machine learning algorithms are discussed, and the available evidence comparing their performance with linear discriminant function (LDF) analysis is reviewed. Although far more research is required, there are indications that machine learning algorithms are capable of giving better results than LDF. Similar algorithms known as automatic interaction detectors, originally employed in the field of survey analysis, are also examined. It is concluded that a computer program representing a synthesis of machine learning techniques, conventional statistical methods, and automatic interaction detectors should be developed.

Several analyses comparing the performance of neural networks to the standard methods for achieving machine classification and machine learning, such as statistical pattern recognition and ID3, have been reported. Typically, supervised learning has been used and the specific learning algorithm has been back propagation. For many classification type problems, a priori categories are not available, that is, one does not know explicitly the number of categories existent nor the boundaries delineating these categories. Therefore, known targets with which to train the network are not available. A supervised learning approach is not appropriate under these circumstances; an unsupervised learning algorithm is required. In this article we report on the use of an unsupervised competitive learning algorithm as a classifier. The network was used to classify individuals into categories based on differences in the manner in which individuals manipulate the uncertainty associated with the chaining of rules. The exeperiment, from which the data to be classified were obtained, is described. Results of the neural network approach are compared to classification using a distance measure and to classification using a standard clustering algorithm.

GOLEM takes as input observations and combines them with background knowledge of chemistry to yield rules expressed as stereochemical principles for prediction. The secondary structure prediction was explored on the alpha/alpha class of proteins; on an unrelated test set it yielded 81 % accuracy. The rules from GOLEM defined patterns of residues forming alpha-helices. The system studied for drug design was the activities of trimethoprim analogues binding to E. coli dihydrofolate reductase. The GOLEM rules were a better model than standard regression approaches. More importantly, these rules described the chemical properties of the enzyme-binding site that were in broad agreement with the crystallographic structure.

J	JABRI, MA; LI, XQ				JABRI, MA; LI, XQ			PREDICTING THE NUMBER OF CONTACTS AND DIMENSIONS OF FULL-CUSTOM INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT BLOCKS USING NEURAL NETWORK TECHNIQUES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Note								Block layout dimension prediction is an important activity in many very large scale integration computer-aided design tasks, among them structural synthesis, floor planning and physical synthesis. Block layout dimension prediction is harder than block area prediction and has been previously considered to be intractable [7]. In this paper we present a solution to this problem using a neural network machine learning approach. Our method uses a neural network to predict first the number of contacts; then another neural network uses this prediction and other circuit features to predict the width and the height of its layout. Our approach has produced much better results than those published-a dimension (aspect ratio) prediction average error of less than 18% with a corresponding area prediction average error of less than 15%. Furthermore, our technique predicts the number of contacts in a circuit with less than 4% error on average.		JABRI, MA (reprint author), UNIV SYDNEY,DEPT ELECT ENGN,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.

However, most applications of neural networks have not taken advantage of existing knowledge about the task at hand. This paper presents a method for using such problem-specific knowledge. The KBANN algorithm uses inference rules about the current biological problem, which need only be approximately correct, to initially configure a neural network. This network is then refined by analyzing sample examples and counter examples of the concept being learned. An application of KBANN to the prediction of E coli promoters demonstrates its superiority to alternative techniques, taken from both the machine-learning and molecular-biology literatures. In addition, since KBANN uses a human-comprehensible ''theory'' of the current problem to define the initial neural network topology, it is possible to extract a refined set of inference rules following training. A refined theory for promoter recognition is presented and analyzed. The extracted rules are only slightly less accurate on novel data than the trained neural network from which they came.

This article focuses on the problem of learning sequential decision rules for multi-agent environments. We describe the SAMUEL learning system that uses genetic algorithms and other competition based techniques to learn decision strategies for autonomous agents. One of the main themes in this research is that the learning system should be able to take advantage of existing knowledge where available. This article describes some of the mechanisms for expressing existing knowledge in SAMUEL, and explores some of the issues in selecting constraints for the learning system.

Suppose, for every machine which learns a class of functions according to the LC1 criterion of success, there is a machine which learns this class according to the LC2 criterion. In the case where the converse does not hold LC1 is said to be separated from LC2. It is shown that for many such separated learning classes from the literature a much stronger separation holds: (for-all C is-an-element-of LC1)(there exists C' is-an-element-of (LC2 - LC1))[C' superset-of C]. It is also shown that there is a pair of separated learning classes from the literature for which the stronger separation just above does not hold. A philosophical heuristic toward the design of artificially intelligent learning programs is presented with each strong separation result.

J	KUBAT, M				KUBAT, M			INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								The primary task of this tutorial is to introduce interested students into the principles of Machine Learning. Since a generally accepted theoretical frame is missing and the results achieved so far are scattered across hundreds of algorithms developed for diverse applications, the paper is conceived rather pragmatically. Its objective is to expose the most typical and illustrative approaches. After studying them, the reader should be able to write simple machine-learning algorithms and should have an idea how to deepen his or her knowledge about some specific area of interest. The introductory parts present a unifying view of the most common notions.		KUBAT, M (reprint author), BRNO TECH UNIV,CTR COMP,UDOLNI 19,CS-60200 BRNO,CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

First, an initial knowledge-base is built using an explanation-based learning approach which generates diagnostic rules. A functional model of the object to be diagnosed constitutes the necessary domain knowledge. Later when the system is operational, analogical inferences which utilize taxonomic information continue to improve its diagnostic performance. In this way knowledge which is 'objectivized' by the model can be acquired, greatly improving the performance of a pure model-based diagnosis while preserving the advantages of the model-based approach.

Prerequisites are knowledge representations as well as problem solving methods easily comprehensible for experts and comfortable and easy to learn knowledge acquisition components. In this paper we give an overview on our research to achieve both requirements by ''strong'' problem solving methods and graphical knowledge acquisition facilities. This is demonstrated with a successful implementation for the well known problem class heuristic classification.

J	MORIK, K				MORIK, K			APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								During the last 10 years, machine learning has been successfully applied. Most often, the applications are confidential. Therefore, only few publications about real world applications exist. In this paper, an overview of machine learning applications is given with their scenarios. Some typical applications are described. Then, future directions of machine learning applications are proposed. It is argued that machine learning is now mature enough to be incorporated into standard systems as well as algorithms. The integration of learning modules into database and retrieval systems is one of the trends. Another trend is to automatically select an appropriate learning tool out of a toolbox. The third trend, which is even more challenging, no longer requires a distinguished learning module, but offers methods of machine learning to be applied by programmers in their regular system development. Software engineers of the future can use inductive techniques as they now use message passing, for instance. Then, any program can be enhanced by some learning ability.

Both kinds of methods closely cooperate to concur in the same purpose : the acquisition, validation and maintenance of problem-solving knowledge. The methods are based on the same assumption : knowledge acquisition and learning are done through experimentation, classification and comparison of concrete cases.

All known algorithms for this task have running times that can be in the worst case exponential in the size of the smallest cover of the dependency set. We consider approximate dependency inference. We define various measures for the error of a dependency in a relation. These error measures have the value 0 if the dependency holds and a value close to 1 if the dependency clearly does not hold. Depending on the measure used, all dependencies with error at least - in r can be detected with high probability by considering only O(1/epsilon) or O(Absolute value of r1/2/epsilon) random tuples of r. We also show how a machine learning algorithm due to Angluin, Frazier and Pitt can be applied to give in output-polynomial time an approximately correct cover for the set of dependencies holding in r.
